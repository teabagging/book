I have heard wonderful stories from her, but I wanted those stories to be preserved for my children.The book asks good questions, some of them basic, some more in-depth, but it should spark some memories. The book itself is constructed of nice-looking paper stock and the cover is nice as well.This book is set in three life stages: early, middle, later years. So you could technically buy it for someone in their 20s, but not all the questions will relate to them."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I got this book for my elderly mother as a gift. She is hard to buy for as she doesn't need anything. She is enjoying filling it out and reminiscing about her younger days. It has brought back memories of things she hasn't thought of in years. The book will be a wonderful keepsake for generations. It would be nice if there was more room for longer memories; a little more space for writing things in it would be better. However, my mother has been raving about how much she loves this book so I would get it again."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I purchased this book and another one to use as journal prompts. Sometimes when writing in my journal I find that if I ask myself a question each day that I can put more of myself into the journal. This book with its 201 thoughtful questions is doing just that ... making me think and respond. Anyone on a journsy of self-discovery would find this book useful.

It is a treasure to me. I learned so much about her as a person, not just my mother. Based on the information she gave, I bought her birthday presents for crafts she always wanted to learn, cooked her favorite meals and realized how similar we are in many ways. I teach and speak extensively about the importance of writing personal and family history, and I always use this book as an example of one way to commit a life to paper. Well done."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"Currently I have only one of my grandparents left living.

There are three life sections: Early Years, Middle Years and Later Years so that the journal can be written at any point in your life. Each section contains questions about family, friends, education, work/responsibilities and the world.Once this book is completed it becomes invaluable. Grandparents can share life lessons, parents can preserve memories, children can start journaling and lovers can share secrets.

It says you are worth listenig to. The questions evoke pictures in one's mind making it easy to begin the journey. These are questions that one may need to share or just for private reflection.At first those who receive it may be intimidated by the idea of an auto-biography, but once any of the questions are read, the person becomes thoughtful and interested.I gave Two to my 16 year old niece, with a nice fountain pen, and asked her to keep one and give one to someone special. Some pages she will not be ready to fill out yet, and, I told her to leave a little space at the bottom of those she did fill out, some will be added to over the years.Everyone should have one.

The book definately has a baby boomer slant to it-- if you're younger, entries such as &quot;I remember where I was when man first walked on the moon&quot; may be difficult for you to elaborate on (I was born a few months after that event...). My intention is to give copies to my parents and remaining grandparents. Someone commented that there was no place to write in the biographer's name so definately do that yourself. I would also recommend reading through the whole book (10 minutes?) before giving as a gift in case you want to change some of the questions or ask for other details."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"As a genealogist, I love to have anything that will help be gain information (other than dates and locations) so they can be passed down through the generations in this age of 'remote grandparents'. This book provides a non-threatening, thought-provoking way for older adults who are reluctant to talk about their past or just 'can't think of anything to say' when you have a tape machine running. This book allows them to write their thoughts in seclusion -- like a diary.I only wish it would have allowed for the person to write their name and personal data in the front.

She loved it and the questions prompted a lot of memories she hadn't thought about in decades.

I plan on giving it to many more people!"},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"The only drawback is there was so little space on the pages to write, so I wrote mine elsewhere.

The only downside to this book is that you only have one page to answer each &quot;question&quot; which this book poses(to provoke your memory)- too often one would need more that just one page to express our thoughts.If you are fortunate to have your parents complete it, treat the book like fine wine, the more it ages, the better it gets."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I love the premise of this book--and got copies for friends and family members--but the point of it is you have to contribute the memories.

That way you will have some great personal time, find out a few surprises, and produce a journal of life stories that will record some family history.You get out of Book of Myself just what you put into it.

Some of the ?'s do refer to world events with examples that weren't in my lifetime however, I can write about any major world event that happened during my life. One of the only things (as Im just starting to write in this book) that I know would of made it nicer would be if it were spiral bound instead. For the price and with the great topics to write about I think my kids and grand kids will enjoy some of their family history. Im sure there are much more pricey ones out there but this will work perfect for me.

Some of these questions may bring on hoots of surprise or delight for you, as they do for me, while others may cause squirming (What dangerous risks DID you take with your childhood friends that your parents would have pitched a fit over?) or tears of regret. Such reflection about your life is never a bad undertaking at any age or in any circumstance, I think, but for those of us who have reached the point of being Elders, at last, this book encourages us to create an unusual and valuable legacy.

Both books are warmly done, with encouraging and interesting questions on a range of topics."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I bought this book for my grandmother after carefully reviewing several other autobiographical writing aides. I have to admit I was disappointed when I received the book. The questions are good, but the book itself is very small. If I'd noticed the dimensions of the book that are listed near its photo, I might not have purchased it. Each of the 201 questions gets one side of one page for answering, and the pages are roughly 5x8&quot;. It is almost impossible to imagine that the kind of rich, detail-laden anecdotes we hope for (and that we want to pass on for generations) when we give this as a gift could fit in the space provided.

She also went out and bought a few more to give to aother family members as gifts. She wrote in it and gave it to me, and I drank up every word she wrote. I learned about her trials and tribulations, I learned about family members I never had the pleasure of knowing...but got to know well throughout this book.

For example, one's sex life is not addressed in this book, but is included in another life journal, \\"All About Me.\\" \\"The Book of Myself\\" makes a great gift for grandparents, parents, & older relatives or friends.Disadvantages: Tailored more for older folks. For instance, the book solicits responses to \\"my memories of World War II, \\"inquires how Pearl Harbor shaped a person's life, your whereabouts during JFK's assassination & the 1st moon landing."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I gave this book to my mother and grandmother, and that has proven to be one of the best things I ever could have done.

Not only have I learned a lot about my mother and grandmother, but they have learned about themselves. This book makes a thoughtful gift, and I plan to buy several more for Christmas presents. My only complaint about the book is its writing spaces. The lines are too wide, leaving little room to write in detail. Still, I've not found another book of equal quality or depth. A gem!"},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I recently received this book as a sweet 16 birthday present. At first I thought it would just be a fun thing to do when I had some spare time. But now I realize, as I've started writing in the &quot;Early Years&quot; section, that this book will serve as the tale of my life -- something I can look back on when I'm older and my children can read with interest. It is not necessary to answer all the questions and you can work as quickly or slowly as you like. I only wish that my parents had written in one of these. Someday when I am in my eighties or so, I hope that I am still writing in it, and still remembering what it was like to be 16 again."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"For my mother's 60th birthday, she told me she'd like to reflect on her life thus far. I'd seen books of this nature, in which the reader can fill out question to create an easy autobiography. After using reading lots of different reviews on these types of books, The Book of Myself stood out with the best ratings. I bought the book from another bookstore, and from just skimming through the book I loved its questions. Finally, I presented it to my mother at her birthday dinner. She beamed with excitement when I explained the nature of the book, and she repeatedly said it's just what she wanted. After the dinner, she immediately called her sisters and told them about the book. They said they would like one for a christmas present, and eventually have all their siblings fill out the book. In light of other deaths in the family, my elders were seeking ways to preserve their memories. They're looking forward to discussing the questions as a group, and recalling all the chapters of their lives. Also, my mom told her co-worker about the book, who in turn wanted one for herself! \\"You see,\\" my mother said, \\"this book you gave me is really taking off.\\"I love seeing my mother's enthusiasm for the book, and she informs me of her progress in filling it out. She decided to type her answers to the questions, and she's saving her answers on a keepsake CD. My father and aunts will be doing the same, and we anticipate having a memory box full of these books and autobiography CDs! Overall, I'm so blessed to have stumbled upon this book, it seems like it's becoming an integral part of preserving family memories."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"This book asks excellent questions relating to several different periods of a person's life. Most of them are generic enough that they can be commented on, providing insight to whomever ends up reading the final version. This is not a book which can be completed quickly - many of the questions relate to &quot;middle age&quot; with grandkids, etc. (things I have yet to experience). However I believe once it is done (even in partial form) it will be something nice I can leave behind for my children and maybe grandchildren to read and gain insight into my life."},{"Title":"The Book of Myself: A Do-It-Yourself Autobiography in 201 Questions","review":"I started out with just one copy, and now I give them as gifts. I have had a great time answering the questions and sharing the book with my son. What a great way to pass on family stories and traditions.

What a treasure!"},{"Title":"The Bretton Woods international monetary system: An historical overview (NBER working papers series)","review":"This is a lovely, warm-hearted Irish romance - and reminded me a bit of a mix of Maeve Binchy and Marian Keyes. It is positively redolent with Irish culture - which isn't surprising because it is set in Dublin, but there is something really romantically appealing about the Irish. Their accent, their culture, their charm, and it all comes across really nicely in this book.The heroine of the piece is Jack finds love and life a bit depressing, she lives in a tiny flat as a single mother. Her life is pretty much on hold - it stopped in 1978 -the music, the fun, and she even dreams about her first love, Matt.So when he re-enters her life she feels like this is her big chance again, he invites her along to his night classes and she accepts - but then starts madly trying to reinvent herself to be right for him. Only Matt is already married with children himself.While it was a nice romance it was very much a lovely story of redemption with Jack finding out the things she disliked around her were really in herself. It was nice holiday type reading and you won't be disappointed with the ending."},{"Title":"The Bretton Woods international monetary system: An historical overview (NBER working papers series)","review":"I love this book written by a hugely talented writer. Anybody who grew up in Dublin in the eighties will relate to this. It is very real.very raw, and highly entertaining. Jack is a great lead writer."},{"Title":"Forgotten Traditions of Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Chinese View from the Eighteenth Century","review":"This book is a translation of a text from 1757 by Hsu Ta-ch'un, translated by Paul U. Unschuld.This book will be of particular interest to those who have a background in traditional Chinese medicine and are knowledgeable with TCM terminology. It is not a book recommended for beginners wishing to study TCM.The book is fascinating, delving deeper into the mysteries of TCM classifications and diagnosis and will be difficult for anyone trained in TCM to put down.The chapters are short, to the point and full of ancient wisdom. One chapter I enjoyed deals with asking the patient for his/her preferences and aversions, what gives them joy or misery, etc. This will further enable the trained practitioner to diagnose the nature of the patient's illness. Fascinating reading.This is not an herbal material medica and if anyone is looking for such a book I would not suggest this. It's more for diagnosis and understanding the nature of illnesses rather than specific herbs and formulas."},{"Title":"Forgotten Traditions of Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Chinese View from the Eighteenth Century","review":"Unschuld has created a wonderful translation of a great classic. This text presents the often cutting style of the physician Hsu Ta-ch'un. This is not a clinical manual in the sense that there are no point prescriptions or formulas. For those who understand the theories behind such \\"prescriptions,\\" the concepts will be enlightening. For scholars of the medicine, the criticisms of the \\"four schools\\" and the appearance of the original Chinese text will be valuable. The often critical style of Hsu Ta-ch'un is still highly relevant today, as he spends a good amount of time criticising \\"lesser\\" physicians."},{"Title":"Forgotten Traditions of Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Chinese View from the Eighteenth Century","review":"I am currently in my 2nd year of a classical Chinese medicine program and just came across this translation. First, I should say that Xu Ling Tai's calls for physicians to return to the classics (Nei Jing, Shang Han Lun, Nan Jing, Huai Nan Zi)--not for philosophical purposes but, in fact, to increase the efficacy of Chinese medicine--echos those of my most revered and respectable teachers. Xu's insights reveal extensive medical knowledge and clinical wisdom, as well poignant social commentary of the time. Xu is highly educated and extremely opinionated, which makes for an interesting read. This translation is surprisingly easy to read--written in a colloquial style and translated by a master of Chinese medical language. I appreciate the publisher's decision to include both the Chinese and English texts for comparison's sake. My only disappointment on this front has been the use of Wade-Giles instead of the standard Pin Yin transliteration. Otherwise, if you're looking for a collection of 100 concise essays by an 18th century physician-scholar, covering anything from 'how to counsel your patient's family,' 'what to do about the price of ginseng,' and 'why smaller formulas and ancient prescriptions elicit better clinical results,' you really ought to check this one out!"},{"Title":"Forgotten Traditions of Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Chinese View from the Eighteenth Century","review":"I would rate this text highly. I refer to it often for inspiration. Its a book that is suitable for any reader whether your a student or someone who has an interest in the classics or is working with the principles contained in the Nei Jing or Nan Jing. What we have within this book is the ability to get behind a great physician who really knew what he was talking about, the breath of his Knowledge is clear. I certainly think this text is equally, if not more relevant today as it was when it was written, 250 years ago. Not only does he criticise so called famous physicians, but he accepts that poor treatment or scrupulus doctors is heavens way of correcting the order of things. In this context, we as practitioners have a choice, whether we choose to know our subject well or not is not necessarily the way, rather an honest and open mind is what will make a good student/ practitoner especially one who is diligent enough to read the classics and bring alive these principles in his or her clinic.Indeed some of these arts have been lost, but there are a few people out there today practicing at a high level that the auther refers to. If you buy this book, whether or not you understand what is being said or not doesnt reallly matter, rather, its what was behind the mind of this amazing physician that will inspire you. His talk on the 9 needles is clear, this art is lost, but, what he does do is echo the priniples that are contained within the classics and indeed praises the worthy physicians who understood the way of heaven, earth and man."},{"Title":"Forgotten Traditions of Ancient Chinese Medicine: A Chinese View from the Eighteenth Century","review":"This is a very worthwhile addition to your library if you're interested in the history of Chinese medicine.

Jean Craighead George waited 30 years before writing this sequel, mostly under the pressure of her beloved readers. The sequel is just as good, if not better, then the original. It continues the story of Sam Gribley's adventure when he ran away to live off of the land in the Catskill Mountains. This is the story of both Sam and his independent younger sister, Alice, who has joined him in her own treehouse nearby. The story is based on his life after his falcon Frightful has been confiscated by a conservation officer and his sister disappears. Sam leaves his home and a searches for his sister with the help of his friend Bando.George's children books are the best that I have read on survival and the outdoors.

The first book dealt with Sam overcoming the harshest of conditions in his new life and coming to terms with his family, who initially want him back. With that conflict settled, this book centers around two interlocked crises; first, Sam's peregrine falcon companion is taken by a thief posing as a conservation officer; second, Sam's younger sister Alice disappears (she has been living with him for a while now), and he decides to track her down.The Good and the Bad:I may have just gotten to this book too late to derive the childhood joy that it is meant to impart. The characters all seemed wooden, the plot contrived and predictable, and the action unrealistic. The original book was one of my favorites as a young boy, and I imagine that I just missed the boat on this one. I did enjoy some of the ingenious survival skills Sam employed, and also liked that I can now recognize a few of the plant names that Sam mentions. And it is also a little thrilling to me to recognize that the tale takes place in the Catskill mountains, not far from my own childhood home. From outside the book, I can praise its politics, which are indicated by a bevy of strong female characters and a pure environmentalist ethic put into practical living."},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"On the Far Side of the Mountain is the second book in the series. It is about Sam Gribley and his adventures on the Catskill Mountains. In this book his family moves off the mountain because they could not farm the land. Sam's sister Alice convinces their parents to let her stay on the mountain with Sam. Sam dose not want her there but his dad says that she will probably be begging to leave in an hour. Alice is well adapted to living on the mountains and loves it there so she dose not tire of it. When Alice lives there thought she wants things that Sam has to build and make for her. Alice is doing well on the mountain and is almost living on her own. When some events happen Sam must leave the protection of his mountain home and explore new lands in order to save a life. What I liked about this book is that it is filled with action and adventure. I also liked his sister she was a great character in the book. What I didn't like about the book is that some on the decision that Sam makes I do not agree with. I know I said I liked Alice in this book but the spent the whole book talking about her and it was too much.People that would like this book are people that enjoy the outdoors and nature.

Since she thought that they might look for her, she gives them clues along the way. Once they find her, there's tons of suprises awaiting them.I decided to read this book because I read the prequel, My Side of the Mountain.

I was thrilled to find out that the author had finally come out with a sequel. But like many sequels it was a dissappointment. I hated it. I wish I had never read it. Jean takes the idealistic '50's Boy Scout viewpoint and weighs it down with '90's political correct/eco-freak/feminist babble. She preaches green peace style conservation and responsibility when what made the first book so good was escape from the hyper-sensitive viewpoints of today's &quot;enviromentalists&quot;. Talk about innocence lost. I am a biologist and understand conservation and wise use of natural resourses but this felt more like a propaganda pamphlet than a young adult book. I plan on letting my kids read the first book but won't tell them there's a sequel."},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"It was a good book for boys who like the wilderness.

I didn't appeal to that or the characters. It was basically about outdoor survival, which is much better done in other books, like Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.I would recommend reading other, more exciting books, like Hatchet,instead of this one."},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"In this book Sam's Falcon, Frightful is taken away by a conservation officer. Keeping Frightful or any other falcon is illegal. Sam is devastated. Frightful did everything for him and now she is gone.Sam hasn't seen Alice for days. He has no idea were she is or what she is doing. Sam checks Alice's tree house. There he finds a note on the ground. The note is from Alice and it says that she is leaving. Sam wonders where. He goes to his friend Brando's cottage. He tells Brando about Alice and how she left without telling him. He asks Brando to help him find her and Frightful. Together they map out where Alice might be going. With the help of a compass left in a sandy marsh by Alice, they set out in search of her. Throughout their journey they track Alice trying desperately to find her because of the danger she could get into. Join Brando and Sam in their quest through upstate New York as they try to find Alice and Sam's falcon, Frightful.I liked a lot of things in this book like the clues that Alice left for Sam and Brando. These clues told where Alice was and made you think where she would be going next. I like that Alice didn't tell Sam where she was going because it made the book more like a mystery. You had to guess where she might go. I like this book because it was an adventure and mystery book. I disliked the book because Sam didn't want Frightful back at the end of the book. It would have been more interesting if he had wanted Frightful back and not let her go free because the quest for Alice was also a quest to find Frightful.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and adventure books. If you like action books, it would be good for you too. Anyone who has read the first book in this series should read this book."},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"In my personal view I thought this was a pretty good book. Ialso read the the first one(MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN)last year. Ithought it was better then the sequel. This book had a lot ofinformation on the wilderness in it. If I ever got stuck in the woods I would think back to when I read these two fine books. It gave you instruction on how to make a sling to hunt for food with. The book also gave information on how to make traps to [catch] various animals. I thought it was interesting when it talked about falconry and gave you descriptions of plants you could eat and couldnt eat. There were times during this book where I couldnt put it down. there were also times in the book where I wanted to put it down. The book was about a boy named Sam who lives in the mountains with his sister Alice and of course his Perigrene falcon named frightful. When Sam was outside a conservation officer came and took frightful because Perigrene Falcons are almost extinct. He is devasted. Frightful is the one who caught almost all of his food. Later in the day he thinks his sister ran away. That day was not his day. ...While trying to find Alice he is also trying to get Frightful back at the same time.

So I grew up and did not write them.&quot; Jean Craighead George overcame that when a plethora of children wrote to her, begging for a sequel to her acclaimed epic &quot;My Side of the Mountain.&quot; As a result of these letters, she wrote &quot;On the Far Side of the Mountain.&quot; While her mother may be right that some sequels are trashy crud, this one surely isn't. It can slightly annoy fans of the first book when Sam decides to change, as it did me, but it improves as you turn the pages. Eventually, Frightful, Samn's beloved falcon, is confiscated by Leon Longbridge, the conservasion officer. Shortly after, his sister, Alice, runs away from the mountain (which she has come to love), saying she is &quot;thinking waterfalls.&quot; This prompts Sam and Bando to &quot;keep an eye on Alice&quot;, and they embark on what seems like a game of Follow the Leader. But as they get closer to her, Sam also closes in on a dangerous secret involving his falcon and her future--and suddenly the whole ordeal becomes much more than a game....It's true that this volume lacks some of the charm of the first, but it is still enjoyable. It also does stand as the middle volume of the trilogy, and must be read before &quot;Frightful's Mountain,&quot; the third and final insullment in this epic series. If you do get bugged in the middle, just read on. When you reach the final climaxes of the story, beginning with the chapter &quot;The Dawn Breaks Over Me,&quot; you'll be very glad you did, especially if you're rather fond of Frightful, who plays a very important role in the book. It's when you'll witness Sam make the single most important choice he'll ever make. What must he choose?

I decided to read on just to see where it was going.Putting this issue aside it was a lovely little book that will be loved by 10 to 13 year olds. Even adults would like the survival skills that are regularly mentioned although I thought these were taken too far when they built a water mill out of nothing and at the end are contemplating using it to produce electricity. I suppose the point is that even living in the wilderness does not get you away from development of some sort but, really, would a 17 and 14 year old from New York have the know who to do this!!Even more like Enid Blyton and The Famous Five for a slightly older audience, as the kids foiled a rare bird thieving ring the only difference being instead of ham sandwiches and lashings of ginger beer they eat squirrel and drink tea made out of plant roots.In summary, a pleasant story which complements the first book rather well and actually makes the first book slightly better.

It is one of the rare stories that can appeal to both young and old. \\"On the Far Side of the Mountain\\" (OTFSOTM) is the sequel that takes place about a year later.Amazon does a great job of capturing what the story is about so I will not go over the basics of the plot. However, \\"On the Far Side of the Mountain\\" is unable to recapture all of the original's charm. One of the problems is that the story is complicated and made messy - compared to the simple \\"Boy vs. Nature\\" conflict/theme of the original. OTFSOTM focuses less on \\"Boy vs Nature\\" and more on \\"Boy vs. Man\\" and the exploitation of the environment - you get the impression that Jean Craighead George is more intent on making a point about protecting endangered species and less on how Sam is able to enjoy his natural environment (which I found a powerful statement in the original). In fact, Sam focuses less on his love for his natural surroundings than his disdain for the ways of society - such as his refusal to eat at a restaurant.Overall, I would still highly recommend OTFSOTM for both kids and adults. However, I do think that kids could learn a lesson on the need to protect animals and the environment. 4 stars"},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"The book was ordered for my 10 yr old nephew who had read the previous books.

In his first book of the series, MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, he ran away from home to live in the mountains. He successfully made it through a tough year. He had to build a shelter and catch food himself. Until later in the book he found a Peregrine Falcon that he named Frightful. In this book, Frightful was his main source for food. Frightful would catch him food. Alice, Sam's sister who is also his age, joined him on the mountain. She made her own tree house a little separated from Sam's house. She helped Sam build a watermill.Later in this book, a police officer came to Sam's mountain and took Frightful from Sam. Frightful was a Peregrine Falcon which is a bird on the endangered birds' list and only a licensed falconer could own this bird. After Frightful was taken away, the officer took Sam's main food source away. Now Sam had to find a new way to catch food.Alice traveled down the mountain on some days to meet with her friend from the first book, Mrs. Strawberry. She liked Mrs. Strawberry and Mrs. Strawberry also loved Alice. They became good friends. While Alice was on the bottom of the mountain she also stopped by a farmer's house. He had a pigpen and Alice loved pigs.Sam woke up one day and Alice was gone. He thought she was just gathering berries or nuts or just visiting Mrs. Strawberry. She hadn't come back in three days. So Sam went to check her tree house to see if she was there. He found a note Alice wrote saying she was gone and not to worry she would be back soon. Well, Sam was indeed worried. He went down the mountain to ask Mrs. Strawberry and the farmer if they knew where Alice went, but they both had no idea. They both hadn't seen her in around three days. The farmer was so worried that they set off on a hike to find Alice. They later found out that she brought her pig. They found a couple compasses that gave clues to where Alice was going because they had a map and would look where Alice was going. They both knew she liked waterfalls so they found another compass and then looked on the map and found out that she was going to a waterfall. They got to the waterfall and found Alice's camp site but couldn't find Alice.

Only he has been joined--to his amazement and displeasure--by his younger sister, Alice, who exhibits the family's pioneer spirit. As the bookopens Sam is devastated by the arrival of heartless Leon Longbridge, the local Conservation Officer, who confiscates Sam's beloved peregrine falcon, Frightful, for breeding in captivity.Much of the story consists of Sam's tracking his independent sister who has taken it into her head to go off with her pet pig, Crystal. Demonstrating her woodland skills she plays their private game of \\"On The Track\\" with him, by leaving tantalizing clues re her destination. Sam enlists the aid of an older friend named Bando--a married man living in a rustic cabin nearby. The guys track girl and pig to distant wilderness areas. The story is enhanced by many pen and ink sketches and diagrams of woodland survival and colonial inventions, which make this book something of a reference manual for outdoorsmen.The plot picks up amazing speed in the last chapters: Alice provesa fearless and loyal sister to grieving Sam, while he must face the most difficult decision in his young life. Both siblings exhibit true character development in this YA book which makes use of diary entries as well as typical narrative to relate the story. Connecticut author Jean Craighead George presents a strong case for the preservation of endangered species, but can mankind both protect and responsibly enjoy these glorious birds of prey? Read the book to learn Sam's compromise."},{"Title":"On The Far Side Of The Mountain","review":"I loved this book what with all of the adventure and still giving you information on what you can eat in the wilderness.

After finding out the land was unsuitable for farming, the whole family leaves except for Sam and his sister Alice. Alice makes herself at home.

Landing in the 64th Century, he tries to return home by using the love of his Girlfriend Linda as a beacon. The only problem is that Linda has been told (By future Flash John Fox) that Wally is dead. Fox is in love with Linda, and hopes to usurp Wally's role as the 20th Century Flash.At their core, most of Mark Waid's Flash stories follow a bacic predictable plotline: Flash battles bad guy, gets lost in the Speed Force, comes back home with a weird new Power/Costume/Identity. But they're well told stories, and this one is no different. The relationship between Wally and Linda is totally believable, and in my mind is one of Comics great love stories.

According to David Fricke, Hoffman was clubbed with a guitar by the Who's Pete Townshed after the former took the mike during the lenthty \\"Tommy\\" medley and spouted some obscenities in the crowd, saying that Woodstock was a \\"bunch of s--t while John Sinclair rots in prison.\\" I next encountered this character when I read about the Chicago 7 trials, when Hoffman and his co-defendants made a mockery of the trial (and what gleeful mockery it was!) and the judge who was handling that controversial case.This book reveals much about who this sixties firebrand was, what drove him to do what he did, how the US government responded to sixties radicals like him (with hammer and tongs), and why he would eventually choose the life of an outlaw. Sadly, it also provides some valuable insights on why Hoffman would eventually take his own life. To his credit at least, he never became what he hated, something that cannot be said for the rest of his generation."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Abbie Hoffman 2 Ed","review":"Inspirational, funny, moving.

The third and forth reads will start to uncover not only how to create images that support your premise but how to disseminate those messages through the \\"free media\\" in order to expand your marketing budget 3 fold while gaining goodwill, acceptance and understanding for your cause.While on the surface a great read about a great American the fact of the matter is that in both his Autobiography and \\"Revolution for the hell of it\\" Abbie teaches the methods behind his madness and shows the reader how to be a more effective communicator on all levels.Sometimes humor is stronger than chains, and new ideas are always better communicated with a smile than a smack."},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"This is a fantastic book for anyone interested in 1968-82 Corvettes. It covers every year in more depth than I imagined possible. Whether you are contemplating the purchase of a 1968-1982 Corvette or are involved with restoring one the information will prove invaluable. It covers part numbers and date codes for virtually every component in the cars and not only tells you what the correct numbers and dates are, but also explains where to find them and what they mean. Also described in great detail are the appearance of factory original parts. The material the part is made of (cast iron, stamped steel, rigid plastic, pot metal, etc.) is revealed, the correct original finish (painted semi-gloss black, plated cadmium dichromate, grey phosphate dipped, etc.) is described, the method by which the part attaches to the car is discussed, differences between the part and later service replacemnt and reproduction parts is described, and just about every other detail is gone into. Even running changes made during the course of each model year are discussed in great depth. The back of the book has several very useful tables and charts that allow for quick reference of part numbers and the like. And very clear, detailed photographs throughout the text do a wonderful job of illustrating the information presented. This is not a coffee table book or a casual read, but rather a tool for anyone who wants to know more about Corvettes. It is extremely well written and illustrated and I recommend it highly to anyone interested in 1968-82 Corvettes."},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"This is a book of factual and historical information about 68-82Corvettes.

I recently bought a 78 corvette on instinct - I was lucky - it had matching numbers, transmission, original spare tyre/jack, windows, steering wheel etc etc. However if i had bought this book beforehand I would have KNOWN this and the risk would not have been there. The only parts on this car not original was the pain colour, side-exhausts, interior seat covering and air filter cover which of course the seller told me this was stock standard original factory fitted - do not believe any seller but educate yourself beforehand.Thanks to this book I am already looking for a second covette 76 model and now I KNOW exactly what to look for. After reading the book You will be able even based on photos on the internet to identify how much a car was modified or painted etc.Shortly put it is absolutely essential. The only detail it did not mention is that the 78 corvette was also issued with a km/h speedometer originally fitted for European custoemers.From a technical point of view - well written - easy to follow with laymans language - Indexes at theback are worth far more than the price of the book.RegardsMungo"},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"This would be a good book if you're buying a vette,to determine it's originality,but a restoration guide it is not."},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I am restoring a 1968 corvette so I purchased this book as one of many references required to complete a project like this.

I'm currently performing a full frame-off restoration on the second Vette. Mr. Prince claims in his book that the seat tracks on the 1980 Corvette were painted Black Phosphate regardless of the interior color. My first '80 had a Claret interior with seats tracks to match. When pulling the seats from my second Vette, the tops of the tracks were white and the bottoms were unpainted. This book states that the front side marker bezels were plastic. The rusted bezels that I pulled off of my front urethane bumper cover attest to the fact that they are indeed metal. Also with the bezels, Mr. Prince falsely records that these bezels were chromed. They were actually painted the same color as the body. There was no V01 heavy-duty cooling option listed for the earlier cars as Mr. Prince notes. It only appeared as the V05 option in '82. The book mistakenly claims that all '78-'82 cars used a horizontal vacuum reservoir tank for the headlights. This was changed in 1980 to a smaller cannister that was clamped to the front air dam support rod. A major faux pax in this book, Mr. Prince mistakenly writes that the transmission cross member was welded to the frame for a manual transmission and bolted in for an automatic. My second Vette has a 4-speed manual with a bolted on transmission cross member. I removed it and bolted to my replacement frame from another 1980 Corvette that was an automatic. Welded cross members harken back to the early '70's so Mr. Prince just assumed that it carried right on through the entire C3 production run. Finally, the FE7 rear suspension option for the '78-'79 Vette used a 7 leaf spring, not a 6 leaf spring as Mr. Prince claims.My point is, this book is rife with inaccuracies. If a person considers it as the ultimate source for Corvette restoration, I assure you, you will not score very highly at a NCRS meet. When I first book the book I was impressed with it. But once I got into it, my own car as I ripped it apart and other research, I discovered that Mr. Prince really didn't do his homework and he is no expert on Corvettes."},{"Title":"Corvette Restoration Guide, 1968-1982 (Motorbooks Workshop)","review":"I have had this book for a while now.

Van HelsemaAt the beginning of a Bible-school class last fall on the history and shaping of Western thought, Russ Pulliam, asked each of the students who they thought of as one whom God had used in shaping the modern world as we know it today. I knew that we might be asked to do a little research and writing on the name we chose, so I chose carefully.Since studying Reformation Church history, I have developed a growing appreciation and interest in the life and ministry of John Calvin. I have heard the name mentioned many times but confess that I knew little of the events of his life and of his significant contribution to understanding the whole of what the Bible teaches. I have heard of only a few names mentioned with such admiration and sometimes animosity as this Genevan pastor. Before I passed judgment on the man or his teachings, I resolved to learn what I could on my own and was surprised that I could find only a couple of biographies claiming to present factual information on the events of his life.The first biography I read was written by Theodore Beza, Calvin's successor as Pastor of the Church of Geneva at St. Pierre's Cathedral. Written back in the 1500's, one can imagine the added difficulty in understanding what Beza related to his generation about Calvin. The strength of the book comes in the fact that the author, Beza, wrote from his own personal knowledge of Calvin from the time Beza was a twelve-year-old boy neighbor until the day Calvin died. No other biography on Calvin that I know of can make that claim.But, reading This Was John Calvin, I found it much easier to get to know the man and the times in which he lived. The author has provided an excellent volume that condenses the life of Calvin and relates the principal events of the Reformation of the Church in one easily read volume. Much research has been put into this little book. The quotations from Calvin's letters have been carefully and appropriately quoted. This gives the reader a close enough view of Calvin's thoughts and responses so as to conclude that he was both a man with the same frailties as any other man, but also a choice servant of the Lord, \\"a vessel unto honor, meet for the Master's use.\\" (II Timothy 2:21)The book contains the story of a man arrested by God to be used not only in the reforming of an entire city during a time of intense persecution where 50,000 of his French countrymen were burned alive for their faith, but also in the summarizing and systematizing of that reformed faith for which his countrymen gave their lives to the benefit of generations to come. Some have said Calvin's magnum opus, Institutes of the Christian Religion, is the best statement of reformed faith ever written. Having read of the turmoil and trials during which this book was written, I have an even greater appreciation for the book I am to study in an upcoming theology class. Written and revised, added to again and again and revised, Calvin worked on this volume for a period of over 25 years, in sometimes unsettled state, suffering from poor health, voluntary poverty, the death of his son weeks after his birth, the death of his daughter when delivered prematurely, the death of his wife, the exposure of adultery in his wife's daughter, of his brother's wife, being rejected from his pulpit and the city of Geneva only to be begged later to return; these are but a few of the great trials through which God seasoned Calvin's studies of the Word of God with supernatural blessing and his articulation of them for all generations with the same seasoned grace.To the life that has been torn and turned upside-down by the providence of God, friend, you will find much consolation and comfort reading about this man who handled the providences of God with many tears, yet with an unwavering faith in the Master of those providences. Calvin could have well said with the Psalmist, \\"All this has come upon us, but we have not forgotten you.\\" (Psalm 44:17) The trials through which Calvin was brought only bore the peaceable fruit of righteousness and an example that goes on to this very day encouraging the hearts of the faithful to endure hardness as good soldiers and to uphold the truth of Scripture to the end no matter what the cost.In his own words Calvin speaks of how he viewed his life when faced with the decision to return to the pulpit in Geneva from which he was forced to leave only three years before. This statement could summarize his whole life, a living sacrifice upon the altar of service to God. \\"When I consider that I am not in my own power, I offer my heart a slain victim for a sacrifice to the Lord . . . I yield my soul chained and bound unto obedience to God.\\"Before you make up your mind for yourself what exactly to think of this man, read for yourself, and my promise to you is that you will not be disappointed, provided you are truly among the faithful."},{"Title":"This Was John Calvin","review":"My daughter who is 11 thought is was extremely boring and hard to read.

Also, Ian\`s lifetime friend John (Grinny) Grinton, who was married with children, remembers Ian having many women and about 4 steady girlfriends in his (Ian\`s) life (Dianne being one of those steady girlfriends). Now, if the author of this book hasn\`t spent time reseaching the subject of Ian Stuart and just assumes things, then you really have to wonder if he\`s done the same thing for other topics that he\`s written about, and you really have to question and judge this author\`s credibility. I also noticed this alot in this book, that this author would just assume and guess things, and obviously hope that the reader will automatically believe him. There are definately more books avaliable on the history of punk rock that are much more truthful and better than this garbage. Maybe this is why this book is so hard to come by and why it hasn\`t been reissued? Because the author now realises that there is provable lies in his book.

The same can be said about Mike Stevens' \\"Mastering Layout\\".Stevens clearly explains the proper use of such elements as negative space, color, and fonts in designing signage that has impact. Many of his own alphabets are included, along with dozens of layout drawings as examples to the text. Much of what makes a sign layout stand apart from others is laid out in an easy-to-understand, equational form.Mike Stevens may have died in 1989, but his thoughts on sign layout and execution are timeless.A must-read, a must-have."},{"Title":"Mastering layout: Mike Stevens on the art of eye appeal","review":"This book you have to read it slowly.

One was a book, whose name escapes me, of his showcards in GLORIOUS color.

It helps the reader design better. The focus is on signs although I found it useful for business cards, posters, anything that involves type. I found it useful in that the author breaks things down...for instance you must decide what is the most important part of sign and that should be read first, but you simply can't just put giant capital letters for this purpose. Naturally the author explains why that is not very effective with some decent visual aides. The book focuses mainly on type only and it is all in black in white.

Anyone who completed some of the exercises should have some confidence that he or she could complete at least an intermediate level O course (assuming reasonably good fitness). The book also includes very basic information on physical training (anyone who is a serious runner will not learn a lot from those sections, but trail running is different than road running, so don't skip those sections if you are strictly a road runner).

The book does not address OS-specific or DB-specific performance problems in detail, but does discuss expensive SQL statements and OS memory issues. There is some discussion of the uniqueness of R/3 memory management on NT. What you will find is a thorough discussion on R/3 memory management, work process distribution, SQL statements, enqueues, table buffering, and much more.Initially, I was disappointed that there was not a thorough discussion on platform-specific performance issues, but after seeing how well the R/3 aspects are covered, I recommend this book to any R/3 Basis administrator faced with the task of tuning a production system.The fact that the author is part of SAP's TCC group is obvious. I consider this an advanced text, but written simply enough for even a beginning R/3 adminsitrator to comprehend."},{"Title":"Sap R/3 Performance Optimization: The Official Sap Guide","review":"I have said before that performance tuning SAP is more art than science... an arguable point.

This book is every bit as good as SAP's monitoring class. I would suggest a solid understanding of performance measurement and tuning for your RDBMS and OS as a pre-requisite to this volume."},{"Title":"Sap R/3 Performance Optimization: The Official Sap Guide","review":"After taking the SAP class Workload Analysis on performance tuning and being thoroughly baffled and confused, I bought a copy of this book.

If a book is the least bit interesting it generally takes me about two evenings to get from cover to cover. This one took me five days. Every time I sat down to read, I started to fall asleep.The book is about lesbian artist Kate Paine and her high school crush, Ellie Webster. After their first kiss, the older Ellie left Kate and made her way through life as a successful heterosexual. The only problem is that Ellie is really a lesbian who won't admit it to herself. During her marriage, she has lesbian lovers and affairs, but she stays married out of shame of her true nature. Twenty years after high school the two women find themselves together again. This time, Kate isn't sure what to think, but she is still very attracted to Ellie. Ellie divorces her husband and starts a relationship with Kate, but soon leaves Kate for someone else.There is a lot more to it, but I'd be retelling the entire book if I continued. Suffice it to say that Kate has no self esteem and lets Ellie run all over her. Ellie is ashamed of her true self and takes advantage of everyone around her. The characters are shallow and the story is disjointed.

However, I do recognize that most people buy the books for patterns. With all that said I will attempt to give an overview and then will offer my opinion. The quality of the example pictures is superb, with no distortions, no fuzzy spots and no glare. The examples themselves range from good beading quality to excellent quality. The pattern graphs are very clear, easy to read and if you have the skillset above, easy to understand. There is at least one example of each pattern set. There are simple and glancing directions at the beginning on the stitches used and a few comments and anecdotes, otherwise there is little text in the book.Now for my opinions, I would have liked more examples as I was looking for endings, edges, inspiration on fringe, etc. So for me it was lacking a bit in the finished example section or could have included a gallery which I would have liked even better.

As it is written by an impartial historian, it is thus much more valid than Mr. Mann's Rise of the Vulcans, as Mr. Mann is himself a member of the Project for the New American Century cabal."},{"Title":"Imperial Designs: Neoconservatism and the New Pax Americana","review":"Gary Dorrien has specialized in liberal theology. Now he addresses the issue of neoconservatism. He does not \\"argue that Bush is a puppet of the neocons and Cheney/Rumsfield.\\" As the author says, the top Bush officials are not neocons. And Bush seems to have come up with ideas on terrorism and Iraq on his own. But Dorrien does criticize neocons for their dreams of Empire, their annoyance with the United Nations, and their hawkishness.Is Dorrien right? Do neocons want the United States to be an Empire? What do neocons think of international law? More precisely, do neocons want the United States to be fair, or do they want us to throw our weight around to get our way?I think the author makes some good and bad points on these issues. The problem is that we need to start with a couple of fundamentals. Political disputes, say between liberals and conservatives, involve agreement on some goals and disagreement on the means to achieve them or the nature of successfully meeting them. That is, most of us want American society to be just, fair, and prosperous. That could be a mutual goal. We could have totally different political ideas about what that goal might mean. Still, we would be speaking the same language, even though we disagreed. Those who wanted American society to be damaged or destroyed would not be able to truly agree or disagree with any of the rest of us.Now where do I think this places those with some specific political views, such as the neocons? Well, I think some neocons might indeed want the United States to be unfairly biased in helping Americans rather than others. But they surely would not want to put it that way in a debate! Matter of fact, they would much rather put the shoe on the other foot, and be able to argue in favor of justice, fairness, and human rights for all against those who are explicitly against them. And that leads to what I call \\"litmus test\\" issues. It seems to me that the neocons have picked some issues of this sort. Dorrien recognizes this, as he points out that one neocon, Norman Podhoretz, has emphatically criticized Communism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism. But Dorrien implies that these issues tend to separate the neocons from the liberals or paleocons. I think that misses the point. I think issues such as Iraq, Korea, and Taiwan might do a better job of drawing such lines. Communism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Americanism are, in my opinion, issues that neocons want to use to draw the line between being able to join the debate or not being able to do so. Those who strongly favor Communism, anti-Americanism, or anti-Zionist terror really are not in a position to constructively criticize liberals, paleocons, or neocons.Dorrien does realize that neocons are sincere about these issues. If they are wrong, he encourages us to address their arguments rather than speculate about their motives. But he merely explains that these issues are important. He fails to address the question of where the line is between such issues becoming national in nature and merely being a facet of partisan politics.I'm a liberal, and I am often in disagreement with neocons, on tactics, strategies, and goals. And I think we ought to oppose dubious or arbitrary American policies. I think we Americans can pursue a better foreign policy. But that certainly ought not mean supporting Communism, anti-Zionism, or anti-Americanism. I think Dorrien agrees with this. But he seems to confuse these \\"litmus test\\" positions with very partisan ideas about our foreign policy."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I love Nora Roberts stories.

Cam, Ethan and Philip continue in character and though they have matured into middle aged men, they maintain the relationships with their wives and family that began in the first parts of the trillogy.

The three oldest Quinn brothers are still building boats, the Quinn wives are still putting up with their shenanigans, and everyone still supports the other, without question. But Seth has been gone for five long years, running more from his past than from his present. Almost immediately upon his return, his artist's eye is caught by the new florist, Dru, who is doing a little running of her own.This was a solid finish to what was already a great trilogy, possibly my favorite Roberts series. There was a consistent theme of family, and how the ones you make can be more important than the one you are born into. And, of course, there was a tempestuous romance to fill in the gaps.If you aren't already a fan of Nora Roberts, this is a great series to start with. Particularly if you are turned off by the thought of her paranormal books. There are a couple of ghosts, but nothing that I think qualify as paranormal - they're more visions than anything. What you get the most is a great family in a great setting."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Chesapeake Blue is the fourth of the Chesapeake Bay series by Nora Roberts. It is the story of Seth Quinn, who as a ten-year-old , was bought from his mother (Ray's estranged daughter, Gloria deLauter) by Ray Quinn and raised by Ray's adopted sons, Cam, Ethan and Phil. After years of promoting his art around the continent, Seth Quinn wants to come home to St Christopher, to the security of the place he grew up in. When he arrives, he meets Drusilla Whitcomb Banks, granddaughter of a Senator, who has come to St Chris to get away from life in Washington and the stifling demands of her parents. She's running a flower shop and loving it, and Seth wants to paint her, and more. But everyone has secrets in their past, and Seth's is insisting on turning up like a bad penny, threatening everything he holds dear. Is there any way someone as sophisticated as Dru can be with someone like Seth with his history? Is Seth underestimating Drusilla's strength? Has Seth forgotten he is a Quinn, and Quinns stand together? This final chapter in the Chesapeake Bay series will please fans who wanted to know how Seth turned out. Roberts knows how to create characters to love and hate, and a plot that is original. An entertaining read."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I was so excited to learn that there was a fourth book in this series. It was great to read from Seth's perspective - to see him grow up, and great to read about the rest of the Quinns and their children. This was my first Nora Roberts series - and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Looking forward to reading another series."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I absolutely loved the brothers trilogy, it was truly my favorite of all Nora Roberts trilogys. Of course I do love them all! This book was telling the story of Seth as he now is grown up. I felt like I knew the entire family and cared about each and every one of them.Seth is home with his family, the business, and the mother who has followed him over the years since he was a young boy. Blackmailing him, doing her best to ruin everything for him and for the family that gave him everything and made him who he is. Although he's all grown up now, he'll still pay her off, do just about anything to protect the family he loves.Dru enters the picture, who has fled a cheating fiance and the life of the wealthy in Washington D.C. to strike out on her own in St. Chris. She owns a flower shop and does her best to fit into the community. Given her experience with men, she doesn't want to fall in love, doesn't even want to date. But Seth can be as convincing as any of the Quinn men and Dru finds herself in love with Seth.I think Nora Roberts did an excellent job with this ending story. Her plot was great, the ending was a surprise and all the characters we loved in this trilogy have returned. If you start with this book you may want to read the first three to start."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"The amazing Quinn family is back!Seth, the youngest Quinn, is home for the first time in years. An acclaimed painter, who is blessed with a gift he can't quite explain, Seth is as handsome and dynamic as the other Quinns. He comes home to find things in St. Chris much the same, with the exception of lovely Dru Whitcomb-Banks, a new shopkeeper in town. Dru is not what Seth expected and he soon finds himself drawn to her, despite his unsavory roots. She's carrying quite a bit of baggage herself, but finds that she's falling for him just the same.Nora Roberts had already built a compelling family that intrigued readers through the first of the Chesapeake Bay saga, Sea Swept, Rising Tides and Inner Harbor. But in response to overwhelming reader demands (she dedicates the book to &quot;Every reader who ever asked, &quot;When are you going to write Seth's story?&quot;) she writes Seth to be as dreamy and decidedly alpha as the other Quinn men. Dru is a perfect match for Seth, strong willed and determined and also a bit of a lost soul. The combined traits make the couple vibrant and interesting. On top of that, you get to revisit your favorite characters from the first three books and find out what's become of them and their children. Nora's greatest gift is her ability to write a family that keeps the reader's attention.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to both first time, or habitual Noraholics! If this is your first Nora book, I suggest that you read the first three in the saga before reading Chesapeake Blue. You'll find your enjoyment of the story even greater having met the secondary characters before.Nora's done it again!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"\\"Chesapeake Blue\\" by Nora Roberts is a wonderful addition to the excellent Chesapeake Bay trilogy of \\"Sea Swept\\", \\"Rising Tides\\", and \\"Inner Harbor\\". The much-anticipated tale of Seth Quinn has finally arrived, and it was well worth the wait. Nora Roberts has written a romantic, insightful, and touching tale that stays true to the original trilogy and is sure to have readers everywhere cheering and begging for more.Seth Quinn, the troubled and angry young boy adopted by Cam, Ethan, and Phillip after the death of their father, Ray Quinn, is all grown up and coming home. Now a successful painter who has conquered Europe, all Seth wants is to return to the big white house on the bay and be with his family. Troubled by a secret that has weighed on him heavily for more than a decade, Seth needs the peace that only home can bring.And it is absolutely wonderful to see all of the characters we fell in love with in the previous three books. We see the most of Cam and Anna, because Seth lives with them, but Ethan and Grace, and Phillip and Sybill are never far away. Though 18 years have passed, not a whole lot has changed as far as the Quinn family dynamics are concerned (though the family has grown considerably), which I was immensely relieved to see. Grace and Ethan's daughter Aubrey is all grown up as well, and is a very important part of Seth's life.Though some things never change, like the love and support Seth's family will always provide, there have been some changes in his hometown of St. Christopher. The most fascinating of which is the arrival of Drusilla Whitcomb-Banks, who has moved from D.C. and opened a flower shop. Intrigued by the beautiful Drusilla, Seth sets about trying to get to know her better. Dru, who comes from a wealthy and influential family, has come to St. Chris to get away from the demands of her previous life. Seth is determined to paint the lovely Drusilla, and as he convinces her to pose for him, and spends as much time with her as possible, the two of them begin to fall in love.The romance between Seth and Dru is beautifully rendered and sure to touch readers' hearts. Drusilla is slow to trust and wary of relationships, but her misgivings are no match for Seth's charm, warmth, and love. Seth and Dru make a fabulous couple, and I was completely caught up in their developing relationship.But trouble is brewing on the horizon, and the painful secret that Seth has been hiding for years is about to come back with a vengeance. Linked to his painful past, Seth's secret has the ability to destroy his new love and hurt his family. Conflicted, unhappy, and determined to keep Dru and his beloved family out of the mess he is in, Seth is heading for disaster. Will Seth trust in Dru's love, bite the bullet, and tell her and his family the truth? The tight knit Quinn clan always sticks together when one of them is in trouble, but they can't help Seth if they don't know what's wrong. Will some visitations from the ghost of Stella Quinn be enough to convince Seth to share his burden? Or will Seth let his past destroy his newfound love and happiness?\\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is a truly heart-warming and affecting tale that had me smiling and wiping away tears throughout. Seth Quinn is a great hero, and readers are guaranteed to fall in love with the sensitive, strong, and fun-filled man who grew from a scared and angry boy. Dru is, likewise, a great heroine. She's independent, determined, and a very loving person when you get below the surface. Add in the amazing Quinn clan from the previous three novels, and you've got yourself an incredible and complex cast of characters. Nora Roberts has an undeniable gift for creating families that readers would love to be a part of, and the Quinns are one of her greatest triumphs. \\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is a superb read, and it focuses just as much on the love and importance of family as it does on the romance between Seth and Dru. Nora Roberts has really outdone herself with this one, so buy \\"Chesapeake Blue\\" today."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Seth Quinn is all grown up and has returned home.

He has been paying her blackmail for years, but when she ups the ante; Seth knows he has to go to his family for help.This is a good conclusion to the series. In this book we see the family dynamic come full circle. They laugh, argue, but they do it all as a family."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Chesapeake Blue is the fourth in Nora Robert's Chesapeake bay trilogy, and, in my opinion, it is the weakest of the series. I will probably received many negative votes for this review, (especially in a forum of so many positive votes), but, here's the deal: Chesapeake Blue was an average read for me. The plot seemed contrived, the characterization forced, and the story suffering from the forced inclusion of too many characters from previous books.Chesapeake Blue is the story of late 'twenty-something' Seth Quinn. Seth has decided to return to the small water front town, this time to stay, and hooks up with rich girl Drusilla Whitecomb. Both Seth and Dru have 'issues' they need to work out before getting together.Seth: I had a great deal of difficulty envisioning Seth as a romantic lead from the way he is written. He still seems to be a little boy running away from his problems. (Personally, I really wish Nora had chosen to write about Aubrey, she was much more interesting as an adult). In Nora tradion Seth is a 'super rich, fantastically talented artistic bachelor', who can't seem to take no for an answer. He seemed to be very immature, and was really pushy with his relationship with Dru. I disliked the way he manipulated Dru to do things she didn't want to do, by using his art and artistic talent as a weapon, and I found his vocabulary and mannerisms.... Somewhat childish. (And I'm not referring to the cussing, that didn't bother me).Dru: Dru was a much more interesting character, but was oodles more mature than Seth. Although her dysfunctional relationship with her parents was touched upon, this was never resolved to my satisfaction, and I failed to see that Dru and Seth had much in common as a couple aside from sexual chemistry.The highlight of this story was NOT Seth and Dru's relationship, but seeing what had happened to the rest of the Quinns- but even there, Nora takes few risks. She portrays the Quinn extended family, as too perfect, a little too cohesive and a little too good to be true. I have come to expect a little more realism from Nora. Also, the Quinn's have lost a bit of their 'blue collar feel' which I really liked.So, overall, I felt CB was an average novel with few surprises. Perhaps Aubrey's tale will be better?"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Those of us who frequent Nora Roberts' Web site know that she was besieged for years by readers anxious for her to tell Seth Quinn's story. Seth, the youngest brother in the popular Chesapeake Bay trilogy, was about 14 years old when the series ended, and everybody (including this reviewer) wanted to know what happened to him when he grew up.Nora obliges us diehards in this wonderful novel, which takes up where the others left off. We meet Seth as a gorgeous, sexy (what else?) and famous artist, who has returned home to his roots on the Chesapeake Bay to join his brothers and family--and also to try to escape a terrible secret.No sooner does Seth set foot on his old stomping grounds than he meets the lovely Drusilla, proprietor of a new flower shop--and a blueblood escaping her own little secrets. As in all Roberts novels, their eyes meet--sparks fly--and the reader is drawn into a hot, steamy love affair with just enough conflict to make it truly interesting.\\"Chesapeake Blue\\" is true to the Roberts format her fans have come to know and love. It uncovers no new ground, and is not particularly imaginative or breathtaking, as some of her other works can be. But it tells the story of Seth, and tells it well enough for all of Nora's fans to turn the last page with a smile and a sigh.Dear Nora: Now can we have a sequel about Seth's as-yet unborn children?"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Thank You Nora Roberts for very satisfying ending to the Chesapeake Bay Series with Seth's story! The book had me hooked from the begining, taking us back to the fateful car ride to Maryland with a 10 year old Seth. It jumps us to the &quot;now&quot; with Cam, Ethan and Phillip and their families still loving and living at Ray and Stella's home by the shore. Seth returns running from his demon and wants the security that was always home. He is a young master painter who has travled the world. He comes back to St. Chris and meets flower shop owner Druscilla, who is running away as well. The true wonder of the story is the rich comlexities of the brother's relationships. Ms. Roberts blends in humor and more importantly--overwhelming love. I wonder if the Quinn's would adopt me. I could see a book for Aubrey, but time will tell. Thanks Nora Roberts for the amazingly complicated Quinn Boys.P.S. Thanks for Stella, too!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This book is a continuation of Nora Roberts' Chesapeake Bay trilogy. I'm sure that if you haven't read the trilogy, you could still enjoy this book. However, I have read the trilogy therefore this book was more meaningful and definitly more sentimental. In the trilogy we learned all about the four Quinn brothers and their tight family bonds. This story is about the youngest, Seth. Family still plays a major role in this book. It was like meeting old friends after so many years. I was happy to see that even though the Quinns were older their personalities hadn't changed. While falling in love with Dru, Seth still has to deal with unfinished business from his past. Once again he learns that &quot;You mess with one Quinn, you mess with them all.&quot; If you haven't read the Chesapeake Bay triology (Sea Swept, Rising Tides and Inner Harbor) I highly recommend that you do. As usual, Ms. Roberts' characters are larger than life. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Nora Roberts has returned to the Quinn family from the Chesapeake Bay trilogy, fast forwarding to the adulthood of the last &quot;lost boy&quot; Seth. Since the Quinns have long been friends of mine, the release of this book was much anticipated. It did not disappoint! It was delightful to see glimpses of characters developed previously in the series, and an interesting twist that they are now twenty years older.Though I'm sure Chesapeake Blue stands alone as an entertaining novel, I'm also sure it adds to this story if the Chesapeake Bay trilogy has been read.In typical Roberts style, there is strong character development, intriguing interaction, and clever dialogue. Seth was quite a character at eleven, and he's even more so in his late twenties. The storyline itself is not as intricate as some of her other work, but that also is part of the charm -- the simplicity of returning to a quiet place, to the roots of family... the symbolism of returning home."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"The fourth installment of the Quinn brothers' (or Chesapeake Bay) series is finally out, and well worth the wait of two and a half years.Seth, the youngest of the four brothers, should not be a stranger. From Sea Swept to Inner Harbor, fans of the series have witnessed his slow transformation, from a belligerent, battered child to a balanced and quick-witted teen with a smart mouth. In Chesapeake Blue, he has come into his own. A world famous artist aptly titled \\"The Young Master\\" by the Italians, Seth finally returns home to St. Christopher for good.While the books serves as a welcome reunion with the Quinns for her hordes of readers, the story revolves mainly around Seth. Gone is the undisciplined cacophony of a thousand and one family members a la the O'Hurleys and the Stanislaskis. Ms Roberts has managed to strike just the right balance this time round, between developing the newest couple and catching up with the older characters.Seth and Druscilla more than amply hold their own against the previous three couples; the banter, buildup and intimacy of their relationship is no less intense or heartwarming. Seth is the quintessential Nora Roberts hero, while Dru, his perfect complement. The former is hard-headed, charismatic and arrogant (just so) while the latter is reserved, strong willed and passionate. Watching them take stumbling steps towards each other is a pleasure, even with an anticipated fallout courtesy of an old threat.Other characters are drawn just as vividly, with the spunky Aubrey heading the list. The lip-lock scene was unexpected, hilarious and wholly unexpected. Seth's two childhood buds, Dan and Wil, who used to hung around him uninvited, also return for interludes. Not to forget too, the precocious sons of Cam and Anna, the elder of whom looks set to follow the illustrious \\"woman in every port\\" habits of his father in his heydays :) .But for me, the most simple and stunningly written part was the first introduction of Stella Quinn (Seth's Grandma) and Foolish (Seth's dog). Paranormal sightings aside, those few pages were a bona fide scene stealer. Not only did it bring Stella to readers, it also subtly reminds us of the love and continuity that is family.And that perhaps, is what Chesapeake Blue is all about."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I hated that he had been paying blackmail to Gloria since the age of 14. She had nothing to blackmail him about.The other thing that was even worse was the illogic of Gloria at all. Someone who is a prostitute and addicted to drugs, simply is not going to live that long. If she does manage it, her brain would have been fried and she would have been in no shape to manipulate anybody.I am also disappointed that the romance did not involve Audrey."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is the first of the Quinn books I read, and I enjoyed it enough that I immediately went out and chased down the original Quinn trilogy. After I read them, I started having questions about Seth's story. Spoilers: After seeing how much stronger Seth was by the end of Phillip's novel, I had trouble believing that he'd cave to Gloria's blackmail in Chesapeake Blue. I could see him being afraid enough of Gloria to give in to her when he was a teenager, but not when he was in his late twenties. Maybe if he'd only been 20 or 21 in Chesapeake Blue the blackmail plot would have seemed believable. But not when he's older. Considering the family ties would have just grown stronger between Seth and the adults, I think he would have gone to Cam and Anna if the blackmail continued after he was 16 or 17. I still really enjoyed the book, though."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is a well written ending to the Quinn story. This is the story of Seth, grown up from the earlier books in the series. This is one of my favorites that I re-read often. I recommend this entire series!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Growing up with three brothers and no sister, I know firsthand that Nora Roberts' depictions of men is right on the mark. She is especially good at capturing brothers interacting with each and the women in their lives, which is why the Quinn Brothers series are some of my very favorite of her titles. I tend to react emotionally to books and how much I like them depends on how much I like the characters. Seth's story is one of my favorites of all her books, and probably of this series. Unlike other readers, I find Drusilla (not so crazy about her name, though) a layered character and I really enjoy watching her work to find her place in St. Chris and in a family, which she does with authenticity. Seth is great - filled with talent, and yes some ego (but most successful people are successful in some part due to their ego or confidence), but with heart and honesty, too. I love how the brothers come together to defend their own, and how the women won't and don't hide behind them, but stand with them. I think this is one of her best for its depiction of character and place. I've been reading it since it first came out and just finished again last night - can't wait to start reading it again."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"A few years ago, a friend gave me two Nora Roberts books and told me to read them, that they were excellent. One was SeaSwept and the other was Rising Tides. I read the inside flap and thought Nah, maybe sometime if I have nothing to read I'll read them. They just didn't seem romantic enough for me to read as I'm a die hard romantic and like my books to have lots of it. In a bookstore a couple weeks ago, I saw Roberts had a new book out. Chesapeake Blue. I bought it and began to read it a few days ago and could hardly put it down. Seth is so witty and charming and lovable that you can't wait to hear what he says or does next. As I read it, I put it together that this was book number 4 in a series. I went to my bookcase and found the first two sitting there collecting dust. From what I've read here on other reviews about this book, I can't wait to read the first three. I finished Chesapeake Blue this morning and am now going to start at the beginning. I can't wait to read Cam's story. This book was a real piece of work and you won't be disappointed in it. But beware...if you don't have a lot of time for reading, don't start it until you do otherwise nothing around the house is going to get done till you're through with it."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I am so happy that Nora Roberts decided to write another book that was about the youngest and newest member of the Quinn family. This is one of her best series. It depicts 3 men with different lifestyles, backgrounds, and personalities. They all come together to live in the house of Ray and Stella Quinn. They show the ultimate patience and love to turn these boys into wonderful and loving men. They all come together when Ray, the father, has a terrible car accident. It turns out to be fatal but before he dies he makes the 3 men promise to take care of the young boy, Seth.I love the fact that each book in the series is about each man. The interesting and wonderful part is that she wrote another book to show how Seth, the newest member; how his life is changed for the better. It jumps forward in time to show the adult Seth and his lifestyle and personality. His horrible past is explained in the book as flashbacks. I do not feel that this book can stand alone because readers need to know about the other family members.The men in the book are all strong figures and are father figures too. I love the fact that it shows the men as strong and passionate men with a dedication to the family named &quot;Quinn&quot;.They live together without any women to take care of the young boy. They story shows a slow progression as to how they in turn love the women who enter their lives for the better.I did not think that another book was necessary because the end of the 3rd book left hope that everything was alright and had a happy ending. I am so glad that I was wrong. She took it beyond just hope for Seth. I am sorry that there will be no more books in the series. I love how she created the characters and the setting. You really feel like part of the book. This book is extremely romantic and passionate as are the others. I wish my husband was like that! LOL! This book leaves more than hope but fulfillment for all the characters.I never re-read books but this is an absolute must re-read series. This is my favorite series from her. I have read a great many of her books but this is the best! I recommend that everyone should read the other books in the series and read this one to conclude the series in for a great in a happy ending for the Quinns."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Unlike alot of diehard Nora fans I can't say I was dying for this story I would have been just as happy for it to have stayed as it was but at the same time I still look forward to it. The best part was meeting up with the brothers and their families. As for the story what bothered me the most is this story was already told. Seth's mother comes back to blackmail everyone and cause trouble sorry but that already happened in the previous books why tell it again. Also if they are such a close knit who are always there for each other why would Seth have been paying her off since he was 14. O.K. she threatened the kids but after he matured you think he would have gone to them so I think it's lame.Plus if Gloria is such a drug user you'd think she'd be dead by now. My review is that it was o.k. but hardly one of her best."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Seth Quinn would never have grown into the fine man he has become if it wasn't for his grandfather who'd taken him in as a child. When his grandfather died, his surrogate uncles gave him a loving and stable home and in doing so they were the ones who were rewarded. After years abroad studying and honing his skills as an artist, Seth returns to the family home in St. Chris where he is welcomed as the prodigal son.When he goes into the local flower store to buy flowers for his female kin, he meets the owner and immediately wants to paint her. Dru is very wary of men and tries not to get involved with Quinn but he finally persuades her to give him a chance. Just when it looks like they have the makings of a solid relationship, Seth's blackmailing mother comes to town, threatening to ruin all he holds dear.The hero of CHESAPEAKE BLUE is based on the premise that environment (nurturing) not genetics (nature) plays the major role in personal morality. The growing relationship between Seth and Dru is tenderly and realistically portrayed. As a result of that believability the audience roots for them. Nora Roberts is at her best in this thought provoking contemporary romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is why Nora Roberts shines above the rest. Everything you ever wanted in a novel and more - great characters, quick-moving story, intrigue, romance, humor. Thoroughly enjoyable read as always. Also highly recommend Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"THE SERIES:The Chesapeake Bay series includes four books which tell a continuing story about a family. Ray and Stella Quinn adopt three troubled boys who came from abusive homes. In the first three books the boys are about 30 years old. They left home, have good jobs and are single. Stella died several years earlier. In the beginning of the first book Ray took in another boy, 10-year-old Seth, who was abused by his mother Gloria. Gloria offered to give legal guardianship to Ray in return for a large sum of money. Before anything was official, Ray died in a car accident. Shortly before he died, he asked his three sons to move back home to take care of Seth. All three men promised they would. They decide to start a boat building business. In the first three books each of the three men meets and falls in love with a woman. The fourth book tells the story of Seth, who is grown, returns home and falls in love. The best parts of the first three books are watching the developing relationships among Seth and the three men and seeing Seth blossom. Each book has a minor amount of fantasy due to some conversations with a ghost. The four books, main characters, and my ratings are:Sea Swept (Cameron and Anna) 4 starsRising Tides (Ethan and Grace) 3 starsInner Harbor (Phillip and Sybill) 3 starsChesapeake Blue (Seth and Dru) 2.5 starsSTORY BRIEF (WITH MILD SPOILERS) (Chesapeake Blue, Book 4):Seth is now about 28. Gloria began contacting him when he was a teen, threatening to hurt his family. He secretly has been paying her money to stay away. He spent several years in Europe to get away from her. But when he became a famous painter, she followed him to Europe. Since he couldn't avoid her and since he missed his family, he moves back to Chesapeake Bay.Dru is the only child of a wealthy family in Washington D.C. Her fianc&eacute; cheated on her, and she moved to Chesapeake Bay to open a flower shop. She bought a house and loves living alone, with no domestic help. She likes the small town environment. Seth sees her and immediately falls for her. He wants to paint her. She is reluctant. He rents the space above her flower shop for his art studio.REVIEWER'S OPINION:The primary weakness was the two main characters were not interesting enough. There was not enough relationship development. I also felt it was too quick for Seth to ask her to marry him. The best parts of the book were the camaraderie, teasing, and conversations among the Quinn family members. That was entertaining and well done.The major conflict in this story was regarding Gloria, Seth's horrible mother. The Gloria problem was resolved in Book 3. So I was unhappy to see that the author had to weaken Seth's character in order to reactivate Gloria's bad guy role. I did not enjoy seeing Seth wimp out and pay her blackmail money over fourteen years without telling his family. They stood up to her and scared her off before. They would have done it again. I wasn't happy with this plot. I enjoyed the first book the most.DATA:Story length: 240 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: 3. Total number of sex scene pages: 7. Setting: current day Chesapeake Bay area and Washington D.C.. Copyright: 2002. Genre: contemporary romance with fantasy.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Nora Roberts and J.D.

This book is the story of the last of the four brothers with fantastic stories of their own. All of the Quinn brothers came into the Quinn family through the love of a couple that took young boys that were abused and abandoned, and they gave them a home filled with love and guidance. All of the brother's stories were told except for Seth's. Now, years later, we finally hear Seth's story.

Having conquered the art world, he simply wants the comforts of home...to be around family (his three adopted brothers) and those things that are most familiar. Abused as a child, taken in by his grandfather, he feels that he owes his brothers everything for the happiness and sense of peace that they have provided/given him. His brothers, who jointly own and run a ship building business, are just glad that he is home and spend no time welcoming him home. Imagine his shock when he encounters a woman (Druscilla Whitcomb Banks) that challenges him in every way. Dru has opened a flower shop and is not interested in a relationship with anyone, especially not a fun-loving, free spirited artist. Dru is tired of doing what everyone wants or expects, and she is still reeling from an embarrassing situation involved the infidelity of her ex-fianc&eacute;e. As a socialite and heiress, Dru is tired of doing what everyone expects and focuses on being a successful business woman. As the two set on a course to discover each other, there is something from Seth's past that has resurfaced and rears it's angry head. As Seth's dead-beat/drug addicted mother comes back to destroy all that he knows and loves, he must be willing to trust Dru and his family. And Dru must risk her heart again in order to find true happiness.What I enjoyed the most about this story were the dynamics of the Quinn family. While all of them were very different and extremely entertaining, they loved each other unconditionally. The conversations and dialog between them was entertaining and humorous. The differences between Seth and Dru's families are startling. While Dru's family's thrives on obligation and appearances, Seth's thrives on unconditional love and understanding. I also enjoyed the supernatural nuances that were woven throughout the book. Seth's conversations with his deceased grandmother (who he never met), provided him moments of love and advice, and provided some insight into Seth and his family.I have read several Nora Roberts novels but never read any others of the Chesapeake Bay Saga. Although this is apparently part of a series, I thought it was a nice \\"stand alone\\" book. There were explanations given for various relationships and storylines, so I never felt lost or confused. My only criticism was that the secret that Seth was keeping was not that big of a deal, so I never really understood why he felt so torn and confused. Overall, this was a quick and easy read.

But that is hard to do when the book is by one of my favorite authors, and continuing the saga of my favorite set of brothers. So I bought it.I have not finished the book yet, but I am enjoying the read. The story continues with Seth coming home to the Eastern Shore to the white house with blue shutters. I am enjoying revisiting the Quinn family, although it is a little difficult imagining them 18 years later. The stongest link continues, however, in this book. &quot;You mess with one Quinn, you mess with them all.&quot;My favorite in the series is still &quot;Sea Swept&quot; with Cameron my favorite character in this and all of Roberts' trilogies."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"You can't miss this one if you've read the other Quinn stories.

She writes love stories not just romances. Stories that talk about the love between blood family and family of the heart. I loved this book because of all of the relationships. I felt like I was coming home to Anna and Cam, Ethan and Grace and Phillip and Syball. Seth has grown up into a loving man. I love how the romance has its difficulties but reflects the fact that Seth grew up in a loving environment.

The story fast forwards about 15 years,Seth is now in his late twenties. He realizes that no matter where he may roam, St Chris is home. It was great to revisit with Cam, Ethan, Phillip and their families. But the main story is still about Seth and how he sees himself. A part of his brain still sees himself as a scared little kid, being victimized by his mother. He would do any thing to prevent this from touching his family again, even paying his mother off to get her to leave him alone. By the end of the story he finally realizes that no matter what, Gloria will always be there but his family is stronger and tougher than her."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I confess that I want to complain about this trilogy/quadrilogy largely because of my un-PC affection for it. These books offer brief (and, alas, imaginary) fulfillments of three of my long-cherished wishes: close extended family, a job that lets me have evenings off (maybe with a beer in hand) and both of the above in Chesapeake country. (I already have the great relationship, but one of the sorrows of adult life is finding that even spectacular relationships don't fill every gap.)Okay, so Roberts doesn't know Chesapeake country as well as people seem to think--no, you CAN'T sail in a fifteen-foot skiff from Tangier Sound to the Little Choptank before lunchtime, and if Ethan's really a waterman he'd know you haul up your heavy stuff with winches, not wenches. Okay, so the real reason the Brothers Quinn all have to be self-employed is because the lower Shore's economically depressed. So the Quinn family, despite its tormented background, is just a little too perfect: what, NO learning disabilities, sexual dysfunctions, drug problems, power struggles, school cutbacks, or marital struggles for dominance? Everybody survives those heinous childhoods without any therapy at all and comes out more mentally healthy than anyone has a right to be? (Incidentally, that's why we probably won't get Aubrey's story; as the eldest of the first generation of Non-Conflicted Quinns, she has no childhood betrayals to overcome.) And who took care of all those kids anyway while Anna was working long hours in Princess Anne and Cam was at the boatyard? Even Grace might blanch at the prospect of nursemaiding seven kids.These are all genuine flaws in the books, including Chesapeake Blue, but as an exilt from Chesapeake and extended family alike, I'm eerily forgiving of this series. Imagination and memory fill in the gaps: if Roberts implies that Phillip (my fave--pity he has no speaking part in this novel) drives off the Bay Bridge into pristine salt marsh, ignoring the development that's scarring the Shore from Cecil to Accomac, I just shake my head and sniffle onwards. I still love this series as much as it's possible for me to love formula romance.The bottom line? Family plus location, location, location. The sex is pedestrian (I mean, COULD the orgasm be described in nonviolent terms a bit more often?), the romance plot predictably predictable, but the idealized family and the idealized Shore together are a sentimental powerhouse, at least for readers like me."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Did you ever wonder what happened to young Seth Quinn at the end of the brother's trilogy? I did. That's exactly why I bought this book the moment it hit the stands. It took a little getting used to knowing Seth as a man and not the scared little boy we all came to know. I quickly fell in love with ALL of the characters again and couldn't wait to see what would become of Seth's nasty mother. Let me tell you, this is one set of books that I will read again and again. You won't leave this family wondering, what happens next? You are truly satisfied with their lives and knowing that they fought all of their demons and will continue to live their lives as they see fit. See how real they become to you!!!! LOL. You will not be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I think this is the only lukewarm review I have ever given Ms. Roberts/Robb. I generally love all her books. However, in this case the Quinn brothers trilogy should have stayed a trilogy. We already knew they lived happily ever after. This book was a stretch to continue the story. I had a hard time picturing Seth as an adult. Also, to think that he would have kept paying his mother blackmail money over the years was ludicrous. Don't get me wrong--I read the book and still loved the Quinn family, but I could have lived without it."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Nora Roberts has 4 brothers and several sons. She loves men, she says, and no reader could say that her men are anything short of amazing. But are they real? Or are they Nora's fantasy of what men should be like? Who cares - I love all of her male heroes but especially these Quinn men. In Nora's latest book Chesapeake Blue, all the Quinn brothers appear: trigger-tempered, protective Cam (my favourite), soft-spoken Ethan and eternally well-dressed, financial wizard Philip. And guess which mouthy, bad-a$$ attitude kid is all grown up here and the centre of this story? You guessed it - our ever-beloved Seth. I truly enjoy having characters I've loved from previous books re-appear in sequels and here Nora does not disappoint. Cam, Anna, Ethan, Grace, Philip and Sybill are all still living in St Christopher with children of their own. Their wonderful personalities are still intact ( thank goodness!) even after 18 years. There was so much family reunion going on in the first section of the book, however, that I wondered if Seth's story was ever going to get off the ground! But I should never doubt this author. Seth and Drusilla's story is as special as the other 3 brothers, even drawing a few tears from me near the end. The fabulous brotherly banter, especially between Seth and Cam, is enjoyable and often hilarious if not 100% believable. (Have you EVER heard REAL men talk like this??) But nothing beat the &quot;kissing&quot; scene - one of the funniest I've ever read. (It would translate really well on the movie screen.) Anyway, go back and re-read the trilogy so all the wonderful characters are fresh in your mind and then sit back and enjoy Seth's story. Thank you, Nora."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This book was an awesome book. I was so happy when I heard that Nora Roberts was going to be writing Seth's story. I waited for months to get the book, and I was not disappointed. Seth turned out to be an excellent, and caring man. It was great reading about Cam, Ethan, and Phillip again. Seth and Dru made a great couple, and I'm happy that in the end he finally stood up to Gloria. Roberts is a great writer. I was really surprised that she referred to Darcy Gallagher....from the Irish trilogy's (also a great family serie). My advice is to pick up this book and the others with Cameron, Ethan, and Phillip. Nora is the best and there isn't a book from her that I wouldn't read."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Quite frankly, I read this book mainly to find out about the 3 original Quinn brothers- an excellent series. Unfortunately, the story has little about them. Second, I hoped this would tell the story of Seth and Aubrey...too bad it didn't. Aubrey was much more interesting than Dru, for whom I had little sympathy. The scenes with Seth and Aubrey sparkled, the ones with Dru and Seth seemed forced and flat. It does not help that Seth tends to come across as someone who expects to get his way and is rather vain.While I do not object to foul language, used carefully and sparingly to create a particular character trait, too much sends up a red flag that the author doesn't want to take the time to develope a character. Either that or she thinks that 'real men' can't express themselves without it. I would like to assure her that they can. The excessive use was annoying and distracting.Overall, I got the impression that Ms. Roberts wrote the story to fill a square- a sequel for the series. I hope she will tell Aubrey's story and put more thought into it than she did this one...but I'll borrow it from the library instead of purchasing it."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"If you've read the first three books in the Chesapeake Bay Saga, you will want to read this one as well.

But his past, and his dark beginnings, continue to haunt him and once more rear its ugly head in his idyllic recreated life.To be honest, the Quinns were never my favorite band of brothers, but this book seemed like a weak and dishonest piece of fan service tacked on to a half-shod trilogy based on a hackneyed premise. Seth's character, and that of heroine Dru Whitcomb Banks, seemed like a cardboard cutout, resting on the laurels of earlier books' descriptions and hardly standing on its own merit. Seth's reactions and interactions with Dru and his brothers pale in contrast with earlier books, and everything in this book seemed contrived, staged for the readers' benefit. Set-ups were predictable, boring, and overused; scenes and actions didn't jump off the page with Roberts' usual skill and finesse.There was very little of the flow and continuity one expects from Roberts. Scenes jumped around from character to character, across time and space, with little to no reason. The Quinns make for a large cast, but the POV shifts were distracting and too clumsily handed to add any to the reading experience. For me, there were too many long periods of introspection and hardly any 'action', in terms of characters actually doing anything worth reading about.Perhaps what bothered me most about this book was the very premise it was based upon. In the original trilogy, the Quinn brothers were dead-set from the beginning against paying Gloria DeLauter any more money. Seth's actions not only prove him to be a coward, but go against everything his brothers fought to represent, the morals they stood for, and their decision to honor their deceased father. Definitely not worth the time it took to read this drivel."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I found this one to be quite disappointing and predictable.

When looking back on it, I had focused on only the negatives: that the trilogy really didn't need a sequel, and that Seth's dilemma was a little too much like Luke Callahan's inHonest Illusions.What I'd forgotten was the characters. To catch you up: Ray and Stella Quinn had adopted three adolescent boys--boys with horrible childhoods. Years later, with the three brothers grown, and Stella dead, Ray ends up with another boy, and his death in a car accidents puts the responsibility for Seth on the shoulders of his three new brothers. How they cope with it and form a family, and find love is the subject of the trilogy. Chesapeake Blue opens 20 years after that, Seth returning home as a successful artist with a troubling secret--his junkie/prostitute mother has been extorting money from him since he was 14, threatening his new family.The heroine of the story is flower shop owner Drusilla Whitcomb Banks, \\"poor little rich girl\\" trying to break out of the mold she's been forced into all her life.The story itself is pretty predictable, but it's the way it's told, and the way the characters are themselves rather than two-dimensional stock characters that make it shine. The reactions go beyond the standard and become individual.And it's occurring to me that I can't think of a good example. Drusilla, maybe, as I've already described her as the \\"poor little rich girl.\\" She does have the standard cold-hearted upbringing, the parents disapproving because she broke up with the philanderer who was, nonetheless, a \\"good match.\\" But she doesn't wallow in it. She sees herself clearly, and knows there's a middle ground between cutting herself off from her family completely and caving in to their expectations. Her parents, likewise, aren't evil--they're just a tad clueless and self-absorbed. The rest of the characters are similarly well-developed.There's just something about this book that really showcases Nora's talent. The atmosphere, maybe, the characters, certainly the way the words flow... whatever it is, it sucked me in and made me believe. It's not a big story, but it's a complete and satisfying one."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Chesapeake Blue: The Chesapeake Bay Saga #4 (Chesapeake Bay)This book is a MUST READ! I love Nora Roberts' writing style so much!!! She has this way of building the characters so that you FEEL like you're right there in the book and you are experiencing EVERYTHING with them! She is true to the history of this saga with this book. Revisiting all of the characters that we have come to know and love from the first three books. I'd LOVE to see another book in this series with the story of Aubrey and see the Quinn Brother's rebuild what was lost in this story.I promise you this much...if you buy this book and begin reading it...you won't want to put it down until the last word!!!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I will say starting off, that having read about young Seth for so long in the other books, it was hard to get used to reading about him being alluring to women. I kept picturing him as a little boy and it was difficult to put him in the roll of the adult hero. The whole thing with his mom was strange to me. Were we really supposed to find her threatening? SO anyway, I just love Anna and it was great to hear her yelling again. Other than seeing the others and their progression, I felt like I was watching my little brother have sex and it was just not working."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift.

I'd just finished reading the other 3 books in the Quinn series and enjoyed each one. When I read J. Ellis' rant about how bad the book was, and who uses 'twaddle' anymore?, I didn't have high hopes and expected it to drag on.Fortunately J. Ellis was all washed up in her 'twaddle'. The book was funny, Nora Roberts was able to pull the smart mouthed child Seth into the adult Seth very nicely and I enjoyed how she brought us up to date with all the earlier characters and showed the couples still in love after 18 years. Nora made Aubrey and Seth best friends and brother and sister and it was good that she didn't have them get together in a couples way, I think it would have given off a creep factor to their relationship. Dru's character wasn't flat, there was enough information and feeling written that rounded Dru out. I enjoyed from the beginning the arguments between the brothers and that all favorite dunking off the dock pasttime they have. Real siblings do act that way and worse.All and all, Seth's story rounded out a very nice, fuzzy feeling saga very satisfactorily and I was a bit sorry to finish it. I wish the boatyard hadn't have been damaged and that Gloria had gotten more of a commupance, but we can't have it all.Good job Ms Roberts"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"If you are a fan of Nora Roberts's many action-packed novels with a little romance thrown in, you may be sorely disappointed with this book, and the 3 leading up to it. I have loved every NR book I've ever read, up until these. I usually always stick with a book even if it's not holding my interest, but all I could do with this foursome is scan through briefly just to get the gist. If you like books that are strictly romance, you may like these, because that's just about all you're going to get. If you want murders, mysteries, and adventures, read some of her other books.If you like typical books about slovenly men who need women to pick up after and baby them, and of course in the end everybody gets married and has babies, then this series is for you."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I finished reading this book.

I really like some of her books while others leave me feeling flat. There was no question with this one. It's a five star keeper and I haven't even read the others in the series. From the very beginning of the story it made me smile. It was the story, the sense of family, the feeling of home. Yes, the romance part seemed a little forced but considering the caliber of Nora Roberts' writing in comparison to many other writers I think that can be overlooked. It wasn't so forced as to take away from the overall feeling of the book.(What would be a really great effort from other writers we don't accept in exceptional authors.)I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This was the first of the Chesapeake Bay trilogy that I read and I could not put it down!

All three brothers were extremely interesting, as well as all of their love interests. This book, about grown-up Seth, isn't quite as good. Don't get me wrong, I still liked it - I just don't feel it was quite up to Nora Roberts usual standards. I've read dozens of her books, and this is probably one of the ones I liked the least. It was hard for me to get in to (normally I get so involved in her books I finish them in one sitting!), it took me a good 2-3 weeks to read the whole thing. I got sick of the whole Gloria thing halfway through the book, it was just way overdone. I liked Seth and Dru together, though the best parts of the book for me were the scenes at the house on the lake with the whole family.

I could not disagree more. As always, Nora tied up all the loose ends and gave the reader a chance to visualize what the Quinn family was like today. Then she spent most of the story doing what romance novels do and that is keeping the reader gripped wondering if the two main characters will work through the tragedy and live happily ever after.I also read that some thought her use of profanity was too much and not needed. Again, I disagree. The reader needs to put personal views aside and look at the characters. Nora lives in Maryland and by my guess has spent time in small rural watertowns eating crabs and listening to the locals. So, I would guess that she has a pretty good understanding of how to create \\"real life\\" characters.

Her new release focuses on Seth Quinn - the gawky kid entrusted to the care of the brothers when their adoptive father Ray passed away. He finally returns to his home at Chesapeake Bay after establishing his career as a renowned artist. Family bliss and a blooming romance with florist Dru Whitcomb awaits him but threats from his mother Gloria shatters his happiness. Dru's failed romance and spliced parents add tension to their relationship. This is a novel which stands on its own; peppered with the protective males (Cam, Phillip), their sassy partners(Anna, Sybill) and even the rambunctious kids (Aubrey, Jake). Their honesty and warmth is exclusively Roberts' creation and this glorious triumph of a book is dabbled with a paranormal favor and cheeky humor to render a splendid finish."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Nora Roberts understands the intricacies of writing romance novels as well as anyone ever. The setting, the interaction, the depth and breadth of expression, the flow of the storyline, is all masterfully done.

Seth is the youngest of the adopted Quinn brothers and the grandson of Ray, the man who adopted him. But when Ray was killed in a car accident mere months after he Seth's mother Gloria sold Seth to him, the brothers Quinn stepped in to raise the emotionally damaged ten-year-old.Growing up amidst the lively Quinn clan, Seth is able to foster his love of art even as he aids his new family in the boat building enterprise. Adulthood brings with it the promises of fame and fortune as Seth, the artist, takes a tour of Europe. To avoid demons of his past and revel in the security of family, he decides to return home to Maryland with the intention of making that his permanent home. And while his charming good looks have heralded a beacon to many a young woman, he has never met anyone like Dru Whitcomb, a D.C. transplant who owns a local florist shop. Dru's past relationships have taught her to be wary of men, but Seth seems to have a way of breaking down her barriers to begin to establish a relationship between them, only to find those demons knocking on his door again.Ms. Roberts has written a novel that immediately immerses the reader into its every page with a sense of realism that gives one the feeling of being a bystander in this small Maryland community. The power of love is an often-used theme of this author, whether it be romantic love or strong bond of family and friends. And a critical point employed in this novel, which puts Ms. Roberts in a league of her own, is the fact that while romance is a crucial part of the plot line, the sub-plots are not just an added attraction, but a major force in building the romance."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Seth is, naturally, a compelling subject, and one that Nora's fans have waited for with major anticipation. The book, like all of Nora's work, is good. The characters are good, the prose interesting, the interactions believable.I liked the book for a number of reasons (not the least of which is revisiting other characters), and I really liked the characterization here. Unfortunately, I found the plot to be a bit...um... canned? Usually a Nora Roberts book grabs me and won't let go - this one was much less compelling in the plot, particularly (it lacked the usual tension that characterizes her books).Still, a very good read."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"For what they were, escapist and light entertainment, the first two books of Nora Roberts' Chesapeake Bay Saga were engaging, touching, charming, humorous and well-written. I enjoyed them immensely. Cam's story made you laugh and Ethan's story tugged at your heartstrings. Roberts was able to draw her readers into her created world in a way that was both tangible and emotionally satisfying. In the third book of what was originally a trilogy, however, I could feel both the author's waning interest and the strains of needing to be fresh and creative with material that was a bit too thin. The Sybill character was supremely unbelievable and we really did not find out much more about Philip Quinn than we had already learned from the first two books. We certainly were not shown a much deeper bond between Phillip and Seth. Inner Harbor was the best indicator that Roberts truly did not need to write another book about these characters. All the loose ends were tied up and nothing more needed to be said. In Chesapeake Blue, however, the author, stretches the limits of believability to the breaking point with a warmed over plot line and a romance that has all the depth of a razor blade. I don't believe in praising anything just because a popular author has written it. They can turn out rubbish as well as anyone and more's the pity since really popular authors are rarely censured or given bad reviews that might affect sales. This book starts off with a promise of a deeper emotional connection to Seth, whom we fell in love with in the first three books, but quickly degenerates into mechanical twaddle requiring the reader engage neither her intellect or feelings.Seth Quinn, now all grown up and a talented and successful artist has returned to his boyhood home with the hint of something troubling him. We are re-introduced to all the original Quinns who now have been fruitful and multiplied and are supremely happy and successful and beautiful--right down to the very youngest. Their wives are all fulfilled outside the home with stimulating and interesting jobs --- even earth mother Grace now owns a company. And of course they are all still gorgeous and desirable after eighteen years and the sex is still hot. Nothing of interest there, so we turn to (sinister music please) Gloria DeLauter, who was menacing and eerie in Sea Swept, but has become &lt;u>ridiculously&lt;/u> cartoonish in Chesapeake Blue--the trailer-trash equivalent of Snidley Whiplash or Lord Voldemort in stilettos. Not only that, but in order to write this drivel, Ms. Roberts had to draw the character of Seth as a frightened ten-year-old living in a twenty-eight-year-old's body. This \\"conflict\\" of Seth's is utterly ludicrous given what we know of both the Quinns and of Seth's character. Roberts had already established the solidarity of the brothers Quinn in Inner Harbor. Seth had been permanently grafted into the brotherhood. (This was one facet of the book that I found both beautiful and touching.)Now, in this book, we're expected to believe (from the background set up information) that the fourteen year old Seth, after having lived in the comfort and security of the Quinn family for three years, suddenly and inexplicably no longer felt connected enough to his brothers or confident enough in their ability to solve the problem together to tell them that his crazy mommy came back to town and was threatening to do bad things again if she didn't get more money? Hogwash. Seth has been previously portrayed as too intelligent a character to believe that Aubrey would remain safe if he didn't tell the people who could actually do something about the situation, or that his mother could reasonably go to any public venue since she was on the run from a litany of charges. I can't swallow this and I really can't buy that this nonsense is &lt;u>still&lt;/u> going on with Seth at twenty-eight. What I could have bought was something involving Seth's past--something more psychological than substantial--perhaps an emotional something from his childhood that haunts and drives him.In my opinion, the boy Seth was far more compelling and engrossing a character than Seth the man, who should have been more carefully drawn and meticulously developed and played out against his brothers and the influences they had upon who he became. But, I imagine that the author could not be bothered to think those things through, since this book had a built in audience who would pay good money to read about Seth even if he were to sit on the Quinn porch rocking and watching paint dry--just as long as he'd get off his duff long enough to engage in a hot sex scene every few chapters.This brings me to the romance which was so contrived as to be almost painful to read. It was badly paced and had no tension or conflict either external or internal. It read like the subplot to a more interesting story--filler material, but not strong enough to stand on its own. Drusilla Whitcomb Banks, because she is so rich, has to be written with many personal problems so she will seem more like us ordinary mortals and so that Seth can show us how sensitive and perceptive he is when he understands her. Gag. I did not like Drusilla Whitcomb Banks, not because she was rich, but because she was a shallow contrivance who had nothing in common with the hero. Even the sex was so fake it left one cold. The author made absolutely no convincing case that these two should be together. The Drusilla Whitcomb Banks character is an annoying hot house flower that was increasingly reduced to an object the more the author tried to show us readers how much Seth wanted to paint her. I did not find it sexy, I found it boring and annoying. It was an easy way for the author to toss together a romantic plot thread without having to actually think about or develop her characters in any meaningful way. And I won't get started about Seth painting Dru lying on the bed with all the red rose petals which was a sloppy copy of the well-known scene from Titanic. In Titanic there was an actual point to it and it had class. In Chesapeake Blue, there is none and it came off as cheap and trashy.Ms. Roberts could have created a believable romance either of two ways; She could have completely redrawn Dru's character with enough depth to actually complement, play off and challenge the Seth character or she could have used Aubrey who was all around a more interesting and likable character to begin with. If Ms. Roberts wanted to truly emphasize Seth's bond to the town of St. Chris, what better way to do it than with a connection to Aubrey, who was inextricably linked to the town from the first moments we meet her in Sea Swept. The connection seems even more feasible seeing that Aubrey overshadowed Dru in every scene they were in together even when Aubrey was not given anything to say. This character literally sparkled and was so down to earth and elemental and full of life she almost jumped off the page. Depicting Seth's love of and deep connection to the town of St. Chris, to its people, to his home, his family, and a deepening understanding of what Aubrey truly meant to him, would have closed the circle nicely since Aubrey was the first person to love him unconditionally and the first person he was able to show love and affection to when he was freshly from Gloria's clutches and and still afraid to be touched by everyone else. It would have been rather sentimental, true, but far, far more satisfying than the warmed over, hacked out scraps of a story the author tossed us and expected us to swallow."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"The first novel, Sea Swept, introduces the story of three adopted brothers and how the deal with the loss of their father and the gain of another adopted brother. Therefore, to fully understand the situation and the developing relationship with the brothers, the series should be read in order: Sea Swept, Rising Tides, Inner Harbor, Chesapeake Blue.The books take place on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Therefore, be prepared to read about the lives that accompany Maryland natives.Each book in the trilogy tells the love story of one of the brothers, beginning with Cameron, the first boy adopted. The brothers have completely different personalities, which allows the reader to better relate to one brother of the four.Cameron, the star of Sea Swept, is extremely outgoing with breathtaking looks. Before the events that take place in Sea Swept, Cameron's heart lied in racing and women. Now, he unexpectantly falls for a woman whose main goal is to make sure the new addition to the family (brother number four) is properly cared for and his biological mother does not interfere.Rising Tides is my favorite book in the series, dealing with the shy but undeniably masculine brother, Ethan. He is the only one of the three brothers who decided to stay on the shores of the Chesepeake and care for his father. His life is immensely simple, spending his days as a fisherman on the bay. The love story that develops between him and his lifetime love is the most romantic of the series.Phillip's story is developed in the third book of the series, Inner Harbor. This book is immensly important in the trilogy because a great number of unanswered questions are resolved during this story. Phillip is a hansome, well-mannered, businessman with a taste for fine wine and beautiful women. Not prepared to ever become a family man, a mysterious woman with a suprising background comes into town and steals Phillip's heart on first site.The last book of the series, Chesapeake Blue, tells the story of the last adopted brother, Seth. Twenty years have elapsed since Inner Harbor. This was the perfect ending to a breathtaking series. In this book, you are able to see how Seth has dealt with his new surroundings and if he has been able to separate himself from his biological mother. The book also updates readers on the lives of Seth's three brothers and their families. Seth unexpectantly falls in the love with a new businesswoman in town. They develop a relationship as friends that blooms into undying love, respect, and compassion.I highly recommend any romance novel fan to read this series. You won't regret the time spent!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This one could have been a tough one for Ms. Roberts - after the truly excellent Chesapeake Bay trilogy, Seaswept, Rising Tides and Inner Harbour, she was &quot;plagued&quot; by fans to write Seth's story.I was looking forward to reading it, as well as having some trepidation as to what I would find - it has been known for only two out of three books to be good in a trilogy ( Three Sister's Island, in my opinion ) and I so did not want the set ruined with a below par fourth.I need'nt have worried. Right from the start the book grabbed the attention and did'nt let go to the last page. It all felt so fresh and yet it was like re-visiting old friends. I must admit half the reason for buying the hardback was I could'nt wait to catch up with Cam &amp; Anna, Ethan &amp; Grace and Phillip &amp; Sybil. Ms.Roberts did'nt disappoint. As well as all the &quot;catching-up&quot; there was Seth's story as an adult and the conclusion to some loose ends that had been left from the trilogy. Sorry, to say more would give things away.If you have'nt read the trilogy then this book might leave you &quot;lost&quot; as there are many references to events and humour carried through from the first three - but if you have read them it makes it all the more richer.Wonderful. Funny. Endearing. Moving. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"The Chesapeake Bay Triology is expanded into a saga with the addition of this fourth book. This story is a sequel to the original trilogy about the Quinn brothers and this book focuses on younger brother, Seth Quinn--who is certainly deserving of his own story.Seth is a painter/artist who has returned to his small hometown to be near his 3 brothers and run away from the demons that have haunted his past- namely an evil biological mother and the mystery of his own paternity. He finds and meets his soulmate- Dru. Dru has settled into running a flowershop in this small town but she is also fleeing from her own past torment as well. Both don't want a permanent relationship but are drawn to each other. Their story is a great ending to this series and it is nice to catch up with the other Quinn brothers and their wives as well. It is also great to resolve the mystery of who Seth's father is and put to rest his conflict with his birth mother.I read this book without having read the triology, but since finishing Seth's story, i have read the Chesapeake Bay triology _(seaswept, inner harbor etc) I definately think you can read this as a standalone novel but those familiar with the previous books will find this as a satisfying conclusion."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I've been reading Nora Roberts' books for a while now, and my favrite series was the Quinn brothers trilogy. I was very excited to find this book--a sequel to the first 3. We get to find out what happened to the 3 Quinn brothers and to Seth, their &quot;brother&quot;. This is an excellent continuation of the original 3 stories. Read this book--you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I love Nora Roberts, I always pick up her new books as soon as they are out, and I never throw them out! Sacrilege! I do love how this last book let's us see the other family members are and how they have feared. It's great to see Stella involved too! Unfortunately I do have to agree with a previous reviewer, the story was a little canned. I have found that most of the \\"last\\" books in Ms. Robert's series are predictable and not as lively and engrossing as the first few. She always starts the series off with a bang! Then you wait endless months until the next book is released, and it's never quiet as good as the first. The thirds is the same, not as good as the second. That will not, however stop me from reading her books!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"For the reader and for Seth, Chesapeake Blue, is a return home. Readers experience the emotion and wonder that Seth experiences as he is reminded of the sense of family that being a Quinn evokes. We see each of the characters of the previous books and we catch up, along with Seth, on the progress of their families and lives. Seth's success as an artist will make all readers of the trilogy proud. His romance with Dru is just as powerful as the romances in the earlier trilogies. For the reader who remembers the toddler, Aubrey, she also appears in the pages of Blue as do all of the Quinn progeny. I wasn't disappointed and I was left wondering if Nora will be inclined to follow this with any of the other Quinn's who make an appearance in this book."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I bought this book not realizing that it was a continuation on the Quinn family saga. When I realized this, I was thrilled and the book didn't let me down. I enjoyed the stories about Cam, Philip and Ethan and it was interesting to read how Nora Roberts made Seth his own person. The family connections are still there. My favorite parts of all the books are when the brothers are interacting with each other. They fight, they joke, they get angry at each other, but they are always there for the others when needed, no questions asked.Seth comes home after being in Europe with his biological mother, Gloria, following him and blackmailing him for money. He has been paying her since he was 14 so she wouldn't bother his family, but her demands are always increasing. New to the picture is Dru, a florist from a very wealthy, prominent Washington family. Gloria threatens to ruin everything and everyone connected to Seth if he doesn't pay. Boxed in, Seth realizes he needs help and goes to his family. They take care of Gloria this time, but in a way that a future book can be written.The whole Quinn family is wonderful. They're a loud bunch, but you can't help caring about them and wishing you could be part of a family like that. It's a family of unconditional love and support at all times. We should all be that lucky in our lives.I can only hope this family saga continues. I would love a book on Aubrey. If you haven't read the 3 books leading to this one, do so. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I absolutely loved the brothers trilogy. Through all three books, I felt like I knew the family and cared about each and every one of them. Chesapeake Blue does a wonderful job of telling the story of the young Seth, all grown up. If you are a Nora Roberts fan, you'll love this book...but I suggest reading the books about the brothers first...or much of this book won't make sense to you."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"After I heard that there will be a story about Seth Quinn, I can't wait to get my hands on it. I always love the Quinns, they are surely my favorite family of all the families Nora Roberts has ever created. And Nora has sure delivered one of her best with this one. Everything I dreamed of, everything I wanted to happen ... was here.Seth turned out just the way I pictured him would be. Dru was one perfect match for him. And the whole reunion with Cam, Anna, Ethan, Grace, Phillip, Sybill, and Aubrey ... surely brought brought a trip down memory lane. I laughed, I had tears in my eyes ... it was a perfect book, with a very great ending. It's surely one of Nora's best, one of my favorite. I can already picture this one as a Hallmark movie."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"OK, Roberts style prevailed once again in Chesapeake Blue and I've always admired her style. I read every one of the Quinn Brothers trilogy and was anxiously waiting for this book. I purchased the book right off the bat for my collection. I brought it home and started reading immediately. This is a typical Nora Roberts story. Seth, the young grandson of Ray Quinn has grown into manhood, he's a famous artist, having traveled to Europe for his fame and fortune. And as expected, he is being blackmailed by the villian, his mother, for more money to feed her nasty habits. And on his return home, the scenes with his family are emotional and well-described, as Roberts knows how to do so well. So if I expected the story to read along the plot lines that it did, why am I giving it a four rating? It was Roberts' style of writing, which I've always admired. The book held my interest even though I had the ending figured out. And it made me cry. If a book keeps me wanting to turn the page, it deserves at least a four. Grant it, this isn't one of her best, especially like the other three, but it was worth my effort and my money. The story is heartwarming and predictable. I think she left enough characters to go on with a sequel with this one, Aubrey, Will, etc. We'll see. Like I said, it has her (Roberts) style and I like that."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book. I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail. Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter. Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial. Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character. Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his \\"problem\\", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book. So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long? And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves \\"so\\" much? I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love. But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.Finally, Drusilla. First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie. Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers. At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man. Which, I like that character.In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion. And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Since I'm an owner of all three other books in this series, I was very excited about getting to finally read Seth's story. However, halfway through the book I was already disappointed. The chemistry between the main characters just wasn't there. In fact, I didn't like the heroine (Dru Whitcomb Banks) at all. All she does is whine about her life and make rude comments to the people around her (especially Seth). It just was NOT believable that these two were in love. The only reason why I finished the book was becasue I wanted to know more about what happened to the other Quinn brothers. Nedless to say, the book was very anticlimactic and Seth definatly deserved better...maybe someone more like his very interesting, very loving niece/cousin/sister: Aubrey"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This was the first romance novel I'd ever picked up. It's been over two years since I first read it and I've reread it more times than I can count. The book offers very little in terms of character development or morals etc. that I usually hope to get out of a novel. Despite all this, it does make for a tasty morsel on a lonely night when you can't sleep.Drew's strength and stubborness makes her a more believable character than the women in you classic \\"romance\\" novels. You had three \\"plot\\" elements to choose from: pirates; forced marriage; endless descriptions that take the reader to...more descriptions.Thankfully, this novel provides a little insight into the mind of both the man and woman in the relationship.

The earlier three books in the series were charming and romantic, if occasionally trite. The conflict in this book makes no sense whatsoever. It is the same major conflict from the previous three books - that is, the appearance of Seth's birth mother. This was resolved in Phillip's story (Inner Harbor), and it makes no sense that Seth would not seek his brothers' help in this matter. With any creativity at all, Ms. Roberts could have come up with a new and different conflict, or simply have concentrated on the love story, which needed work.The two main characters have little chemistry and no reason to be together other than they are both attractive and single and in the same town.Also, Ms. Roberts should avoid tackling subjects on which she is not even remotely educated, such as the art world (not to mention the world of child and family services). Her writing and description of Seth and his work are elementary and baseless. She obviously has no idea what she is talking about, and should have taken a simpler approach to the description of Seth's work as Jennifer Crusie did to her character's work in \\"Faking It.\\"Overall, I was much disappointed especially for paying for this book in hardcover.

I think that inspiration is vitally important to an author's writing, and I would never want them them to feel preassured to write for me. That being said, I was pleased to see a return to the Quinns.I didn't dislike Dru. I will agree that her problems paled in comparison to Seth's past, but almost anyones would have. I never was overwhelmingly convinced of her and Seth's passion. It did all seem a bit convienent. The two, single, attractive people in the small town quickly find each other. And of course, as an artist, he just has to paint her. But oh well. I've heard worse plot twists.I wasn't jumping for joy over Gloria's return into Seth's life, simply because it did seem a bit unrealistic. Drug addicts have psych profiles, and she didn't really fit. Prolonged alcahol and extreme drug abuse would make it hard, if not impossible, for her to mantain the intricate, emotional blackmail she forced on Seth. At some point, her patheticness would have allowed him to take a stand. But that still didn't ruin it for me.Here is what did, and it is a personal problem. After the incredible way being adopted by Stella and Ray saved these guys, NOT ONE OF THESE FAMILES ADOPTED ANY CHILDREN??? REALLY!? Why is it that in our society, we still make adoption seem like a second rate option? Their would be no Chesepeake Bay novels to write about without it. I'm not saying that all the children had to be adopted, or that all the brothers had to adopt. But seeing one of the brothers carrying on the legacy that saved their lives would have been a real tribute to Ray and Stella. Instead, it was only ever treated like a consolation prize in Ethan and Grace'sbook. And he is 'cured' by his love for her, and instead they can have bio kids.

Readers know what will happen within the first 30 pages of her books, but they still clamor to read the numerous mini-series which she has written. In this book, Seth Quinn returns to his home and family on Chesepeake Bay after honing his artistic skills in Paris for several years. He meets a beautiful woman named Dru Whitcomb (on p. 30) and begins his pursuit of her. She has been betrayed by a man she was engaged to and is understandably reluctant to enter another romantic relationship. Seth has his own secrets, especially his dysfunctional mother who haunts him with demands for blackmail money in return for her keeping their sordid past a secret.

Nice romance but the interaction with his family is still the best part. Stella comes back for Seth, which was a nice touch.I also had a hard time with the hardcover. All the others were, let's face it, romances, and paperback is their niche. Also more collectible.

No one writes a family series in romance better than Nora Roberts. My only complaint is that the publisher, looking much too closely at the $$ bottom line, made this a hardback book instead of paperback like the others in this series. My advice to anyone thinking about purchasing this book--DON'T. Borrow it or go to your public library. If you still want to own it, wait until the paperback is released.

Nora Roberts once again writes a great story and I for one, enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Well, almost. Nora's novels are not too sappy, although this one touched the edge.Seth Quinn is coming home,home at last to where the Chesapeake waters of Maryland have always entranced him. The first ten years of Seth Quinn's life were unequivocably awful. Until one day, his knight in shining armor appears, and he is whisked away to the Quinn Boatyard, where he has two older brothers and a sister. He learns of course, that Ray Quinn, his &quot;knight in shining armor&quot; had to use the lure of money to get him, but Ray is portrayed as a saint, and means no harm. He wants to save Seth from a drinking relic of a mother/prostitute before it is too late. Naturally suspicious, Seth Quinn remains so until he is given what he wants most - to never to be returned to his mother. Ray gladly promises. Ray dies soon after, but Seth's new family keeps him, and he grows into a promising young man, handsome and smart. From scrawny teen to husky man, he goes to Rome to be a famous painter. And his paintings are a hit, and they do sell, and Seth Quinn does become not quite as famous as he'd liked, but happy for the first time in his life. He is now a skilled and reknowned painter, but the need to escape the city of Rome is pressing. There are dark secrets there. The author makes a strong effort to emphasize how close the Quinn family is. There are Quinn family sayings and Quinn family rituals and all in the spirit of fun. By now, &quot;Boats by Quinn&quot; is a famous industry. Predictably, boy meets girl, meaning Seth does meet a woman who has just opened a flower shop in town. She finds him pushy but &quot;when a Quinn wants something, he gets it&quot;. Yet an ominous and sinister path follows Seth, a real life haunting of sorts, one he cannot seem to lose. Will his new lady find out? And if she does, will she still want him? Will anyone want him? Maybe it is &quot;a Quinn thing&quot;. Only the reader will know for sure."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is the first time i read this author's novel by some recommendation and this will be the last time.Don't even know what to say about this book. The plot and characters are beyond shallow and boring. There is no build-ups, logic, don't even mention any kind of climax. It is just horrendously boring! A 200-page long rubbish!!! Can't believe i wasted my time on it."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This is the fourth book in the Bay series and I loved it....It was my favorite series by Roberts and I was happy to see that she decided to write about Seth. I do agree a little with someone who had written a review that they just couldn't picture Seth being older. I did have somewhat of a hard time with the fact that Seth was all grown up but then again it was great to know about his life and to see what he had done with it so far....It was also great to see how all the other Quinn brother and their wives ended up....It was an overall great book that I really enjoyed and would urge others to read the series first then Chesapeake Bay....I think you would really enjoy reading this one after you have the full background first!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Seth Quinn is back in St. Chris on Maryland's eastern shore. After a couple of years in Europe, he's a rich and celebrated artist. But now he is home--with his family, the family business, and the curse that has followed him over the years since he was a young boy. His mother is blackmailing him, doing her best to spoil everything for him--and for the family that gave him everything. Although he's all grown up now, he'll still pay her off, do just about anything to protect the brothers who raised him.Drucilla Whitcomb Banks has fled a cheating fiance and the life of the outrageously rich in Washington D.C. to strike out on her own in St. Chris. She owns a flower shop and does her best to fit into the community. Given her experience with men, she doesn't want to fall in love--doesn't even want to date. But Seth Quinn can be as convincing as any of the Quinn men and Dru finds herself spending time with Seth despite what she promises herself.Author Nora Roberts writes a compelling emotional story. Both Dru and Seth are damaged by their families and upbringing--damaged in ways that make it hard for either to commit, and in ways that make it hard to open up and trust anyone. Even supernatural help from Seth's adoptive grandmother (who had died before he was adopted) seems unable to do the job. Yet only if the two can overcome their upbringing can they find happiness with each other--or with themselves.Fans of the earlier novels in this series will joy in seeing Cam, Phil, and Ethan again--each with a growing swarm of children who are now growing up. Nora Roberts can't write a bad book and CHESAPEAKE BLUE is a page-turning read. I would have liked to see a little more threat from Gloria--after all, one woman doesn't have a chance against the entire Quinn clan--ghosts and all--and I would have liked to see more of a resolution of Dru's issues. Still, BLUE works as a story and delivers an emotional wallop."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"One admission: I haven't read the rest of the series (or any other Nora Roberts, for that matter), so I can only review this as a stand-alone novel, not as part of the saga.Without the benefit of knowledge of the family background, I found Seth's big \\"conflict\\" to be totally ludicrous and unbelievable. It just did not make sense that he would find himself in such a thin predicament. Perhaps if I understood the history I would feel its gravity differently.To compound matters, I also simply did not find Seth very likeable. His arrogance and overbearing nature (particularly during interactions with Dru, the leading lady) were extremely unappealing, and made me fully doubt the plausibility of the romance. It just seemed totally forced and absurd. Seth was ok when alone with family members, but when with Dru, I found him to be fairly revolting.The pacing of the novel also seemed off. Despite all reason, the couple found themselves together fairly early on. There was no tension to sustain me to the end. I kept waiting for a \\"real\\" conflict, but none ever materialized. The story as a whole felt hollow and fairly pointless to me.Again, if this fulfilled a burning desire to read about Seth, I might feel more positive about it. Yet it's equally possible that I would feel even more cheated."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Let me first say that I loved this series by Nora Roberts. It was one of my favorite series to read! That being said this fourth book in the series isn't worth your time. This book was nothing like the first three books. I was so excited to read this one because it is about Seth and you get to see how things turn out for him. I was very disappointed. I didn't like the women he falls for...and didn't think they had much chemistry at all. I actually quit reading this book in the middle of it because I was so bored and started another book. I came back to it a few months later and finished it out of obligation to finish the series and know how it ends. It was painful though and I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I was incredibly excited to read about Seth. It started out great. I was like WOW, Seth is an adult. It was weird. I loooooved him as a kid, so it was definitely hard to adjust to him as an adult, and I'm not entirely sure this is how I thought he would turn out, ya know? Like the physical and personality descriptions just weren't what I thought for him. I loved reading about the Quinns and their children. Cute, cute, cute. But then he met Drusilla, and I was instantly BLECH about the book. First of all, I hate that name. That was the name of a crazy, evil vampire on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" so I couldn't get that out of my head. But mainly, she was soooooooooooo uninteresting and unlikable as a character. Together, they were even more unlikable, and I kept checking the inflap hoping that this wasn't the heroine, that this was a sidetrack or something. So when Dru mentioned his connection to Aubrey, I was like YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally!!! Here comes the real romance, the one I actually want to read about. I was giddy and actually got into the book, but nope. That didn't work out. I thought Roberts had set up a Seth/Aubrey romance since the first book, and I was very disappointed that that's not what happened. Plus, Gloria is back in the picture, and she's been blackmailing him for 14 years??? UGH. I thought we solved all of that in Phillip's book, but apparently not??? HMMMM."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Nora Roberts has the ability to make you fall completely in love with her characters! I was thrilled when I heard that she had decided to write Seth's story as well. This books is just as good as the previous ones in this series. I love the fact that we also get to meet Cam, Ethan and Phil's families. Nora Roberts has become one of my favorite authors, and because the first NR books I read was the Quinn books, they will always be my favorites from her."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"After globetrotting for several years succesful artist Seth Quinn has finally returned home to his beloved family. He finds nothing much has changed since he left.His family is a little older but still tightly knit and boisterous as ever. However, one thing did change in his absence.The sleepy town of St. Chris has a new resident, the mysterious and reserved Drusilla Whitcomb Banks.Dru is the daughter of a wealthy and powerful Washington family and because of her family's wealth and connections she has learned the hard way the perils of letting people get too close and personal. So, while Seth is instantly smitten with her she tries to keep him at arms length. But Dru did not count on being so attracted to the sinfully handsome and extremely charming Seth and she had no idea how determined he could be. Before long she finds she can't stop thinking about him and his wonderful family. She is utterly charmed with the down to earth, affectionate Quinns. Although at first she feels like a fish out of water with such a large, loud, outspoken family so different from her own but she is soon regarded as Seth's girl and so therefore a part of the family. Dru has no idea what to do with that and the dangerous feelings Seth is awakening in her, feelings she swore she would never allow herself to feel for anyone again. On the other hand, Seth does not question his feelings for Dru but someone from his past reappears in his life threatening his family and because of his connection to him, Dru herself.I thought it would be hard to pick a favorite book from an author with such an impressive backlist. But after reading this book it was actually very easy. This book is just an absolute joy to read. Seth is sweet, charming, sensitive and doesn't suffer from the emotional constipation that so many romance heroes seem to be afflicted with. What I mean is that Seth is open about his felings for Dru from the start and readily admits his love for her and that is indeed a rare treat for me. On the other hand, Dru was a little harder to like at first and this is a problem I have with many of Roberts heroines. In my opinion they tend to come across as too self contained and aloof and at the beginning of the book Dru seemed to exhibit those annoying qualities. However, as the story progresses Dru slowly sheds the icy facade layer by layer and little by little the reader discovers the reasons for her coolness towards Seth and by the end it is a delight to see her transformation into a warm and loving woman. So, in the end I loved Dru as much as Seth. Finally, what I loved even more that Seth and Dru's perfect love was revisiting the awesome, larger than life Quinn family. Roberts has such a rare gift for realistically portraying the intricate dynamics of family and male bonding and as a result she makes her characters come alive and seem so real to the reader.The scenes with the Quinn family and the interactions between Seth and his brothers are priceless.I had absolutely no quibbles with this book at all so I consider this book a perfect read in every way. In case there's any doubt I highly recommend Chesapeake Blue and while I think the book is stand alone I strongly suggest reading the first three books (Sea Swept, Rising Tides, Inner Harbor) in order to appreciate the perfection that is this book. :0)"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I am a true fan of Nora Roberts and I have always enjoyed all of her books, but this one is one that I have fallen for. I enjoyed the original trilogy, Sea Swept with Cam and Anna their passion and incredible strength. In Rising Tides, with Ethan and Grace and their unconditional love and pride, and Inner Harbor with the classy unselfish love that Phillip and Sybil share. Chesapeake Blue finds Seth all grown up and has taken all the good qualities of each of the brothers and has become a wonderful and very sexy young man. I found myself feeling like I was a part of this little town and was so sad when it ended. I would love to step back into St Cris and see Aubry find that Quinn love with Will. You will not be dissapointed with this one."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Normally when you read an unexpected add on book to a trilogy it disapoints. This one does not.The characters were just as rich and well defined as always. Seth comes back home all grown up, and while the story definately focuses on him and his dealings with the very icky Gloria and the way she has used his feelings for the rest of the Quinn's against him, it also gives a good romance, and my favorite part, we get very updated with the rest of the Quinns. Mostly Cam and Anna, (which was my favorte couple).As you get to know their children, I can see more stories in the future with a new generation of Quinns.Nora did a great job of filling in what has happened since we left off with them when Seth was 13 or so. We touch base with everyone, and see what a great guy he has turned into.Also, while the ghost of Ray used to visit the boys as they fell in love, this time we get to meet their mom \\"Stella\\". She is wonderful.Can't say enough good things. If you liked the Sea Swept series, buy this right away. If you love the continuing series you should check out J.D. Robb aka Nora Roberts futuristic series \\"In Death\\", or any of her MacGregor, Calhoun, or Stanislaski silouhette books. O.k., lets face it, you just can't go wrong w/a Nora book. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Be forwarned Ms. Roberts, readers will now clamour for Aubrey's story. Or Emily's, Deke's, Jake's, Kevin's, Bram's and/or Fiona's. The sequel held true to the characters is the first three books in this series. Less predictible than I thought it would be. I wished it was more, I don't know, just more. The disappointment in continuing stories is that the reader wants to know what happened to all the previous characters in DETAIL, which there isn't room for while telling the primary character's stories. Still, the book was good, typical Nora, in that you love the characters, faults - of which there are not many and slight - and all. Wished for a different ending, the opportunity for the protagonist to self destruct was there, I think. Still a 4 star rating."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"This book is a wonderful addition to the trilogy. Nora Roberts really knows how to spin a wonderful tale of love and drama with out losing depth. This book is a great example of that.

If you love Nora Roberts (and I don't know anyone who does'nt) you wil love this book."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I love this book!

What can I say about this book \\"Chesapeake Blue\\" We waited 8 years for Seth's story to be told and the wait was sure worth it. I loved it!!!! I loved catching up with Ethan, Philip and Cam, he is still my favorite brother. Reading Seth's story, made me want to wrap my arms around him and tell him everything is going to be OK. Seth has it all he has a family that means the world to him. he is an artist, and he's in love with Dru, who owns a flower shop. Seth's Mom Gloria comes into down and wants more money from Seth, since he moved away from Chesapeake Blue, he has paid off Gloria, with the money he has made with his paintings, he will do anything to protect his family from her but he's afraid that by protecting his family he will lose them at the same time. He has to find within himself to be the man that his brothers brought him up to be, it is such a touching story. I know that Nora Roberts is pleased with herself knowing that Seth's story has been finally told.

There hasn't been a romantic book by Roberts that I haven't read at least twice. I feel like I know the Quinn family as well as I know the MacGregors. This book was highly anticipated and worth the time! I never cry about books, but this story sparked tears six, yes six (I know I am a sap)times. I loved it and I can't wait until readers bother Nora enough for Aubrey's story. I am certainly not satisfied with the little bits about her and Will McLean!"},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"I must confess that I just knew that Seth and Aubrey's affection for one another in the original trilogy would roll into something more in their adult years. Perhaps if the age gap had been shorter. However, I really really liked how Seth turned out so strong and confident in his talents and as a man. But I guess with brothers like Cam, Ethan,and Philip, it couldn't be any other way. And I must say that I was pleased to see so much of the characteristics of Phillip in Seth (fine taste and an appreciation for delicate lingerie) since he is and was my favorite Quinn. Well, since Aub's out, I'm glad Seth ended up with Dru, for whom I developed a little admiration. She did make a nice break from the fold to make her own mark. If I can't fault her for that, I certainly can't fault her falling for Seth."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Wonderful story - continues the grasp Nora Robert holds her readers in.

I have read the 1st 3 books of the Chesapeake series by Nora Roberts in which the main character of this book, Seth, was a 10 - 11 year old boy. I was so excited to get this book to finish the series as I had read the first chapter found at the end of my copy of &#34;Sea Swept&#34;. I absolutely loved the first three books and fell in love with the 4 brothers, Seth being the youngest of the brothers. Seth didn't seem true to the character developed in the first 3 books. He was weak. All the other characters remained true to form. Seth was a boy & Aubrey was 1-2 years old in the first 3 books and her grown up character was much more true to form than Seth's character."},{"Title":"Chesapeake Blue (Chesapeake Bay Series)","review":"Chesapeake Blue - Nora Roberts is a brilliant storyteller and I particularly like her family sagas.

This is an alphabetical list of many standard abbreviations along with a very short explanation. It is explained in the introduction that the book is not intended to be a complete list of all the abbreviations one would encounter in their own local research. The book does not instruct nor is it useful to determine the proper abbreviations to use in your own work. However, if you come upon unidentifiable abbreviations in your family history research, this book may just have the answer you seek. Entries such as lp (local preacher) and Twif (traveler's wife) will be helpful if you need that information, but if you don't know what a &quot;stoker&quot; (stkr) is, this won't tell you. It is not a dictionary but rather a basic list, yet a very valuable list if you're completely stumped as to the meaning of an abbreviation in your genealogical research. It is also valuable as you read through the list as it will help give you a sense of the ways words were abbreviated which may help you decipher more local abbreviations not listed specifically in this book. I would like to have seen more detailed explanations, many more abbreviations listed, and a reverse index. However, for the many abbreviations and acronyms contained, it contains information you will not readily find anywhere else. If you regularly get into historical documents in your family research, you are likely to find this compilation beneficial."},{"Title":"Military Recruiting: How to Build Skills, Get Results, Adapt to the Mission, and Sustain Success","review":"I've only read a small portion of this book so far considering I just got my hands on it yesterday, but I can tell you that I am very excited to discover that it is every bit what I was hoping for!

However, the extension of this concept is largely ignored and it was definitely in need of some revision.

The author of this book sits firmly in the latter group, which begs the question, \\"Why did he write this?\\" He is quick to point out the faults of Dostoevsky's major works, but then trips over his words and arguments in meager attempts to describe the positive attributes. Indeed, if I were to base my opinion of Fyodor Mikhailovich and his works solely on this book, I would be quick to label him a neurotic right-wing nut job who couldn't write his way out of a paperbag.

In each case it was clearly a struggle, it was not easy, but they managed.I say the collection of people is extraordinary because it contains far more than just the musicians that seem to get all the press.

These twenty-three anecdotes of experience, strength, and hope are honestly shared and leave no doubt that this debilitating illness cannot only be overcome, but it can also give one purpose and meaning in life when it is overcome.Recovering alcoholics and addicts have to deal with their addiction every single day of their lives, one day at a time. That's why congressman Jim Ramstadt was told, \\"...the only time you're going to be a recovered alcoholic is when they put you in the casket...\\" We can recover, but we'll never be recovered. Writer Annie Lamott was told that we addicts have a fifty-five-gallon drum of shame and self-loathing and nastiness that we want to tip over and get rid of as soon as we start to recover. But it doesn't work that way. We can only take out a teaspoon at a time with prayer, meditation, and working the steps.The story I related to the most was by Dick Beardsley who famously battled Alberto Salazar in the 1982 Boston Marathon only to lose by seconds. A series of accidents left him addicted to opiate pain medication. His addiction became so powerful that this otherwise, upstanding, law-abiding, beloved member of the community began forging prescriptions until he was caught by the feds. He was initially very resistant to treatment because he falsely believed he could beat his addiction with willpower, something a runner of his stature would have no shortage of. But if it was about willpower, he never would have become addicted in the first place.My favorite story, and the one I was most surprised to see in this book, was by broadcaster Glenn Beck. He spoke about overcoming one obstacle that I've recently come to realize is key to my recovery and success in life - overcoming fear. He says, \\"If you just drop your fear of something that you think you can't face, then it isn't real anymore. It may look real but it's not. You'll come through the fear and it's beautiful.\\" He says we're all alike in hiding something. Whatever it is, we think if everyone knew it, then we'd be thought of as inferior and hated. But since everyone is hiding something out of fear, it doesn't make us inferior, just human. If you hide something out of fear, that card can always be played against you. It's best to get it out, and deal with it, so that it no longer has power.These stories, also be Alice Cooper, Steve Earle, Mariette Hartley, Paul Williams, Malachy McCourt, Richard Pryor, Grace Slick and many more, are just plain beautiful. The ability of the human spirit to overcome such a dreadful, often fatal illness is inspiring and fills me with much hope. And according to a recent survey, there are 22.6 million Americans suffering from addiction who would do well to read this book.David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"The Harder They Fall: Celebrities Tell Their Real-Life Stories of Addiction and Recovery","review":"Great because it focuses much of each celebrity's story on the solution andhow each stays sober one day at a time."},{"Title":"The Harder They Fall: Celebrities Tell Their Real-Life Stories of Addiction and Recovery","review":"Great item, great service!

Really appreciate the great item and service!"},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"One of our finest modern short novels, Lewis's &quot;Wife&quot; is a mostly unrecognized classic. Noted by many top authors for her incisive, spare, sparkling style, Lewis tackles some of the greatest moral and spiritual issues of mankind in this little piece. The prose is impeccable (you could learn how to write by imitating it), the story haunting, and the &quot;message&quot; deeply profound, moving, as well as important to the modern age. At heart, this novel is about the decision of a young woman of petty nobility in 16th century Languedoc to deny her happiness in behalf of her moral and spiritual convictions. It presents a seemingly small dilemma that will bother you and keep you thinking about the meaning of life and the foundations of your convictions for years to come. I won't say more, because there is a touch of the mystery novel in this work. Lewis is a minor master of prose fiction, probably mostly ignored because she was the wife of the great and highly controversial poet and critic Yvor Winters, who is one splendid writer himself. Her other novels are just as fine, with &quot;The Trial of Soren Qvist&quot; probably being one of the greatest modern novels. Evan O'Connell and Larry McMurtry are two of Lewis's chief admirers, by the way, though that might not say much depending on your view of those fellows."},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"Janet Lewis has written a fine modern novella. This is a haunting story and its message is deeply profound and moving, as well as important to our modern age. Bertrande as the \`Wife' is a classic representation of the dominated female in a patriarchal society. Lewis tackles some of the greatest moral and spiritual issues of mankind in this little piece.The novella explores the theme of Truth vs. Expediency (doing what's convenient) and tells the true story of a young woman's struggle in 16th century France, to deny her happiness in behalf of her moral and spiritual convictions, or to deny the truth. It presents a controversial dilemma that will bother the reader and yet keep us thinking about the meaning of life and the foundations of our convictions long after we have finished reading it.\\"Madame, I would have you still deceived\\"...I studied this text for my year 12 and I wish it were more widely recognised."},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"I discovered this book in the 60's, as an out-of-print original, and remember it vividly, it being one of those stories that has an impact on your moral and ethical development. The heart-tugging crux of the tale is one woman's battle between the ethics of the time (which she embraced) and personal happiness. When these two conflicted, she chose the prevailing \\"moral\\" attitude that set in motion the events leading to the vivid ending.I was young when I first read it, and admired the heroine greatly for her largeness of conscience, and felt sharply the sting of her husband's cruel unforgiveness, even in the face of her doing the \\"right thing\\". I wanted to be like her, following my convictions even in the face of public censure. But I look at it differently now.While I still feel the husband showed a hardness of heart cruel even for the day in applying the letter of the law towards his wife, I now feel the wife too sacrificed the imposter she loved to that same moral/ethical law. She hoped to be saved by the system of moral expungement of the time, but was instead destroyed by it. Of course, when the karmic balance is made, hers was the higher moral ground, as she wished to be saved by the moral codes of the day, while the husband merely used them.What is valuable about this story is that it is able to hook you so well you emotionally participate in the agonizing choices and ending, so you actually feel the repercussions of those choices, and are able to learn the lessons from this little tale. The fact it is based on truth gave it an extra potency. It really is a story that resonates within you for a long time. You are forced to consider what you would do in the same situation, and what for you is the purest \\"right\\" thing to do.I would recommend this for anyone, and is a good introduction for younger people to the power, consequences and higher consciousness of moral/ethical convictions. Plus, it's very easy to read."},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"This is an easy read, but one that will stay with a reader long after the final page. What struck me upon finishing it is how it really forces one to examine identity in fiction. For instance, the work throughout largely explores how Martin Guerre's wife struggles to identify (and identify with) her husband. She is clearly drawn to be the center of the story. However, towards the end of the book, there is a shift and one realizes that, while she may be the center, she also has to react to others and their equally important decisions about self."},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"I read this book for my English class. It was interesting and I love it. I could not put it down until I finished it.(^_^)"},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"With her very short novel, Lewis offers a model of economical storytelling.This true tale is famous enough. In the sixteenth century, Martin Guerre leaves the family farm in southern France escaping his father's wrath and perhaps seeking adventure. Years later, a man claiming to be Martin returns. He is changed but convinces the abandoned wife and family that he is truly Martin. After three years, he is accused of imposture and convicted. Just as his conviction is about to be overturned on appeal, the real Martin dramatically reappears, the impostor's guilt is confirmed, leading to his execution.Lewis adapts many of the facts. For one thing, she underplays the role of Pierre, Martin's uncle, in the accusation and she presents Bertrande, Martin's wife, as the chief accuser. Lewis never mentions Bertrande's mother, who in real life was married to Martin's uncle Pierre, and who played a large part in the actual events. But this is a novel, not a historical essay. In the end, we see more sharply into human nature than we would were the novel more accurate.Lewis demonstrates her artistry in the resolution, when the last shred of doubt is lifted from Bertrande's heart. Martin's father is a just but stern and autocratic man. Early in the book, his authority causes him to strike Martin and break two teeth; the event later comes up as evidence supporting the impostor's claim since he has the same two teeth broken. The same stern and pitiless authority causes Martin to leave the farm as he fears his father's anger for taking some seed without permission. Finally when Martin reappears at the end of the appeal, he refuses to forgive Bertrande claiming that she should have known the impostor from the start. He shows her the same pitiless character his father showed him.Brilliantly, with one single trait (lack of pity) Lewis establishes two plot devices (the identifying teeth and the reason for leaving) she defines two supporting characters (the father and the son) and she develops the main character (Bertrande) when she realizes she has lost the love of her real husband. A lesser writer would simply have explained it all in so many words, as I just did.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Wife Of Martin Guerre","review":"I read this book for my English class.

It's a story about a widow and her six-year-old son (who is a real scene-stealer, and just simply adorable and HILARIOUS), who must catch a ride with a nobleman to a christmas gala.

It was the best of the lot but I don't think I will be seeking out the author's backlist. The plot was clever and I thought it was good but I could not warm to the H/H although the little boy was not too terribly obnoxious. Getting the ankle-biters right in romance (both contemporary and modern) is difficult. It is interesting to note that the owner of the UBS was contacted by one of the major US romance publishers and asked her what annoyed her customers most about current romance publishing. She told them that overwhelmingly, readers are fed up by &quot;baby&quot; books. Well, damn right!Anyway, getting back to the book, the problem here for me was that the heroine acted with immaturity and silliness when she should have behaved like an adult. Unfortunately, the hero was unable to provide for me, as the reader, that spark of attraction that is so necessary. If the reader can't find something to admire, lust after or just simply sympathise with in the hero, a romantic novel becomes a bit of a chore.An OK read but not anywhere near a keeper."},{"Title":"Every Secret Thing : My Family, My Country","review":"A great read that poses the difficult question: what ought to come first--one's children, or one's cause? Especially challenging when the cause is the end of apartheid. Gillian Slovo is bitter that she didn't have her parents because they were busy trying to free South Africa. Understandable from an individual point of view, but the contribution of the Slovos to the anti-apartheid movement was invaluable. I don't know the correct answer to the question, but I do know that this is a good and engaging tale."},{"Title":"Every Secret Thing : My Family, My Country","review":"This book is very well and sensitively written. It gives a very vivid picture of Ruth First and Joe Slovo, two very strong willed people who were dedicated to the anti apartheid struggle in the dark years of apartheid in the last 40 years before the first democratic elections in 1994.Here we get a true picture of how ths couple had sacrificed their family life for what they had believed in and how this had effected their relationship with their eldest daughter (the author). One cannot help but empathize with the author who makes no bones about the neglect that her parents had towards her relationship with them and how she truly wanted to know more about her parents who were rather secretive towards her.The book makes very exciting reading. My main criticism is that there is a tendency to jump backwards and forwards in the past. There seems to be a problem of continuity of style as passed anecdotes are retold at different stages in this biography.There is also a tendency to repetition. This tends to marr a rather good book which is recommended to all those who are interested in the history of the freedom struggle in South Africa."},{"Title":"Every Secret Thing : My Family, My Country","review":"i only read a small portion of Every Little Thing - having sat sobbing throughout A World Apart - the poignant movie version.i followed the comings and goings of both joe slovo and ruth first, and was myself in exile in lestho, when father john osmond had his hand blown off by parcel bomb; in detention, when albie sachs had his hand blown off in moambique; under restriction back in johannesburg, when ruth was assisinated in moambique; in my second stint in exile in botswana when jeannette and katryn schoon were murdered by parcel bomb in angola.the pathos deliverered in A World Apart wrenched my insides apart, for many of the questions gillian had for her father, my own daughter - separated from me being in exile - she in johannesburg, she pleaded me for, for clear answers. her young enquiring mind was never satiated with whatever i had to proffer.the sad thing about these situations is that we have no clear answers - no magic solution, for when gross injustices prevail within a \\"civilised\\" society, some of us who heed the call - take up the challenge to right these inhumane wrongs. we are forced to forgo our own comforts and loved ones. the call of the multitudes, far exceeds those of our own personal loved ones; for we reach/strive for that day, when all our children - black, white, brown or yellow will be able to live as proud children under one free and democratic governement. only then will we all be opportuned to live out their dreams and aspirations as proud citizens of the world - an integral part of humanity ...and it was this message that tore at my gut, my heart ... my troubled mind - that made me feel a little more proud of the many sacrifices so many of us were forced to endure. that our children and loved ones had to be denied our love and support and guidance that we as responsible adults/parents should have been fulfilling, can never be repayed; for within our offspring, the emptiness of both parents being there for them - when most needed has come and gone ..."},{"Title":"Every Secret Thing : My Family, My Country","review":"Having lived for some years in South Africa when younger, and having heard Jo Slovo and Ruth First spoken of in unflattering terms (to say the least), I was intrigued to read their daughter's memoir. The picture painted of her parents is a lively, generally engaging one; I almost got to like Joe and Ruth, who emerge from their demonic legends as real, fallible but certainly brave people.Yes, the tone of the book is occasionally petulant and self-centred, but one has to accept that it is a personal record, not an objective historical account. That said, certain things grated. One was the completely uncritical stance adopted towards the ANC, which is portrayed as a simple, virtuous, heroic organization fighting the good fight. The fight may have been good, but the ANC was compromised at every level, infiltrated by spies, dominated ideologically by the communist party (that was where Joe Slovo came in) and on record as having supported the Soviet invasions of Hungary and Chekoslovakia (so much for democracy and the will of the people).Another thing that grated was Gillian Slovo's continuing indignation, bordering on disbelief, that the SA government liquidated her mother in Mozambique in 1982. Was this in any way surprizing? Ruth First and her husband were committed revolutionaries, dedicated to the overthrow of the state, if necessary by violence. What did Gillian expect the SA government to do? Send Ruth roses on her birthday? You live by the sword, you die by the sword - or explosives, in Ruth's case.Four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Every Secret Thing : My Family, My Country","review":"Gillian Slovo is unapologetic in her rather petulant story of a neglected childhood. While her parents pursued Communism and pushed against the apartheid government of South Africa, all the while earning a good income with her father's lawyering, she and her sisters suffered especially her ambitious mother's indifference, imprisonment and lack of home life \\"quality time\\".Ruth First, daughter of Polish Jews, ambitious in her own right and extremely intelligent and sharp-tongued, married Joe Slovo, also Jewish, of Russian origin, with struggling parents. It was a climb up for him, with the steady rise of his income as a lawyer in post-WWII South Africa under white rule. His children lived well, enjoyed the blacks as servants, and attended private schools. The parents ran hither and to as Communists tend to do.What makes this book uncommonly candid from a red is that the daughter, while unequivocally defending her parents' \\"struggles\\", openly begrudges their self-absorption and cause-related time-consuming party activities. When her parents become wanted criminals, the father escapes over the border and the mother ultimately goes to prison. Understandably, our writer, the daughter Gillian, is annoyed. She and her siblings avoid mentioning their parents in any of their schools, but her Russian-Jewish name betrays their origins, their parents' political proclivities, and brands the daughters as traitors.The inside battle of any political movement will always take its toll on the activists' children. This part of the book is almost comical in its self-centeredness, but we all can relate if we have had parents with any reasons for indifference or neglect.What I enjoyed was reading how her parents had come to such political ideas, why they dove in to the blacks' cause so valiantly, and how they throve on the injustice to others. When push came to shove, the mother takes the daughters to England, since the Communists and others of their ilk have made South Africa a blood bath for whites. To this day, the nonblacks of that country are fleeing in huge numbers, not the least of which are the descendants of the persecuted Jews of Russia and Poland, who classify themselves as \\"white\\", yet still oppressed in spite of great economic priviledge.The effect of Communist ideas on emerging nations has been catastrophic, but rare is the book that tells openly how devious and traitorous its proponents can be. The end result always seems to send them scurrying out of the nation in which they had once prospered, to go to yet another free nation and stir up further unrest.Rest assured that they would not move into a black neighborhood in England or America, no matter their anti-apartheid views!Thanks to Gillian Slovo for revealing the inside scoop on these infamous Reds."},{"Title":"To Ireland, I (Clarendon Lectures in English Literature)","review":"I am bemused and rather disappointed with this book. Muldoon uses intertextual associativeness to generate wonderful poems -- touching, comic, and stylistically breath-taking. Here he uses the same method in a critical rhapsody that links together a galaxy of Irish literary texts and legends, arranged (or disarranged) in alphabetical order. He moves freely and funnily between Gaelic and English, ancient and modern, biographical and textual. The performance is carried off with brio, in a manner that recalls certain experiments in randomness of Roland Barthes. Unfortunately, many of the allusions Muldoon finds are so farfetched as to make one wince as at a bad pun. He circles around Joyce's &quot;The Dead,&quot; adding one or two valid observations to what allusion-hunters have already noted, but otherwise sending readers off on a wild goose chase. Unlike Seamus Heaney, who is a great, authoritative, and highly trained literary critic, Muldoon does not project from his distinctive poetic sensibility a capacious literary critical vision. He flogs to death the idea of &quot;conglomewriting&quot; as a distinctively Irish practice, culminating in Finnegans Wake, but he offers little serious reflection on what the literary value of this practice might be. For that one must turn to works like Gerard Genette's Palimpsestes, which offers a careful and thorough examination of the ancient art of intertextual composition.

Some may already know that Ernest Thompson Seton and Baden Powell were associates who founded the Boy Scouts of America, with Seton being in charge of the American side and Powell in charge of the British side. Their eventual split was much about their different philosophies where Powell's was more about developing a good citizen and Seton was more about developing virtuous character. A problem Aristotle wrestled with as well, and is expressed in the aphorism, \\"What's popular isn't always right, and what's right isn't always popular.\\" Seton lays out his basic philosophy in this book whose main purpose is to develop individual autonomy and character in practical matters of outdoor life and empower the individual with knowledge and skills that will not only make him/her self-sufficient but also valuable to his/her community as a leader and example of individual virtues and skills. One of the ironies is that Powell's \\"Boy Scouts\\" was more popular in Seton's America, while Seton's \\"Woodcraft\\" movement was more successful in Britain than America."},{"Title":"The book of woodcraft","review":"A great book .Written 80+ years ago, still quite valid today.It made my grandson very happy.

He argues that &quot;dissident groups drew on Christian symbols and language to develop a popular, alternative theology . . . which . . . provided impulses for political democratization.&quot; (p.viii) Nonsense. There were Christian-based political movements in the GDR, especially among young people in the early 1980s, however, by 1989, they were for the most part non-existent and played no role in the popular uprising that began in Leipzig during the latter half of 1989. In his discussion of religious symbols, he says that these symbols &quot;gave the groups (protest groups) a strong sense of legitimacy and authority. They were important means of inspiring and empowering people to act on behalf of peace, justice and the environment.&quot; (p.71) An exaggeration. In fact, the churches themselves were quite displeased with the use of various symbols as well as the use of the churches themselves for the purposes of protest. In Leipzig for example, regional church leaders as well as the majority of members of the St. Nicholas Church congregation opposed the Monday evening peace prayers and pressured the local pastor to end the meetings. The protestors themselves cared little for Christian symbols, only that they were able to use the facilities of the church to publicly express their discontent with various government policies, such as the restriction of travel to the West. Aside from Burgess' apologetic explanation of the Churches' role in the &quot;End of Communism,&quot; his description of religious life and church-state relations is quite skewed. For example, he says that &quot;the state was concerned to avoid a politics of confrontation.&quot; (p.3) Actually, the state forced situations of confrontation in order to make the churches capitulate and reduce their &quot;power&quot; in society. On the subject of church finances, he says &quot;While the West German church relied on a state-collected church-tax, the East German church had depended on voluntary contributions.&quot; (p.139) This is simply false. See Robert Goeckel's &quot;The Lutheran Church and the East German State.&quot; Burgess also says that while the West German pastors &quot;were well paid and their congregations could afford to renovate their buildings to the most modern standards, the East German church had learned to live with less.&quot; (p.139) He does not mention, however, that the Lutheran Church spent between 1980 and 1989, over 1 billion West-German Marks on renovations and new buildings in the GDR under a building program called the &quot;Valutasonderbauprogramm.&quot; Overall, Burgess' book is quite disappointing and does not provide an adequate description of religion and its influences in the GDR. He gives entirely too much credit to the church for influencing the fall of the Wall and places too much emphasis on a theology that, for the vast majority of East Germans, was irrelevant."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I was very exited when I stumbled upon this book because my husband and I have been at war with each other on the issues of what type of parenting we wanted to use.

As a mother of a ten-month old son, I thought I would be able to read about positive parenting skills and gather some good information. I was so disappointed and even appalled at this book. I couldn't even get to the second chapter in one sitting. I ended up throwing it across the room.I know that so many people have written about how great this book is and how wonderful the advice is. I wholeheartedly disagree! There are tidbits of advice that can be useful, such as communicating with your children and telling them that \\"it's okay to express negative emotions\\" and \\"it's okay to be different\\". However, tidbits of decent information do not make a good book.If you are looking for alternatives to spanking, then you may want to consider this book. However, if you believe that spanking (not beating or abusing your child) is okay and actually needed for some children, than this book is NOT for you! (The author even states that if you plan to follow his advice precisely, you can't spank your child at all).I am by no means saying that spanking should be the only form of discipline. However, some of the alternatives mentioned in this book are simply laughable. One suggestion is to give your teenager a timeout and tell them, that they are not respecting your feelings. I actually laughed out loud when I read that. I would have lost all respect for my mother if she ever said that to me when I was a teenager. I am only 29 and I know that spanking is not outdated. If my mother would not have spanked me, I would have pushed her to the edge. I am THANKFUL she did so with me. And I can safely say that I am by no means a violent person or a person with low self-esteem.As for the author's opinion of \\"today's children are more sensitive and intelligent therefore, fear-based punishment doesn't work\\", what a crock of psychobabble. My sister-in-law works with juvenile delinquents and troubled teens and counsels them everyday. She says the biggest problem today is lack of discipline. By talking to these kids one on one, she has been able to find out from THEM that they've never had discipline in their homes, nor communication. Some of them even admit, that had they been disciplined they would probably not be in the situations they put themselves in.This book teaches that children learn responsibility from their parents. True. But every scenario the author gives, blames the parent, whether it's the child breaking something or hitting another child. Children need to learn self-control and the ability to take responsibility for their own actions. The author's teachings make excuses for every wrongful act a child commits. When children misbehave it is not always the parents' fault.I could go on and on about other ridiculous scenarios the author presents but I think what I've said thus far should suffice. I sincerely could not recommend this book to anyone. As a matter of fact, you will probably see my copy up for sale pretty soon."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I have never read a book of child-rearing that I disagreed with more.

Moms with many children want consise, simple and workable plans and we want it now!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I saw IMMEDIATE results when i applied the principles of John Gray's &quot;Children are from Heaven&quot; to my 2-year old daughter. Although I was skeptical Gray's techniques would work, not only did my 2-year old respond, but I became a happier, more relaxed, and more confident mother. I finally had an alternative to the &quot;hard&quot; discipline on which I was raised and the &quot;soft&quot; discipline that was obviously not working on my 2-year old. My pediatrician recommended this book to me and I have been spreading the word ever since! Thank you John Gray!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"John Gray's new book is incredible. If you have children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews it's a must. All teachers, administrators, coaches, day care professionals, or anyone at all who works with or comes into contact with children would benefit greatly from reading this insightful book. There are so many ideas, all of which give adults the tools in being successful in raising loving, compassionate, considerate children. In this day and age of teen violence and confusion John Gray has given us hope. This book will affect parentinglike Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus affected relationships. Putting both into practicewill affect many generations to come. What a world we could have. Thank you John for your insight!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book provides some excellent advice to parents in child rearing. I only wish I had this book and knew about postive parenting when my children were first born. I am trying to incorporate the suggestions into dealing with my 13 year old twins boys and my 18 year old daughter. Positive parenting methods are also worthwhile for dealing with adult relationships too.I recommend it to all parents and suggest it as a perfect baby gift."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I have 2 sons ages 11 and 12 and am always on the lookout for sound parenting advice. Thinking I had found it here, I put some of the advice into action. One thing I did was to start using the words &quot;Will&quot; or &quot;Would&quot; when asking my children to do something. For example, &quot;Will you please pick up your room?&quot; and &quot;Would you take out the garbage please?&quot; This was not an easy habit to get into and it took quite some time before I mastered it. When I used this method they would seem to procrastonate and also become defiant. I should have recognized that this was the cause and stopped. After using it for about a year, one day my sister who is a school psycologist said, &quot;Why are you asking them if they will take out the garbage? You should tell them in a polite way.&quot; I couldn't believe the difference it made when I said, &quot;Please take out the garbage.&quot; They just got up and did it. I think by asking them with using will and would made them think they had a choice, (This was Gray's premise. He said that children inherently want to please so they will make the right choice.)but they did not automatically want to please. I think it made them resentful to make it sound like they had a choice when in fact they did not. If I asked them, &quot;Will you pick up your room?&quot;, it was not optional. Now when I want them to do something I tell them politely to do it. After all I am the parent."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"As a counsellor, I have long admired and respected John Gray for his vast and learned knowledge and for his ability as a writer. &quot;Children Are from Heaven&quot; is a beautiful concept. Grey reinforces the power of positive attitudes in the role of parenting. He bases his philosophy on the concepts it is okay to be different(we are all unique individuals,) okay to make mistakes(we learn from our mistakes,) it is okay to express negative emotion (children also have negative feelings,) it is okay to want more(wanting more, incourages children to dream, achieve and reach for the stars,) and it is okay to say,&quot;no&quot; but remember Mom and/or Dad are still the boss (children will test limits, both yours and theirs.)The book contains very accurate and positive information; however, Gray's concept about raising children with a positive attitude is nothing new in our modern-day world. What is extremely disheartening is the fact not all parents understand the importance of, nor do they implement, a nurturing and positive environment for their children. The approach taken here is similar to many found in other professionally written parenting books, except the author has chosen different words and his own unique writing style to relay the concept. I expected to find an expanded version or a new theory in Gray's book but that did not happen. For this reason, the book received a rating of four stars and not five. Regardless of what words are used, the book still contains a valuable message, and it is certainly worth reading...no matter how many times you may have read or heard the message before."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"Gray shares a welcome sensible perspective on raising children of all ages that keeps the parents in complete charge while encouraging the parents to respect and understand the kid's feelings. That does not mean the kids always or even usually get their way. My older children (9, 12 and 15) have told me during our calmer more rational discussions, outside the heat of the moment, that they like the change is MY behavior and they feel more like I'm on their side rather than the enemy on their backs screaming, insulting, and punishing like I used to. The younger kids (4 and 6) also seem to cooperate more when I acknowlege their feelings and then clearly state and stick to the boundaries. We are by no means wimpy parents with our 5 kids; however, we have become more aware of separately addresing feelings from behavior. I find myself much calmer and listening a lot more than I used to. The amazing thing is that my husband and I have stopped much of the yelling, threatening, and searching for an even harsher punishment that wasn't really working anyway. Another book that really is very compatible with Gray's thoughts is called \\"The Pocket Parent\\". It has hundreds of suggestions to try with your 2-5 year old, focusing on most of the annoying behaviors that often drive even the best parent to the edge of their sanity. I highly recommend both books that specifically teach you how to change your behavior first inorder to get more cooperation from the kids."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"You can get the main ideas of this book by reading the back cover, the introduction, or even the table of contents. The rest of the book is very repetitive, with lots of fluff. It's unfortunate, because Gray's message about parenting is an excellent one, and very important in an age where too many parents are neglecting this important aspect.Instead of this book, I recommend How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk by Faber and Mazlish. It is full of practical tips and exercises to help you communicate with your children in a way that is respectful, instructive, and helpful. It will help you build relationships with your children that will bring you all closer together, at the same time as it helps your children develop reliability, compassion, and initiative. It has transformed our family and I recommend it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book has some wonderful theories that I hope to practice,but reading through this book was tedious because of the lack ofediting and repetition. I feel like marking up the book and returning it to the publisher, if only I had time. This book needs to be edited and re-released. Publishing this book in such a state reflects poorly on the Publisher and the Author.I also disagree with the notion that children today are more sensitive than older generations were when they were children. Dr. Gray didn't say much to back up this premise, but I do not believe that this is at all relevant to his message."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. It helps a lot and give you different ideas about the way you are raising your kids. Every parent has their own way of parenting but reading this book is going to make you think about things you might be doing wrong or things you don't know how to do."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book is better than Venus/Mars books. If you're a parent or want to be or are going to be read this. Even if your children are past 'the formative years'--you may someday have grand kids and the same great advise works for them too."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"The main idea in this book is that in order to get your kids \\"to cooperate\\" you should offer them rewards and then, together with some positive thinking that aims to increase their self esteem but sounds a bit unrealistic (\\"it's ok to say no, but Mum is boss\\", \\"it's ok to want more\\", \\"it's ok to make mistakes\\", etc (??)) they will behave because they want to not because you make them. Right, please, tell me that if your kid is really rude to you or your relatives you are going to say \\"it's ok to call your grandmother a fat-ass, it was a mistake, I can see how upset and tired you are from all this lovely kicking that I am getting on my shins... there, there, promise you will apologize and never do it again and say that Mum is boss and I will give you your favourite candy\\". Right?I liked many of the things I found in this book, though, and agreed with a lot of what the author says. The chapter about different types of children according to their personalities and how to best handle them (not with bribes this time) is very useful and interesting. Also, the positive ideas and attitudes towards children do make you think and try to understand your kids better, which is what you aim for, really, when you read books about good parenting. But when I was told that in order to stop my child from causing a scene in a public place \\"where I cannot use the skills learned from the author\\", I should always carry my child's favourite candy to hand it to her in these situations so that she will cooperate, I lost it. I was reading in my kindle, otherwise the book would have flown, I was so angry. I imagined myself all sweet and smiley, eyes twitching madly, after trying these techniques for a few months...\\"Oh, my, are you upset because we are shopping? here is a little candy so that you can keep behaving like a little s*it... it is a reward for terrorizing the cashiers every time we come to the supermarket, darling. I am going to avoid confronting you and your tantrums because I am so embarra...., ahem, letting you get in touch with your inner feelings while I think about ways to kill myself before you turn 12 and do it for me anyway\\". And then the author says that if the child is misbehaving like that you are propably placating them too much at home. Seriously??? And how about motivating your teenagers to behave better and study harder using money as a reward? excuse me? what about the people who simply can't offer their kids more money or shopping trips to the mall because they can't afford it? you can call it what you like but to me this is pure bribing. And spoiling. The author says it always works, and I must admit it probably does, but after a while (talking from experience here) you will find that the rewards will have to get bigger and bigger in order to keep motivating your kids.Also... using candy and other types of unhealthy foods will create kids that as grown-ups will seek confort in food. In bad food. I don't think it takes a shrink to see that.So, a bit of a let down, but not bad. Like I said, there is good stuff in there. But also a lot of... yeah, that's right."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book is excellent and a must read for any parent, or teacher, or anyone who deals with kids on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"Yes, makes you realise what you know I guess.

Parenting is a huge learning experience. I was brought up with a little fear based parenting. I wanted to change that with my children. This book is an easy read and gives great examples of childrens temperments and how to implement positive parenting skills. I have read the book over and over again.

They have 3 very different personalities, and I definitely see ways I can improve my parenting with them by following most of the guidelines in my book. I have realized that spanking is not the way, and it only makes my youngest madder. Positive re-inforcement is much more helpful. I gave the book 4 stars because I don't agree with everyhing the author says - like he doesn't believe that children under the age of 9 need choices - I find giving them choices gives them improved self esteem and a sense of control over their lives. That being said, there are some great ideas in this book I intend to put to use."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I was so excited when I saw this book had been published. My husband and I both read 'Men are from Mars...' and we couldn't believe how right he was about so many things. So, naturally, I was expecting this book to be very insightful. Although this book has some good points, there wasn't much in it that I haven't heard before. I also believe that if this book had been edited (which it clearly hadn't considering the number of typos) it could've been about 150 pages long instead of 350. His ideas were summarized and re-summarized tediously. Lastly, John believes in positive parenting which I also believe in. He repeats throughout his book that fear-based parenting is ineffective, which I also believe. So what I don't understand is why he would suggest &quot;The ideal time out is accomplished when a parent puts a child in a room and holds the door shut. It is a natural expression of resistance for a child to try to get out.&quot; Do you think a little child is not in fear when they are trapped in a room unable to get out??? I don't care if an adult is on the other side or not. We now know that spanking our children can be both psychologically and emotionally scarring. Common sense tells me that containing my little girl in a room by herself while she's pounding on the door to get out or putting her little fingers under it saying 'Please let me out' ALSO is NOT effective parenting."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"this book is absolutely brilliant! it tells us how we should communicate with children with the correct approaches. from the book you'll also know that children can be grouped into four types - sensitive, active, responsible, and receptive. these terms may seem new to you but after reading it you will know that children are from heaven, they are born to be cooperative. well you see, i'm only 18, yet i think this book really teaches me a lot. not only does it provide positive parenting skills, but also everything that you need to know about children. you don't have to be a parent to read Children Are From Heaven. if you like kids, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I was very excited to start using the parenting skills I have learned from this book. Not only did I start using them with my own two children (ages 7 and 11), I started using it in my preschool class. I was amazed at the immediate positive response I received from my own children as well as my preschoolers. I also was given the confidence I needed to use these skills. Most of all the relationship with my children seems to be different and we are so much happier and the stress is also down. I wish I had this book sooner.

I was really amazed by Dr. Gray's insight and the things that he said about communication between children and parents. The methods he introduces here are very different from those that I use in my home, but I am seeing a real difference in my children by using them...and I'm only on chapter three. I highly recommend this book if you are looking to do things differently. If you don't want to do the work, it won't help you. It will require a significant...but fruitful...commitment in order to achieve success."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I absolutely loved this book and I'm reading it for the second time.

It's great!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book has a wonderful message for parents. It is too bad the book is tediously repetitive and has obvious editing errors. It was encouraging to get support for not being on the logical/natural consequences bandwagon; my sensitive child responded with feelings of negative self-worth when she experienced such consequences. It is also nice to be encouraged to be loving and supportive of your children and not be accused of spoiling them or making them too dependent on you. It is truly unfortunate more time was not taken to make the material more presentable."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I see this book as a third pillar in a self-help trilogy from Dr. Gray together with \\"How to get what you want...\\" and \\"...Together forever\\". The book reveals to a great extent how a person's childhood and adolescence affect his perceptions about life, and the way he raises up his children later. I have seen parents who followed 2 or 3 skills out of the five that Dr. Gray mentioned, but not all five. That implied either \\"soft\\" or \\"hard\\" parenting which ARE negative methods. But the way stipulated in that book, from my prospective, is really THE positive way! My uncle has raised up his son in a way very close to Gray's method, and now he has a World Champion in Karate with very high self-esteem! I am longing for the next gem from you Dr. Gray! Well done!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"It seems like a book that was written in a rush. There are even typos in the book (he uses &quot;where&quot; instead of &quot;were&quot; and other spell check glitches...). Seems elementary. I couldn't read more than the first half and then I put it down. I was hoping for something insightful, but just got a dozen theories all jumbled into one book without much explanation."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"This book could definitely use some editing, but the ideas are wonderful. Even better, he gives actual scenarios and things to say to your children - actual steps to follow. I've been using the tips with my 2-year-old son, and it has worked wonders. So far, my son has confirmed all the things Dr. Gray says about children. A wonderful guide to the most difficult and most important job in the world!"},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"The need of the hour is 'Positive Parenting' and this is exactly what John Gray, the author gives a message in this book. Not only the western new age free world is facing parental problems but Indian culture is also on a shift notion to face challenges tackling parental challenges. The five messages and the wise advice of the author makes it very clear to follow by parents to get the parenting skills. Love base parenting accepts kids with their negative emotions, desires and needs, being different but setting reasonable limits and making the kids aware that they are to be respected is the message flow in the book. Children are innocent and born with a difference and needs rewarding and not punishment. They need to co-operate and both parents and kids need to build a close bond to pull out of parental stress, kids stress and the crisis hovering over parental and kids issues. A good pick by a gem author."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I started to read this book and it lost my interest quick!

Lots of repetition. Nothing really specific and nothing really new. He even uses the concept of Positive Parenting like he invented the term, which has been used by Jane Nelson for years. There are many other better, more concise and more specific books out there."},{"Title":"Children Are from Heaven : Positive Parenting Skills for Raising Cooperative, Confident, and Compassionate Children","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews that the book was a little repetitve, but I did not mind. I have a 8, 4, & 2 yr old. They are all so different in what they need and what motivates them. This book really helped me to realize what each of them really needed to feel happy and loved. I never realized how much my oldest was NEEDING more affirmation and one on one time. He has always been the big helper and the one I could count on to help him self. In the book Dr. Gray talks about the age of when a child should still be, and feel like he is completely taken care of, and I was suprised. I may have been asking way too much of him. My son was exhibiting signs of ADHD and was eventually diagnosed. Implementing these positive messages I have been able to take him off of medication and I have such a wonderful relationship with him now that I feel will continue through out his teen years. This book reviews common, well intentioned lectures and plans that some of us parents come up with and what they may be doing- (the opposite of what you intented them for) I was most certainly guilty of it. The plans seem to really open up the kids and bring out an extra ounce of joy to their smile.Obviously, I recommend it. Especially if your children may seem frustrated, distracted, and you think you have done everything the right way- read this book and give it another try. I hope that it will bring you this much peace.

The main reason is because not only I can appreciate each singing, but also I can enjoy the connections between those seeming isolated singing by soloists and the chorus. That's due to my pastor recommended three books on Messiah. This book, written by a theology professor and Messiah singer, is both theological strong and passionately written--good for both the mind and the soul, the brain and the heart. Many parts of the book can be incorporated into sermons I believe. As the title suggests, this book is written in style of biblical and systematic theology by connecting the various of Bible passages from both Old and New Testaments. To me, it also posses a covenant theology bent-to string the whole Bible, in this case, Messiah (gospel according to Handel's oratorio) from point of God's everlasting covenant with His people. My pastor informed me that in fact covenant theology was strong in 18th century.Through this book not only I can appreciate much better what I am singing, I also admire how much Messiah's librettist and Handel know their Bible, and how much God's Word was such strong foundation in the culture of that age!"},{"Title":"Wyoming place names","review":"This book is a fascinating study of the origins of the place names in Wyoming.

Fukuyama bases almost all of his ideology off of Hegel and Kojeve, a modern Hegel scholar from Czech Republic. I love history yet have found Hegel incomprehensible and too dense to even consider buying one of his tomes - for people who are interested in history or the idea of dialectics, read this book. Fukuyama explains Hegel while placing him in the context of liberal democratic government - Fukuyama follows Kojeve's assertion that this is the end of history because there are no serious competitors to liberal democracy. The fall of communism and the subsequent unveiling of information on the corruption and violence that those regimes inflicted on their own people has led to a more or less universal acceptance of democracy as the preferred form of government. Fukuyama and Kojeve believe that democracy best satisfies man's \\"desire for recognition\\" - which leads to man's stupid ideas - mainly war, envy, etc. These aggressive tendencies of man are what cause history and the end of history has been brought about by the acceptance of the governmental form (liberal democracy) which best allows all men the opportunity for recognition. Seriously, this is an insightful, true book full of great intellectual ideas."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"A mythic history book that has fed reams upon reams of debate, but seventeen years later it sure has aged. First let's be clear. It is not a philosophy book since it essentially repeats and confronts what others have written and it stops with Kojeve who is at least kind of old. Not one of the post modern philosophers or historians are quoted or alluded to. This leads me to my second remark. How can we dare discuss modern history and ignore the post modern school which is, true, essentially European, what's more French? Of course, the disadvantage with these historians is that most of them are still alive and kicking and they do not like people making them say things what they do not think. In other words they can rebut. Which means the book is not a history book in any way entering the scientific and academic debates of the last fifty years. Then, this being said, we can examine the content of the book. The main idea is that history is following some trajectory that leads it to some kind of a destination, understood as an end, a final point. History contains a pattern and it is not pure whimsical caprice. Right. Easy to see. Now to believe democracy is spreading in the world. We can even agree with that. But it is not democracy that is the pattern or the trajectory. It is the march of humanity towards full freedom. It had to free itself from purely animal life and nature that made the human species quite fragile and weak at first. It had to develop its surviving strategies by using what biology had given to it: a brain, the possibility to speak vowels and consonants and articulate them, the possibility to stand up, the possibility to grasp objects in a more effective way due to its thumb opposed to the fingers, etc. And the first task was to take care of their young who were premature and had to be looked after for several years before they could be really autonomous, and yet too small to live autonomously for several more years (sexually autonomous at the age of eleven of twelve, maybe earlier in those distant millennia). This determined the first division of labor, those who could look after the young, and particularly feed them, and the others. And language was invented and along with it the power to conceptualize, etc. And that's exactly what Kant forgot, what Marx neglected, what Kojeve ignored and what Fukuyama overlooks. Then he lives on a mythic first man that never existed, he thinks along the line of the primeval battle without any specification: in what state was humanity before the battle? If this battle established the masters and the slaves, they must have been free before. And they would have accepted to be enslaved all over the world? Of course not. Slavery was marginal and even inexistent in many civilizations, or it had very elaborate justifications like the caste system in the Hinduistic tradition, and that is not primeval. It is not because slavery was the norm in ancient Egypt, in Persia, in Israel (except for Jews or Israelis), in Greece and in Rome that it was true all over the world. It was marginal in the Celtic and Germanic tribes. Then this myth of the first man borrowed from Hegel is redoubled with the other myth of the last man borrowed from Nietzsche. And there Fukuyama derails. The future of the liberal democratic world is peaceful, without any classes, without any conflicts, without any struggle, with full satisfaction of human needs, etc. In other words a life without work, without ambition, without any effort to do better today than yesterday. Just sit back and enjoy. In other words the Elois of H.G. Wells but without the Morlocks. In other words a liberal world that he constantly identifies to capitalism but with no competition any more. He just forgets that competition is the basic principle of the market economy. In other words he is irrelevant due to this contradiction. But there is still worse. He speaks a lot of the inequality of human beings, but in vague terms. Human equality is only \\"born - and not created - equal in rights\\", but that is the French Revolution, but he seems to believe it is the same thing as the Declaration of Independence that says \\"created equal\\", period. Then when he speaks of the liberal revolution that the spirit of 1776 represents for him, he seems to forget that this Declaration of Independence and then the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the states statutes refused these rights to women, men under a certain age which was very advanced at the time, to Indians who do not pay taxes, to Blacks and other slaves who are not free, and to all the whites who do not earn property and/or do not pay taxes. And each extension of the beneficiaries of the Bill of Rights will be a battle, even a bloody battle at times, like the Civil Ward and its 600,000 casualties, and the Indian wars that will not lead to any extension. By neglecting all that he does not see that the motor of history, as he says, is the contradictions in our various human societies and that a contradiction is always solved to be replaced by another and contradictions will be eternal. And Fukuyama does not see the world is changing so fast that we cannot say what it will be in fifty years, and he ignores the fact that we are not in the post-industrial economy anymore but we have entered the knowledge economy phase: what are the contradictions of this world, the competitions of this economy? Fukuyama repeats Kojeve and Hegel and Nietzsche but does not answer these questions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I only wish I'd read Fukuyama's book after taking a slew of political theory courses in the early '90s. At a minimum, he brings a millenium-old debate over the ideal form of government and human nature up-to-date. The book reviews the contributions of Plato, Aristotle, Macchiavelli, Hegel, Hobbes, Locke, Marx and Nietzsche to political theory and inquires whether liberal democracy is the final outcome. Unfortunately, the book is erroneously interpreted by many as conclusive rather than inquisitive. Fukuyama has posed an important question that he knows only history in the making itself can answer.His analogies are not always logical, and the book's contents on Hegel are repetitive. Fukuyama's strength, however, is that he focuses on what is univeral in human nature and politics unlike Huntington and other academics who argue that some cultures are incompatible with liberal democracy. His work ranks among the most worthy political science books of the last decade that I have read."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The major event the fall of the Soviet Union which prompted this work was a true historical turning point. Fukuyama took the world by storm by seeing it as sign of an inevitable triumph of liberal democracy. For a time it appeared to some that he might be right. But as he was now fifteen years later see a world torn apart by radical Islamic terrorism, a world in which tribal loyalties increasingly surface as most important, a world in which the possibilities of terror and destruction multiply exponentially with the perfection of Technology Fukuyama's thesis seems a Utopian kind of ivory - tower dream. Fukuyama is a tremendously learned, intelligent and skillful master of his argument- but the argument itself and the fundamental thesis has gone the way of so many other ' inevitability theories' We could conceivably all go down in a second of doom brought on by any of a number of different human and non- humanly generated events. Liberal democracy may well be the best kind of government Mankind has ever known but it certainly does not seem bound to conquer necessarily the masses of mankind, even as now when certain very large portions of mankind, China, for instance are moving ahead by leaps and bounds economically.This is a tremendously thought- provoking work, and highly recommended. It would have been nice if its major thesis had come true."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The End of History and the Last Man is one of the most controversial and perhaps most misunderstood works of modern political theory.Fukuyama's argument, originally developed in a shorter 1989 National Interest article, contends that the ideals of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism may \\"constitute the 'end point of mankind's ideological evolution' and the 'final form of human government.'\\" By conquering fascism and communism (and theocracy and monarchy before that), liberal democracy has emerged as the unchallenged political philosophy of choice, apparently free from \\"fundamental internal contradictions.\\"The first part of Fukuyama's book relies heavily on Hegelian philosophy and introduces the concept of History--a directional, evolutionary process resulting in some final ideological state. Synthesizing a combination of history, science, political theory, and philosophy, Fukuyama argues that liberal democracy may represent Hegel's End of History.In the second part of the book, Fukuyama transitions to discussing the Nietzschean idea of the Last Man who would emerge at the End of History. While the End of History appears on the surface to be a source of human fulfillment, Fukuyama uses Nietzsche to question whether the Last Man would indeed be fully fulfilled or would rather live a purposeless existence.While Fukuyama's thesis is extremely controversial, his argument is highly philosophical and well-argued. Throughout the book, he presents evidence from a wide range of fields to support his claims and anticipates and pre-empts several important counter-arguments.Following September 11, 2001, many people simply scoffed at Fukuyama's audacious title. The Global War on Terror and the ideological battle between Western liberalism and Islamic fundamentalism seemed to undermine any notion that history was over. Much of this criticism originates from a misunderstanding of Fukuyama's original thesis. His End of History does not predict the end of struggle or major historical events. On the contrary, he predicts that their may indeed be great struggles between Western liberal democratic ideals, and competing Islamic fundamentalist or Asian ideals.Because this book relies heavily on Hegelian and Nietzschean philosophy and makes subtle political, sociological, and psychological arguments, it is not an easy book for the general reader--it is clearly authored for political theorists. The book is very densely written and is occasionally overly repetitive in places. While the book is an important contribution to modern political theory, I believe that general readers will find Fukuyama's original National Interest article a more digestible and concise version of his argument."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Not everyone will agree with Fukuyama's view of &quot;The End of History and The Last Man&quot;. We have to admit that Fukuyama has not only gone into a lot of research in writing this book but out of all that he has raised some very interesting and thought provoking questions about where Man could be heading. His views must be included in any world leader's scenarios and plans for our future. I have a gut feel that Fukuyama will be recognised as one of the great philosophers of his time, not now but probably in a 100 years time."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama's 'The End of History' promulgates his belief that the fall of the Soviet Union brought the end of \\"ideological evolution, and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\\" (The author is accepting Hegel's belief that civilization is moving from lower, ineffective forms of civilization to more effective forms.) Fukuyama in this book is seemingly dancing on Karl Marx's grave - Marx predicted that a similar point would be reached with communism instead displacing capitalism. Obviously, China has changed the situation since Fukuyama's book, and the world is now increasingly looking at it as a model for both a superior form of government (autocratic) and economics (Socialism, with Chinese characteristics). This latest model of superiority is a hybrid of capitalism, democracy, socialism, and autocracy.In addition, the Chinese are also heading to a leadership role as stewards of the world's environment - something American capitalism originally led in, but is now in danger of regressing. (Yes, their current care of the environment is far worse than ours, but their trend and ours are likely to change that.)Some contend that democracies rarely/never go to war with each other - thus, democracy really is superior. But wasn't Hitler elected? Doesn't Israel daily practice low-intensity warfare against the Palestinians?Others delight in the growing number of nations with democratic practices - but we've yet to see the outcome in the Middle East. Regardless, none of them can hold a candle to China's massive and speedy improvements. Who wants the #2 model?Bottom-Line: In fairness, I must admit that it is easy for me to criticize Fukuyama's book today, some 20 years after he wrote it."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Without question, \\"The End of History and the Last Man\\" is one of the finest affirmations of liberal democracy which I've read. Perhaps a more suitable alternative title could be \\"The Triumph of Democracy\\" since Fukuyama makes a very persuasive case for democracy's rapid rise during the last half of the 20th Century and why it may be the best form of government ever devised by man. Fukuyama uses Marxist dialectic reasoning in his arguments, drawing upon science and capitalism as twin pillars of human endeavor which he believes have made democracy's rise inevitable (However, I may be incorrect in noting the source of Fukuyama's dialectic reasoning; someone has mentioned that instead of Marx, Fukuyama has relied upon Hegel's dialectic method from the \\"Phenomenology of Mind\\".). While addressing the rise and fall of the Soviet empire, Fukuyama makes some important comments on the rise of militant Islam which are revelant today, suggesting that it, too, will also fail. Admittedly this is a difficult book to read, and one appreciated most by those familiar with Hegel's or Weber's writings. Still, I don't think it's hyperbole to suggest that Fukuyama's tome was the most important, most influential book on political history published in the last decade of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The revival of Hegel in this book is interesting, but it seems that Fukuyama falls into the same trap that Hegel did. Hegel used the evolution of human freedom as his underlying concept and seemed to believe that the society of the 19th century Prussian state was the culmination of that ideal. So for Hegel that rather modest, if not quaint, point in history and location in the world, with all its shortcomings and future turmoil that we now know of in historical retrospect, was \\"the end of history\\". That being said, I will confess that I am a bit of a Hegelian myself and believe there may be something to the idea of \\"the manifestation of the absolute\\" in human history, but to pick one government and one point in history to say that it is the culmination of all human history is to sell humanity short. After all, it was St. Augustine in The City of God who argues that all earthly governments are subject to change, decay, and fall. I suspect that to readers several hundred years from now, Fukuyama's idealization of American democracy as the end of history will seem just as quaint as Hegel's idealization of the nineteenth century Prussian state."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"By 'the end of history' Fukuyama means that humankind has found the ultimate form of governance and that the period of experimentation has come to an end. Hegel and Marx believed that the evolution of human societies would end when mankind had achieved a form of society that satisfies its deepest and most fundamental longings. For Hegel this was the liberal state while for Marx it was a communist society. Fukuyama believes that humanity will be led to liberal democracy.The book is divided into five sections. Part I addresses the issue of universal history. As individuals we can be optimistic about the 20th century with its improving prospects of health and happiness but pessimistic at the slow progress towards liberal democracy. This 20th century pessimism is in contrast to the optimism of the 19th century marked by peace and improvements in material well being. Science was conquering disease and poverty and the spirit of 1776 and the French Revolution was spreading throughout the world. There was a feeling of accumulating knowledge, increasing wisdom and advancement from the lower to higher levels of intelligence and well being. Free trade was replacing empire building and it seemed that war would be economically irrational. But the 20th century started disastrously with thousands dying daily over a few yards of ground in World War I. Horrendous as this war turned out to be, it was only a foretaste of new forms of evil backed by modern technology and more sophisticated political organization. The ultimate evil of the holocaust emerged in a country with the most advanced industrial economy and one of the most cultured and well-educated populations in Europe, highlighting the need for technological progress to be accompanied by moral progress. Without moral progress, technology will be turned to evil purposes and mankind will be worse off than previously.However, the author argues that during the second half of the 20th century the world got better and the final quarter of the century saw communism and authoritarian governments collapsing or undergoing severe crisis. In most cases reforms were not imposed from the outside but were due to an internal crisis of confidence that had infected the ruling elite. In Fukuyama's opinion liberal democracy remains the only coherent political aspiration spanning the globe and this is his basis of optimism. After a millenium of experimentation and false starts humankind can at last see the light at the end of the tunnel and this is his rational for drawing our attention to the need to plan the next steps.Part II uses natural science to explain the direction and coherence of history, based on the fact that technology confers a decisive military advantage and limitless wealth. The logic of natural science seems to dictate a move towards capitalism; the world's most developed countries are also its most successful democracies.Part III introduces the concept of man's struggle for recognition. Only man can move beyond self-preservation for the sake of higher, abstract principles and goals. Much of human behavior can be explained as a combination of desire and reason, but Hegel maintains that self-esteem drives the whole historical process. When we are not recognized we feel anger; when we fall short of our own sense of worth we feel shame; and when we are correctly evaluated we feel pride. It is self-esteem that drives men into a battle to the death, creating masters of those willing to risk their lives and slaves of those who give in. But the relationship of lordship and bondage would ultimately fail because humanity is not complete. Lordship and bondage led to the French and American revolutions to be replaced by the principles of popular sovereignty, the rule of law and universal and reciprocal recognition. Adoption of these principles should ensure that every citizen recognizes the dignity and humanity of every other citizen. Dissatisfaction with the flawed recognition available in aristocratic societies caused revolutions while Communism is being superceded by liberal democracy primarily because it has a defective form of recognizing man's self-worth. Seeking recognition has been the central problem of politics for the past millenium; it was the origin of tyranny and the desire to dominate. The author warns us that communities must cater to the desire for recognition while protecting themselves from its destructive effects.The deeper and more profound question concerns the goodness of liberal democracy itself and not only whether it will succeed against its rivals. The internal contradictions have already lead to such serious problems as drugs, homelessness, crime, environmental damage and consumerism. Part IV questions whether today's liberal democracy is completely satisfying because capitalism creates economic inequality and equal people are recognized unequally. In addition peace and prosperity leaves unsatisfied that part of us that seeks struggle, danger, risk and daring.Part V: The Last Man brings us to the important part of the book which can be summed up by these sentences: &quot;Common sense would indicate that liberal democracy has many advantages over its 20th-century rivals, fascism and communism, while loyalty to our inherited values and traditions would dictate unquestioning commitment to democracy. But the cause of liberal democracy is not necessarily best served by unthinking partisanship, and by the failure to address squarely democracy's failings. And it is obviously impossible to answer the question of whether history has come to an end without looking more deeply at the question of democracy and its discontents.&quot; Left to itself can liberal democracy be indefinitely self-sustaining, or will it collapse from internal rot much as communism has done? This is the part of the book which we must study carefully to ensure that never again will technology and sophisticated political systems be turned to evil purposes leaving mankind worse off than he was before."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"It takes several hundred pages for Fukuyama to build some kind of pseudo-philosophical model on the course of history and then essentially refute his own thesis in the last paragraph of the book. I can't believe I wasted the time it took to read this book. It's only value is to showcase the arrogance of Western (mainly American, i.e. George Will and his ilk) conservatives who believe that the entire world should adopt the liberal democratic political model. Fukuyama makes a number of questionable claims about global politics and the state of democracy in the world, and the book is too full of contradictions to list here. If you must read this book, then simply read the introducton, since he makes all his main arguments there, and then skip to the last few paragraphs where, as I mentioned, he contradicts his own thesis. Readers would be better off reading the actual works of Hegel, Nietzche, etc. than Fukuyama's sloppy re-hashing and &quot;development&quot; of their ideas."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This book is definitely impressive for the breadth of topics it covers in a clear manner and you really feel a bit more educated for reading this. Its main thesis is that democracy is the most efficient and socio-economically beneficial political system and since there is now only a truly successful democracy as super power the rest of the world will have to make way and adapt to democratic institutions and learn to live in peace. Even though the author supposedly considers all sides of the issues he choses democracy and universal harmony as supreme just based on faith and not necessarily on evidence.The least charitable way of describing this book is that of the giddy boasting by the victors in an ideological war. Whenever the author senses that there might be some contadictions with reality he chooses to quote grand ideologies of Hegel, Weber and other ideologues to make sure that his book is not a compilation of speculations. Ofcourse one might ask what is the use of one speculation being justified by quoting many other speculations. But the author seems to believe that aging of past speculations gives them academic respectability. For my part I will stick to analytic, sensible and realistic Marxian econo-political analysis. Yes, there were many evils with practical Marxism in the form of governance but as of now there are no other lesser evils of socio-economic analysis with predictive powers.But then if you are one of those people with strong and rigid moral convictions which needs reinforcement not reasons for change this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Francis is a very smart man who was expensively miseducated. He knows an elaborate amount about the 19th century German philosophers like the excruciatingly boring Hegel. Nonetheless, since his college days he has self-educated himself to a nearly heroic extent about the real world. Unfortunately in this book, he tries to combine Hegel and reality, with uneven results. He has largely dropped German philosophy in his subsequent and more readable books.His general thesis is reasonable but limited: the war over ideology is over, capitalism and democracy have won. However, ideological conflict has only comprised a tiny fraction of history. Most of history consists of what Lenin himself called &quot;Who, whom?&quot; Who will do it to whom? The conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is a classic example. A related problem is that history isn't over because while most people may approve of capitalist and democrat states, many are not satisfied with the borders of existing states. Finally, it's not clear that much of the world (e.g., Africa) has what it takes to be successfully capitalist and democratic. Seen Lynn and Vanhanen's new blockbuster &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot; for tables showing the average IQ of 81 different countries, and the high correlations between IQ, GDP per capita, economic freedom, and democracy."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I was recommended this book from my friend, and I was eager to start reading it. But I have to warn you; &quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; is not an easy book to read. It is not just badly written, but it is written in such a way that you end up reading the same points at least three times.. I commented this for my friend who recommended me the book, and he said: &quot;Yeah, that's right. I forgot to say that it is a bit wordy and repetitive. I should have recommended you something a little bit easier to read.&quot;That being said, there is not doubt that Fukuyama possesses much knowledge on the subject, and I find some of the issues brought up in this book to be very interesting, even provoking. But after reading this book, I was left with the feeling of spending much time on acquiring very little (new) information.Maybe one would be better off, doing what my friend suggested for me (of course, he did that *after* I had struggled my way through the book). Go to your library and find the original 1989 National Interest article - read that one, and skip the book.

Although it had generated much discussion in literary circles, I found it ponderous and pretentious. What was all the fuss about?Francis Fukuyama leads the reader through a long discussion which sees the West triumph over the Marxist utopias of eastern Europe. He claims not to be triumphalist but I had some trouble accepting this view. But then again, why shouldn't the West be triumphalist? The great clash of the 20th century was a mighty victory to liberal democracy. This has undoubtedly been a good thing. Communism as propounded by Lenin and his followers was sham; a monumental failure and a great generator of misery. So, why does Fukuyama claim to be not making this point?Instead of the obvious, Fukuyama almost endlessly pontificates on Hegel and how his concepts have come to reality. Quite frankly, who really cares? In fact, he could have made this point far more succinctly and just as forcefully in a single chapter. Why go banging on for several hundred pages about the same point?Warning readers: this is an overhyped work that should be readily avoided."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This work is an enigma of philosophical history and ideology at the same time, the piece de resistance of 'bourgeois ideology', one whose arrival with perfect timing and clever idea at the collapse of Bolshevism was a kind of Hegelian coup d'etat of philosophy. Like a good move spotted in chess, one jumps to the play, only to suffer later complications, thus Fukuyama's thesis ends a victim of its own cogency, which demands critical challenge ad infinitum. Picking up the fumbled football of the eschatological advertisement, it inherits the millenarian expectations of its former rival and demands in the end we examine more closely the real Hegel behind the one espoused by Alexander Kojeve, whose interpretation of the Hegelian idea was always suspect as something of a concoction, cf. Jon Stewart's _The Hegel Myths and Legends_ (now back in print), for the creation of this Hegelian myth.The difficulty with this compelling beguilement is the failure to specify the details of the infinite variety of liberal systems compatible with abstract definitions, not all of which will converge to any end, save that of frozen social evolution, the infinite loop of the year 1848. Thus the end is at risk of being a permanent beginning, and as in the beginning, so at the end, the test, behind the jargon, is equality. cf. Alexander Kojeve, Shadia Drury.

(Sounds oddly Marxist to me) He celebrates the dominance of a Christian Eurocentric History and excludes all other histories, unless they are \\"spiritually\\"converted to the global free-market of goodness. This is why the Islamic world never enters this pieces' international consensus.Fukuyama's \\"good-news\\" is bad news. The same old utopia scheming with the same old concentrating on the ends instead of the means.Hitler was also striving after Utopia's grand narrative end. He cared nothing for the means, no matter how many lives were thrown, as long as 'his' utopia's ending was met. Where is Utopia exactly? Be it Nazi or Liberal Democratic, it is nowhere, and that is exactly where it is to be found.Our hyperreal world ignores the fact that the extremist culture is at war with the extremist civilization. The crux of postmodernity is that there are two presents; one is the distorted virtual real techno-media arrange of images, the other is the elusive, fugitive, borderline reality which is trying hard to hold on to it's fleeting customs by rebelling against the superimposed first.Against this insolent author's standpoint to proclaim liberal democracy as the realized \\"end\\" of human history. When really as Derrida implies, \\"never have violence, inequality, exclusion, famine, and thus economic oppression affected as many human beings in the history of the Earth and of Humanity... no degree of progress allows one to ignore that never before, in absolute figures, have so many men, women and children been subjected, starved or exterminated on the Earth.\\"Fukuyama's last men concept (taken from Nietzsche,) ignores the fact that Americans, the supreme exporter of the liberal lifestyle, are the last men, and not the other way around. Our democratic republic is decaying and declining at a startling rate, not rising. We are purely imperial in our foreign affairs. The one's who rebell against this world setup are not the last men, they are the last culture men. So this grand narrative's salvation is not in righteous liberal democracy, but in the neo-colonial based empire which holds the largest arms in the name of the largest resources.Look beyond the text, beyond the author, beyond the media, and beyond yourself.

This was unskillfully done through cutting and pasting from other existing modes of thought. I particullarly found his generalisations about Islam, Japan or even China quite offensive. If one wishes to stigmatise a whole civilisation, I suggest Mr. Fukuyama ignore the current modes of politicised Islam and have a look at the Middle ages when Muslim and Arab scholary work was the first thing scientists and thinkers turned to salvage themselves from the darkness of the middle ages. It is sufficient to point out that Greek philosophy was revived in Europe through back translation of Muslim scholars not to mention other fields such as Medicine, Chemistry, Math, the list goes on... I beleive that in order to understand where the world is going, one should not engage in re-constructing a meta-narrative with half-truths like that which pertains to liberal democracy which may have offered more choice in terms of how many brands of tea are available but at the expence of creating violence, anxieties, tattered family structures and social fiber.

The book's title suggested to some a triumphant valedictory for liberal democracy, and yet the epitome of liberal democratic values -- the West -- was now mired in another seemingly endless struggle. Especially for those who never read the work, the phrase \\"the end of history\\" became something one only said with scorn. Cynics felt obligated to point out that one more philosophy of the world had fallen into the meat grinder of history, never to be seen again.But this book still has relevance in the post 9-11 world. Despite the vulgarization of its title, Fukuyama did not predict an end to conflict. What's more, he also did not cast the future in an unremittingly optimistic light. In some ways his themes -- particularly in the second half of the book when he focuses on the Nietzschean concept of The Last Man -- are decidedly darker than even keen reviewers of the work have noted. Liberal democracy may have triumphed, but its victory had costs for the collective psyche of its denizens.\\"The End of History and The Last Man\\" came out in the wake of the fall and breakup of the Soviet Union. With the collapse of global communism, Fukuyama claimed the fundamental values of liberal democracy and market capitalism were now unchallenged. What's more, no other ideologies on the horizon appeared attractive or effective enough to usurp them -- ever. Yes, some countries or regions might fall under the sway of an ideology (Islamic fundamentalism) or a cultural conceit (Asian values), but too much of the globe now accepted that societies should be organized under the principles of liberal democracy and market capitalism for there ever to be a major reversal in its fortunes around the world. Thus, ideological conflict on a global scale was over. And so history -- in the Hegelian sense of the clash of competing ideologies -- was over as well.What kind of man would this post-historical world create? Fukuyama explores this in the second half of the book - a section I feel is neglected by too many readers. Here, Fukuyama shifts his conceptual lens from the philosophy of Hegel and its focus on ideological conflict as the motor of history to the psychological insights of Friedrich Nietzsche. Having used Hegel to show how history might be ending, he now uses Nietzsche to show how empty and meaningless this ending might become. We have reached the end of the history, Fukuyama claims, but Nietzsche shows how unsatisfying that endpoint is. What happens when men are all recognized as equal and the struggle for everything except the accumulation of more material goods is over? What will they value?\\"The End of History and The Last Man\\" and its themes will outlast its critics. 9-11 did not restart history, because Islamic fundamentalism does not represent the same serious ideological competitor that was once represented by communism. (It's highly doubtful that even a majority of Muslims desire it, and whatever the case in the Muslim countries, it's certainly true that its attractiveness is strictly limited to those of the Islamic faith.) This beautifully written book weaves different strands of philosophy, international relations, and political science into a brilliant argument that overwhelms simplistic criticisms of it. There are weak points to Fukuyama's arguments in the book - some of which he addressed himself later in his career - but few recognize them. The book still deserves a careful reading. Serious political and social commentators will be dealing with its arguments for some time."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"\\"The End of History and the Last Man\\" by Francis Fukuyama has an apocalyptic-looking cover and a title that needs explication. But the book is not a doomsday scenario, quite the contrary, as the explanation of the title will show.Fukuyama, who is Bernard Schwartz Professor of International Political Economy at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, published this work of political philosophy in 1992, and in it, he explains in a logical, well-considered progression why he believes that liberal democracy is the final resting point of progressive history, but that that very liberal democracy can render humanity as less than what it could be - comfort seeking, self-involved, \\"men without chests.\\"The book, which could be subtitled \\"I Love Hegel and Why You Should, Too,\\" builds on Hegel's idea that there is a Universal, progressive History. This is to what Fukuyama is referring when he says that History has reached its end; he doesn't mean that nothing else will happen, but that the progression of History toward a universally beneficial system of government has culminated in liberal democracy. He defines liberalism - \\"Political liberalism can be defined simply as a rule of law that recognizes certain individual rights or freedoms from government control\\" and he defines those rights in three classes, civil rights, religious rights and political rights. He defines democracy as \\"the right held universally by all citizens to have a share of political power, that is, the right of all citizens to vote and participate in politics.\\"His concentration on Hegel arises from Fukuyama's contention that we've been very conditioned by Karl Marx's influence to believe that most social and political problems come from economic and class differences. Fukuyama disagrees, saying that conflict comes from Hegel's theory that some people will risk their lives for prestige, or recognition. He writes that the aristocracy was created by such people - people who risked their lives for prestige and were able to enslave others. He writes that liberal democracy resolves the tension between slave and master because it makes the slaves their own masters.But he cautions that Nietzsche believed in war and conflict as a way for humanity to express its passions, and that without conflict (Fukuyama says that liberal democracies do not attack each other), humans will become soft, meaningless, passionless, \\"men without chests.\\" Fukuyama does not advocate that people become \\"last men,\\" even though in this volume, he believes the End of History is being reached.I read this book because Thomas L. Friedman faulted it for \\"not going far enough\\" in \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree: Understanding Globalization,\\" but I wouldn't agree with that. Friedman clearly owes a lot to Fukuyama, directly or indirectly, and the roots of many of Friedman's ideas are explicated very elegantly here.I find this book difficult to write about because it contains so many interrelated and complex ideas that are truly fascinating, including Fukuyama's views on the role of science in reaching the End of History. (In fact, in a newer book, \\"Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,\\" he writes that the End of History may not have been reached because the End of Science hasn't been reached. So reads a review of this book on the Web.)I highly recommend this book. It really stretched my mind in new directions and helped me to see the world and our current governmental systems in new ways. His integration of key philosophical work and thought with political history was fascinating and had a ring of truth."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The End Of History And The Last Man, by Francis Fukuyama: A ReviewIt is seldom that one comes across a book which can hold us spellbound from beginning to end. But this is the case of this masterpiece by Fukuyama. In this book, Fukuyama proposes a return to Hegel's historiosophical concept of a Universal History which has a clear direction, purpose and progress. After having passed through many stages of development, history has finally come to its end. This, of course, does not mean that time has come to an end. Life and death will continue, the season of the year and the passage of the decades go forward. But history is a particular process in which we witness specific changes in the political organization and cultural arrangements of human societies. This process seems to evolve in accordance with specific laws, such as the expansion of the levels of human freedom. The liberal democracies developed in the modern times are the culmination of such a process, because they embody the fullness of the ideal of human freedom. Sure, there are adjustments which can be made to perfect particular democracies, but the concept itself of democracy as the self-determination of peoples cannot be improved upon. Hence, history has reached its end, its goal.Fukuyama brilliantly developes throughout the book the theme of Plato's tripartite division of the human soul into reason, passion and desire, and its consequences for political science. Political systems are reflections of human yearnings, the attempt of human beings to give full expression to their own humanness. What ultimately matters is how a particular society balances these three elements of human nature. Hegel's thesis is that history begins with the first man who was able to gain mastery over his fellow man and thus achieve a level of recognition as a superior being. Masters come to rule over slaves first and foremost because they are able to face courageously the fear of death, whereas slaves prefer to obey submissively the stronger man than to forfeit their own lives. Fear of death is the primary motivation of the slave. Aristocrats, on the other hand, are driven by the impulse to seek superior recognition through fearless self-sacrifice in battle and war. The element of the human soul which is emphasized in aristocratic societies is passion (thymos).Modern liberal democracies came into existence as the reslut of a rebellion of the masses of servants who yearned for freedom and recognition of their value as human beings. Theirs too was a search based on thymos, but it is distinguisgable from the thymos of the aristocracy. The masses search for the dignity that comes with the equality of all human beings (isothymia), is contradistinction to the aristocratic dignity which is based on their lordship over other people (megalothymia). A liberal democracy is based on the principle of freedom and equality of all human beings.But what is the purpose of a liberal democratic system ? Here is where Fukuyama's analysis reaches its peak of subtlety. The end of human life is &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot;, understood as the search for safety, survival, comfort and material well-being. The furtherance of private property to the highest possible degree becomes the ultimate expression of success in a liberal democracy such as the one in the United States. In order to assure the accomplishment of happiness for the largest possible number of people we must restrict the impulse of thymos and allow for the development of the rational side of human nature. Through science, human beings come to subdue nature and are thus capable of fulfilling as well the third part of their souls, &quot;desire&quot;. Reason and desire go hand in hand, the former being the means to satisfy the latter. The two of them thrive best in the context of the peaceful coexistence of human beings who show, above all, the virtue of tolerance for the differences of their fellow human beings.One might think that such an ideal picture would be easily supported by all people. But the nature of thymos is not to be restricted without its devastating consequences. Its elimination carries with it the trivialization of human pursuits. The modern liberal man finds himself suffocated under the weight of unbearably petty pursuits and wants which diminish his sense of meaningfulness in life. He wastes his life away in the meaningless search for comfort and lives constantly with the crippling fear of loosing his security, safety and comfort. He becomes sub-human. He looses all the ideals for which his ancestors were willing to risk their lives.Democracy may have built into itself a contradiction which may become its nemesis. The last man, having achieved physical security and material well-being under the protection of the peaceful coexistence of liberal democracies, may find a gnawing sense of dis-satisfaction that could drive him, in his pursuit of meaning for himself and the world surrounding him, to renewed conflict with his fellow human beings.In the wake of an incredible wave of democratization in the world, following the collapse of communism and authoritarianism, we must face the question of whether we are in some sense approaching the end of history. Are we coming to the culmination of a linear process that once fulfilled may usher in a new era a peaceful coexistence, or will we experience a rebellion of the human soul against a system that imposes the imprint of shallow materialism across all borders ? This question is one which remains yet to be answered. Fukuyama has brought us, in an impeccably lucid and compelling way, to the edge of our historical journey, and he provided us with tools to understand and appreciate the ultimate existential dilemma which we now face. His work has unquestionably earned its rightful place as a classic in contemporary political theory."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The main problem with Fukiyama's End of History is simply that it is badly written; Fukiyama's prose is verbose and redundant - the reader ends up reading the same points three or four times.That said, much of the criticism that the book has received is, in my opinion, misplaced. Fukiyama is not claiming that the capitalist system is some sort nirvana, but simply that history is a directional force that has delivered us to a point in which free market economies have reached a state of efficiency and harmony with human nature and therefore in large part won't be replaced by competing systems. This is not a value judgement, as has been accused by many critics; it's simply a matter of natural selection.Is Fukiyama saying that a free market economy is *better* than competing systems? Well what he's saying that it is better at *doing certain things*, and this is an important distinction. Fukiyama claims not a moral superiority (\\"best of all possible worlds\\") but a functional superiority in which the occasional backtrack (a military coup here, a revolution there) will be shown to be mere blips. History, according to Fukiyama, is asymptotic, and we're approaching the end state.Much of Fukiyama's argument is philosophical and at such lacks empirical data. So be it; I see this book as more than anything a discussion piece and many of its claims are essentially can't be proved (or will be proved or disproved over the next century or so).This is a flawed work, but one which makes some interesting points. Fukiyama's discussion on Thymos and the &quot;desire for recognition&quot; as the dividing line between slaves and masters is interesting, but in that I'm not a scholar on Hegel and haven't read the original works I don't know if they've simply been lifted from previous writings.In the end, reading this book is a lot of work for a little insight, therefore it is with a degree of reluctance that I recommend it. On second thought, a better idea would be to go to your local library and dig up the original 1989 National Interest article; you'll get essentially the same main ideas without having to slog through hundreds of pages of wordy and repetitive text. In some ways this book has changed the way I look at the world, but some of the conclusions I've taken with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"One of the most thought provoking books I have read in a long time. Contrary to the claims of the right, Fukuyama does not conclude that western liberal democray and economic liberalism are the highest form of evolution. He explores this question and in doing so embarks on a fascinating journey though history and political philosophy. There is no airtight conclusion or doctrine being espoused here, which may trouble some. However, the questions raised are critical to understanding modern society, where we have come from and where we may or may not be going. Some have criticized the book for being wordy and repetitive. Though the same themes do appear over and over, they are always to look at new questions. On the contrary, I wish I could have read on."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"What we are witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or a passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government. -&quot;X&quot; (Francis Fukuyama), The End of History? (The National Interest)One assumes that only George F. Kennan's &quot;Containment&quot; memo, likewise published under the pseudonym &quot;X&quot;, can rival Francis Fukuyama's essay &quot;The End of History&quot;--first published in 1989, in The National Interest--in terms of impact on the public consciousness of a foreign policy brief. Fukuyama's essential argument was not that history, in terms of events and conflicts and the like, had actually come to and end, rather that liberal capitalist democracy represented the final step in Man's political evolution. With its overtones of Cold War triumphalism, the piece set off a huge kerfuffle and turned a State Department cypher into a significant political philosopher almost overnight.In this book, Fukuyama expands on the ideas in his original essay and introduces several new ones, the most important of which, embodied by the idea of &quot;thymos&quot;, is that the greatest threat to the End of History is the fact that people demand recognition. By recognition, he means something fairly broad, but which we all intuitively recognize :...that part of man which feels the need to place value on things--himself in the first instance, but on the people, actions, or things around him as well. It is the part of the personality which is the fundamental source of the emotions of pride, anger, and shame, and is not reducible to desire, on the one hand, or reason on the other. The desire for recognition is the most specifically political part of the human personality because it is what drives men to want to assert themselves over other men... .Liberal democracy succeeds brilliantly at fulfilling Man's basic desires--food, clothing, shelter--but it raises several questions. Will Man, once satiated, still have the kind of thymos which has driven the species to achieve technologically and culturally ? Will the most able in society be content to be treated equally with those they consider their inferiors, or will they demand a level of political recognition commensurate with their contributions to society ? Will those at the bottom of the social scale--and liberal democracy does, undeniably, produce a hierarchy from poor to rich--be content to have less than those at the top of the scale, or will they demand that the high be brought low ? Fukuyama seeks to provide answers to these questions, drawing upon thinkers like Plato, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Alexandre Kojeve, and upon the experiences of modern times.The book is always fascinating, sometimes wrongheaded and frequently brilliant. In the end, the question that animates the discussion is the same that mankind always faces ; which will ultimately triumph, the desire for security or the urge to freedom. There is no more important issue in human history and the ways in which we answer it will, as always, determine our future. Even if he does not arrive at any final answers, Fukuyama adds immeasurably to our understanding of the question and its importance.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The Enlightenment view of history is the triumph of the rule of Reason, which operates in the realm of ideas. Hegel produced a dynamic and material version of Enlightenment history by stressing the dialectic between ideas and materiality, whereby each stage in the development of Reason is instantiated and codified in a concrete social formation in which the reigning ideal Zeitgeist is the motive force driving history forward. Marx accepted Hegel's view of history (actually he \\"turned Hegel on his head,\\" but Hegel upside down is still just Hegel), and located the motive force in class struggle. Many European intellectuals saw clearly that Marx's communism was just one peculiar moment in the general move from autocracy to democracy, by which they meant not a schema of majority rule and political freedom, but rather rule by and for the masses. This was the end of history.Nietzsche saw and lamented this turn of history in Marx's time, and Heidegger and many others followed in Nietzsche's path in the twentieth century. Others, like the brilliant Russian-French philosopher Alexandre Koj&egrave;ve, saw clearly and triumphantly that Marx was indeed a footnote to Hegel, and in the long run the end of history would culminate in a general emancipation of the masses.Fukuyama is a student and admirer of Koj&egrave;ve. The collapse of the Soviet Union became for him the occasion for writing this energetic and apocalyptic defense of modern liberal democratic capitalism, as well as some warnings concerning the implication of the \`end of history.' The collapse of the Soviet empire, the transformation of Chinese Communism into a capitalist system with an authoritarian state, the withering away of socialist and trade union forces in Europe and America, and the success of Pacific Basin capitalism all solidified liberal democratic capitalism as they only viable emancipatory wealth-generating social form. Fukuyama carries this train of thought deep into the future by claiming that modern technology is uniquely suited for liberal democracy, obviating any possibility of an alternative system arising in the foreseeable future. He recognizes that there will be all sorts of rear-guard actions, such as unstable dictatorships backed by military force and religious ideology, but these must eventually give way to liberal democracy.The cautionary dimension in Fukuyama's argument is indicated by the \\"Last Man\\" notion present in the book's title. Fukuyama is sympathetic to the Nietzsche-Heidegger argument that true individuality and creativity is incompatible with mass democracy. Here Fukuyama expresses a key worry of mid-twentieth century American intellectuals, such as Daniel Bell (The End of Ideology, 1960), Sloan Wilson (The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit), and Herbert Marcuse (One-Dimensional Man), who were reviled by the shallowness and vapidity of popular culture, and longed for a return to the high culture of Voltaire's salon and the Wiener Kreis coffeehouse ruminations.I often find Fukuyama a pedestrian writer, but this book is inspired, and Fukuyama's energy spills out onto the pages in into the reader's heart. I would love it if his argument about liberal democracy were correct, although I don't believe the one-dimensional man argument at all. However, there is one major and one minor problem with his analysis. The minor problem is that technological change in the future could either destroy civilization altogether or render capitalism anachronistic for one reason or another (e.g., intelligent robots take over the role of innovation and entrepreneurship, or people tire of more and more material goods). This possibility is remote at the present time, of course.The major problem is simply that Hegel's theory of history is only a half-truth, and a misplaced half-truth at that. History is indeed an interplay between human aspirations and human technology, but human aspirations are not based on Reason but rather upon a human nature that is the product of gene-culture coevolution, and as such, is imbued with certain preternatural values. Most important is that humans desire freedom, dignity, and the capacity to control their social world through association with others as co-equals. To appreciate the centrality of evolved human nature, suppose some termite species (order isoptera) had evolved large brains and complex societies as opposed to Homo sapiens (subtribe Hominina). Termite nature being inherently eusocial and hierarchical, the ideal yearnings of the mass of intelligent termites would include no element of social equality, personal dignity, or self-determination, but would likely center around the sublimely harmonious and completely ordered group mind and flawless bureaucratic structure. \\"Reason,\\" Hume once famously noted, \\"is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions.\\" It is the human passion for freedom and dignity that determines the thrust of emancipatory history, not the dictates of abstract Reason.I do not consider this a major problem with Fukuyama's argument. Evolutionary biology gives the truth to Hegel, but this turning of Hegel on his head is no more revolutionary that Marx's, although obviously more descriptive of human reality (E. O. Wilson, when induced to read Marx to help understand the Marxist hostility to sociobiology, wrote in the margin of the Communist Manifesto \\"terrific theory, wrong species\\"). Much more important is that human technology, rather than being an unambiguous emancipatory force, is a seriously two-edged sword, in some eras liberating, and others enslaving, the human passions. Let me explain.It is well known that the hunter-gatherer societies that defined human existence until some 10,000 years ago were extremely egalitarian, involving widespread sharing both communal child rearing (Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Mother Nature: Maternal Instincts and How They Shape the Human Species, Ballantine, 2000; and Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding, Belknap, 2009) and hunting (Christopher Boehm, Hierarchy in the Forest: The Evolution of Egalitarian Behavior, Harvard University Press, 2000; and Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis, A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and its Evolution (Princeton University Press, 2011). It is the human nature that emerged from this nexus of social institutions that defines contemporary human passions for emancipatory social institutions, of which liberal democratic capitalism is the contemporary most advanced form.Why did hominids develop egalitarian societies while the other social primates, especially chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos retained hierarchical political structures based on personal power (bonobos appears to have a less linear hierarchy that the other social primates, but there is still a hierarchy based on physical strength of males and the coalitional capacities of females)? The answer is probably technological. Hominids developed lethal weapons at least 400,000 years ago, in the Middle Pleistocene (Harmut Thieme, \\"Lower Palaeolithic Hunting Spears from Germany\\", Nature 385,27 (1997):807-810). Most important were sharpened wooden thrusting and throwing spears developed for hunting, but quite effective in killing or maiming the strongest male while asleep or otherwise inattentive. Because of these lethal weapons, there was no possibility of maintaining a political hierarchy based on physical prowess alone. By contrast, non-human primates never developed weapons capable of controlling a dominant male. Even when sound asleep, an accosted male reacts to hostile onslaughts by awakening and engaging in a physical battle, basically unharmed by surprise attack.The reaction of hominid political structure to the emergence of lethal weapons was, logically, either to sustain leaderless social coalitions, or to find some other basis for leadership. The superior survival value of groups with leadership doubtless led to the demise of leaderless hominid social formations, and the consolidation of new hominid social relations based on novel forms of leadership. What might these may be? Clearly, if on cannot lead by force, one must lead by persuasion. Thus successful hominid social bands came to value individuals who could command prestige by virtue of their persuasive capacities. Persuasion depends on clear logic, analytical abilities, a high degree of social cognition (knowing how to form coalitions and curry the favor of others), and linguistic facility. For this reason, the social structure of hunter-gatherer life favored progressive encephalization and the evolution of the physical and mental prerequisites of effective linguistic and facial communication. In short, 400,000 years of evolution in the presence of lethal weapons gave rise to Homo sapiens.If this argument is correct, it explains the huge cognitive and linguistic advantage of humans over other species not as some quirk of sexual selection (the favorite theory through the ages of Charles Darwin, Ronald Fisher, Geoffrey Miller and many others), but rather as directly fitness enhancing, despite the extreme energy costs of the brain: increased cognitive and linguistic ability entailed heightened leadership capacities, which fellow group members were very willing to trade for enhanced mating and provisioning privileges.With the development of settled trade, agriculture, and private property some 10,000 years ago, it became possible for a Big Man to gather around him a relatively small group of subordinates and consorts that would protect him from the lethal revenge of a dominated populace, whence the slow and virtually inexorable rise of the state both as a instrument for exploiting direct produces and for protecting them against the exploitation of external states and bands of private and semi-state-sanctioned marauders. The hegemonic aspirations of states peaked in the thirteenth century, only be driven back by the serious of European population-decimating plagues of the fourteenth century. The period of state consolidation resumed in the fifteenth century, based on a new technology: the heavily armed cavalry. In this case, as in some other prominent cases, technology becomes the handmaiden to oppression rather than emancipation.In Politics VII, Aristotle writes \\"there are four kinds of military forces---the cavalry, the heavy infantry, the light armed troops, the navy. When the country is adapted for cavalry, then a strong oligarchy is likely to be established [because] only rich men can afford to keep horses. The second form of oligarchy prevails when the country is adapted to heavy infantry; for this service is better suited to the rich than to the poor. But the light-armed and the naval elements are wholly democratic...An oligarchy which raises such a force out of the lower classes raises a power against itself.\\"The use of cavalry became dominant in Europe through the success of the Parthians in the Roman-Persian wars that lasted from the late Hellenistic period until the Middle Ages. The Romans armored infantry could not stand up to the Parthian cavalry and the Romans adjusted by adopting the practices of their enemies. The increased strategic role of cavalry was enhanced by the emergence of new breeds of horses engineered for the battlefield, and deployed adeptly by the Germanic invaders and the Islamic warriors. From this, enhanced by the development of the wraparound saddle, stirrup, and spurs, the preeminence of cavalry in the Middle Ages was assured, whence the oligarchic character of European feudalism, which centered around a knightly cavalry.The history of warfare from the Late Middle Ages to the First World War was the saga of the gradual increase in the strategic military value of infantry armed with longbow, crossbow, hand cannon, and pike, which marked the recurring victories of the English and Swiss over French and Spanish cavalry in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries. Cavalries responded by developing dismounted tactics when encountering infantry, using heavy hand weapons such as two-handed swords and poleaxes. These practices extended the viability of cavalry to the sixteenth century in the French and Spanish armies, but gradually through the Renaissance, and with the rise of Atlantic trade, the feudal knightly warlords gave way to the urban landed aristocracy and warfare turned to the interplay of mercenary armies consisting of unskilled foot soldiers wielding cannon and other weapons based on gunpowder. Cavalry remained important in this era, but even in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, cavalry was used to execute the coup de grace on seriously weakened infantry.The true hegemony of the foot soldier, and hence the origins of modern democracy, began with the perfection of the hand gun, with its improved accuracy and greater firing rate than the pistols of a previous era. Until that point, infantry was highly vulnerable to attack from heavy artillery. By the early twentieth century, the superiority of unskilled foot soldiers armed with rifles was assured. World War I opened in 1914 with substantial cavalry on all sides, but mounted troops were soundly defeated by men with rifles and machine guns, and thus were abandoned in later stages of the war. As Samuel Bowles and I showed in Democracy and Capitalism (Basic Books, 1985), the strength of the political forces agitating for political democracy in Twentieth Century Europe was predicated on the strategic role of the foot soldier in waging war and defending the peace.It is clear today that the material basis for liberal democracy is no longer the armed infantry but rather a combination of the willingness of ordinary people to rise up, fight, and die for freedom, together with modern communications and transport technologies that are virtually impossible to suppress, especially if authoritarian states have an interest in promoting economic development. Fukuyama is wholly correct on this point. An oil-rich outlier state like Saudi Arabia is not constrained by goals of economic development, but their security extends only as far as oil remains in high demand, which will not be for long. For the most part, modern technology is highly emancipatory.Where his wrong, however, is in not contemplating the possibility of new technologies capable of controlling masses of people by a powerful few, as envisioned by the apocalyptic anti-Communist writers Aldous Huxley (Brave New World), 1984 (George Orwell), Darkness at Noon (Arthur Koestler), and cinematographers like Jean-Luc Godard (Alphaville). The totalitarian ambitions of the Soviet state foundered on the new technologies that were too synergistic with modern industrial life and private incentives, but there is no reason that a progressive economic system like that of the Chinese might not find new technological means of controlling masses of affluent workers and even middle-class entrepreneurs over the long run. There is no extant technology that would facilitate this control, and those of us who value freedom and democracy must struggle to promote emancipatory over enslaving technologies in coming decades. Even should we survive nuclear Armageddon, global warming, and other byproducts of emancipatory, it is not at all the \\"end of history.\\""},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Contrary to the common interpretation, Fukuyama, in fact, predicts the implosion of liberal democracy because of its inherent contradiction between liberty and democracy.

Francis Fukuyama is one of few economists who is actually a clear and interesting writer. This book is important because, although first published in 1992, it has influenced U.S. Foreign and Defense policies into the 21st Century. It is intellectually engaging because in it Fukuyama presents nothing less than a universal theory of human history.Interestingly, the philosophical basis for this theory comes from Fukuyama's interpretation of the writings of the early 19th Century German historicist and idealist philosopher, Friedich Hegel. Specifically, Fukuyama accepts Hegel's belief in the inevitability of dialectical progression in the development of human societies or to put it another way, historical determinism. Fukuyama uses Hegel's dialectical progression to explain the historical development of human society and attempts to show in several examples how internal contradictions invariably lead to social change. He also attempts to prove that any society that has eliminated internal contradictions represents in his words the \`end of history' in the sense that no further social change will occur.Rather controversially, Fukuyama maintains that those states (societies) that have established democratic political systems, free market economies, and the rule of law are entirely free from internal contradictions. They thus are at the top of the evolutionary chain and are at the end of history because they require no further social change. He further maintains that all states or societies aspire to this condition.Right or wrong, Fukuyama has significantly influenced U.S. post Cold War strategic thinking and his characterization of those societies enjoying democratic government and free market economies have become for U.S. policy makers, the model that all societies should aspire to and emulate regardless of other factors. For a look at how this concept is influencing such things as U.S. Military Force Transformation read the unclassified version of a Rand Corporation paper titled \\"A Framework for Strategy Development\\" that was prepared for the Office of the Secretary of Defense in 2001 and is available through Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Anyone looking to load your arsenal with talking points about the virtues democracy and capitalism, or looking to unearth the secret, zealous neo-con conspiracy behind President Bush's foreign policy should NOT read this book. However, if you want to encounter a challenging thesis on the nature of man, and the way that he orders his social life, this should be right up your alley.The book begins in taking on our 20th century (or at least pre-89) pessimistic belief that man does not progress. He might be capable of build new toys, but his social existence is static, that is to say, violent. This outlook, of course, is the product of the 20th century tragdies that proceeded 19th century exuberance. Fukuyama argues that now is the time to reevaluate our pessimism. He then argues that the invention of the scientific method has set in motion a series of events, and changed our way of thought in such a way that we can never go back. Thus, History was born. He then argues that inevitable improvments in science, in turn, improve technology. The state will then seek to utilize that technology to its benefit on the battlefield. Those technologies will soon spill over to the nation's entire economic system where it stimulates economic growth. Thus, this economic mechanism eventually drives society to industrialization.But industrialization only gets man rich, not democratic. Man has a built-in need for recognition, an irrational need to prove himself, his \\"glory\\", to humanity. In what we know as the \\"state of nature\\", man did this violently, or else he was enslaved. This arrangment of masters and slave, or kings and serfs, was secure until economic progress fundementally and irreversable changed our societal make up. Man is not satisfied with merely become rich, he wants have dignity, or rather, he wants to be equal. While other economic systems can provide certain levels prosperity (his comments on communism might surpise some), unless man is provided a place to compete and be \\"recognized\\" as man, money isn't enough. A liberal democracy is the end point of that demand and best provides for that outlet in man. Thus, the economic mechanism of capitalism grafts onto mans desire for \\"recognition\\" and, voila, we have Democratic Capitalism.Beyond this linear arguement, there are many other interesting discussions on how our new view of history affects foriegn policy and how man may settle into this final stage. And while liberal democracy achieves a philosophical coherence that cannot be surpassed, there are causes for concern. Fukuyama's discussion of these are sobering. There is an inherent tension between mans desire for recognition (that is, to be distinguished) and society's emphasis on equality. Fukuyama presents the \\"last man\\" as exhausted, not triumphant.One would think that a book where Hegel, Plato, and Nietzche are the stars of the show might be a bit dry. Not at all. I found the book both informative and enjoyable. Fukuyama's prose and organization are tight, readable, and sometimes witty.Those who argue that this book is a work of \\"American triumphalism\\" in the wake of the fall of 1989 either has not read the book, or willfully misrepresents it. The same goes for those who sneeringly dismiss it after 9/11. He bends over backwards to emphasize that historical events will not end. He even shows how a liberal democracy might even slip back into some previous form of government. Howevever, what is central to this book, is that our system won't evolve philosophically. A different government will always be one from the past (Islamic facism is no philosophical progression, but rather a throwback to earlier thought that we evove from because of its blaring conradiction). Further, the triumphalist charge is particularly weird being that this is a Hegelian argument liberal democracy was inevitable for mankind. America was the result, not the cause of History. Sorry, but Reagan is never even mentioned.Essentially this book forces you to ask yourself, if liberal democracy isn't for everyone, or isn't the best, what would a perferable political order look like? I have yet to hear someone argue for an altogether new system (Fukuyama points out that he hasn't either), no matter the length of one's list of liberal democracies' shortcomings. The End of History gives an answer for why this is the case."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"i have read the THE END OF HISTORY AND THE LAST MAN in chinese version,which enlighten us to rethink the Hegel,marxism,and the democracy."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"It's really hard to top that priceless review below, but I'll give it a shot. It's really amazing that after about seven years of hindsight, people are still writing rave reviews of this book for its amazing philosophical insights. Fukuyama himself had to back-pedal several times to qualify the bubbling optimism he expressed in the early nineties about the final victory of liberal democracy and the &quot;end of History&quot; (he essentially refutes his own thesis in the conclusion to this book). It's also quite interesting that none of the reviewers who loved this book so much noted the inherent contradiction in Fukuyama's use of Marxist philosophical methods to arrive at a &quot;non-Marxist conclusion,&quot; or his continuous extolling of Hegel as some sort of predecessor to liberal democracy. Hegel was hardly democratic in outlook (he greatly admired the powerful and autocratic Prussian state) and he can rightfully be considered an early proponent of an exclusive northern German nationalism. Fukuyama's book is very flawed, and should have been relegated to the dustbin of history (no capital &quot;H&quot;) long ago."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"The book is written by a very intelligent man, and presents the idea that Liberal Democracy is the peak of human social development. 1st of all, democracy, ...and even representative democracy is impossible to achieve, given human greed and pride. The autor addresses this, but fails to acknowledge that the super-greedy are practicing a new kind of imperialism where the world is conquered through ownership. Vestigial democracy is very valuable to the super greedy, as it gives them \\"legal\\" claim to aquisition far beyond their needs, even to the point of crushing the vast majority of the world's population into a functional slavery. Author argues that, regardless of flaws and weaknesses, liberal democracy is the best we can do. Maybe that is true. Frightening book -- feels heavily agenda'd. Definitely a valuable read."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama spends most of the book exploring the seminal underpinnings of Universal History as it relates to early Christianity and ultimately the great German Idealist, Hegel: Fukuyama expresses his assiduous thesis with mostly Hegel as his overarching linchpin and with Alexander Kojeve serving as an elegant, clear sighted interpreter.As an evolutionary catalyst threading throughout human history, Fukuyama examines the details of the ever-insistent human trait of \\"Thymos,\\" a driving human impulse for recognition: \\"the primary motor driving history.\\" Fukuyama carefully threads the social implications and political impact of \\"Thymos\\" throughout history and its tenuous development through various less than savory political forms (Authoritarianism, Communism, Fascism) until it arrives at its most counter-balanced form under the current rising epoch of Liberal Democracy.For Fukuyama, the natural culmination of human political and social society ends triumphantly with Liberal Democracy. It is with Liberal Democracy that mankind's needs and wants are most thoroughly satisfied: The balanced state of \\"Isothymia.\\" It is with Liberal Democracy that the passionate drive for recognition of \\"Thymos\\" (and it's most severe condition: \\"megalothymia.\\") is most innocuous.However, as the culmination of human history, modern Liberal Democracy is not without its incipient flaws (the constant tug of war between Liberty versus Equality) or its potential for crippling problems arising from an unchecked \\"megalothymia:\\" Equations that Fukuyama explores with iconoclastic precision with the ever powerful and frightening Friedrich Nietzsche as his intellectual blunt instrument.With Nietzsche as his ruthless gadfly, Fukuyama arrives at the danger of the Last Man: \\"We risk becoming secure and self-absorbed last men, devoid of thymotic striving for higher goals...Men would face the constant danger of degenerating from citizens to mere bourgeois.\\" The problem of the Last Man highlights and outlines current social disintegration in our very own society. (Some brief examples: The poor voter participation, the apathy of our citizens to engage in worthy causes, our lack of community spirit, etc.) If the sickness of the Last Man is left to fester, if it is not addressed, modern Liberal Democracies would \\"grow into a morass of selfish hedonism and community would ultimately dissolve.\\"This book is a fantastic piece of work. I had great fun reading this book and I am sure that I will re-read it again."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Francis Fukuyama's thesis, if I read this book rightly, is that democracy and capitalism are the ultimate in political and economic systems for organizing human society. Democracy spreads power to the broadest base of humans in a given society and capitalism makes the most wealth available to the most people in any given society... or something like that. And thus we find ourselves at the end of history: What this means is that there is no further development possible which is what history is all about - progress toward the best possible economic and political structure for human life.The idea of &#34;history&#34; is more complex than simply recounting the names and dates of various persons, nations and events. It has to do with a purposeful progression of events to a specific goal and once that goal is attained we find ourselves at the end of history and the last man. That doesn't mean there won't be more generations born and that there won't be any more events. It means that, in Fukuyama's case, that what is left is the implementation of democracy and capitalism for more and more of the worlds peoples.The question is, &#34;Is that really all there is to the human journey?&#34; Is democracy and capitalism really the goal towards which the universe has been driving for billions of years?For all intents and purposes, this book is Francis Fukuyama's eschatology! (Google it, or look it up in Wikipedia if you don't know what &#34;eschatology&#34; is). If you read this book, and I did find it a worthwhile thought provoking and readable read, then I recommend you read Jurgen Motmann's &#34;The Coming God&#34; to discover the background for western &#34;eschatological&#34; thinking, and for a different view on what the end of history may mean.

According to Fukuyama, \\"The success of democracy in a wide variety of places and among many different peoples would suggest that the principles of liberty and equality on which they are based are not accidents or the results of ethnocentric prejudice, but are in fact discoveries about the nature of man as man.\\" In the Hegelian sense, then, history is over (Fukuyama, however, certainly did not predict an end to human conflict all together).The most interesting part of the book, in my opinion, was the latter discussion surrounding Nietzsche and his concept of The Last Man. Fukuyama raises an important question: will liberal democracy create a society of \\"men without chests\\"? If history is indeed over, then Nietzschean philosophy illuminates how unsatisfying that endpoint can be."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Social institutions, families, schools, clubs, and churches, play a key role in teaching values. These values underpin society and social interaction.South Africa has a legacy, which saw such institutions torn apart. Deputy President Zuma said to the launch of the Moral Regeneration Movement: \\"something is wrong within the fabric of our society, and that we urgently need to do something about it\\". Repairing this fabric may well require more than retracing the historical causes; building something up is more difficult than tearing it down.The disruption of social institutions has apparently taken place before, even on a global scale. The industrial revolution saw the dramatic change from an agricultural to an industrial society. The shift from gemeinschaft (community) to gesellschaft (society) shattered communities and community institutions. Crime in all major cities increased, families broke down, illegitimacy rates rose and alcohol consumption rocketed. Yet by the middle of the nineteenth century the disruption had began to recede.The book, the Great Disruption tackles the the transition from the industrial to the post industrial era. In the first section, Francis Fukuyama provides evidence of wide scale changes in social order and looks at the depletion of what he calls social capital. In the second section he asks where social order comes from and how it evolves. The third part of the book looks to sources of social order.Charles Handy, the management guru, notes that Fukuyama writes books, which generate heated debate even among those who have not read them. Fukuyama believes that social order once disrupted tends to be remade once again. He sees the world wide social disruption as starting to recede. He does not believe that capitalism depletes calls social capital; in fact,he claims it creates new order to replace the one that it destroyed.This book is thought provoking. Fukuyama raises the very issues, with which South Africa is currently grappling.Churchill once said that first we shape our institutions, and then they shape us. How these institutions should be shaped, and what must be done to shape them remains one of this country's most pressing challenges."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I read End of History for the first time in 1992.

Is democracy the response to human kind problems?

It was, however, the most interesting book I've read in some time. The ideas here are rather subtle and reach far back into the Western philosophical tradition. Most of the reviews (at least those giving the book low rating) don't seem to get this. This is not some simplistic, Euro-centric utopian worldview. It's much more meaningful than that.This could be a difficult book to get through if you have not read Nietzsche, Marx, Hegal, and others. (I realize now that I have been remiss in not pursuing a serious read of Hegel.) This isn't some simplistic screed by another flash-in-the-pan politico; this is deep stuff and requires a lot of work to get the substance.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama's essential thesis is that Liberal Democracy is the political system best suited for human beings. He takes his cue from Hegel, with his theory of the universal history and the historical dialectic, and his conclusion that the dialectic has finally been resolved in the Western liberal political system. The greatest opponent to Hegel's theory was Marx, who contended that as long as there is class inequality, there will be class warfare. Today, however, Marxism stands utterly defeated, and it turns out that many of Marx's objectives, e.g. the least amount of work, the dignity of the worker and pursuit of individual leisure, have actually been achieved in the capitalist liberal democracies. Brushing aside the temporary problem of Islamic fascism, the central theoretical problem then is: Is this a temporary state of affairs, and have we finally reached the end of history, with a system that best serves all the needs of a human being.The task is at once to deal with theoretical questions of the nature of history and listing the actual historical events suited to his thesis. To the theoretical questions, such as Aristotle's idea that History is cyclical and no universal history is possible, his best answer is Natural science. Science and technology will ensure that knowledge survives, and short of a nuclear obliteration of the planet, enough knowledge of the liberal theory and traditions will be left for men to build over again, even after a lull of a few centuries. For the factual evidence, Fukuyama launches into a distilled and often tedious historical account of the progress of democracy in the world. Multiple attempts to find a logical reason that democracy is the best system for a modern industrial society are examined, and none stand up adequately. It is here that the text takes a turn, that was most interesting, and contemporaneously relevant for me.To structure the best political system, one must theorize about the nature of man. In Plato's Republic, Socrates divides the soul into reason, desires/appetites and thymos - the human desire for recognition. The traditional master-slave feudal system was created because amongst the first men, the man with the greatest thymos, staked his life in battle and made the others his slaves. In this way he got the recognition of his fellow men. But these were slaves, and thymos calls for recognition from equals and superiors. Hence, the ceaseless battles between princes. In the English liberal tradition, men like Locke and Hobbes recognized the destabilizing potential of thymos and sought to kill it. This however, creates the bourgeois, which is a contemptible class with no public spirit. Hegel, foreseeing this, sought to keep thymos alive. In Hegel's view, a liberal society must redirect and not kill the thymos, and only then will it fulfill all the three components of the human soul, and become the perfect political system. The thymos of people is directed in activities like mercantilism, politics, and for the vast majority, in sports, adventure seeking and so on. Taking a cue from Machiavelli, excessive thymos is regulated through a system of checks and balances.There are numerous objections one can raise at every turn of this text. Liberal democracy is a generic term, and Fukuyama's usage of it is primarily sourced from the American system. Even in the developed world, the European welfare state models are significantly different the American one. Fukuyama is not sparing in his disdain of economic and environmental rights, that inform a lot of the european states. There are south east asian and chinese models which are capitalist, but not democratic. Traditional social structure in Japan and India still has a significantly greater social importance than the individualistic America. More seriously though, the theory appears forced to fit the facts at times, and it is evident that it is derived from a more nuanced source - in this case Alexandre Kojeve's works. The discussion of democratic transitions around the world are simplistic, and presented to suit the thesis, very often tackled with the same billiard ball mentality that he later reserves for his criticism when discussing the Realpolitik school of policy. At a theoretical level, it is certainly not clear that the human desire for recognition is fulfilled in contemporaray liberal societies, as dramatized in Haneke's Seventh Continent. Fukuyama has obviously influenced the neocon agenda in US, and for that reason enough, it is probably worth reading this book. But as a study of the theory of history, it falls quite short of the mark."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"There are already many good reviews so I will only suggest reading the following books (whose scope is amazingly global) instead of, or in addition to, Fukuyama's peculiar work: 1) Economy: 1.1 \\"Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium\\" by Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke; 1.2 and 1.3: \\"The world economy.

Very few academics take this man seriously, perhaps we should. Essentially, the author allowed himself to be caught up in the wave of triumphalism that followed the fall of Communism 1989-91. Similar mistakes were made by such notable right-wing academics as Samuel Huntingon and John Lewis Gaddis, but none so completely as Fukuyama. When one cuts through the Hegelianism of the author's argument--which stands as a curiosity in itself to anyone with any familiarity with sub-altern studies--one is struck by the author's brazen arrogance: we are at the end of history, liberal-capitalism is the greatest thing ever, hooray for us. If discounting thousands of years of history that chronicle the rise and fall of every system and civilization conceived by mankind sounds reasonable to you, it won't be much of a stretch to accept Fukuyama's argument. Otherwise you may want to consider the momentous events (ethnic wars, religious conflict, etc.) that hint at the less-than-complete acceptance of the liberal-capitalist world order by significant portions of the world population and send this monograph to the pile of works, ancient and new, that ignore the past in favor of a self-serving version of the present."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Toward the end of the Cold War, three very different books were published within five years of each other that sought to explain the likely contours of the inchoate new world order emerging from the implosion of the communist bloc: David Kennedy's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\\" 1989); Francis Fukuyama's \\"The End of History and the Last Man\\" (1992); and Samuel Huntington's \\"The Clash of the Civilizations\\"(1994).The second in this triumvirate is the deepest intellectually, one might even say profound, yet the most widely misunderstood and often ridiculed. The vast majority of critics, I'm convinced, never actually read the book, as Fukuyama's thesis is sober and thoughtful. Unlike Kennedy's thesis, which is based on relative economic growth rates, or Huntington's, which is rooted (I would argue) in cultural anthropology, Fukuyama's argument is built upon the foundation of modern western philosophy. For those, like me, who only have an armchair education in philosophy, \\"The End of History\\" will be both a primer on the basic tenets of liberal political theory and a compelling argument for the spread of both capitalism and democratic representative government.Fukuyama's argument is direct, but cerebral, and fundamentally grounded in the political philosophy of early 19th century German philosopher Georg Hegel, and supported by the further interpretations of Hegel by fellow German Friedrich Nietzsche and the 20th century French-Russian philosopher Alexandre Kojeve.At the dawn of the twenty first century, Fukuyama writes, there were two undeniable trends in global affairs: a movement toward market capitalism on the one hand, and a shift toward liberal democracy on the other. He notes that these two trends are not, at least superficially, mutually reinforcing. In fact, one could argue that they should naturally work against each other. After all, authoritarian regimes in East Asia (Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, China) have proven that dramatic, market-oriented economic growth does not rely on a liberal political order. Indeed, democracy may actually stymie the efficient allocation of central resources toward critical infrastructure projects. Fukuyama sees Hegel's \\"need for recognition\\" as the missing link tying liberal economics with liberal political democracy.This book is broken into five parts. The first two provide a background on the philosophical argument behind \\"The End of History\\" as posited by both Hegel and Marx, who agreed on the basics but reached radically different conclusions on the end point. Fukuyama maintains that politics is more like natural science than art or literature - its trajectory is directional and cumulative, with each generation building upon the efforts of the past, unlike the more liberal arts whose value remains subjective across the ages. (e.g. Are paintings or architecture better today than in ancient Greece or fin-de-siecle France? Depends who you ask. Are we more advanced in physics than those societies? No doubt. Fukuyama claims government is more like physics than art.)I found part three to be the most informative and fascinating. Fukuyama explains that part of the problem with Hegel's focus on \\"recognition\\" in political philosophy is that there is no one word in English that accurately captures the true meaning. Machiavelli spoke of \\"glory,\\" Hobbes of \\"pride,\\" Rousseau of \\"amour-propre,\\" Hamilton of \\"fame,\\" Madison of \\"ambition,\\" and Nietzsche of \\"the beast with red cheeks.\\" Fukuyama makes a strong case for Plato's Greek word \\"thymos,\\" the same word and concept that Jonathan Shay uses to develop his convincing hypothesis on the nature of moral degeneration after close order combat in his brilliant piece \\"Achilles in Vietnam.\\" In short, every man, no matter his station in life, has a natural sense of self-worth, of dignity, and when that sense of personal dignity is violated the reaction can be severe. When we don't live up to our own estimate of thymos we feel shame, and when we do we feel pride. And when someone else, especially those in positions of power or authority, fail to recognize our thymos we feel indignation (or, as Shay wrote about Achilles and soldiers in Vietnam, rage). Thus, a healthy political order needs to be more than a basic social contract between man and his government, exchanging some personal rights in exchange for the ability to acquire property (what the Founders referred to as \\"happiness\\"), a sort of mutual societal non-aggression pact. Rather, it must also somehow serve man's desire for recognition, of his dignity and worth.In part four Fukuyama presents his central thesis of the desire for recognition as the motor of history, looking at the recent past and projecting into the future some of the different ways the desire for recognition will be manifest. He notes that it was present in the people who fought for greater representation in right-wing authoritarian regimes in the 1970s and 1980s (Spain, Greece, South Korea, Philippines, Taiwan, etc.) and against communist dictatorships at the end of the Cold War - and arguably what is driving the Arab Spring movement across North Africa and the Middle East. The governments rocked by pro-democracy movements span most continents and cultures, include nations that have experienced rapid economic growth and others that have been moribund for decades, and have sought to overthrow or dramatically reform regimes that range from the far left to the far right. The common denominator, Fukuyama argues, is that they failed to satisfy the collective thymos of their people, as only liberal democracy can do that.The fifth and final chapter addresses the question of the \\"end of history,\\" what the final end state looks like, the so called \\"last man,\\" as liberal democracies wrestle with their inherent contradiction that they treat unequal people (i.e. based on talent and success) equally.In closing, this is a marvelous, thought-provoking book that, in light of the Arab Spring (depending how that turns out), may come back into fashion nearly a generation after its initial publication. Huntington's \\"Clash of the Civilization\\" may still stand as the leading interpretation of the post Cold War international order, but \\"The End of History\\" is still very much in the race and gaining ground everyday."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I first read this book in 1992/93. At the time I thought it was entertaining, and insightful, especially as it came on the back of the devolution of the Soviet Union.Since its publication, this book has been subject to considerable debate by both adherents and opponents. The book proposes that the liberal democratic system operating a capitalist system is the end point of political history - ie that mankind has settled on a system of government that provides the best approach to regulating human affairs. Given the failure of communism, the failure of dictatorships (of the left and the right), I think this thesis holds true.What opponents of the book/argument don't understand is that the author (I believe) is not suggesting that liberal democracy is not without its flaws, and occasionally will generate significant governance problems. (Take the seriously flawed Florida election ballot counting process in the Bush vs Gore US Federal Presidential election.) But what the thesis suggests is that the system is signficantly robust to work through problems, and deliver benefits on the other side. This ability to hande internal political problems without course to violence or repression is not a trait readily found in other political systems.Fukuayma gets 'beaten' up too often for just suggesting that liberal democracy overall is a good thing, that it works, and it has succeeded other political systems because it works and people overall like it. Opponents of this thesis ought to remember that only in liberal democratic systems can opponents of the prevailing political status quo argue for its change or abolition. Try doing that when subejct to a dictatorship!"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This book deeply impressed me. Before I started reading it, I was skeptical concerning the author's views. But after completing it I can only nod my head in full agreement. Not only does he do an excellent job in articulating and defending his position, the seven years that have passed since the book's publication confirm the trends that he describes. In addition, Mr. Fukuyama is a wonderful writer in that his writing style flows almost like a story. Finally, I would hate to think that potential readers would be reluctant to buy the book fearing that its prognosis for society is a negative one. On the contrary, the message is optimistic. Even inspirational. I would recommend this book even for people who have no interest in history, politics, sociology, or even reading for that matter. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Professor Fukuyama's work brings clarity and breadth of vision to our historical crossroads, even in a post-11 September world. I had long been familiar with the thesis of \\"The End of History and the Last Man\\" -- that in liberal democracy and free-markets, history's progression towards finding the most enlightened structure for organizing society had ended -- and since I was largely in agreement with its premise, had for years declined to read the tome. To my surprise, Fukuyama's work was far more expansive in scope and ambitious than I had presumed: it was not the neo-conservative template that I had been lead to believe. Instead, I encountered a cogent synthesis of the Dialectic's search for Universal History that was as thought provoking as it was entertaining (you know your reading a \\"winner\\" when one trades sleep for time).Many have argued that the books conclusion weakens after 11 September. I disagree: Mr. Fukuyama does not ever say that liberal democracy would succeed in the short-term, but offers the inevitability of its ascendancy over the long-term; thus, Islamic militancy (and its attendant rejection of Western values) need not be seen as anything but yet another collectivist (or theocratic) competitor to liberal democracy -- one ultimately doomed to failure. Moreover, that Mr. Fukuyama stresses the views of Hagel's Last Man -- man seeking self-recognition peacefully-over Hobb's-the man who resigns himself to materialistic coexistence -- suggests a role for the Islamist in the dialectical process: one that may one day lead to genuine democracy in the Middle East.I highly recommend spending the time to formulate your own opinions."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This book is basically vested on Hegel and thymos (search for recognition).Hegel's theories are fundamentally wrong and thymos is not an essential human necessity.As Bertrand Russell explains in his 'Unpopular Essays': 'Hegel's philosophy is so odd that one would not accept him to be able to get sane men to accept it ... I was cured ... by discovering that everything he said on the philosophy of mathematics was plain nonsense.'Nietzsche said that whoever got Hegelitis would never be cured.Russell was cured, Fukuyama not.By vesting his theory on thymos, Fukuyama's comments fail to catch time and again essential facts on the individual, social and international level. The outcome of his reasonings are complete nonsense.Hereafter some examples.To get his Hegelian system working, he has to assume that human nature 'changed over time'(p. 63). I wonder if the selfish genes did the same.'Imperialism ... arises directly out of the aristocratic master's desire to be recognized as superior - his megalothymia.' (p.259)This is plain nonsense. Imperialism is about political / economical power to subject other people in order to get slaves, streams of dividends, territories ... depending on the period and/or the countries.'The desire for religious mastery - that is, the recognition of one's own gods and idols by other peoples - ... is not an undifferentiated struggle for power ... but the struggle for recognition.' (p.259)This is plain nonsense. Religious wars for mastery (were) are about power, territory and capital. E.g. 'A world lit by fire' by W. Manchester: by adhering to Luther, the taxpayers didn't have to pay the compulsory indulgences to the Pope.'The willingness to risk one's life for pure prestige plays such an important role in Hegel's account of history.' (p.150)For Hegel yes, but not for me. All noblemen fought one another with mercenaries (see the parody on the Swiss in Utopia by Thomas More, or E. Luttwak). No soldier will ever put his life in danger. However the nobility used the argument of the 'risk of their life for the defense of the country' in order to get a tax exempt status.One of the crucial factors for the outbreak of the first World war was, for Fykuyama, the fact ' that many European publics simply wanted war because they were fed up with the dullness and lack of community in civilian life.' (p.331)I doubt if firmly. But I am sure that one of the crucial factors was the fact that the Kaiser felt that his empire was threatened. He didn't fight (he had no thymos), but fled his country at the end of the war as a thief in the night. (Stefan Zweig: The World of Yesterday).His final thesis that liberalism vanquished nationalism ( = the End of History) is an illusion. Nationalism (the survival of the nation) will always be stronger than liberalism for it serves the essential human characteristic of survival (of the genes).For me, this book is a classic example of what Jean Fourasti&eacute; called a 'conceptual delirium'.But more importantly, the author is on the side of war and not of peace. As another great philosopher stated 'Hegel's war of nations became Marx's war of classes and Hitler's war of races', a truly disastrous opinion with deadly intellectual and physical consequences.N.B. In the 'Assembly of Women' by Aristophanes, the assembly doesn't force handsome boys to marry ugly women, but forces handsome boys to have sex with older women before they could marry the girl of their choice.

It took me many chapters to see where Francis Fukuyama was going with this book. In some ways I think he could have condensed the whole thing down and gotten to the points of his argument more clearly. Yet, in the end, I learned something that will allow me to have more insite into the human condition than before. This makes the book well worth the effort. One of the main points is that history has direction, in short: we get closer to a theoretical goal rather than just move through time doing things. I think he takes too many chapters in &quot;proving&quot; this but it is a basic foundation to the rest of the work. Another main point of the book is that democracy is the end of history. That in democracy society has found the best way to achieve the goal of history. What is the goal, a complex satisfaction of Thymos or, put way too simply, the ability to feel good about yourself. Now here I have a problem with thinking that this is the end of history simply because we haven't been at this stage long enough. I personally think that democracy came about because more people got more educated and we have along way to go in getting people educated. Therefor it is possible that a new system will be developed that will make democracy passe. The clarity I got out of this book was a language regarding human satisfaction that was better than I had before. It is complex, especially when you take it from one human to human society, but of great interest to anyone interested in knowing what can make things better. That's both in a macro ways, such as if you are Bill Gates or the President of the United States, or in micro ways such as if you are just running a small business or interacting with a circle of friends. All in all very, very well worth the time.Bill"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Yoshihiro Francis Fukuyama (born 1952) is an American political scientist, political economist, and author, who has also written books such asOur Posthuman Future : Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution. He wrote in the Introduction to this 1992 book, \\"The distant origins of the present volume lie in an article ... which I wrote... [in] 1989. In it, I argued that a remarkable consensus concerning the legitimacy of liberal democracy as a system of government had emerged throughout the world... as it conquered rival ideologies like hereditary monarchy, fascism, and most recently communism... I argued that liberal democracy may constitute the 'end point of mankind's ideological evolution' and the 'final form of human government,' and as such constituted the 'end of history.'\\" (Pg. xi)He suggests, \\"What is emerging victorious... is not so much liberal practice, as the liberal IDEA... for a very large part of the world, there is now no ideology with pretensions to universality that is in a position to challenge liberal democracy.\\" (Pg. 45) He notes, \\"For capitalism has proven far more efficient than centrally planned economic systems in developing and utilizing technology, and in adapting to the rapidly changing conditions of a global division of labor, under the conditions of a mature industrial economy.\\" (Pg. 91)He admits that \\"Liberal democracy may be more functional for a society that has already achieved a high degree of social equality and consensus concerning certain basic values... Democracy is also not particularly good at resolving disputes between different ethnic or national groups.\\" (Pg. 118-119)Later, he proposes, \\"it would seem natural that liberal democracy, which seeks to abolish the distinction between masters and slaves by making men the masters of themselves, should have different foreign policy objectives altogether.\\" (Pg. 279)He states, \\"The question of the end of history then amounts to a question of ... whether liberal democracy adequately satisfies the desire for recognition... or whether it will remain radically unfulfilled and therefore capable of manifesting itself in an entirely different form.\\" (Pg. 289) He concludes, \\"If it is true that the historical process rests on the twin pillars of rational desire and rational recognition, and that modern liberal democracy is the political system that best satisfies the two in some kind of balance, then it would seem that the chief threat to democracy would be our own confusion about what is really at stake.\\"Fukuyama's book is of interest to students of history, politics and current events, as well as futurists/transhumanists."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I felt compelled to write a review for The End of History and the Last Man because many of the reviews written on Amazon have either misunderstood the thesis, ignored the thesis, reduced the thesis to simplicity or \\"reviewed\\" the book only to attack what they believed the thesis to be because of a dislike for Francis Fukuyama, whom they consider to be a neoconservative.\\"Fukuyama's thesis can be stated as such: liberal democracy constitutes the end point of man's kind ideological evolution and the final form of human government. The term \\"end of history\\" was borrowed from Hegel who declared the end of history after Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Jena in 1806. Hegel believed the American and French Revolutions embodied the principles of liberty and equality and that liberal states were free from internal contradictions. The rise of the liberal state ended the Hegelian dialectic process. Many of Fukuyama's ideas were borrowed form philosopher French-Russian Alexander Kojeve. Kojeve believed Hegel to be correct and he considered the \\"universal and homogenous\\" state to be the end of man's socio-economic evolution; progression beyond liberal democracy is impossible. For Kojeve, the supremacy of liberal democracy meant not only the end of man's political evolution, but the end of philosophy as well. Philosophers had no other purpose but to embrace the emergence of liberal democracy and support ways to achieve its universality.Fukuyama dismisses the idea of a cyclical history. Rather, viewing history as linear and having a propensity for progress. Unlike other philosophers that dismiss or relegate the importance of human nature to history, Fukuyama thesis is centered on human nature. There exist two mechanisms that drive a Universal History and the eventual \\"end\\" of liberal democracy being modern natural science and thymos, which translates into \\"spiritedness.\\" The concept of thymos comes from Plato but Fukuyama uses Hegel's \\"struggle for recognition\\" as a proper definition. Man is not simply an animal of desire, instinct or pure reason. Neither is man simply an economic animal. Man has an innate desire to be recognized by other men. Hegel's first man was a man willing to die in bloody battle solely for pride and recognition. This idea trumps Hobbes' first man whose primary motivation is the desire for self-preservation.Thus liberal democracy is the only political system that can fulfill man's desire for recognition. Man's desire for recognition causes conflicts in political systems, such as communism, feudalism, monarchy and fascism. In a liberal democracy, man's struggle for recognition is satisfied by \\"universal and reciprocal\\" recognition. Fukuyama goes in to further detail how liberal democracy is able to fulfill other forms of man's thymos in religion, economics and international affairs. In economics, work is not only a means for survival and material acquisition but also a means for recognition via success and social mobility.The End of History and the Last Man was published in 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union. This event marked the collapse of communism as a rival contender to liberal democracy, and somewhat vindicated Hegel and Kojeve's beliefs in the \\"end of history\\" and the supremacy of liberal democracy. The book is not without its faults. It is classified under \\"political philosophy\\" so it was not meant to provide empirical proof for the supremacy of liberal democracy. Fukuyama does not provide a strong definition of liberal democracy, nor compare the merits and shortcomings of varying forms of liberal democracy such as presidential systems, parliamentary systems, and federalist systems. Even the \\"struggle for recognition\\" may be false since it puts man only in the purview only of other men and their opinions, while avoiding the possibility of man being driven by personal desires with no regard for the recognition of other men i.e. individualism. Also, liberal democracies do have certain contradictions, such as the ability of the majority to infringe on the rights of a minority and income inequalities.Contrary to what some reviewers and authors have written, Fukuyama does not state that the \\"end of history\\" will result in the end of historical events or conflict. Some have suggested that the existence of China's authoritarian government, which restricts political rights and allows some economic rights but has been able to obtain continual high rates of economic growth, undermines Fukuyama's thesis and provides a functional alternative model for modernizing states. For this proposition to be true, one would have to argue that China's system of government is a universal model for a political system AND a system that history, i.e. states, will progress towards. Both are simply not true.I do not agree entirely with the book but I still found it very intriguing and thought provoking. Disregard reviewers that claim that the book is simple or \\"foolish.\\" Fukuyama takes little information for granted and he cites nearly every idea, proposition and fact. He uses ideas from various political philosophers such as Hegel, Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Jefferson and Nietzsche (to name a few) in order to construct and support his assertions. This is a monumental work and should be required reading for high school and college students (whether or not one agrees with the thesis)."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama's far fetched and frankly irrelevant theories bore me, I'm afraid to say. This was the book that introduced me to that way of thinking - it's basically written by a wealthy American academic (who has spent most of his life employed by the US government), claiming that the American capitalist system has conquered all political alternatives, surpassing even that of democracy and especially that of communism. Capitalism is, for Fukuyama, the end of the evolution of man and the start of an eternal status quo. This idea is laughable in concept and is further ridiculed by his over-selective choice of material which is already outdated. Clearly it is his ideal world - but I not sure that everyone shares it and even less sure that we have reached it."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"With the arrogance of Hegel some 200 years ago, Fukuyama, a coddled, Washington beltway &quot;think-tank&quot; elitist--long on theory unsupported by empirical data and short on practical experience of the real world--proclaims American global Capitalism of the Reagan era (this came out just on the cusp of our current dizzying hi-tech computer decade) to be the &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; (if I may paraphrase &quot;Candide&quot;). Would that Fukuyam had just an iota of Hegel's intellect to balance the presumptous arrogance. One reviewer said this should be mandatory reading &quot;even for the lay person&quot;! Folks, this Is written FOR the layperson BY a layperson! Fukuyama, like all political hacks, selectively chooses the data that supports his theories and ignores everything else that would embarrass them. He is considered a laughable hack by all serious Historians and current affairs global analysts. His writing is the apotheosis of comfortable, elite, armchair detachment that the ignorant, conformist &quot;gray flannel dwarves&quot; love to eat up to placate their gnawing insecurities that the future of the planet cannot, perhaps, be so neatly and cleanly understood. Fukuyama has never been hungry, underpaid, unappreciated, or exploited, has never worked on a production line for subsitance wages, has never likely gotten dirt or grease under the finger nails of his finely manicured soft white hands out of necessity (but perhaps to amuse himself Sunday afternoon in the rose garden). Neitzsche was dead on target about guys like this. The &quot;best of all possible worlds&quot; that Fukiyama envisions--and even claims is here already--is absolute death for anyone with a soul. But that world is not here, and never will be, despite the pathetic efforts of all who espouse his credo. God has not &quot;retired&quot; and turned over his authority to the Hegels and Fukuyamas of the world, much as they would like to believe it. The &quot;universal cyclone&quot; of history is known to God alone, and sweeps away all things known in the present, but it is most shocking to arrogant poseurs like Fukuyama who claim authority that is not theirs."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I like reading old books on the future to see how right or wrong the writer was in what he said.

Societies rise, and societies fall, and in the last phase, there is always the \\"Last Man\\" as defined by Friedrich Nietzsche: someone who cares about nothing but his own comfort. Fukuyama's conclusion that liberal democracy is the ultimate end of this final stage should chill all of us, as he seems to be suggesting that political systems such as our own are best for bringing about this Last Man stage. I would recommend this book to people who want a modern view of Marxism, but for those who would like realistic philosophy that does not assume that history culminates in our present age, I would recommend Nietzsche's \\"Daybreak\\" instead."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"I remember when Richard Dawkin's selfish gene was taken literally by a member of Parlement, who wondered if the opposition party was afflicted by the genetic disorder. Fukuyama's \\"End of History\\" has been taken the same way. This is a fabulous work about the philosophical \\"Last Man\\", not about the final homo-sapien. Once past the title, this work expresses some of the best philosophical thinking about our current society. It's \\"final\\" supposition may speak correctly about capitalism and democracy but the future is full of other possibilities, so I would oppose that position. However, as a superb explaination of 20th-21st century man, this work has no competition."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama's persistence that history has come to an end reflects all that is wrong with our current socio-economic system. I would contend that it is the tension between democratic principles (by the people, for the people) and capitalist ideology (by the corporate, for the corporate) that is a defining feature of our times. How can one man proclaim the end of history? Furthermore, how can a mass of people shrug their shoulders and say, \\"Huh? O.K.\\" From the corporate domination of information via ownership of the media and the hoodwinks of soft money campaign contributions by corporate sponsors on the government level, to the insatiable appetites of consumers, the proliferation of television survival shows and the marketing of well-tanned teens as pop star commodities on the consumer level, we can easily see a society of unfulfilled expectations, watered-down spectator culture, deferred gratifications, and strictly defined \\"alternatives.\\" Is this what mankind has strived for through years of strife, death, and struggle? If history does indeed have a teleology, surely its consummation is more than this. What exists at the moment is not a perfectly realized ideal born of any \\"democratic\\" dialectic of history. It is rather, a deeply-flawed system balanced in favor of the elite. To counter the revolutionary texts of Marx and Engels, capitalism created for itself a new agenda - consumerism. In the words of a famous guy: \\"We have everything that we want and nothing that we need.\\" Fukuyama's book is the worst type of post-modern garbage. It is that type which asks us to revel in our trash culture, to breathe in the dizzying fumes of its bloated corpse because hey, it smells so good! If we as a culture and a people allow ideological garbage derivative of Fukuyama's \\"End of History and the Last Man\\" to penetrate our Americentric minds any further we will be in serious trouble of becoming the world's largest self-fulfilling prophecy. In Nietzsche's \\"Also sprach Zarathustra,\\" he describes the last man: \\"He blinks.\\" Don't be just another blinking TV eye, people. Participate, learn, think critically. History is only over if WE say it is."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama's book is very well written, easy to read and fun. In the end, however, the fundamental premise is unbelievable, and the facts he presents do not appear to support the conclusion. His argument that liberal democracy will win out is based on history since about 1970. Extrapolating a grand historical drama from 20 or 30 years worth of data is unconvincing.I have also read Huntington's book, &quot;The Clash of Civilizations,&quot; against which Fukuyama is frequently compared. Huntington is nowhere near as well written, and while his fundamental premise is more plausible, the data he presents is equally suspect. The major difference between the two books is the authors' attitudes toward western civilization: Huntington claims that it is declining, while Fukuyama asserts it is marching toward inexorable victory. Leaving aside grand philosophical questions about the scope of history, I think Fukuyama is closer to the truth on this issue.I recommend reading &quot;The End of History.&quot; Just don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"As many other pointed out, so many people misunderstand this book after 9-11. For Islamic fundamentalism cannot threat our society as an alternative ideology, I do not think Fukuyama's main point was overthrown because of the terrorist attacks.Yet my problem lies elsewhere. I admit that Fukuyama shows a great skill in his lucidness to describe the Universal History, and his thesis carries an overwhelming atmosphere of plausibility. I do agree that history \\"seems\\" to be directional at least so far. But seeming plausible doesn't guarantee that his logic is sound, nor it can conceal its intellectual sloppiness. Where is the \\"evidence\\" that human history is driven by the human consciousness? IMHO, the whole thesis rests on a nebulous foundation, Hegel's idealism, which rests on his metaphysics, i.e., Hegelian Geist, dialectics and holism.It is mystery to me that Fukuyama uses these gaseous metaphysical concept as his axiom from which he deduce all the conclusions. Before Fukuyama, it was generally considered that Hegelian view of history was shattered by the logical positivism and analytic philosophy spearheaded by Bertrand Russell and Vienna Circle during the early 20th century. To counter this point, Fukuyama boasts in p349 \\"Superficial misreading of Hegel in the empiricists or positivist tradition are legion.\\" But he never offers his reasoning why he thought it's superficial. To me, Hegelian view cannot stand his metaphysics. Russell's attack on the enterprise of Hegelian idealism was much more rock solid than Fukuyama's gaseous propositions."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"There is no End To History. It goes on in multiple ways, no matter how much triumphalist rhetoric celebrated the illusory, temporary \\"victory\\" of a fleeting form of neoliberalism (not true democracy) in the late 20C. With such a foundation of sand, the pretentious Hegelianism that rests on it is superfluous and insupportable. Two stars for stimulating debates (mostly the original article), and for coining a neat phrase. But there's no \\"there\\" there, at least not enough to successfully transition from article to full-length book. BTW, Fukuyama's institutional connections do not impress. Like many intellectuals who align with statist and corporatist views, he prefers to hide in unaccountable think tanks that function as echo chambers. Facing bright students in open and honest class discussion, let alone the peer-review process or independent-minded academics, is not for the likes of him."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Fukuyama is Director of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Relations, and is thus in a position to directly influence the thinking of the rising generation of diplomatic professionals, those who will conduct American foreign policy for the next several decades. Therefore, this book is of great significance, whatever its other merits may be.His thesis, to inadequately summarize it, is that the classical (Platonic) understanding of human nature provides the framework upon which the modern liberal (small \\"l\\") democratic form of government is laid. He further believes that the rise of natural science in the past 400 years has given directionality to history. In laying out this thesis he makes extensive use of the ideas of Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Hegel, and Neitzsche, with dollops of Machiavelli, Pascal, Rousseau, Marx, and Strauss.Fukuyama is not a simplistic thinker or a dogmatist. He makes a straightforward proposition and puts it out there for discussion. There are obvious flaws in it. For example, who is to say that the spread of liberal democracy in the past 50 years is not due simply to the growth of American military and economic strength and influence, rather than to a mysterious Hegelian force? What happens as advances in natural science deepen our understanding of human nature, perhaps invalidating the classical model? Or if we learn how to truly CHANGE human nature, not just to force it into a Marxist Procrustean bed?Fukuyama's thesis is very interesting, but it can be proved or disproved only by the passage of time. And as Fukuyama himself shows us, predicting the future is a fool's game.On a recent C-Span panel, Fukuyama stated that he had opposed the US intervention in Iraq, although he felt that now that we were there we had to see it through to the establishment of a democratic polity. The reason he gave for his opposition was, as I understood it, that since terrorism is a reaction to modernity, our forcing modernity on Islamic peoples will just exacerbate the problem. This is a good illustration of the inadequacy of political theory as a guide to political action."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This book deserves more than 5 stars. It is a masterpiece.I was not impressed by the title itself, because anynone familiar with mainstream philosophical thoughts should be familiar with Hegel's concept of a) end of History, with the replacement of the Feudal and Monarchic systems with democracies and b) struggle for recognition. The Book sounded like a repetition.However, although the concepts that Fukuyama discusses, when taken each independently, are not new, Fukuyama ties it all together in a very logical, seamless sequence.Fukuyama updates Hegel's work, to provide clear evidence to the inevitable direction of History toward the rational model of Liberal Democracies, by dissecting the major events and ideologies that took place or have prevailed during the past 300 years or so. He does so to confirm Hegel's point of view, after the atrocities committed by Man in the 20th century, and the resulting doubts about the positive evolution of man.His interpretation of events and of the evolution of the Human mindset/Psyche, is done along three defining dimensions: that of a) desire, b) Reason and c) Thymos ( I believe a Platonic symbolic division of man). Desire chracterizes modern consumerist and capitalistic society (Liberal economies). Reason is our belief in science and the adoption of science that has allowed industrialization. Thymos is what makes the essence of man. It is his self esteeem, his desire to be recognized. It can be destructive, as in the case of fundamentalism or facism, if not controlled or subdued.Practically any Political system/society/ideology can be analyzed as a mix of the three dimensions above. Liberal democracy is the most rational model, because recognition is universally shared by everyone, and thus everyone is recognized equally.I have always been interested in philosophy. Fukuyama's book has allowed me to grasp some important philosophical concepts with much more depth. I would also say that many political events in the world today have become more intelligible. Events are not random and independent, they are tied together and move along an inevitable path."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"This is really a spectacular work.

In fact Fukuyama first presented a paper with the book's basic arguments many months before the fall of the USSR and before just about anyone thought that fall was imminent. But beyond that, Fukyama made perfectly clear in this book that a very large part of the world (the Islamic part) had not yet accepted democracy. No great insight, you might say, but my point is that he is not so stupid as to try to pound square pegs into round holes. Most importantly, he has an extremely interesting discussion of \\"recognition,\\" something many have said plays an enormous role in politics without explaining what the demand for recognition IS. Even Huntington says that people are more attached to cultural identities than to anything else, but you won't find such a thoughtful extended discussion of the topic in his book or anywhere else, including books on multiculturalism.

(Can anybody help me find a bona-fide printed source for this gem or is it just an unsubstantiated annecdote?). What a surprise to find how wonderfully and intentionally misleading (or titillating?) this title was.This is one of those books which, in spite of reading it with a pen in hand and marking it up copiously, when I reached the end I felt a compelling need to read it again.

In other words, the book is great because it forcefully presents an argument and makes the reader think critically about man as a political creature and what ultimately satisfies.However, the book does have some distracting peculiarities. First, Fukuyama's obsession with Hegel. Sometimes, you get the feeling that Hegel is plugged in just for the name value; it often doesn't advance the case. Fukuyama spends forever defending the idea of the linearity of history, when it could have been done more succinctly. (On that note, Fukuyama invited critical scorn upon himself with such a pompous book title. Fukuyama totally ignores man's other pursuits, like religion, and puts political dreams as the ultimate.) And not all the chapters reinforced each other; (you get the feeling sometimes Fukuyama just strung together his journal articles or something.)But the book has real strenghts. Fukuyama's insights into Nietzsche's critique of democracy is priceless. Also, I really enjoyed Fukuyama's treatment of the Hegelian &quot;thymotic&quot; origins of state.In short, Fukuyama's ambitious work is a good read, will make you think, but not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"&quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; is about the philosophy of history, not history itself. The few snippets of history anecdotally included are from modern Western history. Western political philosophy applied to the immediate post-Cold War world, as seen by a student of the usual Western political philosophers -- Plato Locke, Hobbes, Hegel, Nietzsche, and some guy named Kojeve -- is what Fukuyama purveys. It's a fairly readable book, considering the sources and the points he's trying to cover.I do not agree with the author that history is directional, just path-dependant -- though less so than he implies, the vagaries of linguistics and ephemerality of documentation being what they are. I'm not quick to agree that the essence, the soul of a person is a trinity of reason, desire, and thymos (esteem or pride). But if one is willing to at least suspend disbelief, the rest of the book flows reasonably from that premise, and there are significant insights to be gained along the way. The intrinsic sublimation of thymos by liberal democracy into commercial and electoral politics is seen as the primary factor in its successful competition with previous socioeconomic systems. The presumed 'end of history' arises when all nations have become liberal democracies, and compete solely on a nonmilitary basis. Modernization \\"can be understood as the gradual victory of the desiring part of the soul, guided by reason, over the soul's thymotic part.\\"His characterization of liberal democracy as the best of all possible worlds and its citizens as the 'last men' is tiresome in usage and presumptuous in conception. In liberal democracy as a thesis or paradigm (see Thomas Kuhn), problems will be discovered over time, which will be synthesized with durable aspects of liberal democracy into a new paradigm. An antithesis is not required for a new synthesis, just unsolved problems with better paradigmatic solutions and a crisis of belief among adherents of the predominant paradigm. Fukuyama does add a limited qualification at the end, raising the relativism of liberal democracy (which makes it consider itself as of less than absolute virtue and value; this is theoretical) and its corrosive effect on social cohesion in favor of economic flexibility (decidedly practical) as the leading problems.Treatment of three keys issues would strengthen the book: the hegemonic master-slave relationship between the US and the rest of the world; the translation of the various philosophical theoretical considerations into sources of social power (see Michael Mann); and, while history is path-dependant, it is not teleologicaly directional: there is lack of directionality in the selection regime for States (see Jared Diamond, Stephen Jay Gould or any other evolutionary biologist). It's the power, every day, all day, that matters. There is no Promised Land at The End of Universal History -- just another hill on the road for the wagon to climb (or descend).

He does not worry that other dogs are doing better than him, or that his career as a dog has stagnated, or that dogs are being oppressed in distant parts of the world.

We have not come very far in the last 1000 years at all.This book and its central tenet are fraudulent."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"\\"So philosophy, as it expires in the arms of truly historical thinking, can no longer glorify its world without denying it, for even in order to express itself it must assume that the total history in which it has vested everything has come to an end, and that the only court capable of ruling on truth or falsehood has been adjourned.\\"- Guy Debourd \\"The Society of the Spectacle\\" (1967)"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Quite possibly one of the best and clearest explications of Hegel's Universal History as it pertains to our modern times: The thoughts of Alexandre Kojeve, Emmanuel Kant, and Nietzsche are neatly synthesized into a vigorous thesis: Liberal Democracy and freedom are the culmination, the apogee, of human history.Please note: Fukuyama is associated with the Neo-conservative movement. Hence, you will notice many dishonest reviewers on this board who have given this book a poor rating because they have a political axe to grind. I suspect that most of these individuals either read some portions of the book, never read the book at all, or are relying on someone else's interpretation. Do not be swayed by intellectual dishonesty. Whether or not you disagree or agree with Fukuyama's political viewpoints, it should be admitted that this is an excellent work of political philosopy and history."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"In an economic world, we all analize economic and political facts based on materialist theories (Marxist theory of value). Fukuyama shows us a differnt way of thinking that lets us understand past, present and future events."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Published in the early 1990s, this book puts forth the thesis that the end of the Cold War, and its victory by the US, marked a significant turning point in history. Specifically, mankind can see the light at the end of the tunnel of history, that the liberal democracy that is America at the end of the Cold War is pretty close to a perfect society and once every society reaches this stage, mankind has reached the end of history. No more wars, no more revolutions, no more upheavals, etc, etc. Of course, events in the next decade up to and after the 9-11/2001 terrorist attacks proved this book all wrong. Mankind is nowhere near the end of history; in fact we might be staring at a very long war between established governments and multinational terrorist groups. And the dot.com bust, the Enron and related scandals, and now the economic and social wreckage due to a summer's worth of hurricanes shows that liberal democracies like the US are not even close to being optimal societies in terms of managing people - people or people - nature relationships. I believe this book is even more foolish; that its thesis and its premise was flawed even in 1993, and that the author should have known better than to publish such bullcrap.First, the human population continues to grow. Yet the amount of arable land and drinkable water is not increasing. This can only lead to conflicts. It led to conflicts in the past, and will only lead to more conflicts in the future. We are seeing it happen already; every year the SW states in the USA duke it out in courts over water access. Every year the Jews and Palestinians in Israel bicker over water access. And of course we have at least one war per decade over oil; whether it be in the Middle East or somewhere else. As the world's population grows, we are only going to have more wars, and since wars make great history, a lot more history to go thru.Second, the author's premise that America is a liberal democracy is totally false. America is a corporate democracy. Pull over 100 people on any American city street (D.C. excepted) and ask them who their congressmen is, or who their state representative is, or even who their mayor is, and after a slight pause, the most common answer would be \\"I DO NOT KNOW\\". On the other hand, ask him/her how their 401K is doing, or how is their mutual fund performing, and you will get a certain answer. This discrepancy of awareness and involvement between civic society and the corporate world can only mean one thing; America is a corporate democracy. An even more potent sign; many of the prisons, schools, and health care facilities in the US are increasingly run in part or in whole by corporations. Three of the most fundamental aspects of any society; criminal punishment, health care, and education, are run by corporations in the US.Third, democracies don't always last. A Roman Republic over 300 years old converted to dictatorship in under a century. The area that is now Poland was comprised of democratic states throughout the Middle Ages. These were successively conquered by their bigger neighbors (France, Germany, Russia) and subjected to dictatorships. The Native American tribes throughout the N. American continent were all democracies in the purest sense of the word. From 1776 - 1910, each and every single one of them was either destroyed, displaced, or absorbed by one nation that only allowed white males to rule; the USA.Last, in any given time period, the democratic nations that exist are usually expanding their possessions, usually be conquering less democratic nations. Semi-democratic, aristocratic England conquered the Middle East and India. Democratic France conquered N. Africa. And of course the US has defeated or taken over various countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, all of which were less democratic than the US. Democracy does not put an end to man's greed, it only channels it outwards towards its neighbors near and far.All in all, a book of false conclusions based on false premises. It is worthy of reading if only to see the mistakes in its logic and arguments."},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"Reviews typically focus on the &quot;end of history&quot; part of Fukuyama's argument, and tend to forget the &quot;last man&quot; part (the former derived from Hegel and the later from Nietzsche). But they cannot be separated, and it is the last man argument that is particularly trenchant today. Are we willing to forgo any comfort or security _at all_ (never mind major sacrifices) to vindicate a closely held value? I think the reaction of the French and the Germans to recent events indicates that we are indeed becoming the &quot;men without chests.&quot;"},{"Title":"The End of History and the Last Man","review":"A great book has a kernel of an idea so profound that you will never forget it. This is such a book. Once human beings have &quot;discovered&quot; liberal democracy, once they have tasted freedom, that discovery can never be forgotten. You'd have to erase the collective memory of man to subjugate the world again.The march of freedom is inexorable.

More importantly, it's a fascinating insight into failures of corporate governance and the consequent service failures and collapse of public trust.With chapters entitled &quot;Where were the non-executives?&quot; and &quot;Where were the auditors?&quot;, it provides neat foreshadowing to well publicized private sector failures to come. While governance conditions in the PtL were extreme, I believe that many of the warning signs shown in this book are relevant to the private, public and not-for-profit sectors.Not only that, but I found this book really easy to read, gripping even."},{"Title":"The Windsors: A Dynasty Revealed","review":"Based on research done for a TV documentary of the same name, this book covers the same ground that Elizabeth Longford's &quot;The Royal House of Windsor&quot; does but with a more objective than personal view. This is to be expected because neither author shares the intimacy with the Royal Circle that Lady Longford does. As a result this book focuses more on the historical events that swirled around the Royals than on the personalities of the Royals; yet by their actions, the book still tells a lot about them as individuals.Both books should be read if you want to make sense of current events in the House of Windsor. Read Elizabeth Longford's book first, and this book second. Both sets of authors conclude that the House of Windsor will survive. That is to be expected of a dedicated royalist such as Longford. That Brendon and Whitehead came to the same conclusion appeared more to be a lack of nerve in the end than of reasoned conviction."},{"Title":"Wayward Threads (Jewish Lives)","review":"In Wayward Threads Robert Goldmann creates the equivalent of a snapshot album of his life. The images vary in size and intensity, but all are genuine and document vividly the difficult times he experienced as a Jew in Nazi Germany and as an immigrant in the US. Through the prism of a pesonal perspective, the historical events come alive and lose their abstract quality. The microcosm of the small German village of Reinheim reflects the politics of Germany. The reader can identify with the microcosm because it has a face and is filled not with statistical tables and dates but by real people. It is a book of reconciliation as is Robert Goldmann's life which he has devoted to international understanding."},{"Title":"Intelligence and Strategy: Selected Essays (Studies in Intelligence)","review":"This book primarily covers the intelligence activities of England from the end of World War I through the end of World War II. There is a some discussion of activities going back as far as the mid 1800's and to quite recent times as viewed from relatively current publications of the doctrine manuals of the US Army.Note here that this is a coverage of all aspects of intelligence, not just the codebreaking that has been the subject of so many books in recent years. Code breaking is discussed, but so is the use of the material so obtained and the use of other types of intelligence such as old fashioned spies or whatever. Then he talks about the uses of intelligence by the various commanders in the field. Sometimes they used it well, sometimes, like with McArthur he ignored it if it didn't fit into his plans. He also comments on the counter intelligence operations conducted by the various countries during World War II.Dr. Ferris brings in a lot of new data, and a few new conclusions that reflect his own analysis of what was going on at the time. He also shows some interesting side lights, for instance in researching a relatively minor war in the 1920's he finds documents from the commanders of both sides in the files. The conclusion was clear that during these years when most of us assume not much was happening, someone (in England) was intercepting and was breaking the codes of both powers. Codebreaking didn't fall into Allied hands with the Enigma machine, it had been going on all along."},{"Title":"OOPS!: The Manners Guide for Girls (American Girl Library)","review":"I got this book when I was twelve.

This book teaches girls the fundmentals of having good manners (i.e. first impressions, body language, house guests, nosy questions, etc. ) without being fussy and too prudish. They have quizzes that you can take to test your etiquette when it comes to hosting parties, the outdoors and how to deal with horrible house guests. The book is divided into chapters that put you in compromising positions where your manners can make or break you. They cover absolutely everything you could possibly think of; traveling in a foreign country, how to write the perfect party invitation, how to act in public, everything. They even have solutions on how not to interrupt people when they are talking and how not to bore people when you're initiating a conversation and how to address unmarried women, married women and young girls (i.e. Mrs. Ms. or Miss?)

The great house, of course, is a symbol of England (as it so often is in the English novel), and Playfair's work is a fairly sophisticated and earnest attempt to grapple with some of the larger questions posed by the second World War to the English people: is it possible to ever go back to \\"normal\\"? Was it a mistake to attempt to go back to \\"norma;\\" after the first World War? Must people be willing to sacrifice willingly if anything is to be learned from the wars at all? The novel thus becomes very much in the tradition of the great essay-novels of the modern period, including Woolf's JACOB'S ROOM and THE YEARS and Wells's CHRISTINA ALBERTA'S FATHER and ANN VERONICA; Playfair is a bit less successful than Woolf or Wells, though, in that her characters are often so idealized. Her heroine Cressida is so beautiful and kind and noble that it is--all too unfortunately--easy to imagine her played by Greer Garson; similarly, her wounded hero Charles Valery, agonized by the war, seems of the Leslie Howard variety. You wish the major characters were as memorable as the minor characters (such as Cressida's formidable wealthy aunt)."},{"Title":"50 hikes in Mount Rainier National Park","review":"Overall this book is well put together. The hikes are organized according to their location in the park so you can quickly find hikes that are close the entrace you are using. The descriptions of each hike are clear and and easy to follow and include a small map of the hike with the description. Each hike is accompanied by color photos which really set this book apart. This is a worthwhile purchase, but it has a couple of downsides:- None of the trails are rated. I really enjoy guides that rate each hike and define their rating system (such as the &quot;Don't Waste Your Time&quot; series) so I can quickly determine what the authors really thought of the hike. When I picked up this book to quickly find a hike to do the next morning I had a hard time figuring out which hikes would be most worthwhile. I ended up picking one close to the entrace I was using since that is how the book is organized.- The maps included with each hike could be more detailed. Having the maps is nice but they aren't very helpful in pinpointing your location on a trail or knowing that the upcoming terrain is going to be like. A full topographical map would be ideal.- It would be nice if each hike had an area for writing notes."},{"Title":"50 hikes in Mount Rainier National Park","review":"The best thing you can say about this umpteenth edition of this guide is that it has some nice color pictures. Even then, though, they aren't always accurate - like the picture of Ranger Falls, which really isn't Ranger Falls, but a lower falls about a quarter-mile down the trail from the real Ranger Falls. Or the picture of the &quot;Avalanche lily&quot; on page 69, which is really a glacier lily. You'd think a pair of old veterans like Ira Spring and Harvey Manning would know things like that.That first photo is on the Green Lake hike, which the author tells you starts at elevation 985 feet. In fact, the elevation at the trailhead is about 2,100 feet. There are several mistakes like this throughout the book, which makes me wonder how carefully the book has been edited. After all, they've had four tries.The maps aren't really maps at all, but confusing little sketches which show you very little about the trail you will be walking. There are no contour lines and pitifully few elevations given, and you've got to wade through paragraphs of boring, often preachy text to find out whether the trail is uphill or downhill on specific sections. Compare these useless cartoons to the clear, excellent topographic maps in Ron C. Judd's new &quot;Day Hike! Mount Rainier,&quot; and see which you'd rather try to follow with a compass.Of all the guides to trails on Mount Rainier, this has got to be the worst."},{"Title":"50 hikes in Mount Rainier National Park","review":"The new color pics are great, but one has to wonder if Harvey, et al, are letting the details slip in their golden years. One whole section, for trails on the (washed out) West Side Road, tells you to get on the &quot;shuttle bus&quot; and be dropped off at the trailhead -- when in fact no such bus exists, and probably won't for years, according to park rangers. This minor inconvenience adds as much as 10 miles to some of those hikes -- and these distances are NOT spelled out in the guide. There also seeems to be sloppy editing; more than one altitude-gain stats are wrong, as in, 2,300 rather than 3,200. That's a big difference. Also, like other Mountaineers guides released recently, the authors in this one seem to be at war with their own publishers. Example: The route they suggest to Indian Henry's Hunting Grounds is no longer even maintained by the park, and another route is described on the next page as &quot;safer.&quot; Why, then, include the old route? The authors might want to spend less time defending their old choices and more time making new ones. I'm frankly not interested in the best hikes in the park circa 1965. In sum: Worth having for the pics, but supplement it with something else for trail data."},{"Title":"50 hikes in Mount Rainier National Park","review":"This book is great for light weight planning. it has nice photos, and a good selection of hikes.

Minbiole's delightful prose flows gracefully yet at the right moment it bites with a rapier wit. Never before has Solid Modeling been described so naturally; it's as if Minbiole eats and sleeps SolidWorks. He totally captured what its like to solid model: the excitement, the confusion, the horniness. He's simply brilliant. I'm not the first to mention his name among better known American authors like Hemmingway and Fitzgerald.I credit Minbiole for saving my career, and consequently my marriage.

However, the programs are very similar and the Help inside of the program itself can help you to realize when there are program differences present. I must admit that I did learn a lot from this book (most of the basic features and it boosted my confidence level) but I was only able to get past half of it in total because the program kept having errors even when I was following the directions. Also, there were some steps (like in the blade chapter p.44 where Geometry-pattern actually did need to be checked) and sometimes the author wasn't very clear (like which specific origin to choose when).The pictures and window illustrations were pretty straight-forward as was the text and I really liked the construction of the pizza cutter because it dealt with curves, revolutions, planes and assembly drawings.

I should point out though that I had previously done the tutorial that comes with 2001 Plus. Maybe the combination of my AutoCAD (all 2D, my 3D experience with AutoCAD was 1997 and earlier, I don't even consider those versions of AutoCAD as legitimate 3D solid modeling) experience and doing the SolidWOrks supplied tutorial made this book easier to follow than the other reviewers who found it lacking.This book is written for 2001 which is what I used, I found there to be no errors in the instructions, the few times that things weren't working right for me I went back a few steps and tried it again, everything then worked as it was supposed to.Having taken 3 classes in SolidWorks from a VAR (Essentials, Sheet Metal, Drawing & Dimensioning) I'd say this book is the low cost way of learning SolidWorks, an excellent introduction to the power of SolidWorks.

In the past British writers like Thomas had written solid essays on Cuba and its history. But I must admit my disappointment, particulary at some conclusions. For instance, Gott attempts to be controversial or perhaps iconoclastic when he notes that major US legislation affecting Cuba has been passed during Democratic administrations (a cynical reaction might be: so what?) He points to the Helms-Burton Act as an example of such legislation (passed during Clinton's presidency), without pointing out that Congress was widely split and also controlled by Republicans and that Clinton the Democrat was totally opposed to the bill. Gott's book also concludes that nothing will change after Castro. Castro, he claims, is now a puppet and there is already a subterranean government in place. But he gives us no evidence for this rather silly conclusion and in fact many scholars disagree rather strongly with such an inference. Personally, I think there'll will be chaos, infighting, and huge vendettas when Castro dies and the US needs to be prepared for massive emigration problems, medical and malnutrition challenges of major proportions when the veil over the \\"extraordinary\\" medical system in Cuba is lifted, as well as increased illegal drug activities as Cuba could become an even larger trans-shipment point for drugs."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"A tolerable book, only if read as one of several Cuban history books, because of its thoroughly sympathetic (and apologist) depiction of Fidel Castro's 1959 Revolution. It is perfect example of a view of Cuban history that pretends to be academic and unbiased but in reality closely spouses the current government's portrayal of Cuban history, devoid of democracy and equality and where the past is little more than the struggle that leads to Socialism. In that context, it is a good book to read because it illustrates what the current Cuban Governments is attempting to do to the country's history.Many basic spelling errors of a significant number Spanish words or names the author introduces are off-putting and bring into question his qualifications as a Cuban scholar thoroughly familiar with his subject. The author uses very few source documents, opting instead to quote prejudiced opinions of earlier academics (who tend to quote earlier academics) or casual observers to prove the points he wishes to stress. He also buys into (and sells) the mythology of Fidel Castro earlier year as the chosen one, the inheritor and sum all of Cuba's past \\"caudillos.\\" Moreover, the author omits or manipulates important facts if they interfere with the storyline. The book should be ignored if it is intended to be your only source of Cuban history."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Richard Gott is a British journalist and historian with many years' experience of covering Latin America. He has written a very useful book on Cuba's long struggle for national independence and sovereignty. The first third of the book examines the Cuban people's struggle against Spanish occupation from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The rest of the book looks at Cuba's 20th century struggle against the US empire.The USA intervened militarily in Cuba in 1906-09, 1912, 1917-23 and 1961, always on the pretexts of establishing democracy and order. In 1902 the US state imposed the Platt Amendment on Cuba. Its seventh paragraph gave the USA the \`right' to establish permanent military bases on Cuba. It was repealed in 1934, but the dictator Batista signed a new treaty allowing the USA to keep its huge military base at Guantanamo Bay.Gott shows how in 1959 the people defeated the US-backed dictator by relying on their own forces. He observes that the British and Yugoslavian governments armed Batista to the last moment.Gott possibly devotes too little attention to the Cuban people's successes in developing their country. He notes, without exploring, Cuba's remarkable achievements in health and education and he fails to mention its pioneering pharmaceutical industry.But he gives due prominence to Cuba's internationalism, particularly to its selfless military support to the Angolan people in 1988. Nelson Mandela later visited Havana to thank Fidel personally for Cuba's assistance in the struggle against apartheid, \\"The decisive defeat of the racist army in Cuito Cuanavale was a victory for all Africa ... It made it possible for Angola to enjoy peace and establish its own sovereignty ... and for the people of Namibia to achieve their independence. The decisive defeat of the aggressive apartheid forces destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor. The defeat of the apartheid army served as an inspiration to the struggling people of South Africa.\\"Cuba has a proud record of upholding workers' nationalism and of practical internationalism. Whatever foreign observers hope or fear, the Cuban people will never surrender their national independence and sovereignty."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Nothing has changed in Cuba during the last fifty years except it's image has plummeted from what was widely known as \\"The Pearl of the Antilles\\" to that of an alligator-shapedisland/farm owned and managed by the Castro brothers for their own enrichment. And to corroborate this, I suggest all five-star reviewers read an article published in 2007 by Forbes Magazine in which old Fidel comes out as one of the wealthiest heads of state second to Queen Elizabeth II, with a billion dollars worth of foreign investments.The author also ignores the present plight of thousands of political prisoners, the violation of human rights, the executions and torture of dissenters, the discrimination that exists against Cuban citizens by forbidding them to share in the luxuries reserved only for tourists such as well stocked supermarkets, luxury hotels, restaurants, beautiful beaches, and the list continues.And let's get something straight about the embargo and the imperialists: The main reason the embargo still persists is not because of US unreasonable demands toward Cuba, or the failure of American presidents to understand the issues at hand. It contnues because the last thing the Castro brothers want is to open the eyes of an enslaved people to the outside world, especially to the fruits of capitalism and the American free entreprise system.Why is the lifting of the US embargo so vital to communists interests when they can do business with the rest of the planet, more so when distance is uninportant and our world is getting smaller?The answer: It is crucial and very convenient for tyrants to blame a common enemy for their nation's miseries while they continue to pilfer it, and the United States is the ideal escape-goat.I still can't figure out how I gathered enough guts to finish reading Gott's boot-licking book.Andrew J. RodriguezAward winning author of: \\"Adios, Havana,\\" a Memoir"},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"When I picked up this book in a used book store, I read selected sections on matters I knew very well, read the authors passages on these matters and decided that this book was not only biased but deliberately and maliciously so. Pertinent data was omitted and selectively included data distorted.Thus I did not purchase it. I will buy it here in used form so that the author does not receive any of my money, my purpose of this purchase is to fully document this and other malicious presentations of Cuban history.At that the time I picked up this volume did not know that letters to London Times had labeled Richard Gott as an \\"Agent of Influence\\" e.g.http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/1376998/postsor that he had been said to be a former KGB agente.g.http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/583hqfaw.asp?pg=2What I did know was from family history in Cuba that the author Richard Gott was re-writing the past. I concentrated in my sampling on the so called \\"race war of 1912\\" (it would seem that the author misdates it, and mixes it with the rising of 1906 in which my grand uncle Mambi General Carlos Garcia Velez was deeply involved). In this 1912 horror some of my family's property was burned.Initially this sad 1912 matter had come to my attention some years ago when I was puzzled why the so called Mambi of the \\"Independentes de Color\\" would burn down property of the Mambi of my family.Soon it became clear through critical readings that what the \\"Independentes de Color\\" were attempting to make a separate country, where they could rule despotically. This was apparent to most of the Mambi of that time and place and thus they, what ever pigment shaded their skins, did not take their war skills and courage to this fight.These Mambi who refused to join the revolt had already used all their influence to try to avoid this clash, and to have some of the future revolt's leadership released from jail for inciting racial murder at the most trivial of excuse.This lack of participation of the majority of the Mambi doomed the the revolt attempt from the very beginning. Then it was widely perceived, although apparently never quite proven, that this revolt was Haitian in origen and in intent. Some Dominican Republic activists of similar shaded skins, but few Cubans were shown to be involved. It was a racist revolt, where virtue was thought to reside only in those with the very darkest of skin.As to the Siboney (Cuban Taino, Cuban Island Arawak) involvement much touted on the cover I see very little proof of that in this volume although there were a good number of such, including members of my family, involved in the Cuban wars of Independence. One may note in this reagard that my Mambi ancestor whose property was destroyed was probably part Siboney and certainly his wife (one of my maternal grandmothers) was Taina.All this does not excuse the bloody actions of former General Monteagudo that followed the repression of this revolt, yet it does make their outraged anger far more understandable. For it was characters of this type and racial background that joining with Spanish General Weyler as \\"Guerrillas\\" slaughtered massive numbers of other Cuban in the Cuban Wars of Independence. One may note that butcher Weyler prided himself in choosing these very dark skinned Guerrillas as his bodyguards....Larry Daley (Garcia-I~niguez Enamorado)"},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"-- of those one-star reviews.

However one may agree or not with his views, they are necessary to read if one would wish a well-rounded education on Cuba. Beware anyone who tries to suppress this book, as they are guilty of the same thing of which they accuse Fidel Castro."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"For many, Cuban history started with Fidel Castro's political ascent in the 1950's. Nothing before seems relevant and sadly anything after has been a virtual black hole. Since the revolution of 1959, most writing about the island has been polarized, either ardently sympathetic or passionately hostile. But author Richard Gott, a British journalist and specialist in Latin American history, keeps a level head, guiding us from the first attempt at colonization by the Spanish in 1511 to the present day. By providing a full historical context, the author gives a much needed contextual understanding of an island only ninety miles from the Florida Keys, yet a world away in almost every other respect.Gott dispels many convenient myths, such as the timing of the Communist influence. It didn't start with Castro but actually in 1907 with the Independent Party of Color, when socialists banded together to try to relieve themselves from the oppression they felt from U.S. occupation after the Spanish-American War. The group fomented into an embryonic Communist Party in 1925, which went unabated for years afterward. They even launched their own newspaper and promised then-revolutionary Fulgencio Batista the political support he needed to become Cuba's president during World War II. So, contrary to popular belief, Batista welcomed Communists into his government. But Batista became cruelly repressive during the 1950's, which triggered Castro to launch a failed armed attack on the Moncada fortress barracks in Santiago. It was at this time that Castro met Che Guevara, and Gott vividly describes their first meeting. The two men initially got on very well, brothers in arms. Guevara badly needed a political cause, while he gave Fidel valuable insights into other revolutionary experiments around Latin America. For those who have read and seen the recent movie version of \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\", Guevara's sociopolitical evolution now becomes clear from Gott's account. As we all know, Castro and Guevara combined forces, which led to Batista escaping and Castro taking control in January 1959.What is enlightening in this book is how Castro's energy inspired some of the greatest Latin American novelists of the 20th century, including Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. He charmed not only Russian politicians like Nikita Khrushchev and African revolutionaries such as Ahmed Ben Bella, but also French intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. Castro had a falling out with Pablo Neruda when he implied that Castro may be taking too much credit for the revolution, and one begins to see the megalomania that induced fissures in his power base. Nonetheless, Gott is very thorough when it comes to describing Castro's acumen as a politician, especially as he faced the challenge of becoming more estranged from Guevara, who saw himself as a political visionary compelled to spread the word about the revolution globally. But Castro started seeing Guevara as a loose cannon and wanted no part of the armed struggle Guevara desired. As we know, this all ended with Guevara's assassination in Bolivia in 1967, which has been attributed at various times to the CIA and even Castro himself. Gott was actually on hand himself to identify Che's body after the murder.The author explores Castro's perceived political softening recently, for example, his cautious attitude to the Sandinista overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979. According to Gott, Castro even suggested that the Sandinistas should establish a mixed economy and a pluralistic political system. Likely the most intriguing portions of the book focus on the continuing interest the U.S. has in usurping the power structure within Cuba. Gott handles these episodes lucidly, for instance, taking the drama out of historical watermark events like the 1962 Bay of Pigs missile crisis. Perhaps his most surprising assertion is that virtually all of the most ruthless acts of U.S. political interference and military aggression in the 20th century have been the work of Democrat rather than Republican Presidents - Wilson's deployment of marines to occupy Cuba in 1917; FDR's interventions to crush the 1933 revolution; JFK's 1961 invasion; LBJ's immigration scheme; and the Torricelli and Helms-Burton Acts under Clinton. In fact, plans have been underway since the Clinton administration to suborn the Cuban officer corps after the departure of Castro. Gott also describes the Miami power base of Cuban-Americans, who contemplate with satisfaction the recovery of properties lost long ago. But the author leaves us with the most revealing of conclusions - that he expects little change in Cuba in the years ahead even after Castro dies. Gott believes Castro has become a mere figurehead and that a post-Castro government has been in place for several years. And despite images exalted by popular culture, reintegration of Cuba into the international community may not be such a harmonious affair. This has to be the definitive book on Cuba's history and current political situation and consequently, essential reading for those who want to take a harder look at where things will evolve there."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"'Cuba: A New History' is an excellent account of Cuban history up until this books publication in 2004. Gott manages to write in a completely engaging way and draws you in to the rich and diverse history of this amazing Caribbean island. This is in no way a dry and uninspiring read, but one that helps you immerse yourself in the history and developments over the years. From Spanish colonial rule, US intervention and soviet support, Cuba has managed to retain some remnant of it's own identity and this book shows this side perfectly. The first 100 pages (looking at Spanish Colonial rule and the slave trades to Cuba) were the hardest to engage with for me, but as soon as the revolution occurred and the book focused on the Castro government and all that it entails, I became hooked to this masterly text. The author doesn't seem overly biased one way or the other, although you can tell he has respect for this tiny island nation. He doesn't seem to be too sensationalist either, for example when Che Guevara dies it is noted in quite an understated way and not overly hyped to have a greater impact. Two minor flaws with this book are the tiny font which by the end had given me serious eye strain, why academic texts insist on using this size font I'll never know. And the other flaw is a distinct lack of decent photography to add to the package. There are a few pages of grey photos in the middle, but not on good quality paper, or especially relevant to the overall text, i've come to expect better from history books these days. These are minor flaws in what is a brilliant account of Cuban history which leaves you with some indication of what the future may hold as well. If Cuba interests you in the slightest, I'd seriously recommend you take a look at this book.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Since visiting Cuba in 1997, I've always been fascinated by the place. Havana is a beautiful city, the weather is great and the people are warm and engaging. The trouble is; the economy simply doesn't work.Richard Gott has written of the island from its first visits by the Spanish until the present day where it rests within its own time warp. Gott has done an admirable job. However, as with so many books on the subject of Cuba, it's as though its real history doesn't begin until 1959. This is the time of Castro's rise to power and it is where \\"Cuba: A New History\\" really comes to life. It is clear that Gott is very familiar with Cuba. It is clear that he has travelled there extensively and interviewed a wide cast of people. He is mildly sympathetic to Cuba treading its own path. But, by the same token, he doesn't fall for left wing jingoism. It is a very good read.I have little doubt that many will challenge my view. To cover Cuba and not point out its many failings will be seen as a weakness. Yet, the story of Cuba is more nuanced. It has been dominated by three empires and is only now beginning a path of relative independence. This will bring change. Gott clearly understands this point. It is a point missed by his critics who all too often only focus on the many failings of Castro and little else.I recommend this book to all those general readers seeking an understanding of this island nation and its place in the world. Richard Gott deserves credit. He has added to our knowledge of a small country that has risen above its otherwise backwater place in history."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Great seller, great book. Very interesting introspection into cuban history. Despite going light on the colonial era the book is very interesting. I might not agree with the opinion at every corner about the facts but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"If you're looking for a fast, shallow treatment of Cuban history, written by a largely uncritical supporter of the Cuban Revolution, then look no further, you've found it.I've read Hugh Thomas' book \\"Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom\\" (which is 1800 pages long or so, it's only flaw being that its coverage of history ends in the late 1960s). Naturally, I expected Gott's book to pick up where Thomas' book left off. And, while Gott's book does cover the revolution between 1970 and now, it does not provide any real depth or insight. Thomas' book was obviously written by a scholar who is looking to form a complete picture of Cuba's history; Gott's book, on the other hand, reads more like a newspaper article - perhaps because Gott is a journalist by training.If you're looking to really learn about Cuba, definitely get Thomas' book. Gott's isn't TOO bad, as long as it's what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Very good and accurate view of Cuba. Sent several to relatives as gifts. Found it to have information that we hadn't known about the country's history."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"The author covers the history of Cuba from the 15th century to the present. I had to skip about a hundred pages to get to the 20th century, but plan to go back to the earlier years. Gott is from UK, a bit of a socialist, and never misses a chance to dis the US, but the US hasn't been a good neighbor to Cuba, for sure.The writing is smooth and readable. A good popular history. Footnotes are collected in the back of the book. Not too easy,not too densely written."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Honestly folks, really I needed to come over the pessimistic catastrophic scenarios of contemporary global events and their intrepid interpreters, so here are some books I have recently read instead on Cuban history, on its regional impact and on the Boliv&agrave;rian revolution in Venezuela, as an antidote. Despite the massive bibliography on Cuba's revolution, remarkably few books in English cover the island's story from its earliest days. This alone justifies ex-Guardian Latin American specialist Richard Gott's new work, Cuba: A New History, Yale University Press, 2004 [Yale Nota Bene paperback, 2005] 325 pages [alt. 359 incl. Notes]. Like his informative articles on Latin America over the past 40 years, this book is easy to read, comprehensive, thoroughly researched and partisan.Hugh Thomas's 1971 book, Cuba - the inevitable comparison -starts only in 1762, with the British invasion of Havana that gave a major boost to the import of slaves and the sugar industry, and stops with the early years of the Revolution. However, Gott begins with the irruption of the Spanish adventurers in 1511, although he provides some sense of the shifting indigenous populations, Ta&iacute;nos, Guanahatabeyes and Siboneys, who made their way up from the mainland's Orinoco delta through the vast Caribbean archipelago in pre-Colombian times; and he brings the story of the Cuban revolution up to the present day, with an new Epilogue.Gott is also more concerned to trace historical continuities: geographic and climatic determinants (including those \`malignant forces which took the form of winds of awesome proportions' that the Ta&iacute;nos dubbed the hurac&aacute;n); piracy and corruption; social and racial strife; the pervasiveness of Africanity and the terrified white consciousness of neighbouring Haiti; all in the context of an overarching dependence on foreign empires, whether Spanish, British, American or Russian.Born in 1783, midway between the US Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var's life and ideas were stamped--though asymmetrically--by both events. If the British could be driven out of North America by a people belonging to the same race and religion, why not the Spaniards in the South? The three hundred years of colonial rule that had followed the 1521 fall of Mexico were more than enough. And if the wisdom of the French Enlightenment had laid the foundations of the French Revolution, might it not serve the same purpose in Spanish America?Travelling through Europe in the early 1800s, Bol&iacute;var would compare the decay and lethargy of the Madrid Court with the ferment of revolutionary Paris, albeit on the eve of Napoleon's coronation. Till the emperor's final defeat and the Restoration, Paris would remain qualitatively superior to Madrid and quantitatively ahead of Philadelphia.And, of course, there was always sly, opportunist and expansionist London, which was not to be ignored. Despite the loss of its American colonies, it remained the hub of a strong and growing mercantilist Empire and its mastery of the seas was now unchallengeable. For that reason alone it had to be won over to the cause of South American independence and reminded of its own imperial interests in the continent.Ever since Hector de Cr&egrave;vecaeur posed the question, \`What then is this American, this new man?' in 1782, North Americans have endlessly ruminated on their uniqueness. Yet they have rarely considered what they have in common with the \`Other America', the sister-continent to their south. Such has been the ingrained Protestant provincialism and pietism of Anglo-American thinking that Spain's Atlantic Empire has too often been consigned to the shadows of the Black Legend, according to which the greed and depravities of the Old World were visited on the New by Iberian conquistadors and viceroys.That same view is alive and flourishing since the national trauma of US post-9/11: the erosion of America's national identity by foreign immigration, and the undermining of its culture of Protestant individualism by Hispanic bilingualism; multiculturalism and the de-nationalization of elites and middle-class integration. \`Fortress America' is today symbolized by the police-patrolled Iron Curtain erected on the US-Mexican border to exclude illegal Spanish-speaking, predominantly Catholic and poor, migrant immigrants wanting to survive after the slums and devastating slumps of their origins and share in the American Dream."},{"Title":"Cuba: A New History","review":"Although I found some parts of this book interesting, Mr. Gott has failed to point out the sad truth is that whatCastro has done to this island nation. He has brought equality by bringing everyone(except the party elite)to the level of medieval serfdom. I lived through the revolution, and saw personal liberty squashed into nothingness, in a system where neighbors turn you in for expressing your views criticizing the government, or having too many friends visiting you. Yes, Batista was a thug, but at least you could come and go as you pleased. I do not belong to any right wing Cuban militant groups, but only a blind man fails to see the truth."},{"Title":"Against Capital Punishment: The Anti-Death Penalty Movement in America, 1972-1994","review":"Herbert Haines explores the history of the death penalty abolitionist movement in the United States.

And I've been quite interested in Gandhi and his philosophy for years. So I was really disappointed in this book, which seems to be a half-hearted collection of Sharp's essays on Gandhi--and some that aren't even on Gandhi. (Hence the subtitle, &quot;with essays on ethics and politics&quot;.) Nonetheless, the book is hard to find, so I'll wrote the table of contents here.ContentsIntroduction by Coretta KingPART ONE: GANDHI AS A POLITICAL STRATEGIST1. Gandhi's Political Significance2. Origins of Gandhi's Use of Nonviolent Struggle: A Review-Essay on Erik Erikson's &quot;Gandhi's Truth&quot;3. Gandhi on the Thoery of Voluntary Servitude4. Satyagraha and Political Conflict: A Review of Joan V. Bondurant's &quot;Conquest of Violence&quot;5. The Theory of Gandhi's Constructive Program6. Gandhi's Evaluation of Indian Nonviolent Action7. India's Lesson for the Peace Movement8. Gandhi's Defense Policy9. Gandhi as a National Defense StrategistPART TWO: ESSAYS ON ETHICS AND POLITICS10. Type of Principles Nonviolence11. Ethics and Responsibility in Politics: A Critique of the Present Adequacy of Max Weber's Classification of Ethical Systems12. Morality, Politics, and Political Technique13. Nonviolence: Moral Principle or Political Technique? Clues from Gandhi's Thought and ExperienceAPPENDICESA. Shridharani's Contribution to the Study of Gandhi's TechniqueB. The War in 1942C. Glossary of Indian TermsD. Sources for Further StudyE. Recommendations for Course UsageF. Suggestions for Preparing Courses on Gandhi...and that's about it.Sharp has some great points here. One of the best is that, while Gandhi is often thought to have judged his movement a failure towards the end of his life, this isn't the whole story; Gandhi published an enormous amount, writing constantly for various newspapers and talking to many reporters, and while he judged his movement a failure on some days on other days he judged it a success; one should really look at an analysis of the movement itself, not Gandhi's changing evaluations. He also talks about Gandhi's thoughts on a potential nonviolent defense strategy, which was simply inadequate and not thought through very well. This is something that is often neglected in studies of Gandhi's thought. Also, his chapter on categories of nonviolence may be useful for some.The most annoying thing about this book is that many of the chapters are atrociously redundant. 8 and 9 in particular, as well as 11 and 12. The writing is already a little bit dry, and two chapters which both say the exact same thing, one a little worse than the other, doesn't help at all. Sharp should have put in a few more hours of work and combined them. Also, some essays, such as the third chapter, are largely quotes of Gandhi with little added.Finally, I'd say that this book is only for those who are excessively interested in Gandhi. But I would repeat that Sharp's Series on &quot;The Politics of Nonviolent Action&quot; is, unlike this uninspired collection, magnificent."},{"Title":"Paddington's 123","review":"The lovable Paddington needs your help counting. This book features Paddington in all different situations needing to count from one to twenty. A little busy at times, this book can help children learn to point and count how many items are on the page. Used one on one, this can help a child practice while counting fun and colorful postcards, buckets and much more."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read this book 2 years ago, and I must say, the more I reflect on it, it's really an excellent book. While I was reading, for some reason, I was resistant to it's charms... I wanted to put it down, but never did. And now 2 years later, here I am looking for something good to read, and came here to follow the \\"People who bought this, bought that\\" link in hopes of discovering something equally terrific."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The Belsey family is about as screwed up as a family can get. The teenage/young adult children speak to their parents irreverently, the parents seem disconnected from each other, but yet, somehow, the love that they all have for each other is obvious from the start. Howard Belsey, the patriarch of the family, however, has no love for Monty Kipps, a rival college professor and someone whom he has challenged professionally for years. But Howard's son, Jerome, is interning for Monty and has fallen in love with Monty's daughter Veronica. This is only the beginning of a story that has the Belsey family intertwined with the Kipps family at every twist and turn.The Belsey family struggles in many ways - Kiki attempting to overcome Howard's infidelity, Levi, ony 16, trying to find his way in an adult world, Jerome struggling with finding his own identity in the shadow of his parents, and Zora trying to choose between being sensual female and a true intellectual feminist. Each of the characters interacts with a whole host of other characters that bring this book alive.Set in a conservative college town in the suburbs of Boston, the actual story line of On Beauty is not that original in and of itself. It involves professional rivalries, love won, love lost, and friendship. It deals with standard coming of age difficulties. But what makes this novel fantastic is the excellent character development. The characters simply come alive and the writing makes you feel as though these are actual people you know in a town that you have visited. The author reveals the plot in a seductive way - only a little bit at a time - letting the story cleverly unfold to keep the reader interested. But when she reveals the next piece it is without fanfare - as though you were aware that that particular piece of the puzzle was there the entire time.A truly enjoyable character driven novel. Zadie Smith continues to craft enjoyable reads that you can really sink your teeth into."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was a little slow to pick up, but once it did, I had a hard time putting this book down. I even got sunburned today trying to finish it at the beach. Smith tackles a lot here: race relations, infidelity, religion, hypocrisy, and inter-generational misunderstandings. With some exceptions, I think she is largely successful. I found each of the characters interesting and sympathetic (or just plain pathetic) in their own ways, but I was rooting for them regardless. Some aspects of the story were a little far-fetched, but Smith is able to get the reader to buy-in enough, that it doesn't matter. This would make a really interesting movie, done right of course. In the meantime, a great summer read, with substance. Pick it up!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty starts out so promising, but quickly loses its way. A drama about two men (Howard Belsey, a liberal, non-religious English man, and Monty Kipps, a conservative right-wing Christian) who teach at a fictitious university outside Boston and their families has the makings of a great story.Unfortunately, while it may impress intellectual critics, it fails to draw in the average reader. The initial few pages set the stage with Jerome Belsey sending e-mails to his father while living and working with the conservative Kipps family. After those few e-mails, the story never connects the dots. There is no lack of characters: Howard Belsey, Kiki Belsey, Jerome Belsey. Zora Belsey, Levi Belsey, Monty Kipps, Catherine Kipps, Michael Kipps, Victoria Kipps, faculty from the fictitious university, a group of street vendors and the people who make up the fringes of the school; however, we learn very little about any one character and On Beauty jumps from story to story with no actual beginning and no conclusion.I finished the book only because I hoped to grasp a \\"greater\\" purpose this cast of characters would reveal but, if there was one, it escaped me."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a good writer, although a somewhat sloppy writer. She makes mistakes (\\"obverse directions\\" should read \\"opposite directions\\"), and sometimes she shows signs of haste or of a tin ear (\\"slanted sails blowing about on perforated seas,\\" referring to textual oddities). She can also be very funny (describing a theory of \\"women's punctuation\\" for example, or using the phrase, \\"Umbrellas, like dead birds after a shooting party, pile up in the far corner\\"), and can be both funny and accurate (\\"Howard could not piss next to people he knew\\").In this novel she tells a fine story, or rather a series of stories, and to my mind has captured the dilemma of mixed race families perfectly. She can bring the reader's emotions up in her description of a death of a friend, or a character's gut reaction to hearing music sung, or the tenuous, anguished life on a non-tenured professor. And she does a real number on Ivy League colleges. Where I lose her is in the area of \\"Beauty.\\" What is it and who can describe it? There is much discussion of Rembrandt and of the depth of his vision, but Rembrandt also created some obscene etchings that were lodged almost out of sight high on the walls of the Norton Simon Museum when I first saw them.My enjoyment of the book was enhanced by Smith's occasional ear-perfect perceptions, like this one: \\"[People] continuing with these banal little English catchphrases that never failed to drive Howard up the bleeding wall. His childhood had been shot through with this meaningless noise, just so many substitutes for real conversation. Brass monkeys out there. Don't mind if I do. I don't fancy yours much. And on. And on.\\" A good read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"From the accompanying reviews, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person \\"On Beauty\\" left cold. The starred reviews! The alleged play on \\"Howard's End\\"! What are these reviewers falling for? The book did not engage me and I couldn't be bothered to finish. If the novel had been set in England, Zadie Smith might have better understood the types she was writing about. As it is, little rings true in \\"On Beauty\\". Ignore the fuss and read something else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The story is weak and the characters meaningless. I never reached a point where I could relate to or sympathize with any of the characters. The story never really developed, it just seemed to wander without direction. Though Smith made a worthy effort to tie together multiple social issues, inter-racial relationships, contrasting classes and personal family/spousal conflict, she failed in the end. The book falls flat."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If you're like me, you thought \\"White Teeth\\" was entertaining but ultimately sagging at the end and overhyped. Maybe you forgave Zadie her missteps and tried again with \\"Autograph Man\\" and, marveling at its messiness, wondered how this writer got so much credit in the first place. And now you've been hearing about \\"On Beauty.\\" Some say it's brilliant, some say it's boring, and you're not sure if you really have the time or the faith to give Zadie a third go.All I can say is, for those of you who have been wading through Zadie Smith novels, admiring her cleverness, her zippy characters, and her fabulous ear, but wondering where the real soul is - you'll be rewarded for your patience in this book. \\"On Beauty\\" contains multitudes - the state of academia, the state of the family, the state of countries and marriages and young women who hate themselves, the random nature of loveliness in our lives, and the crazy things we will do to grab hold of or destroy it. And while Zadie pulls in threads of everything from art history to hiphop to Haitian politics to poetry, she never veers off course, masterfully keeping her imagined world tightly drawn and alive.One more note: I happened to own both the audio and the book and after some switching back and forth, ended up listening to the audio, simply because it was so enjoyable. I highly recommend it - the reader does a fantastic job with the varied accents, and this is a perfect story to be told."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith builds interesting, complicated characters in this book. Set in an east coast college town and in London, it paints an intriguing picture of faculty life, politics and the raising of families with different ideals. It is a good book for a book club discussion as it touches on the subjects of ethics, morals, family values, world and local politics, career choices and more. Most of the characters ring very true with one or two exceptions. All in all, a good read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"i am very disappointed in this book. after all the rave reviews i read i was expecting much more. its just rather dull. the language is stilted so it sometimes hard to figure out what they are talking about. the characters are rather flat and the \\"plot\\" is just not intereting. i loved white teeth but could not get through her 2nd novel. i am barely making it through this and going to the book often feels like a chore that needs to be completed. she is clearly a gifted and intelligent person but with regard to this book ... \\"there is just no there, there\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was the first book I read by Zadie Smith. The hype around this young author and the mixed feelings reflected and expressed by most reviewers triggered my curiosity. So I started reading it with a sense of anticipation, however I was disappointed almost immediately.I think the story and all the characters in it are poorly developed. I always finish a book that I've started, even when I don't like it much, but I must admit that this was the first time ever that I really struggled to get to the end, it was so boring it often became soporific. It was a relief to turn the last page.On a more positive note, I do believe that the prose was very good and the style original. That's the only reason why I gave it 1 star. And that's also the reason why I'm going to give this author a second chance and shall read White Teeth soon."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Great book, and very humorous too. Well developed characters and plot line. The writer manages to convey the idea that we are all humans, after all, and thus falible and lovable. Still, actions have consequences - and on this ground, what surprise was the end! I went from hating-this-character to liking-this-character and then found myself wondering why, since no character in the book is completely likable. It was nice reading about the faades and the beauty of human nature... and how its consequences can be at the same time terrible, funny and long-lasting. Would suggest it for a book club, if I had one!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Don't let the title mislead you... The book is indeed about beauty, but also about contradictions, love, cheating, family. Two completely different men, one liberal the other conservative. Their families. But are they really so different? A book not boring at all and that, in the end, really is 'on beauty'."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The title suggests an essay. And it _is_ an essay with persons of flesh and blood. Each of the persons in the family, their friends and their foes, pursues their own idea of beauty. In doing so, they contradict themselves, get into conflict with each other, they develop, they question their own and other peoples' beliefs, as real persons do. And no, &#34;beauty&#34; is not just arts (they get their fair share, though), it is also the beauty of your fat wife after 30 years of marriage, the beauty of watching a football match with strangers in an English pub. And no, Zadie Smith does not take sides. She lets all her persons collide in the next-to-final showdown - all raise their axes in judgement, and lets them sink again seeing the other's axe hover over their head. The book ends in ... a painting, the two main characters seeing the painting, and we, the readers, watching the two.I recommend every reader to look up the art works named in the book. They are part of the book, characters in their own right."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I had decided that Zadie Smith was not an author that I would like to read (Smith being an author that a pretentious friend \\"LOVED!\\") Luckily it was a book I took the time to know so that I could judge it - and it turned out that I really enjoyed it. The theme of infidelity infected my mind and made me think about real-life relationships."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's 'On Beauty' is beautifully written with a compelling plot. She once again tackles the portrayal of an intercultural family, as in White Teeth, however this time the action is largely situated in Boston, though occasionally drifts back to London. The novel confronts everything that White Teeth attempted to do (underwrites the importance and normative value of intercultural/racial families in our society, confronts racist tendencies in our communities and selves and wrestles with the qualifiers of identity) without the overwhelmingly broad set of characters and plot points. This time around, Smith narrows down her focus which enables her to reinforce the plot in an articulate and convincing way.Loved it!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"However one feels about Zadie Smith, this clearly is her best book. The parallels between this and EM Forster's Howard's End are very much worth exploring throughout and make for fun conversation while Smith's ending might be one of the most beautiful in contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The characters felt fake and forced. I think the author harped too much on ethnicity. It didnt seem to be a major them, but he just kept going about it. Also it really failed to keep my attention. There was really no point to it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Once I started this book I could not put it down. There was no mercy on this family. What a page turner!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The critics gushed over this one. While it is well-written, I couldn't help wondering why it was written."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I liked this book very much. The author has an ear for dialogue that rings true in the American family and for the particular characters. There is great laughter at the beginning, a keen eye for interior reflection that is honest and insightful about cultural identity, and a movement toward the ultimate sweet sadness of their situation. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"this is an amazing book, maybe my favorite of zadies.received quickly, good shipping price, book was in good condition."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Not only did this book come faster than I thought, but it was in perfect condition and it turned out to be a wonderful read. I recommend it all!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel condenses a variety of philosophies (and warnings) about how our culture values beauty, and considers what we are willing to trade to be close to it. I really enjoyed this novel -- the characters are complicated and interesting, and it was easy to be sympathetic too, yet disappointed in the characters. I thought the writing was impressive, as well."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed White Teeth and had heard reviews that On Beauty didn't live up to it. However, I enjoyed it thoroughly!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This author's main asset is in her descriptions and nuances. Many of them were simply terrific.I did also detect some humour, which was pleasing. The start of the novel with Jerome's emails to his father, although not a big attention grabber, is unique.However, for me the story was much too slow moving.There was too much detail and what I consider filler throughout the novel. Even in the midst of a very good fight between Kiki and Howard (204), the author sidetracks with the elastic of Kiki's underwear and Howard placing his hands on the sideboard,thus losing the momentum.I disliked the clumsy way the reader is told to jump nine months forward and back across the Atlantic (42).That weird poem \\"On Beauty\\"...what did it say? (153).Not bad but would I recommend it? Sorry...."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Overall the book is well written, but its clinical and not emotionally or intellectually satisfying. Many other reviews give you details on the book but I'll just focus on reasons why it didn't work for me. This story, these characters had so much potential. I was enthralled after the first few pages and then it turns out, that was the best part of the book. I kept waiting for that feeling to return and it never did. The stage is set, the characters in play, but the story just doesn't ever pull you in. I think perhaps she tried to have too many mini-stories within the story. I'd rather just had the focus and development of a few key characters and storylines. For example, Jerome (the eldest son) of the Belsey family is dispensable after the first chapter. There's no satisfying conclusion at the end...which I can live with if I've been fulfilled throughout the rest of the book. This book just left me still feeling like an outsider vs. feeling emersed in the characters, their lives, the story. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but I think not."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Yes, this book is about two families, PC, Academia, Rembrant etc but really it is about how ZS gets some of the characters from the inside. Howard Beasley, Zora, Isaac, and from the outside: Jerome and most of the family of the rivals.To me what was wonderful was when two characters we know from within are sitting or talking together or, with Ziki and Howard, making love.The richness of this book is in that psychological intimacy, more imo than the ideas, which surround the characters as they do us readers, more or less. But what's really earth-shaking and great fiction is how ZS does let us in and once in, we can become that character, flawed and all. I think that is her gift independent of the various subjects that are really no more pronounced in our lives than in theirs: The PC College or the black/white stuff is all around us as well, but what is formost is our ways of knowing ourselves and each other, what Zadie Smith can do, and can avoid. So for me, what is genuninely wonderful about this book, is how when she enters Nora, we are inside too, and when she doesn't enter Monty he is seen only thru others. I can't be perfectly clear here and so will try again later. But for now, I noticed mainly how she can slip into one or many characters so that it's not plot-driven as much as a psychological study, and we become the characters. Very special writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith shone in \\"White Teeth,\\" missed the mark a tad in \\"Autograph Man,\\" but shines once again in \\"On Beauty.\\" Her grasp of racial issues, family relations, and academia are right on. Smith is also able to accurately write for a wide-range of characters. And, none of the different story lines were any less interesting, thus leaving a reader to skim certain sections.This book has definitely lived up to is hype."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I picked the audio copy of On Beauty on the suggestion of some wonderful Twitter buddies who answered my call for multi-cultural books with themes similar to Jonathon Franzen's Freedom (which I'll be starting in January). I've not read Zadie Smith before, which made this novel even more perfect to compare against Freedom. I'm a Franzen virgin as well. When I've finished them both, I'll be writing a more in depth comparison of them both. I will still be reviewing them separately. The comparison has more to do with my #readingfreude than it does the novels themselves.On Beauty, although primarily about the racially mixed Belsey family, is the tale of two black, educated, university families. The Belsey family is made up of white Englishman Howard, African American Kiki, and their three children, Jerome, Zora, and Levi. The Kipps family is made up of Monty, Carlene, and their children, Michael and Victoria. While the Belseys are politically and culturally very liberal and irreligious, the Kipps family are politically, culturally and religiously conservative. Both Howard and Monty teach and write about art. Even in the world of art they are diametrically opposed. In fact, Howard sees Monty as his arch nemesis. Despite every one's intentions, it proved impossible to keep the families apart, even when they were separated by the Atlantic.This is a difficult novel to pin down in just a few paragraphs. It's dense and cerebral. I've spent months trying to write this review in my head and I've not been very successful. Instead of covering everything, I've decided to focus on the role of the wife in this novel. While outsiders might think Kiki's lot in life was more free and appealing, she was locked down just as much as Carlene appeared to be in Monty's home. The truth is that the women had more in common than anyone would have suspected. Carlene may outwardly hold up Monty's ideals, her mind is her own. She doesn't keep herself tied to an ideology at all costs. In the same way, Kiki finds that life is never as simple as black and white. The adult lives her son Jerome and daughter Zora start living mirrors how complex her own life has become. While the men in their lives fail to appreciate how their lives and view points can compliment each other, their wives are drawn to each other. They alone know how much their husbands are really alike.Of all the characters, I related to and loved Kike the most. Kiki roared \\"I am woman!\\" in all her glory. She believed in herself and her culture when she was young and when she is middle aged, when she was fine and when she was fat. She grew more than any character in the book, finding that change does not equate to losing your essence. Her son, Levi, while less confident in who he was, was most like her. They both never tried to forget the importance of living in the here and now.Since the demise of Guiding Light in September of 2009, it's not very often any longer that I can say, ''He/She is/was on my show!\\" On Beauty gave me such an opportunity. It's narrator, Peter Francis James, took a turn on Guiding Light. I recognized his voice before I did his picture. I found him to be a good narrator. I think he captured the attitude and tone of Howard and Monty especially well.Final ThoughtsOn Beauty was probably the most tiring book I read in 2011. It took a great deal of thought and concentration. It's one of those books I'm glad to have read but can't say that I enjoyed the process. I had to fight the urge to give it up because it was so stuffy. That stuffiness is essential to the story. Good Lord, it was so stifling there that things were bound to explode. The explosion was more internal and introspective than spectacular. It also required a good deal more of me as a reader. I'll be interested in seeing how it compares to Freedom."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is difficult to write a review of this third novel of Zadie Smith without making a comparison to her bestselling, freshman attempt \\"White Teeth\\". I was captivated by \\"White Teeth\\"'s sometime caricature-ish portrayal of the culturally and ethnically diverse cast of characters: some of them take themselves too seriously, some of them don't think much of themselves or of their surroundings, but in the author made even the most self-conscious characters be a little self-deprecating in a humorous way. Details are thrown at the reader either purposefully and effectively, or in a way that adds more color to the writing. Upon reading the book, I felt that it's alright to take one's self seriously, and it's alright if one doesn't, but that we should both respect and take some humor in our diversity. In \\"White Teeth\\" I felt that the author used diversity as a very good tool to make captivate the reader's interest, propel the story along, introduce conflict, and introduce humor all at the same time.In \\"On Beauty\\", there is still that sprinkling of ethnic and cultural details, strong and minute, but they are more often neither necessary nor effective. It seems that taking all the ethnic, gender, and cultural aspects from this novel will not subtract much from it. The wit is still there, the cartoonish portrayals of certain archetypes and stereotypes are still there, but they are disconnected from the storyline. I have not read the original inspiration of this story, so perhaps I am missing something here, but if I hadn't read \\"White Teeth\\" I will still have written the same about \\"On Beauty\\".If you have read \\"White Teeth\\" and really enjoyed it, then \\"On Beauty\\" is worth the price of admission. If you have not read \\"White Teeth\\" and know Zadie Smith only from book reviews and interviews, I will only hesitatingly recommend this book. Perhaps it is Smith's familiarity with the British way of life that makes \\"White Teeth\\" appear to be a more integral and effortless piece of writing, but both aspects are lacking in this latest novel."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"For its first 200 pages, 'On Beauty' lacks clear momentum. The characters aren't yet in sharp focus and the reader - this reader at least - is uncertain of where the plot is heading. Once the story begins to come together, however, it takes off with a bang, rewarding the patient reader with plot-lines that neatly (but unpredictably) interweave and characters that are fully realized and sympathetic, despite their flaws. Smith's send-up of the vacuousness of modern academia is spot-on, and the pain her characters cause each other and themselves really resonates. The ending of the novel is simultaneously ambiguous and satisfying - as in life, some characters are left happily and others less so.I would recommend 'On Beauty,' but it requires a willingness to plod through the first sections."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Firstly, I was extremely impressed with Zadie Smith's first effort, 'White Teeth', though less taken with her follow up, 'The Autograph Man'.'On Beauty' is undoubtedly a return to the form 'White Teeth'. Another epic sprawling family novel with lovely (though not overdone) writing and fascinatingly flawed characters. I particularly loved Kiki, the strong wise matriarch of the house, whose humanity is continously juxtaposed against her husband's intellect.Unfortunately, as addicted as I was to 'On Beauty', it suffers the same problems as her earlier two novels. Namely, the pacing within the text is slightly off-centred, with almost nothing occuring within the first and last forty pages. Nothing appears to evolve quickly enough, and although I was entirely captivated, I was never sure why. I also found the African-American characters simplistic and capable of falling into the mold Smith was perhaps trying to break from. Perhaps it would have been better set in England (like 'White Teeth'), because some of phrasing has a distinctly un-American ring to it.Similarly, the title 'On Beauty' is somewhat illogical, although I can see that Smith is essentially writing about discovering the flaws of selfhood and learning to dance with those flaws.Despite this, an interesting read, although not as engaging as 'White Teeth.' I am looking forward to Smith reaching her full and obvious potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It has taken me over a month to get round to writing this review, as I really struggled to decide whether or not this book is worthy of recommendation. An enjoyable read, certainly, but often it seemed to me that Smith was making a point and I was simply missing it...unclear where the narrative was going, what the characters were about and actually at times what the whole point of the story was. Howard's spinelessness irritated me endlessly. A shame, since Smith's style of writing is accessible and persuasive. Will read 'White Teeth' on the basis of having read this novel though, as I am told it is superior to 'On Beauty'."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After writing \\"White Teeth,\\" (which I highly recommend) Zadie Smith has not come close to a satisfying read.The plot of \\"On Beauty\\" is unoriginal -- how many times have we read about middle aged professors sleeping around, with the \\"good\\" wife and hip kids -- puhleese!The main charcters are uninteresting, and the writing is just OK.When the cover of a book has the author's name in type 5 times larger than the title, watch out!Waste of time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Chekov would've hated this novel. Why? By the end of the novel, there are a dozen guns on the mantle, not one of them fired.Every character had potential. Every story thread had potential.But non of them go anywhere!I read the whole novel WAITING and nothing ever really happened.There is an affair which has no real meaning in the book but to supposedly add weight. There are friendships which never go anyhwere.The supposed main plot never even really happens.Guns guns everywhere but not a single shot fired!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Sometimes we read books simply to enjoy the feeling of recognition -- of ourselves, of the \\"types\\" of people we've encountered, of the world around us. For me, On Beauty was that kind of book. Not the kind of novel that will change my life or take me to new places, and not \\"Important Literature\\" that will be read generations from now, but a story that presents me with characters and situations, cleverly and carefully evoked, that I find delightfully and sometimes disturbingly familiar.This being said, it makes sense that the book wouldn't have universal appeal. I live in Boston and I went to a college very much like Wellington. So I can relate to many of the scenarios and characters (and I mean that in the sense of saying \\"that guy's a real character\\"). For me, reading the book was like looking through old yearbooks or photo albums. The pleasure of it was akin to watching a well-written but not particularly deep TV show, like Six Feet Under, or Sex & the City.My major beef with the book was the dialogue. I second the reviewer who commented on Smith's tin ear for American speech. Where were her American editors? An American--even one with a British father, I'd think--would never say \\"You were meant to be here,\\" but \\"You were supposed to be here.\\" Jerome would call his emails \\"emails,\\" not \\"mails.\\" And Levi would certainly not \\"pay a call\\" to his friend in Roxbury. It's incredible that no one made the necessary edits, for the American printing if nothing else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am one third of the way through On Beauty. I came to Amazon to see if I was the only one just not getting this book. I don't care about the characters, the setting or plot. I agree with one of the other reviewer's when he said the book was long winded. I finish most books and even picked this book up for the second time to give it a chance but I just don't have the patience to continue when there are so many good books I still have not read. Once again, I should have read the reviews on the jacket more carefully and I would have realized they were for her last book and none were for this book, always a dead giveaway. I just checked my only other review and saw that in that review I recommended Zadie Smith's White Teeth. Funny."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Hard to beleive a first time novelist would have gotten this published, let alone well reviewed. the characters don't speak anything like real people (an inner city rapper: \\"I'm awfully glad you could come.\\"), the plot is barely in existence, the last third feel chopped together in a software program. Its childish. Prudish. Pompous. Read any two pages and you'll see."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth, I was thrilled to pick up another Zadie Smith book, \\"on Beauty.\\" Although I do not like \\"On Beauty\\" as much as \\"White Teeth,\\" I believe it is a worthwhile read. Once again, I feel that Smith masterfully presents us with REAL people. These people aren't all good or all bad. They are REAL, and for that, I love Zadie Smith's writing. One thing I loved about White Teeth was the deep cultural messages and although \\"On Beauty\\" contained similar messages, it wasn't as profound. I was disappointed as I looked for deeper meanings into the characters and their motives and felt that Zadie Smith could have made a stronger effort to discuss the interracial marriage between Howard and Kiki and their children's own struggles for their identity in a rich white neighborhood. The two older children do not seem to think much about their personal idenity, at least in regards to race, and the only character who does is the youngest son, Levi, who tries desperately to be \\"street.\\"This book took a very pessimistic view of marriage and discussed affairs and divorce as if marriage has, like batteries, only a certain amount of \\"life\\" to it before it all goes to hell. I appreciated that the pain of affairs was clearly shown in all characters, including the wayward husband. The affairs the wayward husband has were so pointless and ruined his marriage and almost ruined his career. You find yourself so angry at the man! I was pissed because I was like, \\"Dude, you should have at least SOME rationale for having an affair beyond middle age boredom and lust!\\" Yet, the anger I feel toward this character simply testifies to Smith's ability to bring her characters alive and bring you into the story. It is truly masterful writing. The story is depressing but I couldn't NOT finish it. Each character is so complex, beautifully described, and beautifully developed. And although things go from bad to worse...you have to follow it through to the end. Throughout it all, you HOPE for the characters and I think that is the most powerful element of Smith's writing."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I actually enjoyed White Teeth better, unlike many reviewers who say this is Smith's best work. But make no mistake, \\"On Beauty\\" is a fine book and well worth reading. Smith is particularly good at dialogue."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I purchased and read this based on a great review in the New York Times Sunday Book Review. I was not disappointed.The story is constructed on a wonderful frame and decorated with engaging, careful writing. It is a highly embellished, almost rococo story; anyone seeking the distilled prose style of a JM Coetzee will be unhappy. The author gives voice to adolescents, especially, in a full and thorough way. She respects her young characters and does not create glossy caricatures of youths, as so many authors do.Other reviewrs here have complained that the author has a poorly tuned ear for American slang, gives inaccurate descriptions of black body colors and does a bad job of describing physical traits. I can only say that none of these things appeared to me to be a problem. I much admire the way her characters adjusted their speech and deportment according to their shifting milieus. Particularly with regard to descriptions of middle aged bodies and the way they work, I was on board. And as a 56 year old woman with many same-age intimate friends, I think I am on safe ground here.My only complaint about this book: God bless your young heart, Zadie Smith; middle-aged academics and others are a lot more nuanced and occult than you now know. The story from Howard's and Kiki's perspectives does not quite ring true. The writing has the mildly snide acerbity typically heard among slightly insecure graduate students. The author will improve in this area with more years on her.The author is a wonderful observer and chronicler of humans, especially young ones. I look forward to many more witty, kindhearted, trenchant stories. It is a joy to watch this talent develop."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book, though good, wasn't great. I expect great from something receiving so much hype. I was interested in the story, but didn't much care about what happened for the characters. I wish I had spent my time somewhere else."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"White Teeth was dead boring but gave her the benefit of the doubt and perservered with Autograph Man, which again failed to capture my interest on any level. Have only read On Beauty as I always try and read the Booker shortlist and how this novel can be nominated,let alone shortlisted is beyond me. Again it just seems to be a raving mess. I really want to like this author - she interviews well, is very beautiful, I definately admire her, but if this wins over Arthur and George and Never let me Go there is something seriously wrong ( although last years winner was rubbish too!)"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith knows little about life in a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts. After all, she is not even American and it appears that she has done little research on this subject matter. Characters did not seem realistic or believable. It seemed to me that she or her publisher wanted to market the book to an American audience so she made the book take place in the US, but that subject is not her expertise.I understand that this book was nominated for the Booker - I am starting to lose respect for the prize. It is not even well written. There is much better fiction out there - skip this one!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's third novel, \\"On Beauty\\", touted unashamedly as a rewrite of E M Forster's \\"Howard's End\\", succeeds on a level, which in lesser hands would not have been thought possible. Avoiding by a mile a verdict of misadventure which would have greeted such a seemingly foolishly brave venture, Smith brings us bang up-to-date in contemplating contemporary truths behind the famous \\"only connect\\" line from Forster's original novel by examining class and race divisions, political ideology and religion, the role of art and above all, universal human concerns and values in modern society.The liberal Belseys and conservative Kipps, two families from opposites sides of the track, cross paths and swords when their contrasting social values and beliefs collide as soon as the Kipps relocate from London to Massachusetts. Howard and Monty, heads of their respective clans and both Rembrandt scholars, are poised for a dangerous showdown that could cost them their academic reputation and careers. Ironically, the flash-in-the pan romance between Jerome and Victoria in London, rather than accentuating the rift between the two families, in fact provides the perfect excuse for Kiki to reach out to Carlene, thereby forging an unlikely friendship between the two older women that would form the moral center of the novel. There is a secondary plotline focusing on Carl, a member of the modern underclass, his accidental relationship with the idealistic Zora and his seduction by the heartless Victoria, which brings the conflict to a climax.But strip away the ideological faade and you will find the Belseys and the Kipps looking uncomfortably like each other. For all their puffed up conservatism and pro-establishment values, the worm at the heart of the Kipps family proves just as pernicious as the dysfunctional badge the Belseys wear on their sleeves. Howard's philandering, his undisguised disconnect with his family, etc, reveal the hollowness at the center of his agnostic secularism - Howard Belsey proudly declares they don't celebrate Christmas. In daring to subject the fractures and fissures of modern life to microscopic scrutiny, Smith has given us characters that don't endear themselves to us. Apart from Kiki and Carlene - earth mother and realist respectively - the other clan members are by turns pathetic (Howard), smug (Monty), repugnant (Victoria) or else surprisingly underwritten (Jerome and Michael).Smith's prose is wonderful and never less than compelling. The plot moves a tad slowly at first but picks up in the final third and best written part of the novel. The dialogue isn't always smooth - Levi's and Carl's street talk sound forced and awkward - and we could have done without all the gratituous sex. It just leaves a nasty aftertaste.Despite its flaws, \\"On Beauty\\" makes for a totally absorbing read and is one of the best novels I've read last year. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As gifted a writer as Zadie Smith is, she disappoints in \\"On Beauty\\". Lifting a novel's entire structure from E.M Forster is not an \\"homage\\" - it is plagiarism. Translating another author's plot into present-day idiom is, at best, a sophomoric exercise. I expected better from this talented author.Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype that surrounds this book. Read the work in its original form, E.M. Forster's \\"Howard End\\". And pick up Zadie Smith's \\"White Teeth\\" to see what this author can do when she refrains from the derivative."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I initially enjoyed this book and the characters but as I got further into the story, I started to feel like it wasn't going anywhere. The story seemed to run out of steam for me after Carlene discovered the truth about Howard's affair. I found myself wandering and losing interest after that point and then I finally gave up without finishing the book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"So I read it -based upon the euphoric reviews. Excuse me - while there are two hilarious scenes regarding academia (Zora's blackmail of the dean to gain admission to a class and a university faculty meeting) and one truly sad scene when an older faculty member goes back to visit his working class dad, there is nothing else to recommend reading 400+ pages about basically uninteresting, sometimes nasty folks - no matter what their color. The book is disjointed in terms of narrative and uninteresting in terms of characters. If I met them at a gathering of any sort I would run for cover and I am so annoyed that I spent as much time with them as I did."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is my first Zadie Smith read, one of my book club picks. It's very different from the books I usually enjoy, but I found myself drawn into the story. If it had a better ending I would have rated it a five star. All in all, however. it is well worth the time and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved it! The book was in wonderful shape (as described) and it turned out to be an amazing read. The price was reasonable even with the shipping charge. It appeared to have barely been touched let alone read! The only complaint that I have is that it took way too long to receive. I would say I didn't get the book until a week and a half after I placed my order. I wish it would have cone fasterm though I suppose I should try a different mailing option other than 'standard' so that was probably my fault, athough the book was supposed to be sent out within two business days after the order was placed and it certainly was not shipped until I would say four or five days.Otherwise I was completely thrilled. I am happy that i went through this seller- they are very competent. I would gladly wait a week to get a book in such great condition as this instead of one that is all torn up. I am overall very pleased and will probably order from this seller again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Like many other posters, it took me awhile to fully grasp On Beauty. I read White Teeth right before Beauty to get a grasp of the writer. In my opinion, Smith is much more focused on character development-where as the plot can sometimes become slow or irrelevant. She takes her time to develop each character with their flaws and curious qualities. I guess that it why it took me so long to understand or even care when Howard was discussed as a character. However, take the time to keep reading and you will see how he develops along with his family and colleaguesEven though the book can be \\"adjective heavy\\" with the plot, I still found it enjoyable and related to my college experiences with all types of students. Read On Beauty for what Smith does best---become invested with the characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I really can't understand all these negative reviews. I just loved it. Smith's writing is superb...she is not only like Forster, she is like Dickens in her scope and humor. One of the best books I've read this year."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Who are these people saying bad things about this book!?Zadie Smith's \\"ON BEAUTY\\" is hands down the best book I have read this year! It is phenomenal! I can't believe nobody is getting the intricate beauty of the truths being \\"touched on\\" here--rather than shoved in our faces. Excellent.And I'm quite shocked that someone else mentioned Kola Boof in their book review! I thought I was the only person who'd heard of her work! But you're right. Kola Boof's novels are like poetic tablets from another planet. She's just AWESOME. I don't think the literary world is ready for a writer that soulful and original yet. But it's wrong to compare her to Zadie Smith. They're too totally different writers. They're not cut from the same cloth.Zadie is BETTER.People who don't like \\"ON BEAUTY\\" are crazy. Go Zadie!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I can't believe this book got any good reviews. It is just plain awful. It looks like something that went from first draft to publishing with no editorial review in between. Her characterization of Americans and American speech patterns is ridiculous and quite annoying. Her American characters are caricatures -- for example why is Kiki obese? Oh, because women of color just get obese when they get older, no reason, no explanation, no delving into her character to understand why a sexy, happily-married woman would just balloon up to an unhealthy fatness. I really loved White Teeth. Ms. Smith should stick to writing about English people and their ways, and leave us alone.Finally, many of the newspaper reviewers talked about Howard's End and how it's such a reflection on it, etc. I didn't read Howards' End, so sorry, if that is what it takes to appreciate the book, than there should be something on the cover that says, \\"make sure you read Howard's End first.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This claptrap would have never been published had the author not been black and female."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If you read Howard's End perhaps you will find this book particularly interesting, as you may compare the two worlds. It's also a fine read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Very interesting book. It is provocative and deals with relationships and behavior of familty members and interracial relationships."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Calls to mind \\"The Brain Hunters\\", the great 1940 novel about eugenics, racial stereotyping, global geopolitics and the influence of the Third Reich on the Fourth.The chapter on pets got me very emotional, and made me think differently of my own dog, Peter.I don't know where to start! This novel is a pager turner of an incredible story with an abyss of emotional depth that will leave the reader spent, shaken out of his or her wooden workaday existence. The descriptions of the dust-bowl and the Depression (the period following the stock market crash of 1929) made me weep more than once. The cast of characters calls to mind Dickens, and the presence of artificial limbs is outright Melvillian. Features also the excellent use of a fey man as the embodiment of a wooden, post-columbian textual figure. A must for teachers, students and parents who care about the rainforest.I just bought three of these to give out as birthday presents this year. And plan to buy more for Christmas. This is definitely a heartbreaking work of incredible genius."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I only read the first 50 or 60 pages of this book, but in that brief space I saw several things the reviewer below me talks about. I gave the anglo/new england/southern slang mix-ups a pass -- at one point Smith notes that the son is purposely affecting his Brooklyn accent. Also, these are characters who have lived in a lot of different places, so I can imagine that their language would pick up a bit from here, a bit from there.The reviewer below me is spot on about the facile characterizations, tho. Uptight, white, male academic; earthy, forgiving, sarong-draped black wife; earthy, forgiving, black wife of other academic. The characters didn't move beyond these types for me. And then we meet the celebrated & somewhat intimidating (to KiKi -- earthy wife #1) poet who says in her first speech in the book, \\"The sun is a lemon today, it is. It's like a huge lemon-drop.\\" Yup, our hip, sophisticated poet says that. Maybe later in the book we find out that she's the Thomas Kincaid of poetry but I couldn't be bothered to find out. If Smith can't take the time to put something a little more interesting, or heck, even a little less embarassing, in that character's mouth, then I can't be bothered to read her book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" is my first Zadie Smith book. And I have to say that I am better man havinig read it. The book is divided into three parts. Part I: an introduction to the Belsey-Kipps rivalry. Part II: development of the Belsey household. Part III: the \\"explosion.\\" I term part III the \\"explosion\\" because I have never busted through 100 pages faster in my life. Everything falls together. You have to be patient in this novel. Often, in the first two parts, you're asking yourself what's the point. But part III is where everything takes off. My only complaint about this book is that Smith leaves the reader wanting more, resembling the disingenuous approach of Howard, one of her characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If I could, I would have given this book a \\"O\\" I didn't write a review of it a few months ago, when I tried to read it, as I was too busy- but I have read many of the posted reviews and found them to be much more accurate than the reviews in the mag/papers. I love E.M. Forester(sic) and Howard's End is one of my favorite books in the world- after Proust. I bought the book in hardcover shortly after its publication. I could not believe how bad it was. Having paid close to 30.00 for it, I was determined to finish it. I couldn't. It was painful. At least with Danielle Steele you get what you expect. I agree with the reviewer from England who says more or less, \\"The worst part of this is that Smith has received such acolades (sic) for it- i.e. a finalist for the Booker. Its enough to make one believe that \\"multi-culturalism\\" and \\"political correctness\\" has ruined literature and criticism. When Frank Rich, an intelligent man, though admittedly not a literary critic waxes eloquent about this book, then I know that I, my husband, (a distinguished Professor of American Literature) and a very small handful of people, must be the only persons in America that can still recognize a good from a bad book. Good: Charming Billy (Alice McDermot) (sic) Bad: Gilhead by \\"I'm trying to forget\\" I saw a piece about her(Smith) in Vogue- that exactly where she belongs- and even then, since I enjoy V.'s as a pastiche of American pretensions."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In Zadie Smith's third book, On Beauty, she returns to the woderful storytelling that she showed in White Teeth. This time she brings the story to America, to the fictional Wellington College, in Massachussetts. Howard Belsey is an Art History professor there, specializing in 17th century art. He is an Englishman, married to a woman from the Carribbean, Kiki. Their marriage is based upon that in E.M. Forster's Howard's End (a book that I strongly suggest reading, or re-reading, after or before you have read this one). However, instead of a mixed-class marriage, theirs is a mixed-race marriage.Kiki and Howard have three children: Jerome, who remains firmly fixed in the white world of their father; Levy, who maintains a black identity; and Zora, a brilliant student at Wellington, who is stuck in the middle between black and white. How their try to reconcile the difference is at the heart of this wonderful novel.Their peace is shattered when Monty Kipps comes for a short stay to teach at the college. He is a professor of Black Studies, and married to a white woman. Monty and Howard are professionally at odd ends, and they bring their rivalry to the front during faculty meetings.This is a wonderful story, with mixed and hidden messages. Reading Howard's End will help to partially solve some of the mysteries that this book contains."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I had the unfortunate obligation of reading this novel for a class. The characters feel like caricatures fumbling around each other with never the right words for the situation they find themselves in. Most of the book is composed of awkward dialogue, with the characters either being too polite or too aggressive. Yes, Smith is trying to convey how different people of different backgrounds clash yet still try to get along, but for the reader's sake, it would have been nice to have a little more flow to the book. The book should have been titled _On Social Anxiety: When People Who Are Different Interact_, because that is its major theme. The thing is, we don't need a reminder of how different we all are. We're living that every day. We don't need to read a novel to realize that.Lastly, I don't know what all those positive newspaper reviews were reading, but this book was not funny -- at all. I didn't laugh a single time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was reading this book for a book club but really could not get interested in the the first section. I am glad I kept reading as the last 2 sections were very interesting. A good book for a book club discussion."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Well, this novel by Zadie Smith was selected for our book club. After reading the first chapter, I realized that this had a similar plot as E.M. Forrester's Howards End. Although I had a good idea where this was leading towards, it came to some disappointment about the character development in the book. Also, I found myself predicting the scenes ahead of time and finding a slightly interesting twist in the plot. Smith seems to have a strange depiction about kids growing up in today's society. We see how Smith tries to transport the Edwardian time into the present time with a upper middle-class black family. Things fall apart when another family with higher status moves into the neighborhood. If you are not familar with Howards End, then I feel that you may enjoy the plot more than me. But, you probably will feel a slight indifference with this modern family since they are all equally bad except for the wife and perhaps the son who was rejected by the daughter of the other family. This is just my own opinion but there are bad sides to people but characters are just as diverse as us. Plus, I am old-fashioned critic and it would be more constructive with a clear protagonist and antagonist. There has been plenty of praise for this book and I guess doing something over again with your own style should be recognized. I just feel that if you are going to do it again then keep some aspects of the book that is true to the characters. I just believe that there is some good in everyone."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved this book. As the daughter of a professor and an adjunct professor, I found humor and truth in the book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. Zadie Smith is a young,sophisticated voice in the otherwise plain landscape of new writers. This book is not exceptional, but it is outstanding in the subtelty the author employs when discussing the complex realities of race and academia. I don't think this will be the author's best (I personally found White Teeth to be an even more rewarding reading), but it is definitely book worthy of a reader's time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Yes, this book is about two families, PC, Academia, Rembrant etc but really it is about how ZS gets some of the characters from the inside. Howard Beasley, Zora, Isaac, and from the outside: Jerome and most of the family of the rivals.To me what was wonderful was when two characters we know from within are sitting or talking together or, with Ziki and Howard, making love.The richness of this book is in that psychological intimacy, more imo than the ideas, which surround the characters as they do us readers, more or less. But what's really earth-shaking and great fiction is how ZS does let us in and once in, we can become that character, flawed and all. I think that is her gift independent of the various subjects that are really no more pronounced in our lives than in theirs: The PC College or the black/white stuff is all around us as well, but what is formost is our ways of knowing ourselves and each other, what Zadie Smith can do, and can avoid. So for me, what is genuninely wonderful about this book, is how when she enters Nora, we are inside too, and when she doesn't enter Monty he is seen only thru others. I can't be perfectly clear here and so will try again later. But for now, I noticed mainly how she can slip into one or many characters so that it's not plot-driven as much as a psychological study, and we become the characters. Very special writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Just don't bother.It's seldom I quit reading a book I've started, but I wish I had quit trying on this one.Cartoon characters, no depth. Plot? Are you joking?Don't bother, really."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was my favorite book of '05. I haven't enjoyed a novel so completely since Middlesex or The Corrections. It's a rich comic novel, not gimmicky, well-developed charcters, great style."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As others have pointed out, the book has obvious flaws, but it may well have strengths that are less obvious.Smith is not accurate at social description, as for instance in her faulty understanding of the American vernacular. Nor does she seem to have mastered that particular brand of Standard English that is employed in elite American universities, where, to give an example, a scholar would not say, as she has her Howard say, that he would be \\"happy to drop everybody [with his car] where they need to go.\\" In elite American English, that would be \\"where he needs to go.\\" And she is not accurate, either, in the details of academic politics. A non-tenured professor would not be asked to chair a major university-wide committee. And the timetable of tenure decisions is not as she says.All this suggests that Smith has not done the careful research about American academia that was done, for example, by Ian McEwan about a medical specialty in his \\"Saturday.\\" But this question of a novelist's research also raises the issue of just how much a novelist can indeed learn by spending a few months, or whatever, in an environment in which he had been previously unacquainted. Can he, or she, find a satisfactory shortcut to the deep understanding that comes from many years of immersion in a social milieu ? When a writer like Simenon, say, writes about the streets of Paris (where he was not born, actually), he writes with an authority that is immediately apparent, and this without the \\"research\\" of more with-it writers.In any case, the inaccuracies in Smith's book are often more than made up for by her right-on skewering, in the manner more of a cartoonist than a reporter, of the inanities of academic windbags. She has both \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" academics hold forth with humbug that is exactly, though not literally, accurate.After Pablo Picasso made a sketch of a \\"peace dove\\" to support the Communist-inspired peace movement back in 1949, Joseph Stalin, then still more-or-less alive, complained that \\"Comrade Picasso is a great fighter for peace, but he is, alas, a lousy artist.\\" Well, Comrade Stalin was looking for a photographic accuracy in the details of the dove, and when he didn't find it, he thought that the art, or non-art in his eyes, was \\"lousy.\\" The lines, the form, the inspiration that others drew from Picasso were all lost on him, no doubt because they were not obvious to a General Secretary of the Communist Party."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just finished this novel a couple of days ago. I envy Zadie Smith. She is a superior writer and novelist. The intricacies of her stories astound me.I especially enjoy the way she can switch between different characters voices as narrators' so effortlessly. Her prose is amazing.I want to share one favorite quotes from the novel.\\"This is why Kiki had dreaded having girls: she knew she wouldn't be able to protect them from self-disgust. To that end she had tried banning television in the early years, and never had lipstick or a woman's magazine crossed the threshold of the Belsey home to Kiki's knowledge, but these and other precautionary measures had made no difference. It was in the air, or so it seemed to Kiki, this hatred of women and their bodies - it seeped with every draught in the house; people brought it home on their shoes, they breathed it in off their newspapers. There was no way to control it.\\"I love Zadie Smith's writing. Absolutely love it. She is my new favorite. But I recognize the fact that her novels are not as accessible in terms of content to a lot of people. She makes reference to tons of authors, artists, and other \\"bourgie, frou-frou\\" culture that your every day run of the mill average joe might not be familiar with--and I can see how that might turn some people off onto reading her. Also, her novels are a bit difficult to grasp in their entirety--very intricate, detailed, multi-layered. However, I love her references to popular culture juxtaposed against the supposed \\"high-end' culture that she also writes about. This trend is even more evident in On Beauty than her previous novel White Teeth (which I also love).A substantial portion of the theme and content and characterizations of On Beauty deal with the idea of academia versus such things as Hip Hop Culture. Or upper-middle \\"white\\" class versus working \\"ghetto/immigrant\\" class. She weaves these themes throughout the novel in ways not always directly evident but often just implied, glanced at, thought about quickly--that is the beauty of Zadie Smith's writing. She can make references to Rembrandt and Tupac. To Karl Marx, Mozart and \\"the fattest man in rap. . . a 400-pound, Bronx-born Hispanic genius\\" who \\"only 25 years old...died of coronary (I assume this to be Big Pun ).This novel is the struggle of a mixed race family with forming an identity, of mixed economic and home country origins and mixed career and life goals. Are they \\"street\\" in touch with black/african/african american culturel like Levi wishes so vehemently to be, Florida-country super woman like Kiki, astutely academic minded like Howard and Zora or religously enlightened like Jerome.They are actually, as a family, very far from any of these characterizations, and yet, each one has an extreme influence on who they are as a whole--they would not be the same without each one. With a family full of such polar personalities you would think it was a wonder that they still manage to love through the very rough times they encounter throughout the course of the novel. But Smith makes it very simple to see that love does exist, not always, maybe not fully, but underneath it all where it matters the most.Please read this novel sometime in your life. AND read White Teeth as well. :) Zadie Smith my new hero.p.s. I love the hip-hop savy, savaant, character named Carl who blows the academic folks away--at least in my mind."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty made me remember why I loved Zadie Smith so much.On Beauty begins with an introduction to Howard Belsey, a middle-aged Englishman living in a wealth suburb of Boston. Howard teaches Art History at a college that reminded me of &lt;a href = \\"http://www.wellesley.edu\\">Wellesley&lt;/a>, with the exceptions that Wellesley is not co-ed and Wellington, the fictional equivalent is. Howard is introduced to us at a time in his life when most people would consider him struggling - he is a Rembrandt scholar that does not have tenure, cannot finish his book and has recently been caught in an adulterous affair with he and his wife, Kiki's, best friend.Kiki and Howard have three children - Jerome, Levi and Zora. The three children have their own issues to overcome. Jerome is completely disgusted by his father's behavior and becomes a devout Christian in order to come to terms with that behavior. Zora, a sophomore at Wellington, is a feminist who is trying to set herself apart from the legacy or lack of it that her father has at Wellington. Levi becomes enmeshed with urban, hip-hop and Haitian culture in an effort to distance himself from his family's upscale lifestyle.These players are pitted against the Kipps family, their opposites in every way, shape and form.I loved how Ms. Smith deftly intertwined all of the characters in this novel and developed them. From start to finish, you could see how the characters morphed and changed and learned. It was amazing. At the same time, she raises issues of economic class, race and gender as well as family relationships, marriage and friendship. There were some parts that I skimmed and could do without. I did not like Levi a lot of the time - I thought that he whined a lot and it got old after a while. There were also some parts of the novel that dealt with analysis of art that I did not enjoy in part because I did not know the piece that was being discussed and had no frame of reference. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel...and would highly recommend it to anyone out there."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As a member of a book club the discussion and points of view made for a good session &#34;On Beauty&#34; Many were not sure about the book but changed their mind at the end"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I highly recommend this novel to anyone who loves the rich novels of the 19th century.

Wow, I loved it!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was completely absorbed in the story and the characters from the first page to the last.I must read!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I love this book- thought I couldn't love anything as much as White Teeth, but I was wrong. Such a clever story of two families, so honest and sad and funny and perfect."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What could be more beautiful than a family? Why, the debacles of two of course! Awarded the Orange Prize for Fiction, On Beauty follows the Belsey and the Kipps families through 443 pages of shenanigans that only family can forgive.The Belsey family is made up of Howard and Kiki who are the parents of Levi, Zora and Jerome. Howard is a white Englishman and Kiki is a voluptuous African American. They've been married thirty years and have lived the last ten years in a Boston University community where Howard has been an art history professor. Kiki, once an activist, works at the local hospital.The Kipps, an all black family from London, includes Monty and Carlene as the heads and their children Michael and Victoria. Monty is also an art history master and Howard's arch nemesis and vice versa. Circumstances lead the Kippses to the same town and same university as the Belseys where frictions arise between the men and the siblings.The ongoing racial and art war going on between Howard and Monty is what drives a wedge between these two families. Howard is for affirmative action and Monty is not. Their battle has been in the newspapers, on the radio, in interviews and in books. Now it's on Howard's home turf; except he hasn't been given tenure yet. Only Carlene and Kiki are willing to put past differences aside and co-exist amicably.The characters don't stop with these two families. There's the antiquated university staff, knowledge hungry students, angry Haitian street vendors, melodramatic Hip Hop writers and both talented and untalented poets. All these relationships show a definite balance of wants and needs; and haves and have nots.Zadie's character development made me want to follow these two families through their day to day lives and interactions. Now that it is over I still want more. There are a lot of characters, main and supporting but all have a purpose, even a young child prot&eacute;g&eacute; who's only mentioned in a page and a half. Her perspective, given by the narrator, lends to Howard's personality.On Beauty is rich with the emotional turmoil of love, hate, deception, redemption, politics, art, racism, acceptance and of course the draw beauty has on us.My favourite character in the book is Kiki. I love her name, I love her body and I love her personality. Kiki is resentful for having been isolated from other black people. \\"Everywhere we go, I'm alone in this... this sea of white.\\" She made me laugh, she made me cry, she made me proud. She is a large beautiful woman who carries herself well despite her husband cheating on her. She uses this heartache to locate the woman she once was and to build on the woman she has become. Her self-acceptance is inspiring and she is the character who has grown the most by the end.I've probably made this sound like quite a serious book but it was really quite light hearted and amusing. The humour of every day life and how silly people (young and old) can be is around every corner. The storyline is intense enough to peak your sense. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Reviewed by M. E. Wood."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I cannot believe this book was nominated for a prize. I had to leave this book after giving it a few chances - it was just babbling and pointless."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"There were too many weak males to call it a good book. Certainly makes for an interesting book club discussion, but not a book I'm anxious to share with friends."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A story about a very liberal mixed race family living in a Cambridge-like college town, how they live, and how they nearly implode. The story centers on the Belsey family, and more so on Howard Belsey, the British-born art history professor hoping and waiting for tenure at Wellington, a fictional stand-in for Harvard or some other small, elite, ivy-walled university.I found Howard hard to like. He makes a marriage-threatening mistake, and just when it seems the relationship might heal, he makes a similar, ickier mistake. But beyond that, he is self-centered, cornering conversations, even with his college-age children who might have something to say. He doesn't permit the family to celebrate even a secular version of Christmas because it assaults his atheist and non-commercial views, he only allows abstract art to be displayed in the house despite what his wife loves, he doesn't support his eldest son, Jerome, after a heartache because the girl comes from a religious family (and is the daughter of his academic foe), and he doesn't take Jerome's growing Christianity seriously. So he's a pretty rigid, my-way-or-the-highway liberal.But even though he's not likable as a &#34;person,&#34; complicated characters like Howard are awfully fun to come across in a book, and Smith gives us many such characters. Howard's wife, Kiki, is an African American nursing administrator, a stout-hearted woman from the south and an earthy foil to Howard. She can turn on the southern sass, but never becomes a caricature. During a long period of marital crisis, she strikes up a lovely friendship with an unlikely newcomer in the neighborhood. Jerome is the quiet, spurned, Christian boy getting his education at Brown, so therefore away from the action for most of the story. Daughter Zora is the ambitious, entitled middle child, a student at Wellington who takes a forceful, activist role that blows back in her face. Levi, still in high school, has adopted a more urban, &#34;street&#34; persona that runs counter to his upbringing but represents for him a more authentic way of being black.Beyond interesting characters, Smith gives us much to consider about race, religion, art, politics, liberal, conservatives - all the big stuff, and she does it in a natural way, as these themes arise in the course the normal goings-on within an academic community. Heck, I'm pretty left-leaning myself, yet got a better sense of a religious, conservative view of homosexuality from a speech made by Monty Kipps, an art history professor new to Wellington, an Howard's more celebrated rival.So yes, a great book, and one that will send me to the library looking for more of her titles."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book was an easy read, but it definitely had me bored more times than once. It's mainly about the complexity of a multiracial family, but it kind of just glazes on the surface of this topic. I kept wanting Smith to go deeper, and her characters were too under-developed. It was funny at times, and had me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. I don't like how she didn't really include any dialogue between Kiki and Howard after his affairs with other women became common knowledge. I wanted to see that play out, instead of just reading about their independent thoughts and feelings about it. I really liked her writing style..just not so much the content, which is probably a bit more important."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is coming from a person who reads mostly nonfiction and is looking for something different. There's a great plot, memorable characters, quality writing, there's some suspense, but it doesn't feel like characters are machines set up to drive the plot to the last page. Some loose ends are needed to make a story more lifelike, and that is here in just the right amount in this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel is a slice of several cultures I have little experience with: East Coast black urbanites, Ivy League university life, mixed-race families, London, art history and beat poetry. Many have criticized the story for its inauthentic dialogue and slow pacing. I can't speak for the dialogue except the words sound true to me though I do understand why others had problems with it. The apparent slower pacing worked well, I thought, because the prose was much more introspective. This book allows you to immerse yourself in each scene and each exchange of dialogue, and the added commentary is more like our own loose reflections on daily life, which give it a realism that others might find slow or irrelevant."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Considering the awards it won, this should be a great book, but I found it very unengaging. The author sets up any number of interesting subplots (son of H is about to wed daughter of M, his arch enemy; K gets cheated out of inheriting a valuable painting by her deceased friend's family) but all these conflicts somehow just evaporate. Considering that the first 200 pages of the book are the setup, and the second 200 are one expectation after another thwarted on the part of the reader, this makes for very disappointing reading. Add to that that every character manages to lose our sympathy the second they gain it (K and C seem to become friends, even though every single recorded conversation contains snubs and misunderstandings) and I had the hardest figuring why I should care about any of them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is an engaging novel of large scope, and with well-defined, vivid yet believable distinct characters. The writing is deft and mordant, without tipping into hilarity. A tale of tensions between and within two academic families, it revolves around Kiki, the wife and earth-mother figure of the Belsey family. Her feckless husband Howard betrays her and their children in myriad ways yet remains likable in a pathetic way, an object finally of pity as much as censure. I \\"read\\" this as an audiobook, ably narrated by Peter Francis James, whose deft handling of the many voices resolves the criticisms of reviewers as to Smith's treatment of dialects."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith brought me back around to being a fan of her writing with this book. I loved White Teeth, but was disappointed with The Autograph Man in all kinds of ways (though her writing ability is evident in anything she writes). On Beauty is a return to the insightful, panoramic vision of White Teeth. A large cast of characters handled deftly, and each one of them intimately rendered. I wouldn't say this novel has a plot so much as many incidents that eventually arrive at an amazing conclusion. Smith is a very English author (the novel is a spin off of an E.M. Forster novel), and it comes through in this book, even though she takes on American characters as well as English characters in this book, and spends a lot of time in American settings. Because of this, she's able to create American characters that feel almost more authentic than many American writers have rendered. Looking from the outside in has provided her with a fresh perspective. Recommended for readers who like a side of characters with their characters."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I really regret that I actually brought the book, If you want to read it I suggest getting it from the library but even then I wouldn't waste my time, the book has some moments but all the characters are very flat and one-dimentional. Also they were very unbelievable and I couldn't warm to any of them and I don't know why this book is so long Smith could have cut the story in half and it would have still had the same effect- emptiness. Overall I found the book shallow and too try hard."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I'd heard lots of hype about Zadie Smith, and I was not disappointed with On Beauty. The book's unconventional opening line had me hooked: \\"One may as well begin with Jerome's e-mails to his father:\\"The son is saving his virginity for marriage because of a new-found Christian faith, and his liberal, British father, a professor, is unamused - particularly when Jerome falls in love with the daughter of his arch-nemesis, a black, right-wing conservative who is anti-affirmative action, homosexuality, women's rights...and then we're off.Smith dexterously explores issues of race, class and culture through the lens of a family, name-dropping from Rembrandt to Tupac. This is a book that will set the benchmark for future \\"modern classics.\\"Here's an example of her writing chops:\\"From here she could see the strangely melancholic format of Jerome's text, italics and ellipses everywhere. Slanted sails blowing about on perforated seas.\\"Wow!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book was beautifully written and flawless if you ask me.

My loss.I clicked on 'add to cart' for one reason only -- I was looking for a very long audiobook to occupy some long walks, and 'On Beauty' -- at 20+ hours -- fit that requirement perfectly. In the beginning, I admit feeling as though I'd come in late -- I couldn't quite figure out who these people were, or why I should care. That didn't last long -- about a half-hour in, I was hooked.This may not be the greatest book of the year -- I did love some of Smith's throw-away observations (eg,the least-wanted party guest always shows up first) which matched my vision of reality perfectly. I don't quibble over Kiki's down-home talk, even though she's a professional -- she's talking to her family, for crying out loud. Don't we all speak differently at home, than we do in professional settings?I also appreciate the fact -- the very rare fact -- that Smith is at least fair to the religious and conservative visiting professor. Most authors, sadly, would have trashed him for his ideas alone. Instead Smith created a very real character -- he has his faults, like everyone else, but she doesn't ridicule his philosophy. If anything, she gives him a fair chance to present his views. That's unusual, among the left-leaning literati who seem to dominate the scene.The narrator is great, by the way. So good, you forget you're listening to just one man reading the whole thing. The characters come alive through his narration, each speaking with perfect definition.In all honesty, I probably wouldn't take the time to read this book, but as an audiobook, it's great entertainment. I found myself looking forward to the walking errands, so I'd have a chance to listen again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After the excellence of white teeth, this is a poor effort. First I don't think the author should try to write a book based on life in America because she clearly does not understand it. I don't know the basis of her research and I don't want to paint with a broad brush BUT, the children of academics and most middle-upper middle class black and well read people do not speak \\"ebonics\\". Most cannot even relate to the characters she miserably attempts to portray. I did not buy into the story or any of the characters. After a few chapters, I found myself annoyed by the baseless story, lame dialogue between the family members. I hope the author goes back to what she knows and does best - stories of characters based in England. Glad I didn't pay for this one!!!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The book has nice prose passages, especially when the siblings are interacting. Other than that ...I'm impressed by Smith's knowledgeable treatment of Rembrandt, although the relation between art and reality as illustrated by the lives of the two families is a bit obscure and feels forced at the end.Now that I've dispensed with the book itself, I have a plea to everyone who has been mis-using the Forster quote \\"Only connect\\". Read the quote --it is not about communication, but self-integration. \\"Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion, and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer. Only connect, and the beast and the monk, robbed of the isolation that is life to either, will die.\\"Sorry to be nitpicky, but it is one of the great quotes of all time and it makes me sad that so few people understand it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" is Zadie Smith's glorious third novel. Howard Belsey is having a difficult time. He is still in the doghouse after a one-night stand. Then he learns that his academic adversary, Monty Kipps, is joining the staff at Wellington, the Bostonian university at which Howard teaches (which seems to be based on the Harvard Zadie Smith knew as a Radcliffe fellow). Howard, whose unfinished magnum opus is entitled \\"Against Rembrandt: Interrogating a Master\\", ironically casts Monty as an iconoclast: although Monty's targets are political, rather than artistic. It is Howard who is the direct opposite of a Simon Schama or a Harold Bloom. Howard and his liberal colleagues fear that the conservative Monty will argue against Affirmative Action and the unqualified discretionaries that they allow on their courses. It doesn't help that Howard's son, Jerome, has previously engaged in a brief connection with Victoria, Monty Kipps' exceedingly beautiful daughter. Howard's daughter Zora (whom Zadie Smith has named after literary heroine Zora Neale Hurston) jealously regards Victoria as a vacuous beauty. However, not all of the Belseys' are at war against the Kipps': Kiki, Howard's wife, finds a common shelter with Carlene, Monty's friendly but sometimes distant wife. Meanwhile, Levi, the other Belsey child, embarks on a quest to assert his black identity, and falls in with a crowd of deprived Haitian immigrants. Along the way, they encounter Carl Thomas, a young black poet with conscious hip-hop lyrics, who strives to make something better of himself.Carl is the Leonard Bast, Carlene is Ruth Wilcox, and Kiki is Margaret Schlegel, in Zadie Smith's reworking of E. M. Forster's \\"Howard's End\\". In this, Zadie Smith seems to be taking her cue from Elaine Scarry's essay, \\"On Beauty and Being Just\\" (which Zadie does acknowledge to be one inspiration for the title of this novel). Scarry's thesis starts out with the observation that Beauty leads to replication - the artist sees a beautiful bird, which leads artist to paint the beautiful bird beautifully. Thus does Zadie Smith embark on a seemingly perilous voyage to reproduce a book she loves. It would appear that it's okay for a beautiful boy band to reproduce the millionth version of \\"Unchained Melody\\", because we don't expect much of the poor darlings: it is not okay for a respected literary novelist to do the same, because we expect so much more from them. That, at least, is the initial perception. But if one thinks of the origins of storytelling - bard on rock embellishing the already fantastic tales of his predecessors - then what Zadie Smith is attempting to do here does not seem so strange. However, it just seems more acceptable nowadays for the oral culture (boy bands) to do it, rather than the set-in-stone literary culture. At times though, it does seem as though Smith is following E. M. Forster's line too far - the aborted rail trip to Amherst reads uncomfortably due to this - Carlene's terminal spontaneity could have been revealed in a more original way. Yet, the final analysis must be that she uses her source material very intelligently and subtly. Although Zadie Smith seems to regard Roland Barthes as being very dry (no doubt due to the utility of his prose), \\"On Beauty\\" could be seen in some ways as indicative of \\"The Birth of the Reader\\", with the reader going so far as to create their own version of the text (although I prefer to see the relationship between author and reader as a dialogue, which is a whole lot less dramatic than this birthing and dying and circle of life kind of thing). For instance, Leonard Bast pursued Beauty in \\"Howards End\\" through books and impromptu midnight walks. Although \\"On Beauty\\" is in some ways a love letter to \\"Howards End\\", in its wit and vitality, the love goes both ways, resulting in a novel that is very much Zadie Smith's own. On a mundane level, there are scenes set in Zadie's homeland, Willesden, just like \\"White Teeth\\". On a more sublime level, Zadie Smith's voice in this novel seems liberated, exuberant, and confident: she is a novelist who is in full command of her literary powers. \\"On Beauty\\" is very much her book, full of her character, her twists and turns, rather than E. M. Forster's. To paraphrase a popular film of the 70s, it's she who is the master now.There is another more practical reason for Zadie Smith's employment of \\"Howard's End\\", other than her love for the novel. Current day America is analogous with Great Britain at the end of the Victorian era. Zadie Smith does know that there are many Leonard Basts out there in America: in pursuit of beauty, but angry and resentful because they have been deprived of it, or because it has been literally robbed from them. Just as the liberal women debate how to save the Leonard Basts of this world from their fate in \\"Howards End\\", so too do Howard and his liberal colleagues battle to save the discretionaries. Can Beauty ever be reached in an inherently unjust society? Zadie Smith has produced a very timely novel, as the truth in her novel has been made self-evident by the ugly catastrophe of Katrina.It would also be a pleasing irony if a Great American Novel, (as \\"On Beauty\\" is), were to win the Man Booker Prize. Zadie Smith should walk off with the prize in my view, because this outstanding novel deserves nothing less.I have created a comprehensive reading guide for \\"On Beauty\\" on the internet - interested readers can contact me for the hyperlink."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is not totally impossible that Zadie Smith named the main character in \\"On Beauty\\" Howard, so that reviewers could say that this book is about Howard's end and \\"Howards End\\". Puns aside, this magnificent novel has a lot to do with E. m. Forster's masterpiece -- so much so that that she even states in her early acknowledgements that her fiction is indebted to him and she wanted to make a homage.Any good reader can say that it is a hell of homage. \\"On Beauty\\" begins virtually like \\"Howards End\\", but instead of letters, here we have e-mails -- this is the XXI Century after all. Most of the important events in Forster's novel are here in a way or another. The main narrative follow two families, whose both patriarchs are British, but one of them lives in United States and the other in England. But it doesn't take too long for an incident that will join -- in spite of separating, at first -- these two families.Howard's family, the Belseys, live in Wellington, a college town in New England. He is married to an African-American woman and they have three children. He is a professor and has been working on a book about Rembrandt. After he has an affair with a colleague, his oldest son moves to England to the Kippses' house. Monty Kipp is Howard's nemesis. To his disappointment his son falls for Victoria Kipps and he goes to the old continent to sort things out. This is just the beginning of the mess that will be brought to the two households.Smith follows, most of the time, Forster's novel, updating the conflicts and characters. Nevertheless, the most important thing is, she has her own voice, therefore her \\"On Beauty\\" reads like a homage, like a re-read of classic and not plagiarism. \\"Howards End\\" is only an \`excuse' to her novel -- actually it is more than this, but this is a way of putting the connections.Since her first novel, \\"White Teeth\\" Smith has been interested in Forster narrative, his speech and the way he tackled English society of his time. In that book she dealt with a multicultural London where many ethnicities were \`forced' to share the same space and time. The results were mostly hilarious and heart-breaking. At the same time, she was criticizing the globalization and the search and lost of one's cultural and social identity. Her prose was light and fast -- some sentences were as quick as a heartbeat. She tried to capture slices of lives from one cover to another -- and she succeeded most of the time.With \\"On Beauty\\" she hasn't changed her interests. However she sure is a more mature writer. Dealing with less characters and plots, Smith is able to go deeper both in the people and situation she created. Most of the folks here suffer an arc from the beginning to the end, their lives are dramatically changed and we follow a very believable process. In the end, one can notice that the Belseys and the Kippses aren't the only ones who a different. And sensitive person who reads this book will also feel that something unusual happened to his/her feelings and senses. And Smith assures the place of one of the best novelists of our times, of her generation, of contemporary Britain, of...whatever category she can be placed. Period."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It is obvious Zadie Smith is excellent at the craft of writing. But I don't understand the hype about this book. Too many characters, some not developed very well."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I loved this novel by Zadie Smith. I'm so poor--I was an English major--that I have to get my books from the library. So, I checked out and read On Beauty last year. However, tonight I was at Borders and I saw this book on the remainder table. I choked! How could such a great, well written novel be priced at $5.99? I loved this book so much that I bought it. I've read the negative reviews posted here and do not understand what the reviewers were thinking. Maybe they are jealous. I'm a writer, but not jealous, just joyous whenever I can find something good to read (difficult these days). This novel is fresh, interesting, well written, great characters, great story, I learned a lot. In some ways this book reminds me of Lush Life by Richard Price. However, On Beauty did something that I dearly need and almost never get out of a book anymore...it made me laugh...out loud...God that felt SO good. (Glee Club.) Richard Russo's Straight Man did that to me too. Anyway, if you want to enjoy a novel, try reading this insightful, perceptive book. Kiki is such a wonderful character. She still makes me smile!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I recently read \\"On Beauty\\" by Zadie Smith and found it to be a very good read. The novel askes many questions that give readers much to think about: the male/female perspectives on beauty and aging; what is an \\"authentic\\" black experience; essentially 'airheaded' academics and much more.You will get to know the Belsey family of liberal white British academic Howard, his earthy African-American wife Kiki and their children: the pious and heartsick Jerome, the single-minded yet slightly out of touch Zora, and the desperate-to-be-down Levi. It is a family that is very different from any family in most new novels and I found the racial mix, politics, and setting of the novel very refreshing. You fall in love, get infuriated, and laugh with this family. To make a pop culture comparison, they are the \\"Huxtables After Dark\\", if you will.The only place Ms. Smith trips up is in capturing real American dialects and idioms--sometimes she comes off as a British person who gets all of her information about America via sitcoms and MTV. Also, since this book is often placed in the 'black section' of the book store, it may have a problem finding a wider audience, unfortunately stuck between books with titles like \\"Thug Missez\\" and \\"On Tha Down Low\\" ( I wish I was making this up!). But for people looking for a different sort of read from what you may usually find, this is a good one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews here- I found this book absolutely compulsive- its full of great dialogue, witty descriptions and is, at times, laugh out loud funny. The funniest part I remember is when Howard is at an academic dinner, and nearly wets himself because a barber-shop quartet are singing U2's In The Name of Love- in a samba style, complete with an impromptu moonwalk. That, alone, nearly had me in tears.I notice that many of the reviews are critical of Smith's use of dialogue, and her portrayal of black Americans such as Howard's wife Kiki. Being from Britain I can't comment on this, but I personally found the dialogue snappy and convincing, and Kiki to be a warm and empathetic character (and, unlike one of the nuttier reviewers, I didnt worry about why Zadie Smith didnt elaborate on the myriad of potential medical conditions which Kiki's 250 pound weight would entail. This is fiction, after all.)Many other reviewers complain that there is no plot. This is true, but because there is such a complex tangle of relationships throughout the book, this simply isn't an issue- in fact, it zips along beautifully. This novel isnt meant to be a fast-paced thriller- it's a study of human relationships. But it is perhaps here that the critics are on to something. For if I were to criticise On Beauty, its that the characters, while being interesting and recognisable, are rather stereotypical. Anyone who's been to university will recognise the clever but overly-eager Zora, or the hippy poetry teacher Claire. But Smith doesn't do enough to develop them. In fact, the characters fit rather too neatly into the reader's expectations. The characters Howard and Monty Kipps, exemplify this- the former a pretentious left-wing intellectual who's not much good at coping with reality, the latter a hypocritical right-wing ideologue. So far, so predictable. But Smith never really problematises this- the Kipps family in particular just weren't developed much beyond their hard-line Christian values. (Although the one exception to this is Kiki's touchingly brief friendship with Monty's wife, Carlene). This rather superficial charcaterisation is both On Beauty's strength, and its weakness. Its strength, in that it caters to its audience very well- if you're middle-class and university-educated, or have a literary inclination, you will revel in this novel's jokes about intellectuals and student life, etc. But the responses of some of the reviews posted here prove that not everyone was enamoured by Smith's potrayal of race relations, or minority ethnic groups.When you enjoy a book as much as I enjoyed reading this one, you do ask yourself if there's something suspicious about its being too readily appealing. And I think that the criticism above accounts for that. Perhaps, in trying to deal with large, thorny issues, Smith has bitten off more than she can chew, and has skimmed the surface as a result. However, had Smith undertaken a more thorough and complex exploration of these issues, the result would have been a much weighter piece of literature, but a far less enjoyable read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On the face of things the two families featured in Zadie Smith's On Beauty are fairly functional. The Belsey family lives in New England, near Boston to be more precise. Howard is English and white. Kiki, the wife, is from Florida and is black. There are three intensely sophisticated progeny, Jerome, Levi and Zora. The Kipps family, meanwhile, lives in Old England in a less than fashionable area of north London. Monty and Carlene are black British with Caribbean roots. Their children are the delectable Victoria and an older, cool, already achieving son, who figures little in the tale. Both husbands are academics. Howard is a specialist on art history and is an arch-liberal. His rival, Monty, is almost rabidly neo-conservative. They have feuded for some time, academically speaking, despite their families being on good enough terms to want to stay with one another. When the story opens, Jerome Belsey is in London and has fallen for the obvious charms of Victoria Kipps and is suggesting engagement. Now wouldn't that complicate things!As the book progresses we learn that these apparent domestic heavens are less perfect than they appear. The two fathers are not as dedicated to the promotion of domestic harmony as they at first seem. Romances bud and blossom amongst and between the younger members of the plot. There are inter-generational liaisons of various kinds.There is also a heightened professional rivalry between Howard and Monty. There ensues an ideological battle that intensifies when Monty joins Howard's US college on an invitation. Monty tries to stir things up and, as ever, liberals are his prime target. Howard effectively assists by rising to take the bait, trying, as liberals sometimes do, to equalise before he has gone behind.Zora, Howard's daughter, wants to enrol in a poetry class. There are no places, however, because the tutor - a poet who has a special relationship with Howard - takes in talented candidates who are not actually on the college roll. A campaign is launched and Zora, her dad and Monty are in the thick of the argument. Things come to a head when a poor lad from the rough end of town is invited to join the class because of his unique gift for rap. An accommodation must be found. Victoria, Monty's daughter also figures on campus and she manages to complicate most things simply by looking the way she does.Basically the lives of these families begin to unravel as tensions pull at the frayed ends of their lives. Zadie Smith writes with great poignancy and irony. She is particularly successful in characterising the generational gaps, and she does this without ever sounding clich&eacute;d or patronising. The sex that simmers throughout just beneath the surface occasionally bubbles through and, when it does, it generally makes quite a mess.In theory, all these people want to do the right thing by and for others, but when opportunities arise, they usually can't resist the pull of blatant self-interest. They all profess the long view, but in reality they all live for the moment, and that is usually passing.On Beauty is a convincing and moving portrait of modern family life. Zadie Smith consistently resists the temptation to pitch the populist against the elitist. Her characters merely live, and the ups and downs they all suffer are eventually no more than their individual and collective experience."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I have always been a sucker for academic novels, and (though I liked _Moo_) this is the first academic satire I've read that comes up to the standards set by David Lodge's _Trading Places_. The criticism other reviewers make of Smith's handling of dialect may be correct, but her ability to capture academic discourse is excellent, and her parody of deconstructionist dialogue in Professor Belsey's class (a scene that comes right at the centre of the book) is dead on. More generally Smith's take on the mixture of and confusion between beauty as aesthetics and beauty as an object of (or source of) desire (particularly sexual desire) was fascinating. And the openness of the question with which this novel ends, which is the difficulty of understanding how love survives though beauty does not, makes it poignant. (Now I need to read _Straight Man_ ...)"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As a Booker Prize finalist, this novel should be good. Unfortunately, it isn't. Almost without exception, the characters are unlikeable and shallow. Most of them live in a college town, but author Zadie Smith apparently doesn't care much for universities. She makes dueling Rembrandt scholars Monty Kipps (an unchristian Christian, grave robber, and neo-con) and Howard Belsey (an illiberal liberal, without a recent original thought, who is temperamentally unable to avoid coupling with members of his faculty and student body) into cardboard cutouts of the life of the mind. Their respective families and heavily satirized university colleagues don't fare much better.Philosophically \\"On Beauty\\" leaves much to be desired as well. Is Mozart or Keats more beautiful than hip-hop, and if so, why? Is beauty physical, e.g., the 20-year-old temptress Victoria Kipps, or is it found rather in a breadth of humanity, e.g., the 250-pound matron and pie-giver Kiki Belsey? Does deconstructing a text or a painting reveal its beauty or kill it? Is art life? Does anyone care?The pacing is uneven, the book has a bloated feel, the prose is often Edwardian, there are riffs (such as Howard's visit with his estranged father) that lead nowhere, characters disappear without a trace, the end is unilluminating. On the other hand, the publisher overstocked by half. The resulting price is more than right."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I recently got this book and White Teeth and was disappointed in both. Descriptive passages without narrative momentum, snarky and repetitive. This author does not have much to say. I would recommend at least getting them from the library before you waste any money."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty takes place in a suburb of Massachusetts and follows two families: The Belseys and The Kipps. Howard Belsey is an Art History professor at the prestigious Wellington University. His archrival Monty Kipps comes to Wellington for a year with his family as a visiting professor. Howard and Monty represent opposite ends of the spectrum: liberal and conservative, non-religious and religious, pro-Affirmative action and anti-Affirmative action and on and on. Their views are brought to life as On Beauty covers the year they share at Wellington.On Beauty has strong character description. It tackles the various issues that professors and students of a university face as well as the issues of the home (loyalty, fidelity, marriage, parenting, etc.) While not a fast paced read this book provides a good deal of conversation starters and controversial topics. It would be a good book group read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has once again created some interesting characters in her latest book \\"On Beauty\\". This time she seems to take some delight in sticking some painful pins in their dolls. Death, infidelity, occupational hazards, and theft are all part of a novel which still, despite these difficulties, provides a lot of entertainment. Two mixed race couples (one British and the other American) and their families find both friendship and hostility in their relationships with each other. The two male heads of family, both academics, are pompous bulls who paw the earth, and roar their political disagreements at each other. One is a liberal and the other a conservative, so what else can you expect?One of the half white, half black sons is so desirous of identifying with his black heritage that his efforts to identify with the black community are often quite comical. A daughter's promiscuity wreaks havoc within the other family. The American father who dearly loves his wife (?) survives one affair that becomes publicly known, and then falls into another one.Fine writing coupled with an interesting tale makes this an enjoyable book. Yet I was a bit disappointed; this book does not match up to her first novel \\"White Teeth\\". Some of the family members lacked definition. Perhaps there's just too large a cast to be able to do justice to without writing a much longer book. And, sadly, this novel lacked the wit of \\"White Teeth\\". Ms Smith did have one funny farcical scene when our professor was the guest of a student at a college banquet. It seems that there is something about small choral groups singing in harmony that he finds hilariously funny. Sure enough a choral group marches on stage during this black tie dinner, and starts singing. The prof's reaction to their performance totally embarrasses his student, and himself. To me this was the funniest part of the novel. Smith is an expert at this kind of inanity, and I just wishe there had been more of it. All in all, though, it's a good read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"From the description of the book, I expected On Beauty to be an interesting, insightful work that would influence my thought processes and bring to the forefront of my mind issues that I otherwise would not consider. While the book had moments of truth, of insight, and of humanity, they were strung together incohesively, rendering the novel almost impossible to comprehend in its entirety. There were too many issues brought up and too many characters followed, that the experience was rather overwhelming.Of course, the focus on many characters would not have been such a negative thing had they been developed properly. Instead, they seemed to remain the same from beginning to end.On Beauty is not an engrossing story. It is, instead, a slice of life from the Belsey and Kipps families that is all too stagnant and ultimately leaves the reader wondering what the author was getting at in the first place. Its lack of momentum left me wondering if I should even finish. I pulled through it, though, and was left disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty is the second Smith novel that I have tried to read. I loved White Teeth and although I was underwhelmed by the sloppy ending, I tried reading her second novel, The Autograph Man to no avail. Ever positive, I made the mistake of taking On Beauty as my only reading material on a trip to Europe and waded through the first 150 pages. I cannot say that I have very much interest in finishing it. The novel lacks a cohesive story and seems to be only a loose structure in which Smith attempts to write clever dialogue for her uninteresting characters. To make matter worse, the novel's characters are not very believable and doubt the veracity of the \\"coolness\\" of their dialogue, especially in the case of the younger characters. Even more disconcerting, I find myself back in a the world of academia, chockfull of literary references and academic observations and slights only entertaining to individuals in those very tedious circles. While there are some beautiful sentences and pithy observations about life and its vagaries, many of the sentences are overly labored, distracting from the narrative flow. Ultimately, so much crafting of language makes the novel suffer. At this point, I could care less about what happens to any of the characters. Fourth time a charm, maybe?"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A flawed but lyrical and energetic novel. Zadie Smith clearly has the ability to invent and then to describe compelling and vivid characters: Kiki and Howard Belsey; their three children Jerome, Zora, and young Levi; Montague and Carlene Kipps, and their offspring the gorgeous Victoria (\\"Vee\\") and the stiff and judgmental Michael; even a sudden ingenue, one Katie Armstrong, 16 and from South Bend, IN, whose feelings of bewilderment at post-structuralism intrude briefly on the center of the book. Then poor Katie just as suddenly disappears from the book, never to be heard of or from again. Her vanishing act is emblematic of the problem with this book: its fundamental lack of coherence and staying power. The only character who spans the entire novel is the bountiful Kiki. The others slip in and out when Smith needs them to make one point or another. As the book starts to flag, which it does, she desperately engages the characters in increasingly desperate activities, bringing the book to a crisis in the final chapters that she seems to have no plan in hand to resolve.Another reader who suggested that a good editor was needed here certainly has it right. Zadie Smith is a talented young writer, but she is not well served by a reputation that exempts her from the kind of editorial scrutiny that would have been required to make this into the great book that it could have been. I found the wit, the author's descriptive power, and the charisma of the world she populates to be sufficient to keep me engaged in the novel. It doesn't, however, realize its potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I love Zadie Smith. I think she is an amazing talent. Whte Teeth is among my favorite novels, but I felt like all Ms. Smith's weaknesses came to roost in this novel. This novel lacked focus, but if you think about it so did White Teeth, the difference is you have to think about it with White Teeth, and with On Beauty it is far too painfully obvious. I still enjoyed her social commentary, and I enjoyed the process of reading the novel, however, it left me feeling nothing. I don't know that there was a point to this novel, and honestly much of it wasn't even worth remembering it was so mundane.Fast paced it is not, but that's not her style. I still think she is an amazing talent and can't wait to read the next one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"When I first began reading the novel, I was not sure if I could believe in the characters. With a short amount of time, I did. Then I began to feel anxious, because the novel's cynical tone and tendency to question and deconstruct every element of \\"polite conversation\\" as false and ingenuine made me feel self conscious and as though few conversations could be trusted as real or honest. With time, I came to see that this constant questioning of the banal interactions of our lives made the rare moments of true, deep, and honest connection between characters all the more meaningful, much like our own life experiences. In fact, most of my initial impressions of this book, whatever they included, changed with time, which I believe is part of the beauty of this book. It is definitely worth sticking with the book and giving it the time it requires to recognize the subtle, slow growth and change in characters and yourself as a reader."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"not nearly as bad as the autograph man. not as sparkling as white teeth. it started off really slow, then i started enjoying myself around p. 100. however, it went back to mediocre. i won't give up on zadie smith, but i'm waiting for her to write something satisfying all the way through again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I think I feel sorry for Zadie Smith. Maybe she could develop into a good writer if she were left alone to hone her craft through much practice and reflection. Alas, she has been adopted as a media darling, and she is being made out to be much better than her work shows her to be. But, hey, she's young, and she has a long way to go yet. I thought that \\"On Beauty\\" was replete with rather loathsome characters (who can stand these people?!) who only succeed at sabotaging their happiness over and over again -- rather predictably. I know, that's human, but what's the point of reading hundreds of pages of it? The only person who isn't so annoying is Jerome, and that's only because he's blessedly absent for most of the book. So who are we supposed to believe is a redemptive character? Kiki? I don't sympathize with Kiki because she has raised shallow, self-centered, maladjusted children, and has remained in a marriage to an awkward pedant. The Kippses (or the Kipps', as Ms. Smith interestingly spells out every time) succeed at being not only annoying, but self-righteous to boot. The \\"showdown\\" between Carl, Victoria, and the motor-mouth Belsey girl is the only part that woke me out of my stupor, and only because it resembled a seedy talk show brawl. Hey, I tried to get enjoyment where I could, however base.\\"On Beauty\\" is beach reading (if you like lugging a novel the size of a phone book to the beach) but it is nothing more than that. I think E.M. Forster would not indeed be puffed up with pride at the fact that Ms. Smith made the unfortunate comparison between her book and \\"Howard's End\\". Don't waste your money on this homely tale."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As actor William Hurt might say in his stolid and mannered, look-at-the wheels-turning-in-my-head voice: \\" I.............could not................finish.................this book. . For a book about race and identity, family dynamics and adultery, and academic rivalry and competition it's surprisingly dull. Midway through the book, there is little or no character or plot development, and the overall feeling is that it was written to fulfill a publishing contract. There's some amusing banter from the younger son, a teen teen who lives in an academic community (a disguised Wellesley, Massachusetts?) but tries on an inner city \\"hood\\" identity, and several of the scenes are very well written.There's a lot of potential here, with the relationships between races, the liberal/conservative dichotomy and the two affairs, one emanating from the liberal father (a Rembrandt scholar), and another between his older son and the daughter of the right wing Rembrandt scholar. (It seems that almost every best-seller over the last ten years either connects somehow to a European painter or contains recipes, and is presented to the consumer as either erudition, or a creative subversion of the novel, or both.) However, the book meanders rather than moves, and, as noted by other reviewers here, the characters sometimes lack authenticity. Perhaps, in this admitted attempt to emulate Forster, the author overlooked the necessity to keep the book interesting and credible."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What I like most about Zadie's style of writing is her ability to create believable characters that are wonderful yet flawed - which is, I believe, the human condition. And she does this with great heart. She also has an insightful sense of humor. For instance, the interactions at the party which Kiki and Howard put on for their friends and college colleagues is hysterical. One of the funniest episodes in literature I've read in years. It rivals one of my favorite party scenes (also among college professors) that was created by John Gardner in his novel Michelson's Ghosts. Zadie Smith is quite an amazing writer. On Beauty is a great read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book has its moments-- bits of lovely writing, occasional insightful moments, some good laughs. It wasn't a page turner, but I'm not sorry I read it. The book also has a lot of problems, and they distract from the reading experience. The most noteable problem, is, as others have pointed out, the terrible and terribly overdone dialect. The southern graduate student's speech is ridiculous and laughable. Levi's is as well-- and I'm giving smith credit here by assuming it was supposed to be bad dialect, a middle class black american kid emulating slang, but it fails to accurately capture that. Levi speaks like no person in the history of ever, and would be laughed out of his house AND off of any street corner. Moreover, the characters never really come to life-- and this was a book about types I recognized and wanted to like. The Belsey's feel like walking lessons, and fall into cliche. Their feelings are never clear unless they're explicity telling you why they are the way they are. For a while, the sweeping tone of the book and frequent point of view shifts distract from this, but eventually you want a character to hold onto, and there isn't one. The Kipps' are even worse, seeming to exist solely as foils for the Belsey's. Their conservatism and Christianity are so shallow and underutilized from the begining that the subsequent exposure of hypocrisy doesn't pack any sort of punch. No one feels fully imagined. Characters can state a worldview or a self perception, but when all of the characters have to explicitly announce their politics and purposes all the time, it's a problem. More problematically, the pivotal scene of the book isn't really written. It's as if Smith got to the book's climax, realized it was already at least a hundred pages too long, and rushed the ending. Kiki's deciscion never feels real, and the final scene seems to indicate that there's been a good deal of forgiveness on the part of the children, something that seems unlikely.I'm not sure that this book would be great even with better editing and dialogue. I think we've gotten to the point in literature where we pat an author on the back for even bothering with the \\"big questions.\\" This book isn't really telling us anything new, and it seems confused about what it wants its reader to take away. Ok, beauty standards are varied, and in one way or another dominate women's lives. Pretty girls have problems because they're too pretty and ugly girls have problems because they're not pretty enough. OK... and? It's amazing that in a book about appearances, we never know what anyone looks like, aside from basic physical shape. What does Zora look like, beides big? Why is it that Kiki still gets hit on in black neighborhoods, even with the extra weight, but Zora is invisible to the opposite sex? What does it mean that Victoria isn't just a pretty girl, she's a pretty, dark-skinned black girl in a world where that's still often seen as a rarity or contradiction? Is her sexuality a rebellion against her family,and if so why does she side with them in key deciscions? Race creates identity issues, especially when mixed with class issues... and? This books doesn't tell us anything new about middle class kids trying to pass themselves off as poor, or interracial families having racial tension. It's not enough to have provocative material, or to have big issues-- you've still got to do something with them, and this book really doesn't."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Other reviewers have covered most of what I consider problematic about this book. What bothered me most was that Kiki is a black, Southern woman with absolutely no connection to any black Southern woman I've known or seen. Other reviewers have criticized Smith for her inauthentic dialogue. The inauthenticity extends beyond the dialogue. Smith knows little to nothing about black Southerners. Her description of \\"soul food,\\" in the book is unrecognizable to any \\"soul food\\" emanating from the South. When she has Kiki reverting to her Southern roots, her dialogue, culture, etc. are markedly more Caribbean instead of Southern. The Belsey children speak slang that is Caribbean, not Southern. To some, this may be a minor point, but since Kiki's Florida roots are a central part of her character, that they weren't authentic is troubling.A sabbatical in New England does not make Smith an authority able to accurately critique American culture, especially black-American culture."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It's almost impossible to dislike Zadie Smith's writing because she's very funny and has a fine handle on character; still, there were so many strange flaws in this novel I kept commenting on them out loud with the friend with whom I was travelling while I read Smith's third novel. She seems to misunderstand entirely the way the American tenure system in private colleges works (it is impossible Howard Belsey would have the institutional authority and privileges he has and yet be untenured), and she also seems to have done little research on things as simple as American labor laws (a major subplot about one of the characters being forced to work by a megastore on Christmas Day is another impossibility in the US). And her re-working of many of the basic plot points of Forster's HOWARDS END are simply unnecessary, and force Smith to create all kinds of plot contrivances to allow the truth of Mrs. KIpps's bequest to come to light. The novel is most valuable as a study in character, and here Smith does not fail to delight: the characters of Howard, Kiki, and Zora Belsey are so funny and finely drawn that even with all the errors and elaborate plotting coincidences I've still recommended this book to others already. Yet it is a bit of a puzzle why by her third novel Smith should be making such elementary errors in her plotting research."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just finished reading \\"On Beauty\\" after several friends recommended \\"White Teeth\\" and I found Smith to be an enormously talented writer who does not humanize her characters. It is hard to say that she does not flesh them out, we do hear their voices but we cannot relate to them except as objects of Smith's satire. There is nothing wrong with writing a purely satirical work but she is trying for something more here and it does not work. After introducing her characters we are ready to enjoy their humor, their failures, their triumphs and eventually their redemptions but, alas, the book ends on a note of cheap revenge that is decidedly unpleasant. She makes some attempts to honor these characters but Smith's basic cynicism does not allow her to do so. I believe Smith believes she is transcending stereotypes by portraying a mixed race marriage and young black intellectuals. Why is it then that Howard, a white, working class man ultimately fails in his dream career and as a family man, that a beautiful, smart black student is portrayed as a sexual predator destroying lives around her. Did Smith so hate her time in America that she has her character Victoria destroy so many lives from the minute she lands here? And on and on with each character whether black or white. One wants to like these characters but she just wont let us. Two scenes I did think were brilliant - the way Claire, the teacher of poetry interacts with her students especially during their evening at The Bus Stop, and the department head making introductory remarks at a faculty meeting with a one line cameo appearance by Smith herself.Ultimately, this is a mean book with mean characters that leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. I would have given it one star only that Zadie Smith is a brilliant writer. I would say to her \\"channel your anger, give us believable characters that we can care about\\". Zadie Smith needs to grow up."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read so many glowing reviews of this book that I couldn't wait to read it myself. I hadn't read Zadie Smith's other book but I knew that it, too, was well-acclaimed. This book was really hard for me to finish, so I didn't. That doesn't happen to me very often. I try to give any book enough of a chance that I'll keep reading to the end. In this case, I didn't care enough about any of the characters to keep going. All of the characters left me feeling indifferent at best, except perhaps for Kiki and Levi. I can appreciate books that are slow-moving; I don't read many mainstream pulp novels and was a literature minor in college. But this book moved so slowly that I just couldn't get into it. If I had felt something - anything at all - for the characters, maybe I could have.I agree with the other reviewer who said that the book really should have been set in England. I had to keep checking back to make sure, because it really did not ring true to real American life to me. The tone of the book seemed much more British. Because of that, I think there were some inconsistencies in the book that contributed to the reason I found it so difficult to read. I don't honestly understand why so many people have rated this book so well. To me it was just pretentious and unjustifiably long-winded, and with characters I didn't find especially compelling."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was hugely disappointed with \\"On Beauty\\" after being blown away with Smith's debut \\"White Teeth\\". I was certain that she was the UK's new wunderkind.Many of the storylines lagged with soggy prose and inconsistent characterisation. Who are these people? We get to the end of this book not really knowing the essence of these characters. Too many of the characters are unlikeable. Not helpful for one who is desperately trying to like a book.I was also concerned with the amount of typos. I am a shameless stickler when it comes to this and was horrified to find so many mistakes. Where were the editors?It's not all bad, though. There are some beautifully written and hilarious moments throughout this book. The overall picture for me, however, was that of a boring effort and one which did not deserve to be shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In many ways, On Beauty is similar to White Teeth. It's laugh-out-loud funny and contains marvelous descriptive passages. In the end, however, the similarities the novel bears to White Teeth work against it. Reading On Beauty, I got the feeling that I'd already experienced much of what unfolds. And I had--in White Teeth. For example, a character named Jerome falls in love with another family in the same vein in which Irie Jones and Millat Iqbal fall in love with the Chalfens. Zora, by the way, seems nothing more than a smarter version of Irie. Also, Smith describes the beauty of Zora's love interest, Carl, in the same manner she describes Millat's beauty. And, as in White Teeth, On Beauty's religious characters prove themselves hypocritical. But the similarities don't end there. In, On Beauty, Smith even borrows a line she devoted several paragraphs to in White Teeth--\\"What you looking at?\\" While Smith's commentary surrounding this question is hilarious in White Teeth, it should have been left out of On Beauty.The novel's similarity to White Teeth does not ruin it. Its many flaws do, though.The dialogue is disastrous. At one point Roxbury resident Carl asks Zora, \\"Am I meant to be grateful?\\" This is a British phrasing. An American would say, \\"Am I supposed to be grateful?\\"Smith particularly fails at her attempt to incorporate Black English Vernacular into the text. Sometimes she nails it, as is the case when a character named Levi asks, \\"Where they at?\\" Other times, she stumbles, such as when Levi asks, \\"Who you on the phone to?\\" \\"Who you talking to?\\" or \\"Who you on the phone with?\\" should have been used instead. Also, an abundance of black characters say \\"I be.\\" This wouldn't sound strange coming from an old black Southerner, perhaps, but, coming from young blacks, it does. Even uneducated young black urbanites speak a more standard form of English than this. Even the blacks on UPN shows speak a more standard form of English than this. Then there's Kiki, a middle-aged black woman with Florida roots, who speaks consistently inconsistently. At the beginning of the book, she tells her husband, Howard, \\"Your life is just an orgy of deprivation.\\" But later she remarks that the sun \\"done set.\\" It's unlikely that the same speaker would have birthed both lines. I was similarly startled when Carl, an uneducated rapper, who utters sentences such as, \\"I be a college a man now,\\" has no difficulty writing lengthy papers for the music department of upper-crust Wellington College.Often, the black American characters are stereotypes. All of the women have large breasts and backsides and use the words \\"baby\\" and \\"honey\\" gratuitously. At one point we meet LaShonda, a young woman who calls Levi \\"baby\\" a half-dozen times in the span of two pages. Of course a girl with a \\"ghetto\\" name such as LaShonda must not only have a \\"big old booty,\\" she must also be an unwed mother of three on the prowl for a new baby daddy. It's also apparent that Smith believes all black Americans refer to each other as \\"brother\\" or \\"sister.\\" Maybe during the Black Power Movement. Not in 2005.Kiki's weight is also problematic. While Howard cites Kiki's 250-pound frame, in part, for his adultery, black urban men won't stop hitting on her. Shapeliness is said to be valued in black culture, yes, but 250 pounds is not shapeliness, it's morbid obesity. Reading On Beauty I am puzzled as to why celebs such as Star Jones and Oprah Winfrey weren't sex symbols in the black community when they were at their heaviest. There's also the fact that there are no consequences for Kiki's weight gain. In real life, middle-aged, overweight black women suffer from hypertension, diabetes, joint-pain, back pain, etc. Kiki, on the other hand, does yoga.The novel includes other inaccuracies about black Americans. At one point, Kiki says, \\"We got black kids dying on the front line..., and they're in that army 'cos they think college has got nothing to offer them.\\" Actually, the military's promise to pay college tuition is the main reason young people of all races, blacks included, enlist.Smith's description of Kiki's and Carl's palms is also wrong. The two are described as having rich-brown palms. Blacks, even dark-skinned ones, have palms that fall into the pinkish-beige range. Smith makes the opposite mistake when describing Kiki's areolas, which she describes as pinkish brown. In fact, a dark-skinned black woman would have dark brown areolas.While not all of what Smith writes is wrong, it isn't necessarily good. She uses an abundance of adverbs and adjectives, many repeatedly. How often can someone be called fatuous? There are also redundancies such as, \\"He nodded mutely\\" and non sequiturs such as, \\"Kiki restrained herself. Instead she opened her purse and began searching through it for her lip-gloss.\\" Huh? Instead of what?Character development is also lacking. Choo, the main Haitian character, is nothing more than Smith's mouthpiece. His sole purpose is to inform the reader about Haiti's plight. Then there's Victoria Kipps. Worshipped for her beauty, Kipps turns out to be a walking cliche. She may be stunning, but, guess what, she's dumb! She may be promiscuous, but, guess what, she's easy because sex is all men want from her. Sigh. Katherine Armstrong, a character who makes an inexplicable cameo (as does Helen Keller), is eerily similar to Lee Fiora, the protagonist of Curtis Sittenfeld's novel, Prep. Like Lee, Katie is from South Bend, Ind. There, she was the brightest kid in town. But, surrounded by New England preppies at Wellington, Katie is overwhelmed and, thus, painfully shy. Ring any bells? It's also problematic that Smith features other minor characters such as Doc Brown, her rapper-brother's stage name in real life. This choice uproots readers from the fictional world and places them into the real one. The same thing happens when the reader encounters a poem written by Smith's husband mid-novel. The rap lyrics and poetry used in the novel should reflect the characters who authored them. How can this occur if Smith gives fictional characters credit for verse composed by real people? This move also led Smith to make another mistake. When Carl recites the lyrics of Smith's real-life brother, he refers to Mc Donald's as Macca D's. No one in the States calls McDonald's Macca D's. Amercians say Mickey D's.In closing, read On Beauty if you're a Zadie Smith fan or if you'd like to see how she tweaked Howard's End. Don't read it because you've heard it's a good book. At best, it's mediocre. I give it two-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After having read \\"White Teeth\\" a few years ago, I was anticipating another novel of similar caliber. What a disappointment!While she acknowledges up front that it is written as an hommage to E.M. Forster- the storyline is needlessly convoluted in order to mirror the plot of \\"Howard's End\\". What's worse are the underdeveloped, frustratingly shallow and across the board uninteresting characters- at the end of the book the reader doesn't particularly care what happens to any of them. I gather the intent was to examine personal relationships through the lens of larger scale issues of class, race, gender and aesthetic- but to say that she falls short is a gross understatement. It just feels so contrived- the dialogue- the meandering plot- the lifeless characters- all of it. This is definitely not a novel that will transport you into the story. It was a complete waste of time to read (I am kicking myslf for buying it in hardback)-and such a let-down after having read Ms. Smith's other work."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with \\"On Beauty.\\" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of \\"street\\" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's \\"Straight Man.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't like to put a book down, and the only reason I didn't toss this one aside is because it was a gift. What is all the hype about? The characters were stereotypical, and worse, even after 100 pages into the book, I couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them. The author is far too judgemental of her characters. She forced her judgement of them so much on the reader that I was almost inclined to root for the ones she didn't like. But like I said, I couldn't bring myself to care for any of them. The author inserts too much of herself and her opinions into the book, thereby beating the reader over the head with her viewpoints about race, academia, culture, and family life. A superb author can win a reader over to his/her viewpoint in such a subtle way that the reader does not even know that he/she is being pulled in a certain direction. This author clearly prefers a crass sledgehammer approach."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"One of my favorite novels ever. It's wonderful to find a contemporary author who writes with the beauty and depth that you often think lies only in the \\"classics\\"."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read this book twice while in Senegal and it really got me interested in the work of Zadie Smith. I have since read White Teeth which I too thought was amazing but quite different in approach and method.When looking to rate in some nebulous, objective manner the quality of an author's work, it may be best to look into what the author set out to accomplish in the first place. If Smith was setting out to do some sort of historical fiction or dramatized non-fiction about the American academic culture or do some scathing exposition of the dodgy world of Rembrandt criticism, she had done a bad job of it (Zadie Smith is not a documentarian in the strict sense of the word, she is, however, a great recreator of contemporary Western society). That's why I don't think it's the case that she sought to do that kind of story.This book is about two things: middle age and social (interpersonal) politics, it is as much about the interaction between middle age and social politics as it is the way each of them affect the whole lives of the characters in the story. The story of Howard is terribly interesting because one can delight in his downfall as he realizes his agedness yet realize that the mistakes he makes along the way are at least human, if not understandable in some instances (the pridefulness of wishing to be recognized for his academic work at the expense of his nemesis). Of course, Smith doesn't stray far from her character wheelhouse of hybrids too, which always adds some pretty attractive complication to the storyline.A great book on an interesting subject."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a wonder. I love this woman's writing. I only wish she would have written the story entirely through Howard's point of view. Still in all, quite remarkable."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I have read Zadie Smith's novel \\"White Teeth\\" and I enjoyed it very much, so when my copy \\"On Beauty\\" arrived I was expecting another story with memorable characters, a great plot and a super ending. But, alas I was disappointed. I didn't feel it was a terrible book, nor a super book, but rather a good, interesting read. In other words, I'd like to think I got my monies worth, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll read it again.The story revolves around two families that live in Mass. The reader will find the Belseys family with the main character Howard Belsey an Art professor and from the second family; the Kipps there is Monty Kipps. Monty arrives with his family and begins his work at the same university that Howard is employed. In summary these two characters lock horns on various social issues (family life, marriage, faithfulness, etc.) and their strong views are covered in this story that spans over a one year period. I suspect that so far this sounds boring, but the author did weave this subplot (I say subplot because there seemed to be numerous plots where I'm in the middle or I'm just starting another one) into the story to make it very interesting.I use the word \\"interesting\\" loosely because I found it difficult to find a lot of empathy for the host of characters, although Zora with her sexual problems did stand out in my memory.The ending was a let down for me. It left me sort of confused, as if there were more pages to the story that needed to be read. Maybe that was intentional by the author. Overall I'm not sure if I would recommend \\"On Beauty\\" to my friends. I guess I would have to be very selective if I did opt to encourage someone to buy the book. Maybe, my best bet would be to advise them to check it out at the library."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"As both a modern story and a reinterpretation of Forster's \\"Howards End,\\" Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\" does a good job of showing the struggles of two families, both with ties in Britain and America, and their struggles personally and socially.With Smith's unbelievably extensive knowledge of both English-speaking cultures, she adds wit, satire and irony seamlessley into her story; her usage of the characters' language and dialect also adds amusement and keeps the reader at ease with such a complex book.If you've read \\"Howards End,\\" you will understand Smith's story much better, but if not, fret not and enjoy it nonetheless."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Gifted actor Peter Francis James has leant his talents to many an audiobook - Cast of Shadows, Brothers In Arms, The Emperor of Ocean Park, The Way the Wind Blows, and more. He always delivers a stellar, memorable voice performance as he does once more with On Beauty.James is also active in films (The Rosa Parks Story), on stage (On Golden Pond and Judgment at Nuremberg), and he appears in the HBO series Oz. He taught Shakespeare at Columbia University and now teaches at the Yale School of Drama. Each of his voice performances brings an added luster, a richness to the narrative.What more praise can be heaped upon Zadie Smith, who at the age of 24 took the reading public by storm with White Teeth? With this, her third novel, she firmly establishes her place in the pantheon of amazing writers as she deals with two disparate families. Again, Smith is wise, fiercely funny, and insightful.A Brit academic, Howard Belsey, is now teaching and living in a college town in New England. He's been married to for some 30 years to Kiki, an African-American, and they have three children, all about to find out for themselves what life is about.Their eldest son, Jerome, goes to England where he completely kicks over the family traces by going to work for a right-winger from Trinidad. He soon becomes enamored with his employer's daughter, Victoria.Another Belsey offspring, Zora, sets her sights on the salvation of a Boston rapper, and young son Levi seeks to define himself in perhaps not the wisest of ways.Can Belsey ever come to terms with a right-winger when the two are poles apart politically and culturally? Is it possible for these two families to reach an understanding of each other? Smith explores many human dilemmas with zest and perspicacity as the answers to this question are sought.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The only problem with this well written, funny and insightful book, is that it ended.

Gets you thinking about family and the dynamics and how we have woven threads even when we try to separate and be bold."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"If you'd like to read funny novels about academia, read David Lodge. As did many reviewers, I enjoyed White Teeth for the author's brash, audacious style (with certain reservations). This review should be rated in yawns not stars- she is an author with prodigiously interesting images but who really struggles when it comes to investing her own heart into characters and plotlines. Too clever for her own good and the reliance on Howard's End is a misstep. Clearly, Zadie Smith is the darling of critics but I trust Amazon reviewers on this one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Talk about dont believe the hype this is truly an instance of that. A poor tree gave it's life for this book and to say nothing of all the man hours that went into writing this junk. Dont buy this book save your money. Nothing rings true of the book. It was like she was writing about a group of people she had heard about but never met. About places she had read a little about but never visited. There is no story here I would advice a soul to waste their time reading. Remember that is time you will wish you had that wasted time back on your death bed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot! Others have explored the plot in detail, but I found Smith's characters rich and diverse -- in particular Kiki. There were times when I wanted to see other characters explored further (what happened to the new husband of Howard's mistress after the affair was revealed?). All in all, this is an entertaining book from a talented writer. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"She's here to stay!!!Zadie Smith's big comeback!An excellent read and very different for a change. I actually liked this better than WHITE TEETH and to me it proves that Zadie is here to stay. She's a brilliant writer, not just intellectually, but with soul and guts. I FEEL HER as the young people say.I still, however, think that Kola Boof is the most important new VOICE in Black women's literature. Sure she's raw and unorthodox, but she's more powerful than Zadie and Z.Z. I put Zadie Smith and Z.Z. Packer just a little behind Boof in revelancy and a LOT BEHIND in daring.

I was reminded of so many academic families I've come across."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Early in the narrative, we learn that Howard loathes anything carcinogenic. He smokes.Who is the protagonist here? There is no single story line but several. There are oddities and profanities sexualities and ambiguities of heart. The sex is violent and gratuitous. The profanities stupid and gratuitous. This was a good idea for a long short story.There is mystery, but no resolution.There is infidelity and unwarranted forgiveness. The end left me feeling like Ms. Smith didn't want to go out to buy more ink for the printer.The intellectual/academic men in this book are stupid. The women are wise.For WRITERS who wish to read a young, contemporary novelist with a hand on her own heart -- not on the pulse of the commercial public -- read \\"THE HISTORY OF LOVE\\" by Nicole Krauss.Zadie Smith's celebrity sold this book. Nicole Krauss's talent sells hers.Zadie Smith's On Beauty, said to be a take off on Howard's End and like an experiment is remains unfinished, uncertain.Nicole Krauss's book is its own story, the story of a book, of how a book written sixty years before impacts a random reader and how what we put **out there** stays there.The legacy of On Beauty will be its momentary snapshot of a poorly framed current culture of youth.The legacy of A History of Love will be its universal, ever current longing to not be invisible.The main male character in On Beauty is an unattractive wimp who can't keep his pants on. Howard's voice is a whine. I think Ms. Smith despises men.The main male character in The History of Love is an old man who awaits his death. Leo's voice is permanent and familiar. Ms. Krauss adores her elders.In all the result, for me, of On Beauty, was an exercise in placing all the *right* ingredients into her big soupy novel.Comparing the writing between the two is another review entirely. There is no real heart in On Beauty. It is superficial, yet perfectly written.In \\"The History of Love,\\" the writing is as alive as its characters. The language does not intrude or insult. The words are perfect, the pauses as well as the gushes of emotion. If only it were a difference in technique, but no - the difference between this book and On Beauty is in the amount of blood the author was willing to pour from herself into the work. Nicole Krauss will need time to heal.I have a personal distaste for writers who add such things as song references, or current trendy markers as items credibility or as time stamps to their stories. Do I really care what the boy listens to on his iPod? No. I care what the boy feels in his heart.In On Beauty there are wonderful, well developed subplots. It's the story line that is empty and dependent on these digressions.In A History of Love, one never forgets the very real characters (though one can become a little lost) The reader never loses track of the book about which the novel is titled and written, the piece of string that keeps it all together.On Beauty: 2 Stars ; History of Love: 4 stars (But then, the first books I can think of that I would rate 5 stars would include Madame Bovary, Les Miserables, Atlas Shrugged and To Kill a Mockingbird.Get Beauty from the library. There are no words or passages which cry out for highlighting, no pages to be dogeared and referred to again and again. Once the book is done, it's done.Get The History of Love from a book store and cover it in your favorite fabric. Put your name in it and carry it around with you.

Howard Belsey is a white professor, and Monty Kipps is a black professor; both study art and hail from the U.K. They also both married black women, but that's where the similarities end. Specifically, Howard and Monty have been waging an academic vendetta across the Atlantic. These two families start to intertwine in unexpected ways - or at least unexpected to the characters in the novel. When Monty comes to the U.S. and joins the faculty at Howard's tony liberal arts college (the fictional Wellington), sparks fly.\\"On Beauty\\" has a bit of a hook - it's an homage to E.M. Forster's \\"Howards End,\\" which is a book I really love. Primarily, the similarity between these two books rests on common motifs and a few shared plot points. Specifically, both novels explore the potentially negative consequences that can occur when well-meaning progressives become overly involved in the lives of the \\"less fortunate.\\" In this case, Howard's daughter, Zora, attempts to help a talented street poet she meets. However, her munificence may be more about wanting to remold Carl in her own intellectual image rather than help him on his own terms; plus, she kind of has a crush on Carl and hopes he'll reciprocate. In addition, both novels concern class struggles, with \\"On Beauty\\" focusing especially on race.\\"On Beauty\\" is a sprawling, messy book crammed with interesting ideas and details; unfortunately, many of its themes are not fully developed. In addition, the characters sometimes ring a bit false, and the elements relevant to \\"Howards End\\" feel a tad forced. As a result, some readers may view this book as more of an experiment than a truly great novel; I know I did at times. However, even when it falls short, it does so in an interesting way. Overall, I recommend this book, although less enthusiastically to readers who dislike books that are more than a bit self-conscious or pretentious."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, there were times during this longish book that I wondered what the hype about it was. Interesting, yes; humorous, certainly. But I wasn't entirely sure what the direction was-until the very end. And the last 3 pages explains the entire trajectory and raison d'etre (sorry for the bad spelling) of the book. And ultimately, reading this book was a worthwhile endeavor.This book is about how everyone sees other people through blinders and through the prism of our beliefs and ideals--nothing too startling there--but then the book goes on to examine what happens when those blinders are or are not removed. It's much easier to live a life in which one interacts with simplified 'types.' But life isn't that simple, and it is much richer when one learns acceptance of all the flaws and complexities within oneself and within others, that is, if one is developmentally ready to do so. One of the strengths of the book is the recognition that because various characters are different ages, their ability to adapt, change and accept are different. The author has a good ear for the voices (literal and figurative) of her characters at all their various life stages.I also enjoyed this book because I am a recovering academic. In turn, perhaps because of this, in contrast to some of the other reviewers, I found the picture presented of academic life to be quite accurate. Take, for example, the Chair of the African-American Studies Dept. He is pleasant, bright, engaging, somewhat flawed in his personal life, and dispenses professional problems--including problem-people--by re-directing them in the extreme. (I'm not being specific here because to do so would ruin some parts of the book.) Having known a number of department chairs, the fictional character was far less unpleasant than the reality, but the principles rang true. Similarly, there are other academically-based characters who are variously exploitive, overwhelmingly self involved, or who have made careers of wielding a certain ideology, all of whom are well represented in universities throughout the US. I can well believe that Smith wrote this while at Harvard or any other liberal arts institution."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Loved the book: I liked the treatment of race, not too heavy-handed, not too melodramatic, but ever-present.

Race and class flare up to confound the lives of the Belseys and Kipps.In this case, the campus is Wellington. I believe that Wellington is supposed to be in Boston. The setting is current. Characters go to poetry jams, have views on current affairs, and make mistakes with powerpoints and emails.And, the book is very upfront. She takes on figures like \\"Condaleeza and Colin.\\" Why do they seem to reject a system that may have given them a start? Equally, what really comes of years of orations in art history class? How can people take a painting about love and become competitive about its interpretation, especially if they cannot pursue love in their own life?The thing I like about this book is the way that it handles the charged topic. With Wolfe, I felt like he was writing about something that shocked his own sensibility. Zadie Smith is just 30 or so. She has probably used an Ipods or surfed on myspace.If I could change something, though, I would end more like Wolfe: with a big event that brings all of the characters together in a way that forever changes everything. Here, , it is just the opposite -- earlier misdeeds wither under sunshine and with it the hopes for a good ending for Mr. Belsey."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the only book by Zadie Smith that I have read and by the contents of this one I don't feel like reading any other. However, I guess I should not judge this \\"it\\" author by one lousy book. This book was so boring, it centered too much on academia and not on the people who had potential of being slightly riveting. There were too many stories at once, the connection between the characters was dubious, none of the chapters of the characters culminated in a satisfying ending. To conclude, Howard is such a bore, it was a mistake to center the book on this character."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I just devoured this novel. Zadie Smith is outrageously insightful about the business of family. The novel is tender and forgiving. Bits of it left me stuck in an emotion. It is by no means a \\"perfect novel\\" whatever that would be...there are names that I would change, particular lines that stick out like an unfinished hem. But what you feel like while reading is that you're swirling around in the lives of these broken characters, and when you put the book down, they linger. Their problems are recognizable, human. That aside, she's hilarious. Just buy the thing and read for yourself."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This was the first time while reading a book I have lost my place and thought it wouldn't matter where I started again. I was tempted to go on reading close to the end rather than try and find my place. Now having finished and read the whole thing I regret the extra time spent. Not only did the characters not learn from each other or develop over time, but I stayed much the same too from taking the journey with them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I cannot understand the praise this book has received. The subject matter was kind of boring, the characters completely unbelievable. It was an ok read and I laughed once or twice but it was really nothing special."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Beauty is not only what we see but who we are inside. Sounds like a cliche but the way Zadie Smith writes about human beauty has nothing to do with cliches. The way she portrays each character, even the secondary ones, is breath-taking and aw-inspiring. I wish I was a writer so that I could express how magnificent and inspiring the book is. I'm just rereading it at the moment and find more depth and beauty in everyday world of average people. It depicts identity struggles every one of us has had: race, nationality, gender, sexuality, etc. Reading it once leaves you craving for more. Just read it and see for yourself."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the story of two families, each family headed up by a strong-willed academic man. These two patriarchs are opposites and enemies (or rivals, if you want to be optimistic). The emotional center of the book revolves around Howard's struggling marriage to Kiki. This novel is satirical and comic, on the one hand, and heartbreaking and sensitive on the other. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"So, this is one of the greatest works of contemporary fiction I've read (listened to) in a while. The only reason I considered it at all (being a strict devotee of the cannon)was because it won the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2006 which is the UK's award given to the best original full-length novel written by a woman in the English language.My complaint with this set, therefore, lies not with the story, but rather with the quality. I noticed that there were many \\"blips\\" or \\"skips\\" in the CD - not sure if it's just my copy or all of them. I suppose I could have sent it back, but by the time I noticed it was a recurring problem, I was already too involved in the story to let it go.Peter Francis James gives an excellent oral reading of this work."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Una de esas novelas que cuando las termin&aacute;s, extra&ntilde;&aacute;s a todos los personajes como si los hubieras conocido. Tiene buen ritmo. Lo mejor: las descripciones de las familias y susmiembros. Lo de la acad&eacute;mica de la pintura me pareci&oacute; lo m&aacute;s flojo del texto."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is a young brilliant British novelist whose best strength is in creating characters, such as Howard, Kiki and Zora Belsey - the main protagonists of \\"On Beauty\\" - sucessfully breathing life into them with a keen wit and sensibility of the human condition. She also succeeds admirably with several members of the Kripps family; husband Monty, wife Carlene, and daughter Victoria. Their tightly interwoven interactions are those often replete with ample mirth, which frequently left me laughing almost out loud, as I read about their interpersonal foibles. But Smith's skills as a compelling storyteller leave much to be desired, even though she has written a very good homage to E. M. Forster's \\"Howard's End\\", introducing academic politics, race and gender relations and rap music, among others, into a heady, occasionally fascinating mix. However, Smith tries too hard to emulate Forster's plot and prose, occasionally coming across as a second-rate version of Rick Moody, emulating his penchant for long-winded sentences and prose, which I find in her case too exasperating to comprehend (In Rick's case, he often has a sound artistic reason for his literary pyrotechnics.). Regardless, I can still recommend \\"On Beauty\\" to those unfamiliar with her work, since I find it a substantial artistic improvement over her literary debut \\"White Teeth\\". However, if I am interested in reading some elegant contemporary fiction on politics, race and religion, I'll have to turn elsewhere, to authors as diverse as Edwidge Danticat and William Gibson, not Zadie Smith."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Having read White Teeth with glee and interest, I felt that On Beauty might be as good if not better. It is not. It is annoying. What happened to the editorial process? Zadie Smith uses English vernacular where American would be appropriate. It's a trap a lot of English people new to America fall into and it is jarring.The story is just a ghastly rehash of the usual academics-are-god type that has been written countless times, and it is done without gusto. There is a smugness to the tone of the writing that is also unattractive. There is a lack of wisdom to the whole enterprise that makes this read like a high school essay.In summary, I agree with the above reviewer's comment \\"the author overlooked the necessity to keep the book interesting and credible.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"A big brawling novel ripe with ideas of race, class, and education, 'On Beauty' surprised me with how quickly it had me invested in it's characters. I have to admit the first fifty or so pages I had to work to get a foothold, but soon the novel found it's rhythm and I keyed right in. A white English University professor, Howard Belsey, is teaching at a prestigious Boston college,has been married for thirty years to an African American woman, and has three bi-racial children each in various stages of their adulthood. His somewhat routine life is sent into a tailspin when a rival conservative African American professor comes to teach at the same school. Funny, thought provoking, and just wonderfully written, it was a great book to end the year with."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book packs a great deal into 450 pages or so, and it's not all fully digested. The academic debates over the nature of beauty in art, which clearly matter to Smith (note the title of the book!) are not really integrated into the book's structure. In fact, Smith plays them for satire more than for anything else. The characters who are not part of the academic world (Kiki, Carl, for example) seem more real and more fully developed than the university types.As this book picks up steam about one-third of the way through, however, it hits its stride. Smith does well in showing how all these imperfect characters from two generations interact with each other, across the generations and within them. Her portrayal of the Belsey marriage seems very real to me. Kiki is constantly frustrated with Howard's failings (infidelity is only one of them), but until the end, always seems to find that there is enough history between them to continue the marriage."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I think it was courageous of Smith to tackle bi-racial America academia. But her distance makes the story quite awkward, ven slow at times. I am halfway through the book, regaining interest after several scenes that I forced myself through. Smith will always captivate me with her ability to illustrate dialogue, inner thoughts and gestures. My only real gripe with On Beauty, right now, is that I feel all the nuances of voices actually very familiar to me (Floridian \\"country\\" grammar, Roxbury slang, alienating white academia, well-to-do West Indian) is constantly being broken down by the narrator. Before I began reading her first novel, White Teeth, I worried the British vernacular would throw me for a loop. It didn't. It became natural after the first fw pages, nothing overtly explained. I wish Smith would have kept in mind that her readers, like her, are quite conscious of the languages heard in urban spaces, that we can recall and even imagine tones specific to age, class, region and skin color. And to echo other reviews, the young people in the story are at times unbelievable.I'll keep reading. I can't let a story go unfinished.P.S. Am I silly to think that reviews about books need not give away the entire story?"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down.If you enjoyed the movie \\"Crash\\", you will love this one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read this book on a train and then plane. The only option to not finishing the book was to stare at the seat in front of me. I would not have bothered to finish it otherwise. It is dull. There is not a single character that is likeable. I don't want to read a book where I dislike every character. The characters do not grow as people. The main character, Howard, learns to use Powerpoint by the end of the book. That is his biggest achievement. It is that dull.It felt to me as if Ms Smith was tasked with writing a book that could be sold to the broadest possible audience, so it is a transatlantic and mixed race. There are lots of things she obviously doesn't know about America.The sex in it is horrible. One of the things that annoy me about literature aimed at young women is the propensity for attractive young females to form relationships with crusty old men, of the age where nasty hairs have sprouted out of their ears. Is this realistic? (Another example is A girls guide to fishing and Hunting.) Maybe this is the norm for those in the publishing field, but it just doesn't work for me. It happened twice in this book, with different old geezers. It is a statistical anomaly.The academic setting was not at convincing either. Moo by Jane Smiley does a better job.I'm giving it a two because the girl can write well, I just don't think she has that much to write about. I'm sorry to be so harsh as I thought White Teeth was great."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Truly, I wanted to read this book. I tend toward more non-fiction and had asked my manager at work for a recommendation - she passed along this book. I found it difficult to get into - though I did like some of the characterizations (ie, fall leaving and slamming the door on the way out) - it just overall seemed like her writing wasn't very well integrated - in terms of the style(s) of writing in the book and the uneven development of characters.I found the way the characters spoke to be distractingly unnatural - and found found the oblique physical descriptions of people (explicit for some characters, almost soft porn - and very vague for others) difficult to hook into. The drama and the sub plots - just not all worked out very well and in the end - not that interesting. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes it would improve - not sure I would bother with another of her books."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"For me, this falls between 'White Teeth' and 'The Autograph Man'. I really liked it. END REVIEW.Just kidding.Smith retains her witty, charming prose style. Moreover, she maintains an interest in racial issues and popular culture, but it these themes are never what the book is really about. Smith's novels are, so far, like Woody Allen's or Wes Anderson's films-- works by wonderful stylists that you can kind of know going into watching if you'll like it, whatever the strength of script. Smith's prose is wonderful as ever. I love it. Yet the respective structures and pacing of her three novels are variously strong. The characters, too, are variously compelling. This is her most America-centric novel thus far, too, which makes sense now that she splits her time between the US and UK.Ultimately, 'On Beauty' is a morality play (of sorts). Not to reveal too much, but protagonist and antagonist alike behave in similarly a/im/moral ways despite their espoused views. Indeed, they hold their views in-spite of their backgrounds: the white British liberal contra West Indian-British conservative. Perhaps to add more cultural contrast (or maybe more shades of grey is a better way of describing it?), the multiracial children of the white British liberal and his black Floridian wife struggle to make themselves fit into New England settings with the various white, African American, and Haitian communities. Once again, these backgrounds are just all backdrop to the morality play, not major driving factors its plot.So! If you like Smith's writing style, buy this book, I doubt you'll be disappointed. If you're so-so on her style, it's a good story and you may still like it on its own merits-- it is loosely based on 'Howard's End', so if you liked that book you might like this 21st century interpretation."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The plot and structure reminded me of a daytime soap opera like All My Children (with profanity), two families always bumping into each other whether in Massachusetts or England.The writer Zadie Smith, covers a lot of ground through these families. University life, art history, adultery, death, crime, sex, hip-hop, Christianity, right-wing/left-wing politics, affirmative-action, class, Haiti, beauty, you name it, it's there.I would've enjoyed the storytelling more if there was at least one main character who had some good morals to cheer for. The only character that did, died midway through the book which left a lot of moronic behavior and made everyone seem rather ridiculous.Despite this, the characters do come off extremely real and the dialogue is very spot-on most of the time. Credit that to the great writing skills of Ms Zadie Smith.I enjoyed the audio book read by Peter Francis James who did a great job weaving in all the diverse characters. (I kept imagining the role of Howard Belsey being played by Tim Gunn of \\"Project Runway\\") I'm not sure if I could've read it manually. It seemed overly long."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It was interesting; as I read through this book a single quote kept going through my head.Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practise to deceive! - Sir Walter ScottThis wasn't a story I was expecting. I'd read that Zadie Smith is witty and funny and I think part of me expected this to be a hilarious, fun book. It's not that - but don't get me wrong. I laughed out loud more than a few times for various reasons.I think what struck me most and why this book really hit hard is not only the exceptional quality of writing (which really amazed me) but also the depth of the characters. Zadie Smith managed to take characters that could almost be stereotypical and put enough of a twist on them that I didn't know exactly what to expect from them as the story progresses. And above everything else.. these were real characters. There was no preference toward the more liberal or conservative arguments made in the book by the characters, everything was just laid out, unashamed, bold and without mercy for the reader to absorb.Most of all I felt as if these are people that I could know. I don't know how else to express it and wish I had the same talent with words. My best advice would be for you to experience this story and figure out what I'm talking about that way - but prepare yourself.. there are parts of this book that are brutal. There is language, unforgiving sexual encounters and this is not a \\"feel good\\" story. But it's one that made me think and slow down and absorb what I was reading.There is one quote I'd like to talk about, because it's something that I've been thinking about a lot recently, especially as one of my sisters has had a recent birthday and is now approaching 30. Zadie Smith speaks on the relationship between Jerome, Zora and Levi.. three siblings that feature prominently in the book.People talk about the happy quiet that can exist between two lovers, but this too was great; sitting between his sister and his brother, saying nothing, eating. Before the world existed, before it was populated, and before there were wars and jobs and colleges and movies and clothes and opinions and foreign travel - before all of these things there had been only one person, Zora, and only one place: a tent in the living room made from chairs and bed-sheets. After a few years, Levi arrived; space was made for him; it was as if he had always been. Looking at them both now, Jerome found himself in their finger joints and neat conch ears, in their long legs and wild curls. He heard himself in their partial lisps caused by puffy tongues vibrating against slightly noticeable buckteeth. He did not consider if or how or why he loved them. They were just love; they were the first evidence he ever had of love and they would be the last confirmation of love when everything else fell away.Isn't that a beautiful piece of writing? That is something I've felt while sitting in that peaceful quiet between siblings, while listening to them talk to one another, while laying beside them on the floor sharing a loud bout of laughter.Ultimately, this is a book that is about relationships. The relationships between the right wing and left wing, the husband and wife, brothers and sisters, boyfriends and girlfriends, wealthy and poor. It is a pretty fantastic read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's third novel has the multi-cultural and multi-racial themes of her earlier novels. But this time she doesn't showcase them; she uses them to paint a bigger picture. As the title suggests, this book is about the nature of beauty. The protagonist is Howard Belsey, a college professor at a Harvard-like college in Boston called Wellington. His family is about as \`mixed' as one can get. A white British man, he's married to a black American woman named Kiki. To further mix it up, Kiki is an office worker and, though she tries, isn't much of an intellectual. Howard is somewhat of a failure at his work. He teaches a class that questions what we view as beautiful in art. Not many students attend more than the first class, probably because it's difficult. (We are briefly introduced to a student, Katie Armstrong, who is a successful student but struggles mightily to understand Howard's lectures.) Further, he is writing a critical book about Rembrandt that he can never seem to finish.From Howard's perspective, everyone is an antagonist, (even Rembrandt) his wife, his three kids, his students. But set up as his official foil is Monty Kips, a Trinidadian British scholar. He is Howard's opposite in every way: black, conservative, and successful. His book on Rembrandt- a glowingly positive one- has come out and sits atop the best seller list. As the story begins, Howard's eldest son Jerome, a born-again Christian to boot, is in London working and staying with the Kipps'. He has a short-lived and disappointing sexual dalliance with the Kipps' beautiful daughter Victoria.Next the story moves ahead nine months, the Kipps' have moved to Boston because Monty has gotten a position at Wellington, disturbing both Howard and Jerome, who is trying to get over Victoria. Howard has committed an infidelity, though how significant that is remains to be seen. A young poet from the ghetto is introduced to the delight of Howard's college-aged daughter Zora and teenaged son Levi. And Kiki meets Monty's eccentric wife Carlene. With that, the pot is stirred until Howard is transformed by the most unlikely of people. But perhaps too late.Smith is fantastic writer. This was apparent from the first page of her first novel, White Teeth. But she has been an underachiever of sorts, because for its great start, White Teeth sinks at its end, and her second novel, Autograph Man, was a mess from the get-go. On Beauty makes amends for both those failures. It is a mature novel that addresses the biggest questions of them all (life, happiness, how we go our own direction while maintaining a relationship with someone going in the opposite direction) with her own unique style. Yes, there are slow parts. Yes, she changes POV a lot, sometimes to the point of distraction. Yes, some of her characters are shallow, not fully baked, and sometimes stereotypically overblown. Yes, the story can be depressing, especially where some of our characters end up. But the work gels. The resolution at the very end is beautiful, and worth the effort of reading this beautiful book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith, a London writer, first came to fame with her debut novel, \`White Teeth'. While slightly over hyped, White Teeth was a great novel. It was basically about modern London life, seen through three very different families. It was a great mess of a novel that worked like an early Dickens' novel in its ambition to take a bite of modern London life; full of memorable caricatures, great story lines, hysterical dialogue and a lyrical and hilarious prose.Her third novel is \`On beauty.' The novel takes place in a Massachusetts college town. The story is about two families: the Kipps and Belseys; but mostly about the Belseys. First up is Howard, a liberal art history professor. Then, there is his wife, Kiki. She is a nurse, and proudly not an intellectual, in the worst sense of the word. In her early years she was very beautiful, but has ballooned up to 250 lbs. Then the kids: Zora, a college student and ultimate daddy's little girl, Jerome, a conservative virginal (to Howard's despair) college student, Levi a home boy from the burbs, down with all things hip-hop.As the novel opens Jerome is living in London for the summer in the house of Monty Kipps, a conservative professor, and Howard's enemy. Back at home Howard is at the dog house for having cheated on Kiki. After a short tumultuous sexual encounter between Jerome and Victoria, one of the Kipps's daughter, Monty Kipps accepts a job in the college where Howard teaches and moves down the street from the Belseys.The plot is of course \`borrowed' from Forster's \\"Howards End.' Ms. Smith says this is a tribute to the author whom she says, \`all my fiction is indebted.' This is the novels first problem. From the opening line, \`One may as well begin with Jerome's e-mail to his father,' to a lengthy description and history to the Belsey's residence, to the structure of the story, Ms. Smith tries to echo Mr. Forster's novel. The first problem with these attempts is the plot, which at various point Ms. Smith has to yank into the narrow structure she has set for self. As a result the plot is a mess, without any of the \`White Teeth' ambitions. Another problem is the characters. Most of them are here standing in for the characters from the original story, as a result they are lifeless caricature and are pushed aside almost immediately after Ms. Smith has nodded at the original story.The second problem with the novel is the setting. She wrote the novel after her short stay in Cambridge. It shows. She has trouble with small everyday costumes: Kiki sends her nineteen years old son to buy alcohol; and most noticeably with the dialogues. Levi, whom she attempts to portrays as a suburb kid speaking in a hip hop lingo , sounds like a lovely English lady trying to speak in a hip hop lingo: \`You know ... I just thought I'd pay you a call'Yet, in some ways this is also the best novel Zadie Smith has written. Her prose is a lot more controlled than in her previous novels, but still lyrical and funny. More importantly she has created Kiki Belsey. Kiki Belsey is by far her most complex and detailed character. She is perhaps the only character without any intellectual ambition, and is perhaps (coincidentally?) the most normal. She is a mother worried about her kids, a woman dealing with aging and a failed marriage. In a way she is a simple character, that holds all the characters together. Towards the end of the novel she cleaning out the basement and observes, \`The greatest lie ever told about love is that it sets you free.'I finished this novel with a mixed felling. Here is a flawed novel, from a tremendous talent, who has still to write her GREAT NOVEL."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't always like books that are an homage to an earlier work, as On Beauty is to Howard's End. The Hours comes to mind as a completely over-hyped, forced replica of Mrs. Dalloway. But while some of the ties to Howard's End in On Beauty are, indeed, forced a bit, I was nevertheless sucked in to the characters and Zadie Smith's writing style. Smith is a truly gifted prosaist and I look forward to reading more of her works. In spite of some other minor flaws, don't believe the reviews that say this book was \\"dull\\" or uninteresting - it is anything but!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Any writing about Academia tends to bring out the hype. Smith's pyrotechnical language and sharp eye for (some) details can be deceptive. This is a rather mean-spirited, insider's book about some aspects of college (Ivy) culture, with a lot of \\"social relevance\\" and hot-button themes thrown in for cover. With the exception of Kiki (who we might feel sorry for) there's no one to like or admire in this book. The fools are unfunny and the villains lack that special something to raise them from the realm of merely unpleasant.So it's terribly confusing when in the midst of all this hip, soulless dialogue and mannered prose we get some laugh-out-loud comedy, brillant characterizations, and odd tidbits of wisdom. Like a sociopath with high IQ and sharp social skills, Smith romps over the reader and dulls the bludgeoning with an occasional reward.If that's your cup of tea, you're probably a 20-something college student playing with nihilism. You have second-hand, well-thumbed (but unread) David Foster Wallace on your crate-and-barrel bookcase. But the grownups are weary, weary of this.For a more fun romp through collegiate politics, try Moo."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The author creates believable characters and explores the relationships between family members. However, although believable and three-dimensional, the plot and characters are not that interesting, and I wouldn't really recommend it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I don't think I can add much to the excellent assessment of this book in the editorial reviews printed at the top of this page, but I do want to register disagreement with the general tenor of Amazon readers' comments, which tend to find the book disappointing. I find this to be a stunning achievement, more so even than the author's debut bookWHITE TEETH. While that fell clearly into the category of Immigrant Novel, this one is simply Novel; this still-young writer has begun to mature.True, ON BEAUTY also deals with race and culture, especially among younger people, but you soon stop thinking about them as special cases. For the most part these are comfortable middle-class folks, people who have made it in white society, where the challenges to their identity are more subtle but no less real. The principal setting is Wellington, an elite American university, whose atmosphere and characters Smith captures very well; her gentle mockery of academic fads is buttressed by a sure sense of what makes good teaching and helpful criticism. This is certainly a novel of ideas, but it is also about the people who advance the ideas, and on that level Smith's powers are extraordinary, on a par with books such as Ian McEwan's SATURDAY. The story centers on two academic rivals, Howard Belsey (a white British art historian married to an African American) and Sir Monty Kipps (a Trinidadian living in London), and their families. Ultimately both men are shown to be seriously flawed, but the women in the families especially reveal enormous reserves of strength that is a real joy.One Amazon reader mentioned David Lodge (e.g.CHANGING PLACES), and the territory is certainly similar, but I feel that Smith writes with more depth and less obvious comedy. Indeed, I cannot understand the insistence on the back of the paperback edition that this is a \\"hilarious send-up\\" or \\"rollicking satire.\\" It is comic, yes, in the sense that people are seen as they are, warts and all, but Smith's character-painting is as sad as it is funny, and often deeply affecting. It is comic in that you have to accept its structural premises, such as its sequestered environment, convenient coincidences, or the idea that Sir Monty as a visiting professor could immediately wield the sort of influence on campus politics that normally takes decades to achieve. But it is what Zadie Smith pours into the structure that makes her novel so wonderful. I find it a treasure trove, rich in ideas and filled with characters whose lives matter, even when they are making such a mess of them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has talent, but this book is lacking as a novel and would not have been published if the same work was delivered by an unknown author. The lack of a story is pathetic. The character development is rather good, but there's literally no story, beyond reading about a sad family going through a hard time. Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I'm surprised that nobody has excoriated this underedited, impossibly self-indulgent and above all boring book yet. I've actually found the amazingly generous online reviews of this novel more readable than the book itself. Its uneven tone (now comic! now serious! now bathetic!) is matched by a clunky, thudding exposition, exemplified by the overdescriptive narration of Jerome's affair with Victoria Kipps through emails that sound nothing like those a 19 year old boy would write. Of course, dull Jerome and ravishing Victoria (who I kept getting the hideous suspicion was supposed to be - yikes - an author surrogate) are unconvincing characters anyway - or caricatures really. I know this is supposed to be a \\"comic\\" novel, despite being extremely thin on laughs, but the characters are infuriatingly one-dimensional and stereotypical. Smith has admitted to blatantly ripping off Howards End, stripmining its themes and structure, to create this dreary tome - as if acknowleding her debt openly in any way compensates for her own failure of imagination. Save your money and buy the novel it steals from instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Since others have synopsized the plot at great length, I won't echo their reviews. Zadie Smith has flashes of brilliance and insights into human nature which are remarkable for her age, especially when dealing with the relationship between Kiki and Carlene. Sadly, the remaining family dynamics felt implausible, contrived, and strained. Howard and Monty come off as caricatures of academecians, most painfully in their inability to control their respective libidos among nubile young coeds. Their offspring, Jerome, Zora, Levi and Victoria, are simply unbelievable, as are their choices of friends and paramours. As a Boston native, I also found Smith's fabrication of a fictitious college town somewhat off-key. Wellington? Wellesley? Across the river? Cambridge? This was a distraction, as were the myriad typos that seem to be rampant now that spellchecker has replaced the human touch. The word \\"nothing\\" instead of \\"noting\\" completely changes the meaning of a sentence."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On the first page of Franz Kafka's great unfinished novel Amerika, the Statue of Liberty guards New York Harbor holding upright a large sword. San Francisco is a nearby East Coast city. Kafka had never been to America, and given his difficult life, and lack of access to the internet, such errors are easily forgiven.Zadie Smith supposedly wrote this novel while at Harvard, and there's no literary or practical reason for the sloppy writing and research. This novel just does not capture American language or culture.Supposed Americans speak in British vernacular or in some mid-Atlantic way that corresponds to a language that is spoken nowhere. An American character asks \\"What will you do at [for] Christmas?\\" Other Americans refer to the water board [water company] and an extractor fan [exhaust fan]. Graduate students are repeatedly referred to as \\"graduates.\\"Culturally, the book gets the details wrong too, making the simplistic assumption that liberal and conservative mean the same things in the US and UK. (They don't; look how well Bush and Blair got along.) For a campus novel, the details of the American university system are awfully wrong. A sixteen year old considers going straight to medical school or law school without getting an undergraduate degree first. A senior academic with thirty years experience is first going up for tenure. Neither would happen in the US system.Best of all, in Zadie Smith's Amerika, Thanksgiving is on a Friday!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I so wanted to enjoy this book, but I just didn't. I first read Autograph Man and fell in love with Zadie Smith. I also enjoyed White Teeth and was really anticipating this book, but it's been weeks and I'm still trying to drag my way through it. I found the characters generally unlikable and I really, really want Zadie to ask an American to read her writing before she attempts any more American dialogue (or descriptions for that matter). Should Levi really say, 'So what am I meant to do?' or SHOULD he say, 'So, NOW what am I supposed to do?' We never say 'I have done.', we say 'I have.' I could go on and on. Basically, it's an 'American' book told in a British voice when each part should be told in the voice of its narrator. The constant shift between under-developed characters makes for a confusing and interrupted read. Something would finally start to happen with one character, when boom - now you're back with some character you haven't heard from in chapters who never really did anything anyway.I'm hoping that this one is a learning experience for Ms. Smith and I'm still awaiting her next novel. Based solely on her first two, I would read anything that she puts out there (no matter how long it may take)."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I choose this book on the basis of its recommendation by the NY Times; I was deeply disappointed. It's a collection of loosely strung-together encounters among a cast of sterotyped characters:-Howard, the insipid, dyspepsic, weary British academic has-been who can't keep his pants on-Kiki, his African-American wife who's large of heart and girth-Jerome, the son who drifts in and out of the story and who's born-again in defiance of his atheist upbringing-Zora, the awkward over-achiever activist daughter-Levi, the son in his mid-teens who's pretending to be from the 'hood-Carl the sullen rapper who actually is from the hood-Monty, the self-righteous and ultimately hypocritical evangelical conservative-Victoria, his stunningly gorgeous and slutty daughter-Carlene, his mysterious sickly wife-Claire, the self-consciously liberal poet-professorOver the course of a year, they drop in and out of each other's lives, sometimes in the college town of Wellington, Mass and sometimes in London. And then...the book ends. Just ends. Did the author get bored? Deadline was up? Set herself a goal of so many pages and made it? If I'd been listening to in on CDs, I'd have thought the last one was missing."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I felt exhausted by \\"White Teeth\\" and could barely bring myself to finish it, but when I saw the sale price here on Amazon, I thought I'd give Zadie another go; I'm halfway through the novel now, and I've got another howling headache. I recognize her gifts, of course, but what I don't understand is her lack of discipline and craft. She seems very young, still, to me; every possible idea sprouting in her brain is deemed worthy of putting down on paper. She mentions in a forward that if it wasn't for her editor, this would be longer and 'worse'. I wish the editor had been more strict (and also that they had employed a halfway decent proofreader -- there are a multitude of typos in the book, shocking). Was it necessary to include Zadie's husband's poem (also titled 'On Beauty') in here? It's all so indulgent. Much has been said about her attempts at imitating American modes of speech -- this is the exhausting part. So many character types, each speaking in their own vernacular, but in very cliched ways, and THEY NEVER STOP TALKING. This is one of the talkiest books I've ever read, and what makes that challenging is that no one seems to have anything worthwhile to say. Another complaint, while I'm at it -- Kiki, the matriarch, is referred to as a nurse, but halfway through the book she still has yet to be seen doing anything nurse-like, no work, nothing. She doesn't even relate to an obviously ailing woman in a nurse-like way -- an arbitrary choice by the author, apparently, and then forgotten. I think this is the character Zadie missed by the longest shot, and the more she writes, the farther from a genuine character she gets. There is no real story here, that I can see. Indulgent, immature writing. I may not finish it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Many of my friends had recommended White Teeth to me, so when a book club I go to picked On Beauty by the same author, I was excited. However, I thought this book did not deserve any of the accolades heaped upon it. Her metaphors are way over used, and some of them just made no sense. Other descriptions were just so poor that I didn't know what she meant then either. Physical descriptions of characters left me picturing that everyone was one of Van Gogh's Potato Eaters, and I couldn't see why, in this book focused on love and relationships, anyone was with anyone for anything. It is said that writers should write about what they know. Based on her descriptions of anything American, I was surprised to learn that she had been in the country even once. She needed more research and a better editor. What's weird though is that I could see she was talented. But after this there is no way I want to try White Teeth. I don't trust her to not make me mad with these elements again."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Why did Howard and Kiki ever get married? How did all of their children go such different ways? Why, after 443 pages, do I not know or care? Zadie Smith has written some beautiful passages, surrounded by flat characters. Phew, and not to mention the unending snippets of sociopolitical commentary she drags us through without ever getting to a point, or a compelling concept."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I grant that Zadie Smith can write an evocative scene, or describe a setting well. But this skill does not an engaging story make.On Beauty sets out to examine the issues which divide men and women, parents and children, husbands and wives, Old World (UK) and New World (US), and academe and reality. Given the huge number of books which have tackled all or some of these subjects already, a great onus is placed upon the author to deliver a unique insight or two, and here Smith fails.Perhaps Smith could learn from her brilliant contemporary, Kate Atkinson, who can pull an engaging plot and lovely prose together while engaing us intellectually.Smith also incorporates some of her poet-husband's work in this book, which I found a tad precious. As well as a crude attempt to boost his sales.I keep reading rave reviews of Smith's work, so I keep reading her books, but this may be the last. Somehow I am missing whatever the raves are about."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Wellington is a fictitious college somewhere near Boston. Howard is a white art history professor who cheated on his black wife, Kiki, with a white poetry professor, Claire. Howard is a staunch proponent of affirmative action and liberal politics in general, and Howard's nemesis, Monty, a black professor, is a stalwart of the religious right who wants to take the \\"liberal\\" out of liberal arts. There is a fair amount of contention among Howard's colleagues over Monty's right to espouse his right-wing opinions in a series of lectures and over Claire's right to include poor but talented students in her very exclusive poetry class, even though they are not enrolled at Wellington. These issues, however, are not as compelling as the more intimate ones facing Howard's family. The book opens with the very uncomfortable scene where Howard attempts to break off the engagement of his son Jeremy to Monty's daughter, Victoria, when the whole thing was a rather unfortunate misunderstanding. In fact, the book's most memorable events are all somewhat embarrassing, including Howard's youngest son Levi's attempt to rally his co-workers to refuse to work on Christmas Day. The irony is that Levi's family members are mostly atheists, and his coworkers are actually pumped about the opportunity to be paid double-time for the holiday. Howard and Kiki's daughter Zora's forte is argument, and she manages to blackmail her way into Claire's poetry class. The ten or so main characters become tangled in relationships with one another that are often surprising and usually regrettable. Although Kiki is the emotional and ethical conscience in the family, no one person is truly the central character; it's more of an ensemble cast. The finale happens in sort of a flourish that puts the finishing touches on this colorful canvas of a family with still a few challenges ahead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I absolutely loved this book and recommend it to many friends. She captures a sort of family, a sort of dialogue, a way of talking-- perfectly. I did not hear her statement that the book was based on the plot of Howard's End until after I read it, but I love that fact. Not just because Howard's End is one of my favorite books of all time, but also because there there is something inherently humorous about basing a book's plot on another book which has a nearly indecipherable plot... I do not understand other people's bad reviews of this novel. Perhaps because I live in a community of academics and have two parents who are/have been academics, I found nothing about these people inauthentic... quite the contrary. Her ability to humorously and sympathetically portray these people is stunning. Not to mention her language."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I decided to check out the reviews, and was shocked at the plethora of bad reviews of this book. I picked it up after reading \\"Autograph Man\\" and have read it at least twice since then. There are some subtle nuances in the book, the way certain characters are shaped, but especially the themes of love and loss and failure that keeps me returning to this book. I read this just for the fun of it, and not in terms of a class or a book club, so cannot speak to a very critical and careful assessment. What I enjoyed about the book seems to be what everyone else hated! Namely, that ZS's characters don't present themselves in the same way that black American characters typically do. I am certainly not going to try and make a case that every single black american character is presented in essentially the same fashion, as that would be absurd. However, it seems to me that there is a certain trend or an aeshtetic that links black american writers of fiction to the greatest works of the Harlem Rennaissance and a steady stream of influence, \\"In search of our mothers gardens\\" often becomes a mold, a manner of being or presenting that is consistent with what is 'considered' authentic as far as african american speech or identity or expression. I hope that made sense, I won't claim to know a damned thing about black southern living or dialect, food or style; as a white girl on the west coast I have literally nothing on that. What I am alluding to here, is a kind of discourse, ok so you know how if you hear the news you know its the news because it sounds like the news? Even if its in Spanish or Cantonese, its still sounds like the news, right? The pauses, the cadences, the manners of shaping phrases...that's what I'm talking about. When you pick up a novel about black North American characters, you know what sort of voice to expect. I am certainly not saying that all of these novelists are mimicking Alice Walker or Toni Morrison, I just mean that there is a set discourse that regulates how these characters speak, and what I loved about ZS's book was that she just broke with that tradition entirely. I don't know that I can even consider what is or is not 'authentic' apart from what is or is not considered as adequate representations of 'authenticity' in the world of fiction. I just know that I like books that surprise me, that keep me guessing and shape themselves in unusual and interesting ways, and this one did that."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I first spotted this book when it was released in hardcover and was excited about it. I LOVED her novel White Teeth and was impressed by the glowing reviews of On Beauty. Once it came out in paperback, I scooped it up. My first impression was not a good one. The dialouge in the beginning was flat, boring and often times confusing. But I trudged on, hoping that it would be another Zadie Smith gem. It never got any better. The characters were dull, annoying and stereotypical. The plotline was never interesting. All in all, i was very disapointed. Zadie Smith is usually a brilliant writer and that is the only reason I forced myself to make it through the book, months later. A good book usually takes me about 3 days. If you haven't read White Teeth, get that instead.White Teeth: A Novel"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"DID I JUST READ THAT?Is what I kept saying to myself while reading this absolutely deliciously written book by Zadie Smith. Her characters are all bold and probably a little larger than life. Her dialogue is so witty and gritty. Her plot emerges slowly through these peoples' lives but it nevertheless moves. A terrific story about quirky people living in our time. A great read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed On Beauty. It is a book set mostly in upper middle class academia with some forays into lower class life. The depiction of life in academia with all the infighting is very well done. There is a dynamic between liberal and conservative philosophies that I would have liked to see more of. A lot happens in this book. There is marriage trouble, a depiction of the life of a up and coming street artist and student life at a fictional school that is modelled after the Ivy Leagues. Although I enjoyed this book I found it to be uneven. For example the disintegration and perhaps resurgence of the marriage is very interesting but the life of Carl and his conclusions about the world of academia are difficult to believe in. However, this is a minor complaint about an overall enjoyable book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Fans of the BBC soap \\"EastEnders\\" will recognize the way Zadie Smith has constructed this wonderful send-up of academic life. Here are the closely interwoven lives of people related by blood, lust, and a too-tightly knit community. Here also are the racially mixed families, the full-blown sibling disputes, the marital infidelities, the class divisions, high-volume generational conflicts, the festering animosities, and the seldom acknowledged but visible contrast between the good-looking and the plainly unattractive. Meanwhile, there are uncounted threads of plot lines as we cut from one character to the next and learn the secrets they are keeping from each other, secrets that will eventually have their day of revelation.Layered over all this melodrama is a brilliant comedy of manners that is often laugh-out-loud hilarious. Smith occasionally dips below the surface of her characters to reveal their self-awareness, but most of the time her scenes are about what happens when people are talking to each other. With her fine-tuned ear to the varieties of speech, Smith uses wildly different ways of using language to represent collisions of personalities. And she invariably sets her characters on a collision course with each other.This is a hugely entertaining novel and a refreshing departure from more sober-sided and politically correct portrayals of \\"diversity.\\" The novel has some ideas on that subject, but they're not very big ones. Readers should just settle back and let themselves get lost in the fun house."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Our book club read it with disbelief and puzzlement: why the universal critical acclaim? The writing is stilted, the story tedious and plot absurd: all in all I couldn't care too much about any of the characters. If anything, it is similar to her meandering horrible first book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the first of this author's works I've read and I'm very impressed. I also know nothing about her background, except that she's a thirty-year-old black Londoner, but she does a terrific job describing the dynamics of a mixed marriage in Massachusetts. This consists of Howard Belsey, a transplanted Brit and untenured art history professor at Wellington College; his black wife, Kiki, a hospital administrator and self-described non-intellectual -- though she has a forbidably analytical mind -- and their three children ranging from fifteen to twenty. The author takes you inside each of their minds in rotation, giving the reader a multifaceted view of the action and of everyone's reactions to it. The other major player is Sir Monty Kipps, a hypocritical, black, hyper-Christian, right-wing apologist of the sort who pretends to openmindedness and egalitarianism but who cannot pronounce the word \\"liberal\\" without a sneer. Kipps, also from London, and Howard are mortal professional enemies and political opposites, and when Kipps comes to spend a year at Wellington -- ironically in the Black Studies Department, which he also sneers at -- the battle lines are drawn. But that's only one plot among many. Howard was rather stupidly unfaithful to his wife with a colleague. The marriage may be simply running out of steam. Jerome Belsey, the eldest son, had a very brief affair with Victoria Kipps, a very, very hot number indeed. Zora, Jerome's overachieving sister, is a freshman at Wellington and already a master of academic politics. Levi, the youngest son, wants desperately to be \\"street,\\" one of the brothers from Roxbury; he also has sold his soul to rap music -- which brings him into contact with Carl, a very talented young poet/rap artist, who gets into a creative writing class at the college (though he's not a student), then into the Black Studies music library, and whom Zora also has a massive crush on. And there's Levi's other sort-of-friend, a Haitian teacher refugee now earning a living on the street. And hovering in the background is Carlene Kipps, Monty's wife and a complicated lady with whom Kiki develops an unlikely friendship. All these layers and interrelationships sound like too much for a book of less than 450 pages, but Smith is extremely talented and very subtle. I shall definitely be pursuing her other works."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I've read Howard's End a few times and think it far superior to this book. However, On Beauty was a nice read during my recent Mexican cruise. I thought there were some interesting parallels to Forester's book, and I enjoyed the descriptions of the politics that goes on with professors at a liberal arts college. However, I didn't really care about any of the characters that much, and found most of them shallow and annoying. I'm not sure if I'll be willing to invest much time in another book by this author in the future."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"On Beauty is an easy read whose largely stereotyped characters can fill an evening better than TV. I picked it up because I'm always curious about literary fiction that win prizes. Amazon provides short reviews from Kirkus Review, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, etc. But I've learned not to take them too seriously. Witness the Publishers Weekly starred review that doesn't even get the names of the characters right. Caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"It surprises me that Zadie Smith was a contender for the Booker Prize with this novel. It struck me as structurally similar to her earlier White Teeth, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The structure of the two parallel families is the same, the multicultural aspects of exile/mixed marriage/mixed races are the same, only that Smith now transports most of the plot to Massachusetts. I don't think she has the same cultural understanding of the US as she has of England (and as she showed in White Teeth). The worst really is to read American teenagers, however educated and academic they may be, asking for \\"favours\\". English spelling does no favor to her portrait of hip-hop culture, which seems to be limited to one of the characters' use of \\"scene\\" anyway. In short, Smith's characters are a bit culturally superficial; she makes up for it with lively descriptions of the characters' inner lives, but somehow that is also so much like White Teeth. All in all, I am disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"10/19/05It is an honor to review ON BEAUTY, Zadie Smith. I read the book, putting it down only to walk the dog, talk with my husband and sleep. I regretted leaving the people in the book when it ended.On Beauty is full of characters; perhaps this is a flaw, but I found the people exciting and all were differentiated, most growing or changing in some way in the course of the book. The book begins with a BANG and ends with a bang and a whimper; how, I wonder, will the people go on with their lives? Reading On Beauty is similar to walking down a crowded street in lower Manhattan, a street filled with people of every nation, every color, all talking with or often at cross purposes to each other, but all, nonetheless, living full lives.If for no other reason than this next one, the book is worth reading: Zadie Smith has an absolutely accutely attuned ear for accents. She has captured, on paper, the accents of people from all economic, educational and social walks of life. It is amazing to hear people talking so clearly on paper. Who am I to say this, but I will take this chance: I do believe that 40, 50 years from now, when people want to know what life was like in 2005, they will just pick up this book and enter life in our present, their past.This book is about people in all our glorious, basic, stupid and fantastic selves, with hundreds of roads to take, but the one taken really does make a difference in peoples' lives.I think that you cannot skim this book. It is actually an easy read, but the book is so full of people and ideas and those marvellous accents, that only a careful reading will allow you to enter fully into this book. I can hardly wait until Smith's next book. I also read Smith's book, White Teeth, but truly, I feel that this book definitely tops White Teeth. Zadie Smith is only 30 years old--imagine what her \\"take\\" on life will be as she grows older???"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith takes the English language and weaves a tapestry of prose to be marveled at. This is one of the most down to earth, insightful and just plain entertaining books I have read in many years.Some books are best read during a specific season or time in your life. this is an anytime read. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Smith's OB is a fine novel. Not great. Not particularly memorable (at least I don't suppose that it will leave a lasting impression on me; I doubt I'll find myself quoting from it days, weeks, or years from now). But solid: well written, well styled, balanced, strong on character development, well researched. This last point bears underscoring. OB is a perfect evocation of university life, in certain quarters of certain universities. I'm not familiar with the details of Smith's own biography, but I assume she herself was, once upon a time, enrolled in a school similar to the eponymous one at the center of this novel. OB evinces the kind of offhand familiarity with academia that experience (and, I imagine, only rarely research) brings. Kudos to Smith for successfully toeing the very fine line between characterization and stereotyping. The protagonists of this novel, their strengths and their foibles, the storylines, the setting -- in short, everything about OB -- seem genuine. That said, OB gets 4 stars from this reader for the following reason: that which is genuine is not always compelling. In the end, OB felt over-long to me and a little less substantial than it might have been. The classics to which it has been compared, and on which it was consciously modeled, all have something this one lacks. For all the reasons I can imagine reading Howard's End again and again, at different stages of my life, I doubt I'll ever crack the pages of OB again. Smith is a fine writer, to be sure. I look forward to reading more of her in future. OB is a fine novel. It's no masterpiece, though."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth on tour through Canada, I became a devotee of Zadie Smith. So, like other smitten fans I was stoked when On Beauty was published and pre-ordered a copy. The book arrives. I read the first few pages. I am disappointed. The book sits on my shelf for nearly a year.I decided to give it another go last month. I struggled through the introductory e-mail correspondence quite a bit. However, by the second \\"chapter\\" I was fully engrossed and devoured the story in three days.Overall, the plot of this novel is not as vibrantly paced as White Teeth or The Autograph Man, character development is...bizarre. There are no heroes in this story, just nemeses. Everyone is at war with one another (even if they are friends). If you like nice and tidy resolutions in your stories, this may not be the novel for you. The relationships between the characters are at once complex and superficial. One of the main characters, Howard, is just tragically dense and self-absorbed. At times, it's hard to have any sympathy for him.The ending is pretty open. I read it a few times and decided that it was just incomplete. Incompleteness is a general theme of the book and my general experience while reading it.Despite this, I give the novel 4 stars. It has these wonderful, illuminating moments that make it float.Smith's portrait of the pitfalls and tragic politics of academic life was downright hilarious and all too familiar. The dialogue in the story is for the most part brilliant. A good example is when Belsey visits his estranged father in London. She captures the tension, frustration, and love between father and son wonderfully. She's a gifted wordsmith and has an amazing method of interweaving metaphors with literal phrases. Similar to Joanne Harris, she's sensuous and writes with all senses in mind."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's new novel is at its core an exploration of family life, and the ways in which love sustains and fails us. She does a remarkable job of capturing this with the Belsey clan: Howard, who has lost the ability to articulate his emotions and in the process devalued them; Kiki, who \\"gave her life\\" to Howard and has to reevaluate that decision in the face of his infidelity; Jerome, embracing faith as an act of rebellion; Zora, ambitious and insecure, forced to reconsider what she really cares about; and Levi, struggling with how his middle-class existence can be reconciled with his identity as a black teenager. Smith understands the intricacies of this family, and she portrays them in a way that allows the reader to forgive them for the things they struggle to forgive in themselves and each other.Smith's prose is lively, interesting and often very funny; most of her characters are fully realized and multi-dimensional; and even minor scenes often reflect uncommon insight. To the extent that the novel tries to impart a larger commentary about race, class, politics and art, it is often less successful than it is in the portrayal of the individual. It is nonetheless an excellent read.Smith describes this novel as an \\"hommage\\" to E.M. Forster, and it is certainly that--but it is also limited by its efforts to mirror Howards End. The best novels can be retold in ways that make the reader appreciate their universality, and Smith's book has the opposite effect: it reminds the reader of the ways in which Howards End is limited by its time and place. You can see this in the way she has to change events and characters to fit them into a more contemporary setting. The Belseys have neither the charm nor the innocence of the Schlegel sisters, and the Kippses do not carry the same dominant assurance that the Wilcoxes have--they are accused of self-hatred, and deny it, but are tinged with it in a way the Wilcoxes would never have been. Carlene Kipps is too much Ruth Wilcox, and does not receive the benefit of the peculiar insights Smith brings to characters more fully her own. And Kiki Belsey is insufficiently Margaret Schlegel, with neither the wisdom nor the compassion of Forster's character.The strengths of this novel are Smith's, not Forster's. But Smith's strengths come through on every page."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I enjoyed white teeth as a book, but was disappointed by the ending, which I felt was very rushed. In contrast, I found On Beauty a bit laborious to read (not as quick a read as White Teeth) but the ending was much more satisfying. The character development is as detailed as Smith always is, but it is quite obvious that she has studied life in America to write about it, not lived it."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's excellent third novel, On Beauty, limns the tale of a thoroughly modern family beset by issues of trust, adultery, race and class in a New England academic town.Howard and Kiki Belsey (he Caucasian and English, she black and from small-town Florida) have forged a decades-long and mostly-successful marriage that has produced three children. On Beauty follows the family through a troubled passage both in Howard and Kiki's marriage and in Howard's university career that raises questions about honesty (both marital and otherwise), fidelity, racial identity and politics.While Smith revisits some of the questions addressed in her first novel, the wonderful White Teeth, the tone of the two novels varies markedly. Where White Teeth was allegorical, On Beauty is more intimate and its central characters more finely drawn. The depiction of Kiki, a middle-aged woman caught between the needs of her children, her husband and herself, is especially moving and generous.On Beauty is highly recommended as a beautifully written and absorbing novel of family relationships, with welcome comedic turns. For those who wondered whether Smith could produce a second novel of the caliber of her acclaimed White Teeth debut, the answer is decidedly yes. Even better, the two novels are sufficiently different so as to diminish disparaging side by side comparisons of either. What can be said is the Zadie Smith is a major new literary talent who deserves the praise that readers and critics are bestowing on her."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith has a nice ear for dialogue, especially when the young fend off their parents or when her characters quarrel. Scenes are sometimes funny and, on one or two occasions, moving. She is good on immature students, on faculty rivalries and on fashionable political issues on American university campuses. Her main characters are mostly well drawn, though one of them surely descends into caricature when she has him lecture on art in meaningless post-structuralist jargon; and the way in which most of his students respond in the same jargon is frankly unbelievable: that sort of lecturer would never keep a class. (Incidentally, the title of the book led me to think that issues about art and poetry would be much more central than they actually are. The poem, On Beauty, which is quoted on p.153, is presumably supposed to be a clue to much else in the book, but I couldn't make head or tail of it.)I think the novel is not tightly enough constructed. In the first half there are several scenes whose purpose in the overall scheme eluded me, and at that stage it was hardly a page-turner for me: I was not eager to find out what happened next. But in its last quarter the book gathers momentum, and the ending is terrific."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I know that White Teeth was one of those polarizing books...either people loved it or they didn't.I loved it.Saying that, I found On Beauty equally funny, and well written.Summary, no spoilers:In a nutshell, this is the story of the Belsey family. The father, Howard, is a white man married to a black woman named Kiki. Howard is an oddball professor at what is supposed to be, a liberal arts Ivy League school.Kiki is a large woman, in many ways. She is full of life, and love, and has also put on a lot of weight since giving birth to their three kids. She is the anchor of the Belsey family, but she must deal with betrayal when she finds out that Howard has been unfaithful.The other family in this book are the Kipps. The father is a well-known black conservative named Monty Kipps. He is very religious, and conservative, and against affirmative action. Exactly the opposite of the Belseys...Needless to say, the Belsey's and Kipp's clash. The book features the interplay between the Belsey's and their children, with those of the Kipps, involving not the least, sex, love, and true friendship.I don't think anyone does dialogue better than Zadie Smith. And she is able to get in the minds of middle age white men, as seemingly easy as she does teenage black rappers.Zadie Smith has become one of my favorite writers. She is one of those authors who's new book I will run out and get in hardcover....and read immediately.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I read \\"On Beauty\\" based on its favorable reviews and my fondness for \\"White Teeth.\\" However, I was disappointed to find \\"On Beauty\\" a shallow and immature book with underdeveloped characters. Equally bothering to me is the cultural context, which does not ring true. I have lived in the Boston area most of my life and am an academic. Smith's knowledge of Boston is slight and removed, while her perception of academia is that of a student. In addition, she has a weak grasp of American English. These problems combined to destroy this reader's \\"willing suspension of disbelief.\\""},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's latest novel, ON BEAUTY offers fans of WHITE TEETH a new story with new characters rendered in that same exquisitely touching and genuinely funny voice. Despite some unfortunate reviews, ON BEAUTY is a predominantly successful modern twist on E.M. Forster's marvelous HOWARDS END. I will not bother rehashing the details of the plot (others before me have done an exemplary job on that front) except to say that Smith moves Forster's novel of elitism in 19th century London to a 21st century Boston suburb adding in the elements of race, gender, religion, politics and a modern perspective of sexuality. In Smith's hands academia becomes the perfect setting for this novel of personal and political passions and her fictional college, Wellington, succeeds as an obliquely disguised Harvard.Sadie Smith has a rare gift for rendering each character perfectly within a well-populated novel. No character lacks for development. Each member of the Belsey family, including the extraordinarily endearing (Kiki), her aging, defeated, unfaithful husband (Howard), their brilliant but socially inept daughter (Zora), their oldest son and the Christian rebel of a secular-liberal family (Jerome), and especially the troubled, passionate youngest (Levi), has their chance to shine in near-perfect prose. Even the minor characters get their moments of well-delineated glory. In short, Smith is able to create novel in which a large number of characters is a blessing rather than a distraction.Many reviewers have commented upon Smith's use of language and perceived a lack of ability to master American dialect. But I failed to find this either offensive or distracting. (I also must note after having lived in Boston, that her New England Caribbeans speak rather authentically.) That aside, language is an essential element of this book and virtually all the characters come from linguistically mixed backgrounds. Levi's inept use of \\"street\\" language seems quite intentional and emphasizes the truth about his background: he's the child of a professor who has spent his life near colleges and universities, yet wishes to be authentically \\"African American\\" in his manner. And he is not supposed to be able to pull that off very well! The same may be true of Kiki: raised in south Florida, well-educated and married into academia, she is caught between many worlds and obviously fails to fit authentically into any of them. As you read this wonderful novel, please keep in mind that language is fluid. It develops and changes under the influences such as family, friends, the media and the environment that surrounds the speaker. Rather than disparage the characters for the way they speak, simply allow yourself to follow the rhythm and substance of their language. That is the heart of the novel. The dialect may not adhere perfectly to your conceptions of how a person a particular station or socio-economic status might speak, but I believe that THAT, for Smith, that is the very point. Elitism and conformity are but contrived conceptions. Beauty, both physical and perceived, is what is real."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"My vantage point allowed me to enjoy On Beauty and I've already picked up a copy of White Teeth. I can understand the negative comments about lack of character development and the lack of maturity on the part of the young author whose own beauty, race, and cultural background apparently made her a prize of mass media, but since I live outside the US and haven't been asaulted by media hype, and because I'm not a jealous-wannabe-writer, I can't sympathize with the viciousness of the reviewers who give On Beauty one star. On Beauty entertained me; it did not enlighten me, but I did not expect this of a simple novel. I enjoyed the verbal interplay of the characters but felt disatisfied with the ending. The structure of the novel is the flow of life of a couple of families. We step into the flow at the beginning of the book and step out at the end. There is no Beginning, Development, Denouement. By the time I reached the end, I had imagined several possible endings which could have been better than the real one, so I did feel a bit let down."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am tired of books about writers. I'm more tired of books about academics and universities. I give a free pass to Nabokov and that's it. This is purported to have such a great ear for language and move so seamlessly between these different races and classes and I didn't buy a bit of it. It lost me for good at the scene at the spoken word/poetry jam. Ultimately this could turn out to actually represent reality but I certainly hope I would never know about it. Goofy. The snarky Haitian guy, what? Maybe literature is becoming so narrowly focused that it's just writers writing for writers and reviewers (being writers) getting all fired up but it's getting lost on me."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I found this book lengthy, depressing, and the characters incredibly unlikeable. Smith infused White Teeth with humor and characters, that although flawed were always relateable. On Beauty is just not another White Teeth, and I did not like it at all nor did anyone else I know who enjoyed her debut novel."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Irritating, interesting and sometimes hilarious book with a cast of multifaceted characters. However, some of them float in and out of the book as an afterthought (e.g. Jerome). Some of the characters were a bit forced and unrealistic (e.g. Levi, Vee) and turn out to be quite annoying. There is also a LOT of crying in this book . . . EVERYONE cries, the men, the women ...I mainly kept reading to find out what would happen as the tension kept rising. Some of the discoveries are scandalous, others not quite so, but it was strange to see how some of the issues that came out were not dealt with upfront. There was always an air of not speaking about it out loud, which I think just added to the frustrating side of this book.There were times, as this book takes place in the US and in the UK, you were not sure where they were at times. It got a bit confusing that way and had to take a step back to see that no, Wellington is in fact in the US.Likes: Howard, even though he was a bit of an arse; the humor; Monty, so pompous, hehehe.Dislikes: over and irrelevant use of tough, wannabe African-American talk (note: pimps, gangsta, sista, brother . . . too much), near maniacal obsession with the plight of Haitians."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is a tribute to EM Forster's Howard's End. It shows the conflict between two families based on class, culture, literary values and moral sensibilities. This was there in the beginning of the 20th century England and is portrayed in Boston in on of the old colleges there. It is full of petty feuds, academic and professional stepping toes, silly pride, but completely cut off from the outside world that is full of poverty, crime and fear. They live in an academic bubble. There is also race and nationality in this mess, which was not present in Howards End. This is due to the fact that a lot of the literature has in part been affected in the recent years by these factors. It is independent of the status of the person, no one is immune to it in the present day world.The story is about Howard Besley, a Rembrant scholar, who has no knowledge of the outside world. He has an academic rival, Sir Montague Kipps, a conservative who is against affirmative action and a racist. His wife develops a relationship with Kipps' invalid wife. She bequeaths her an immensely valuable piece of Haitian art, a legacy the Kipps family tries to block (just as Ruth Wilcox leaves Howards End to Margaret Schlegel). It shows the relationship between the two families, its diversities and all the pettiness. The novel shows great refinement in language between the different people, and is very funny. Due to the number of types of people, she shows diversity in language and mixing it with great brilliance. It is her best novel since White Teeth. This is a wonderful novel and confirms Zadie Smith as one of special novelist of this generation with an understanding of the mind and the heart and how to mix them."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"What a waste of talent! Feeling like a rising star, Zadie Smith obviously wanted to score high points fast. That she is an aspirant for glory is the lesser sin, though. Those who short-listed her book for the 2005 Booker prize are the true sinners. A book so short of cultural depth and so devoid of structure, not to mention of full-fledged characters, cannot--and should not--be elevated to a standard for good literature.There is no doubt that Zadie Smith has a very talented pen. But at her early age, there also is no doubt that she lacks life experience and a mature concept of the literature's mission: to educate emotions, to reflect on sublimity and tragedy, to explore the human condition in its evolving dimensions. A book should be judged relative to its author's aspirations. Smith's ambitious project, with its 443 pages, leaves no ambiguity as to her desire to match the great novels of the past.The classic elements are there: family saga (not one but two families), generational conflict, class opposition, love and betrayal, etc. But all this is amorphous, without a solid composition, logorrheic, and, at the end of the day, meaningless. It even smacks of snobbery. People like me who are life-long insiders in academia can only have a jovial laughter at the tasteless treatment of professors and students offered by this writer. Her characters are entangled in sex--and adultery, of course!, old-fashioned sholarly leftism, teenage rebellion, and confusion about the value of art. I even cannot say what Smith thinks about family values. All her characters, except perhaps Kiki, are flawed without awareness of the roots of their flaws. Their lives suck without us knowing why. Maybe because their creator wanted them to look stupid and ridiculous?So, is this book a condemnation of academia? Or a laudation of artistic freedom incompatible with academia? Or maybe it is a statement about dealing with racism on both sides of the Atlantic? No message, if there is any, of this book, is clear but that this author, brought up in the conflicting values of today's Anglo world, is unable to outdo her own limitations."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is the story of two families, the Belseys and the Kipps. One based in London, the other in the States. One conservative and Christian and the other liberal and 'god-aversive'. The patriachs of each family are academics and take opposing views on artworks of Rembrant resulting in an 'academic fight' that encroaches on other areas of college life and is further intensified when their families become entwined through relationships between their children and wives.The story is not only about the obvious clashes in viewpoint but a close examination of academia - the high morals, competitiveness, a critique of sorts of the meritocracy and the strange closeted environment of colleges.Initially I found the story slow and was wondering what was the point, but the story really hits a home run in the last quarter."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered. I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY. Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents. Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH. They are believable. Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl. The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all. The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster. Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM. I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I am not sure at all why this book became as hyped as it did, but I can't agree with the over-assessment of it. There is much talent here, and an energetic cast of characters but it strikes me as false, and lacks alot of depth. Perhaps I am wrong, but I just couldn't understand why it was lauded. Smith seems to stay on the surface and this is always interesting and lively, but it isn't a work of literary brilliance, though highly entertaining (which is alot in itself). I wouldn't have minded if it had just been noted as such."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I was so bored by this book that I was unable to finish it. I know that it isn't really fair to write a review of a book I couldn't finish, but then I realized that the fact that I was unable to finish it (and I am an avid reader, and not too hard to entertain!) really said a lot.I was expecting something pretty good, since there is a lot of hype around this book. I have not gotten around to reading White Teeth (and now may not even bother) and probably I should have read that first. But I found this book to be a rather pretentious, dull, and even stilted rip-off of the great books about class and manners. HOWEVER, in contrast to those great books, there was not one character in this book who could hold my interest. I really agree with one of the other reviewers who said that the characters were not really humanized at all. I just could not relate to them or empathize with any of them, which really surprised me. Furthermore, the writing style - which I suppose was attempting some sort of idea of refinement and breeziness - literally put me to sleep. Literally. I fell asleep twice while reading this. I had to read it for a book club, and I am not one to shirk on reading, but I just could not muster up the ability to get through this one. Highly overrated, in my opinion. At least wait for the paperback - I felt like this was a waste of 25 bucks."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After reading White Teeth I was expecting this novel to be of the same calibre, sadly it is not. The plot is very jerky and the characters are under developed. The idea for the novel is good but it does not hang together well. White Teeth's weakness was it's ending and I think this novel has the same weakness or more so, a novel that seems to go nowhere, shame as it had so much potential."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"In ON BEAUTY, nominated for a Booker Prize, Zadie Smith writes about two families in academia. Howard Belsey is a Caucasian British liberal transplant, teaching at a fictional university in Massachusetts, living with his non-academic African American hospital administrator wife Kiki; and their children, Zora, Jerome and Levi. The Belseys are pitted against-- well, at least Howard is-- the Kipps family composed of Trinidadian conservative scholar Monty; his wife, Carlene; and their two children, Michael and Victoria. These two families intertwine themselves in more ways than a crazy quilt. While Howard and Monty carry on a very public feud at Wellington University, Kiki and Carlene become friends-- sort of-- and the beautiful Victoria mixes it up with just about everybody.Ms. Smith spins an entertaining story that lopes right along; but she also raises questions about art, religion, race, class, family relationships, friendship, fidelity in marriage, etc. She makes insightful observations about the human animal and can be so good with words: \\"Each couple is its own vaudeville act.\\" Kiki at one point says about her son Jerome that \\"You don't have favorites among your children, but you do have allies.\\" While that statement probably isn't true, it's certainly a good way to say it and Kiki probably actually believes it. (Hemingway expressed it better, saying that he didn't love an older child more than a younger one, but that he had loved the older son longer.) The character Carl folds \\"his arms across his narrow filleted chest, every rib as visible as it is upon a cat's belly.\\" And surely everyone of us can swear by this statement: \\"It is an unnatural law of. . . parties that the person whose position on the guest list was originally the least secure is always the first to arrive.\\" (And I should add, often he is the last to leave.)The least interesting parts of the novel are Howard's analyses of Rembrandt's paintings. His pedantic ramblings didn't convince me that he knew what he was talking about; on the other hand, I find a great deal of art criticism decadent. Sometimes Levi gets a little tiresome with his rapper talk; but perhaps if I were 18 and trying to find my way amidst a often deliciously dysfunctional familiy, I might have a different opinion about him. The men-- Monty and Howard, that is-- both behave badly, and for all their differences, ultimately are more alike than either one of them would admit.Ms. Smith's attributing her husband's poem \\"On Beauty\\" to the poet Claire (although she acknowledges his authorship in her ending notes) is an example of chutzpah unadorned. Surely a writer as skilled as Ms. Smith could have written a poem of her own. (The things we do for love.) This rambling, ambitious novel nonetheless is certainly well worth reading and runs over with an enthusiasm that can only come from a young writer."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This is not a great book. Certainly don't rush to buy it on hard cover. The plot is somewhat disheveled, although some of the characters are well drawn. The most annoying thing about it is that Smith fails to understand and hence accurately render the African-American adolescents she depicts. Their language sounds constructed and forced. The prose also gets profuse at times. I don't recommend it. Buy Ishiguro's book, _Never Let Me Go_ instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I really struggled with whether to give this book two stars or three. Zadie Smith's writing is so superb that for a time I tilted toward the higher rating.But I opted for two because of so many glaring weaknesses: missing are plot, storyline, character development, tension and a realistic understanding about race in America.Mostly I found that I didn't care about anyone in the book. I wasn't curious to know them better or, really cared what would happen.And I also think she really should stick to writing what she knows--and that is NOT race in America. It's not even race and immigrants in America. She hits so many false notes that they ruined the beautiful music of her writing.For example, when I ask myself what distinguishes Kiki as \\"black\\" my only answer is her stereotypical obesity. (And yes, statistically, most African American women are obese). She looks like a mammy. Otherwise, for most of the book, she is strangely devoid of culture, beliefs, history, family, friends, politics--you name it.But no mother of black sons, whether she lives in a city or a suburb, can afford to act as if color does not matter--not in America. We have a violence here that permeates everything. Often it is black on black violence. But nonetheless our violence devours young black men. Mothers here (and father's too) are vigilant about the minutiae of their son's lives--the size, style and color of things like t-shirts, baseball caps and blue jeans.And the mother of a black boy who doesn't come home at night doesn't talk like Kiki does in this book--like a white mother--about how she's not his \\"jailer\\" and oh well, she just doesn't know what to do. No, the mother of a black boy wonders if he's dead.And were Howard a recent immigrant I would understand his ignorance, but no one who has lived here for any length of time would fail to understand and be terrified for their sons. Were this a deeper book, that fear could have been used as one of the more obvious reasons Howard has a fling with a white woman--it could be an expression of his wish to escape, if briefly, the tremendous difficulties that come with having to worry incessantly about blackness--something that was probably foreign to him for much of his life."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" was chosen by my book club, and soon after I heard a lovely interview with the author on the Diane Rehm show. I was really excited to read this book, so imagine my disappointment when I found a book in which characters were undeveloped and uninteresting, not to mention unfathomable, and in which there were no discernible themes. There was nothing beautiful about the book, and honestly I found the highly sexualized content of her writing offensive because it added nothing to the story or to my understanding of the characters. All in all, a depressing read, all the more so because Smith is clearly a gifted writer. Perhaps as the author matures she'll have more success at developing characters and themes that actually mean something. We agreed at book group that this is a sophomoric effort, and all wondered how in the world it got published. I had bought \\"White Teeth\\" at the same time, but couldn't bring myself to read it after finishing \\"On Beauty\\". The photo of the author on the back is the only thing beautiful about this book."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I rushed out to buy this book based upon the terrific reviews it received, especially from the New York Times (both Sunday and daily editions). And I loved White Teeth. But this book absolutely made me cringe. I must admit I was unable to get past the first 150 pages. To get that far required a major amount of willpower... I kept waiting for it to get better, which it didn't.The portraits are so self-conscious and false. Not a single character rang even halfway true to me. And the dialogue...so phony that the author's not especially skilled hand, was evident everywhere. If the author thinks she understands the United States, even New England...she is wrong. One year at the Radcliffe Institute does not, obviously, an expert make.An homage to Forster's Howard End...I think not."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Based on all the rave reviews that this book received, I should have loved it. Instead, I had to force myself to complete this pretentious, plodding bore, since I truly hate to give up on any bookI found the characters to not be at all well defined. Just when I though I might get some deeper insight into one of them, the author moved on to another character. The book starts out with e-mails from Jerome to Howard. Very interesting. However, Jerome essentially disappears from the rest of the book. Claire, Carl, and Levi - I was waiting to find out a great deal more about these characters, but instead I had to read the boring and incredibly predictable scene in which Victoria and Howard have sex (honestly, who was surprised by this?) What is the hot, sexy college student Victoria's motivation for wanting to have sex with the 50ish year old Howard? This is never explained. And in the end, when Howard spurns her further advancements, do we find out anything more about her? No. We do however find out that Howard simply likes her. Why? What's to like?I also found the story to be incredibly disjointed. Various story lines were started and then dropped. Howard's visit with his father, the developing friendship between Kiki and Carlene, The painting that Carlene \\"willed\\" to Kiki, Jerome's Christianity and many others. None of these things were explored to their fullest.The author must have been paid by the word. There are numerous page long plus paragraphs that say absolutely nothing. This book needed a better editor since it could have been shortened by about 100 pages and we wouldn't have missed a thing.Another reviewer recommended Richard Russo's STRAIGHT MAN and I couldn't agree more. It is a wonderful book about academia. Better characters, better story. Give that one a try instead."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Coming to it from a background as an academic whose area is developmental issues across the lifespan, I found her depiction of the individual characters insightful and sympathetic."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith makes a literary comeback with On Beauty, an ode to EM Forster's Howard's End. Like her first novel, White Teeth, Smith examines the complex lives of two families - the Belseys and the Kipps - battling it out in the fictionalized college town of Wellington. Howard Belsey is a liberal Rembrandt scholar who is on the brink of tearing his family apart after having an affair with a fellow professor. His long suffering wife, the lovable Kiki, tries to keep together the sanity of her three children - Jerome, Zora and Levi. Howard's archrival is Monty Kipps, the ultraconservative Trinidadian academic who comes to Wellington with his sensitive wife, Carlene and their promiscuous offspring, Victoria. Beginning with the rumor that Victoria and Jerome are to wed, the novel is a perfect capsule of the red state/blue state battle in America. This book is the perfect comic relief for anyone still recovering from the 2004 and/or even the 2000 US Presidential election. Any reader can relate to at least one of the characters. Smith gives her readers her version of race, gender, class, art, psychology, religion, family and politics - 21st century style. Lovers of Smith's first book will continue to be proud of this young writer who is beyond her years. Like in real life all her characters have flaws and concerns that they come to terms with in the end. Smith is a remarkable voice in latest crop of new writers. Forster would be most proud."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Zadie Smith's ambitious first novel, WHITE TEETH, sent its young author into the stratosphere of literary culture, earning her rave reviews with critics and readers alike. Although her second novel, THE AUTOGRAPH MAN, received mixed reviews, Smith's intellect and creativity have firmly established her as an author to watch. Now, with her third novel, ON BEAUTY, Smith returns to her fine form as a gifted storyteller and astute cultural critic.ON BEAUTY focuses on two families that couldn't be more different. Howard Belsey is a white Englishman, an art historian on the verge of obscurity, teaching at Wellington, a fictional prestigious university in New England. His African-American wife, Kiki, is larger than life in more ways than one. A big woman with a taste for bright clothes and a passion for food, Kiki struggles to comprehend why Howard had an affair with a woman who appears to be Kiki's polar opposite. Their children --- Jerome, Zora and Levi --- are each brilliant in their own way, eager to define themselves apart from their parents and as part of some culture, whether religious, academic, or \\"street.\\"On the other side of the coin (and the pond) are the Kippses. Howard Belsey and Monty Kipps (a so-called public intellectual) have bickered via the pages of academic journals for years. Kipps, a black Englishman, has the fame and respect (and book deals) Howard has never achieved, even though his conservative politics couldn't be more removed from Howard's liberal sensitivities. When Howard's son Jerome, bitter over his father's infidelities and eager to explore evangelical Christianity, accepts an internship with Kipps and then carries on an ill-fated love affair with Kipps's daughter Victoria, a more personal connection between the two families arises, a connection that grows only stronger (to Howard's chagrin) when Kipps accepts a visiting professorship at Wellington. Forced into close proximity, Kiki Belsey begins a surprisingly intense friendship with Monty's sickly, stay-at-home wife Carlene.ON BEAUTY is a broad, sometimes messy novel, full of ideas and unafraid to tackle subjects both lofty and earthy. The novel's title is reminiscent of a scholarly treatise, and indeed, Smith does touch on aesthetic theories both directly --- in numerous discussions of Rembrandt paintings and in other contexts --- and indirectly. Her female characters are brilliant and accomplished but still loathe their own bodies. Her male characters argue articulately about politics and art but still remain in thrall to their own desires. The \\"mommy wars,\\" rap music, campus politics, love --- Smith tackles them all with her characteristic wisdom and humor. Along the way, she adroitly references pop culture high and low, including Alice in Wonderland, Outkast, and practically everything in between.Like Smith's earlier novels, ON BEAUTY is ambitious and bold in its storytelling. This time, Smith's book is a homage to E. M. Forster's masterpiece HOWARDS END. That is not to say that readers unfamiliar with Forster's novel can't enjoy ON BEAUTY; when read in tandem, though, Smith's novel gains even more richness, as it adds dimensions of race and gender to Forster's ideas about class and human connections.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"\\"On Beauty\\" constitutes Zadie Smith's most accomplished novel to date. Its focus is the Belsey family, comprising the devoted African-American matriarch, Kiki; the father, Howard - an emotionally detached English academic, and their three fiercely individual teenage children, inhabiting the affluent college town of Wellington in New England. Here, each character faces a challenge to their own morality and beliefs, and must come to terms with a redefining perception of the nature of true beauty and fulfilment, whilst endeavouring to preserve the cherished family unit. This is an honest look at domestic life: the impact of the cultural and political backdrop on these people, and their effect on each other - articulated with Smith's typical wit and elaborate metaphor. In short, an absolute joy to read."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This novel is the story of Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps, feminist matriarchs of the Belsey and Kipps families, of their feckless husbands, leftist agitator Howard and conservative Monty, and their very interesting children. Kiki, married to Howard for 30 years, is tested in the course of this novel by various ethical and moral concerns, just as the characters in Smith's model, E. M. Forster's *Howards End*, are tested. Carlene's gift to Kiki provides a delightfully witty moral center to the novel.The husbands, Howard Belsey and Monty Kipps, are locked in a battle of words and ideology over Rembrandt, each being an academic specialist in the field. Drama ensues when Monty comes to Wellington (a thinly disguised Ivy League university)from London as a visiting professor. Howard, an activist proponent of free speech, promptly sets out to prevent Monty from lecturing on removing \\"liberal\\" from \\"liberal arts.\\"The daft behaviour of the husbands is mirrored in the highly hilarious behaviours of their teenage and college age children. The privileged lives of the children are counterbalanced by that of Carl, whose fate is not surprising.*On Beauty*, a reflection on defining \\"beauty,\\" covers large terrains: geography of London and a small New England town near Boston; racial politics; generational conflicts; teenage angst; middle age angst; inheritances; wife-husband conflicts; gender politics; contemporary popular music; the sublime; the ridiculous; authority and challenges to authority; the importance of poetry in the world; the life of the mind. Smith's sensitive handling of the explosive topics she explores makes this novel a delight to read.Smith's writing style is very agreeable. She has an excellent ear for various types of speech and conveys the utterances of her characters with dispatch.Smith's satire is thoughtful, incisive, penetrating, and, ultimately, uplifting. Her comic genius, shown to great advantage in her novel, *White Teeth,* here again beguiles the reader. Even as one winces at some of the rightfully placed jabs that Smith offers, one still finds the book to be a real page-turner. Students, faculty, and non-academics alike are bound to enjoy this fictive universe, so similar to the real world of academe."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"This book is excellent. Well written, engaging and enthralling-- I couldn't put it down. Left me with many new perspectives."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"The ladies of my book club loved \\"On Beauty\\" and were amazed that the author who was born in 1975 was so able to get into the minds of characters in their 50s. She sets up two academic families, one in England and one in Massachusetts. The English family is black and conservative while the American one is mixed race and liberal. There is professional competition and hard feelings between the two patriarchs; and when the English professor comes to teach at his competitor's college, the men take opposing stands with regard to academic politics. In the small town environment their families also develop interesting relationships.The juxtaposition of liberal and conservative attitudes is interesting and I kept watching to see which the author was going to prefer. However, she revealed no bias and showed both liberals and conservatives as a mix of good and bad traits with a touch of hypocrisy and a little infidelity here and there."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"I have read the three Zadie Smith's novels, starting with the brilliant \\"White Teeth\\"; then the rather, to me, esoteric, but also well-crafted and well worth it, \\"Autograph Man.\\" \\"On Beauty\\" asks all the right questions about relationships, truth, beauty, in Zadie Smith's original inimitable style -- that her husband is a poet is so very fitting! That she is so young and so wise is a tribute to her keen intelligence."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"Sometimes I avoid novels with too much hype, and at the beginning this one had a little too much hype surrounding it for my taste. Ultimately, I was unable to reist the lure of it. I purchased the hardback, and I was quite engrossed in the tale. But I still don't understand the hype, and even worse, I didn't like ANY of the characters. None of them seemed realistic, likeable or relatable. Merely interesting. And at some point, my jaw just dropped and I was never able to pick it up again. Good story teller. Not scared of a tough topic. But, unfortunately, the book is not a great work of fiction. Just a good one."},{"Title":"On Beauty","review":"After hearing several people suggest that this was indeed a good book, I made the purchase. This certainly wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it is certainly very poorly written. As you read chapter after chapter, you are left wondering why exactly you are reading this book in the first place. I can't say I have ever read any other of Zadie Smith's works, but throughout the entire book, I couldn't help but feel like a 13-14 year old decided to write a book. You wanted to like the characters and find something interesting, but the book never delivers. I certainly regret making the purchase instead of borrowing the book from a friend or the library. If you are truly interested in reading this book, don't let me discourage you, but do not BUY the book."},{"Title":"Native American Identities: From Stereotype to Archetype in Art and Literature","review":"Scott Vicker's new book about the depiction of Native Americans in art and literature in a thorough and academically rigorous account, yet quite readable. The book helps one to understand how the depiction of Indians has been influenced by the economic and social needs of the dominant white culture, whether that be the dehumanizing of Indians to justify wiping out their cultures, or their romanticization to attract tourists to their lands and make money selling their art. Vickers also brings to attention several writers, for example Frank Waters, who have attempted to deeply understand the culture they are depicting and to create multidimensional characters that provide the reader with a window into the true lives of Native Americans. Seeing how the depiction of Indians has progressed toward a more authentic and self-expressed picture over the last 50 years provides some uplift to counteract the rather depressing story of the books first half. (This book sco! res an impressive 9.5 on the PC scale.) Overall, Vicker's book avoids excessive academic jargon and provides insight for people who are interested in literature and art that depicts Native American's, but may not have thought too deeply about how such depictions have been influenced by the paradigms of the time. The reader may occasionally feel frustrated when Vickers discusses artwork without reproducing it in his book, but this minor problem does little to mar an otherwise outstanding text."},{"Title":"Killigrew R.N.","review":"Having just finished reading the first book in the series, I eagerly look forward to the remainder. This novel pits our hero against some rather ruthless slavers, evil doer's in Africa, brigands and an odd assortment of pirates. Set during the Royal Navy's campaign against the slave trade between Africa and the Americas, the now steam-powered ships give chase and the action is plentiful. Some terrific battle sequences, a fair amount of narrow escapes, surprises abound and good dialog from an author with a flair for suspense and the haughty days of sail and steam. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Romans (Usborne Beginners)","review":"This is a great book for a student I have who is an English Language Learner in 6th grade and is studying ancient history. It is also great for younger readers with an interest in Rome."},{"Title":"Dealing with d4 Deviations: Fighting The Trompowsky, Torre, Blackmar-Diemer, Stonewall, Colle and Other Problem Openings (Everyman Chess)","review":"If you play chess, you'll have to face 1 d4 fairly often. And if you answer 1...Nf6, you may be walking right into a possible Trompowsky (2 Bg5), a Torre (2 Nf3 and 3 Bg5), a London (2 Nf3 and 3 Bf5), a Colle (2 Nf3 and 3 e3), a Veresov (2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5), or even a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (2 Nc3 d5 3 e4). Even if you play 1...d5, there are versions of all these systems that are still on. I guess one could play 1...f5 (the Dutch), but even then White can play 2 Bg5 or 2 Nf3 and 3 Bg5, or even 2 e4 or 2 g3 for that matter. At least, if you play 1...f5, you'll be able to answer 2 Nc3 with 2 ...Nf6, which might confuse a Veresov player, since 1 d4 d5 2 Nc3 f5 3 Bf4 is ghastly for Black.Still, most of us will need to find a way to defend against unusual lines after 1 d4 Nf6 or 1 d4 d5. And that is where this book comes in handy. Cox explains how to get back to the lines you wanted or to get a good game against these \\"problem openings.\\"After 1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5, White is clearly hoping to take your Knight and double your pawns. Or, after 2...Ne4 3 Bf4 d5 4 f3 Nf6 5 e4 get a Blackmar-Diemer gambit with an extra tempo. So Cox recommends 2...e6 here, and he gives us some good lines for Black. White can also play 1 d4 d5 2 Bg5, but that's not really the Tromp, and the author shows how Black can do well after 2...h6 3 Bh4 c6.In the Torre attack, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3, Cox does show how to play 2...e6 for Black. But he strongly recommends 2...d5 3 Bg5 Ne4, and I certainly agree. Of course, you will have to be able to defend a Queen's Gambit after 3 c4. The same is true for the London and the Colle. After 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nf3, Cox explains how to play 2...e6, but recommends 2...d5 3 Bf4 c5 and 2...d5 3 e3 Bf5.The Veresov goes 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5, and Cox recommends the exciting 3...c5, which means letting White play a Chigorin with a move in hand. I like this line for Black and I think it is worth learning.Many folks accept the Blackmar-Diemer gambit. But Cox gives us an Awful Warning about what can happen. A Master with Black tried 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 e4 dxe4 4 f3 exf3 5 Nxf3 e6 6 Bg5 Be7 7 Bd3 Nbd7 8 0-0 0-0 9 Qe1 c5 10 Qh4 g6 (Black is already totally ripped) 11 Ne5 Re8 12 Nxf7 Qc7 13 Bxg6 hxg6 14 Qh8+ Kxf7 15 Qh7+ Kf8 16 Bh6 mate. So Cox very reasonably recommends 3...Nxe4 here (the Hubsch Defence), in order to answer 4 Nxe4 dxe4 5 f3? with 5...e5. And after 1 d4 d5 2 e4 dxe4 3 Nc3, he wants 3...e5.The next unusual lines we see are 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 c5 without 4 d5. Cox shows how Black can still play some form of a Benoni or Nimzo-Indian against 4 g3 or 4 Nc3 here. But that leaves 4 e3 as a problem. Black can play a Caro-Kann and defend against a Panov-Botvinnik attack with 4...cxd4. But Black may not want to be on what I would consider the wrong side of an isolated Queen pawn attack, so Cox recommends 4...a6 and 5...d5 (threatening dxc4).The book concludes with some rare lines. 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Bg5 tries to avoid the Nimzo, but Cox explains that 3...c5 works well for Black here, as do 3...d5 and even the move that White was trying to avoid, 3...Bb4+ (although White will indeed play 4 Nd2 rather than 4 Nc3). 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3 aims at a Catalan after 3...d5, but Cox shows that Black can avoid this with 3...b5. 1 d4 Nf6 2 e3 is met by 2...c5. And finally, 1 d4 Nf6 2 g3 d5 leads to a very good version of the Slav for Black.This is a useful and well-written book, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Dealing with d4 Deviations: Fighting The Trompowsky, Torre, Blackmar-Diemer, Stonewall, Colle and Other Problem Openings (Everyman Chess)","review":"It appears as if the people who have reviewed this book on Amazon glanced at a few lines and wrote a great review of it. After taking the time to go through every chapter of this book, writing down the lines and analyzing with friends (2000+ rated) or Fritz, the book comes up far short.From the get go, the reader should be a little worried. You get through the first two pages of the Trompowsky when all of a sudden a game is not only mis-cited, but also missing a move from white and from black. It's the first chapter, first recommended line (did anyone here READ the variations?) and already the editing is shoddy. Although I went into Chessbase and dredged the game up, clearly the editor should have caught that. This is a repeated pattern throughout the book.Nitpicking aside, what about the content? Are the recommended lines good? Against the Trompowsky, Cox does a solid job covering how black should play. Unfortunately, it's not one of the books that shows the reader full games (which is useful, since many times endgames in the London, Colle, etc. are very intricate). For the Blackmar-Diemer, the clever counter-gambit is very cool and I've found it's pretty successful. However, after analyzing it for a few hours with some friends, numerous errors and missed moves crop up. Of course there are some lines that have been unplayed, but if Fritz gives a clear +.25 over all the other lines, the author's doing something wrong.Another problem I encountered is that many times the text is in the wrong place. I have quite a few malicious feelings toward the London and Colle (and Cox offers some witty banter on all the openings as well), but at times the introduction to the chapters are TOO full of the Cox's commentary. There is a de-emphasis on the actual lines and little explication of important move sequences where there should be.It gets two stars because it gives good lines against the Trompowsky, London (though there are lots of holes the reader needs to work out for themselves), and I suppose the Torre. However, the book is simply too small and too thin to be as meaningful as it should be. The editing significantly detracts from its readibility and many times at the end of variations the reader is left wondering \\"have I really equalized?\\" as well as \\"what do I do now?\\"It's a great idea, but if you're looking for a book to cover that hole in chess literature, perhaps it's better worth your money to just buy a book on the Colle or London."},{"Title":"Dealing with d4 Deviations: Fighting The Trompowsky, Torre, Blackmar-Diemer, Stonewall, Colle and Other Problem Openings (Everyman Chess)","review":"For MANY years, I played (as Black) 1.d4 Nf6, and went confidently into the mass of theory that was the King's Indian Defense, fearlessly fianchettoing my KB and salivating at White's king, fantasizing about the upcoming regicide about to hit White. Even if I lost, I looked forward to a full-blooded battle. Then came a move other than 2.c4, and I started to roll my eyes. White played something I considered \\"lame\\" - for example, the Colle System. I ended up losing more games than I should have, and it took me way too long to realize that I could easily handle the full-blooded battles, but when White didn't want to give me what I wanted, I would lose my attention, fall asleep, and give the game to White.I finally decided that I needed to play something less committal (on my part), and after toying with the Budapest Defense (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5), the Benoni, and the Queen's Gambit, I came to the scheme of 1...e6, followed by the Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, or Queen's Indian. I played ...e6 first because I'm a die-hard French Defense addict, and I wanted to give White one last chance to right the wrong he committed by playing 1.d4.While these are less critical lines, and I haven't won as many games with them as I did with the King's Indian, I haven't lost as many either, and I find myself in the game for a much longer period of time than I did when I fianchettoed my KB. But there was an amazing dearth of good books on the annoying sidelines that John Cox covers in this book. Here, he gives coherent, understandable schemes to combat these \\"mosquito openings\\" as I call them, these openings that are more annoying than fear-inspiring. Cox writes very well, covering the major sidelines such as the London, the Torre, the Tromp (which was the reason I converted from the King's Indian to the ...e6 stuff), the Colle, and the Veresov (which I haven't ever faced). Cox covers these lines with a respectable system, the basics of which are easy to understand, but doesn't form one of those \\"systems against everything\\". His coverage, of, for example, the London System, is MUCH better than that of the \\"Winning With the London System\\" book I reviewed elsewhere. Basically, his system consists of ...e6, ...Nf6, and ...c5 or ...d5. He realistically approaches these lines for Black as not likely to put the White openings out of business, but at least allow Black to get through the opening and into the middlegame.I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dealing with d4 Deviations: Fighting The Trompowsky, Torre, Blackmar-Diemer, Stonewall, Colle and Other Problem Openings (Everyman Chess)","review":"This has been one of the best opening books for me. I've books about the opening which are discussed in this book, and here you finally get to see the good lines for black. In books about these d4 deviations you usually only see the bad lines for black and the best ones hidden to make the openings look good. In al the lines John gives black is playing simply the kind of positions the white player doesn't want and usually in the end you get a = position or even =+. The recommended line against the trompovsky for example was very usefull for me 2..e6! after that you get good positons and avoid a lot of white's preparation."},{"Title":"Dealing with d4 Deviations: Fighting The Trompowsky, Torre, Blackmar-Diemer, Stonewall, Colle and Other Problem Openings (Everyman Chess)","review":"This book offers many lines on dealing with an opponents Queen pawn openings.

Even lines vs the what was called Old Catalan (1.d4 2.Nf3 3.g3)are givenIn the Colle he gives the QID which is what Rudel gives in his books as the best defense vs the Colle.

Also gives the impression that, has a entire chapter talking about the Stonewall, however if you see the content page, there is no chapter about Stonewall, it just only a part of the Rare Lines chapter. I've started to look for some lines against Stonewall, and only it has a very small portion about some stonewall formation (p 137) and only have one game talking about stonewall.

Much of the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is from the perspective of someone else recounting Mike Frost's story, and it comes across a little shallow. But the book suffers from more than just poor writing - their is also a stream of hypocrisy running all the way through it. Essentially, Mike Frost says that he chose to be a spy and had no issue with spying on Russians, or any other \\"bad\\" country. He then goes on to say that he was very uncomfortable spying on Canadians, but did it anyway. At no point does he ever point out that he could have walked away.Over all, the book has quite a lot of interesting information about Canada's involvement in cold war spying. Unfortunately, the book sounds so whiny that you're never sure exactly what is true."},{"Title":"Spyworld","review":"The jealousy and immature opinions from some of our northern cousins never fails to amaze me.

I have a tiny bit of programming experience in things like BASIC back when they had line numbers and such. I tried reading it. By the time I got halfway through the first page, my head was spinning from the casual use of terminology that I didn't understand.

Savitch goes comprehensively through the core classes that come with the standard Java distribution. Also, he uses Java 5, which is the latest major release of Java. If you are going to start learning Java, you might as well start here, instead of using a text that deals with earlier versions.It turns out that Java 5 also gives notational simplifications, which may help the new programmer. For example, suppose we have \\"int i\\" and \\"Integer x\\". In earlier versions of Java, you would have had to write \\"i=x.intValue()\\" to assign from x to i, or \\"x=new Integer(i)\\" to assign from i to x. Experienced Java programmers will shrug and say, \\"so what?\\". But they don't need this book anyway. For a beginner, some of the earlier Java notation or formalism can be bulky. But now in Java 5, you can just say \\"i=x\\" or \\"x=i\\" and the JVM makes the appropriate conversions internally. So long as you understand this, the new notation is better. It makes the code more concise and readable. Which even for experienced programmers should be desirable. Easier to understand and debug.It should be said that Savitch goes much further into other aspects and improvements in Java 5. Without gainsaying his efforts, I think the above is the most understandable thing to appreciate about Java 5.Another positive aspect of the book is the plethora of worked out examples and problems in each chapter. For the latter, answers are also furnished at the ends of the chapters. But if you want the most out of this book, retain enough self discipline to devote serious effort to the problems before checking the answers.Savitch also brings up the topic of patterns. It reflects a roughly 10 year old realisation in computing about the importance of this to robust and rapid coding. And it also aids in the efficient communication of solutions between programmers. Seeing it migrate to a beginner's book like this is a good sign. If you can learn just the overall concept of a pattern, as well as several specific and important patterns given in the text, then you get off to a good start in programming. In any language.Sure, when you don't even know the syntax of Java, patterns can seem a little abstract. Just like interfaces. But when you get around to writing thousands of lines of source code, or having to maintain or extend such code bodies, then patterns and interfaces really show their utility.Note in passing that the book is not really an algorithms text. The most involved it gets in this aspect is a brief discusssion of sorting methods. If you're after algorithms implemented in Java, try elsewhere."},{"Title":"Absolute Java with Student Resource Disk (2nd Edition)","review":"It is BY FAR the best book on programming that I have read.

I can go through a chapter in a couple of hours, this semester I've gone through a thousand pages in this book, but it doesn't feel like I spent more effort on this course than others, I have learned so much from it.Also, if you want to skip ahead, he will tell you what sections you need to know before beginning a chapter, so you can hit some relevant topic without reading every chapter prior to it.Effective use of formatting and white space, clear headings that really help to find and organize the information, chapters are nice and manageable. Important parts of the code examples are highlighted so that you don't have to read the entire piece of code to get the relevant information, but if you want to see how the piece fits into a working program, the entire code is there to be referenced.

Deitel starts out with graphics, assuming the student will graps Java better but Deitel introduces some rather major concepts when doing this and I don't think the students would appreciate the complex ideas without using Savitch step by step methodologies. Deitel assumes a student undestands the concept of \\"extends\\", \\"implements\\" etc and this is exactly what graphics class uses and Deitel assumes students will understand these concepts just because they are graphical in nature. Savithc covers these concepts later when other major concepts are covered so that a student will appreciate the \\"extends\\" concepts much better.So Savitch and Deitel cover the same material, but in different sequences. And I believe that Savitch's approach works better and helps the student understand the more difficult concepts later in the textbook.gerard sagliocca,gerard_sagliocca@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Absolute Java with Student Resource Disk (2nd Edition)","review":"I don't understand all the good ratings at all.

When you twist it twice, which is step 2, you get horned and hairy. Then step 3: You twist the ring three times, but no person has dared.In this book a kid named Russell is going to a Halloween party and he needed the perfect costume for it. I can make a text to world connection by saying every one had to go to get a costume. So he went all around town looking for the perfect costume but no store had one. So he went to the magic store and the clerk gave him a box with a ring in it and it was the monsters ring.I personally think that the ring made him a horrible person and as the story went so did his attitude.

As usual we have a magic item that may or may not help a middle school kid with his or her problem. Here, the problem is bullying, and while lots of book address that problem, they do so with wildly varying degrees of success. This one takes a turn toward standing up for yourself, which is OK by me. Again as in all of the Magic Shop books there are other issues as well - babying by Mom, poor communication with Dad, not paying attention to instructions and warnings. This all sounds pretty preachy, but it isn't. It just acknowledges that from the point of view of middle school drama, these are the kinds of things that come up.The hero is believable and sympathetic. There are some funny bits with secondary characters. All in all a quick but satisfying read with some excitement, some mild instruction, and a sense of humor.

Actually, it isn't so much genuine world peace that the good doctor is interested in, but rather a state that is more conducive to the eventual takeover by his Si-Fan organization. While the book does seem to make the case that Nazi and Fascist dictators are preferable to the \\"yellow menace\\" as represented by the Manchu man, it still shows those men to be overbearing, arrogant and ripe for being brought down. The book is certainly racist (to a degree, all the other entries in the series are, too), as the reviewers below mention, but at the same time it does make a plea for peace and sanity in the year before WW2 broke out...and that's not too bad a message for any novel.In this book we have a new narrator, the journalist Bart Kerrigan, who joins Nayland Smith on his seemingly endless quest to foil the Doctor's plans. The action hops around quite a bit in this installment, from Essex and Suffolk to London, from Venice back to London, and finally off to (not so) gay Paree. The action is fairly relentless, the book's real saving grace. What with Green Deaths, a run-in with the Doctor on the Essex marshes, brainwashing via television, a new kind of superrifle, the Ericksen disintegration tube, torture chambers under creepy Venetian palazzos, a yacht trap on the Adriatic, killer pygmies and on and on, this book really keeps the reader glued to the page. One of our old friends from previous volumes makes a return in this book, and it's a real stunner when this character does reappear. So despite the racist elements, the book entertains.I did, however, have more serious problems with the book than just the racial comments. There are numerous inconsistencies with previous entries that just bug the bejeebers out of me. For example, in one scene of this volume, Fu Manchu refers to \\"the Seven Gates,\\" a grisly rat torture used on Nayland Smith in book 2, \\"The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu.\\" But in that earlier volume, it was called \\"the Six Gates.\\" Grrrrr. In the current book, Smith is referred to as a \\"deep, silent sleeper,\\" while in the previous book, #8 (\\"President Fu Manchu\\"), he is referred to as a light, \\"hair trigger\\" sleeper. Huh?!?!? Fey, Smith's manservant, in previous volumes, has had a rather normal pattern of speech. In this volume, his speech is telegraphic and robotlike all of a sudden. What!?!?!? These kinds of inconsistencies can and do drive alert readers bonkers. But the worst thing of all in this book is when Smith tells someone that a description of a Japanese suspect is not necessary, as all descriptions of his \\"countrymen sound identical.\\" Jeeeeezzzzz!!!!! Get past these groaners, though, and you'll have a fun time. I did."},{"Title":"THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU","review":"Europe ~ 1939. As the fragrance of the deadly hawthorn wafts through the night air, sinister drums beat in the distance and herald the dreadful Green Death. The Si Fan and the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu murder military and political leaders who threaten world peace. Although it appears that Fu Manchu has switched to the side of the angels, Nayland Smith doesn't buy it. In his nervous and high strung way, Smith runs around trying to prevent the death of war mongers. In the process, he tries to determine what the heck Fu Manchu is up to now.This entry in the classic mystery-adventure series is good lightweight reading. We aren't speaking of great literature, but as a pulp novel, it serves the purpose for young adult readers (and those who remain young adult at heart). Typical of Sax Rohmer, there is a lot of running around and narrow escapes. Cryptic characters abound. The evil doctor stays one step ahead of his pursuers. Nayland Smith and Bart Kerrigan do what they can to frustrate Fu Manchu's fiendish purpose. Back and forth it goes. There are less of the typical \\"yellow peril\\" overtones of the earlier books in the series to trouble modern readers. To borrow a phrase from Sherlock Holmes, \\"The game's afoot!\\" Enjoy the fun. ;-)"},{"Title":"THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU","review":"THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU sees Sax Rohmer bringing Fu Manchu into play in the months leading up to World War II. Originally published in 1939, the book returns to the classic FU MANCHU format with narrator/hero Bart Kerrigan (a worthy successor to Dr. Petrie, Shan Greville, and Alan Sterling) teaming with Nayland Smith to prevent Fu Manchu from assassinating fascist dictators from Germany and Italy (the names have been changed to protect the guilty). A marked change from the paranoiac American presidential campaign documented in PRESIDENT FU MANCHU (which inspired THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE). Long-time fans will thrill to Rohmer's patented breakneck pace, sharp characterizations, and brisk dialogue. Highly recommended to mystery fans and adventure-lovers alike. A word of warning--the book ends abruptly paving the way for 1941's THE ISLAND OF FU MANCHU."},{"Title":"THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU","review":"A historical oddity as well as a very bad and very racist book. In this entry in the popular series, written in the late 1930's, Nayland Smith rescues thinly disguised versions of Hitler and Mussolini from the evil &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, Fu Manchu. His only reason seems to be that, well, they may not be our sort of people, but they are white, dash it all.I wish I could have read Mr. Rohmer's mail over the next few years, after WWII started!

This book is a FANTASTIC steam table resource. It practically eliminates the need for interpolation as it moves in 1 degree or 1 psia increments for the \\"standard\\" range, it's not until you get well outside of typical conditions that this book even begins to move into increments of 5 degrees or 5 psia (impressive considering all of this data was collected before the computer!).If you buy a used one, there is a pocket in the back for a very large Mollier diagram, double-check to make sure that chart is included and in good shape.If you're looking for a steam table book - this is a great book to use and I would recommend putting it on your bookshelf! The only caveat to be aware of is if that this book is exclusively in inch-pound units (farenheit, psia, btu, etc), so if you need SI units - you will need to convert these units, or you may need another SI book or chart from the Internet as a second resource."},{"Title":"Thermodynamic Properties of Steam Including Data for the Liquid and Solid Phases","review":"This is a very comprehensive steam table, with very small temperature and pressure increments that make interpolation very easy and accurate."},{"Title":"Thermodynamic Properties of Steam Including Data for the Liquid and Solid Phases","review":"This book is loaded with good thermo data.

The narrator is certainly not a hero and does not judge what his happening around him.I also found the book very good in being able to paint a picture of daily life, at the collective and individual level, in the period where the book is set."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"Gao Xingjian's second novel, \\"One Man's Bible\\" contains partially autobiographical life story of a Chinese writer, who tries to find his own place, peace of mind and right to writing and publishing in the Communist China.The writer, living in permanent exile from China, goes to Hong Kong to attend a premiere of one of his theater plays. There, he meets Margarethe, one of the women who had an impact on his life. Margarethe, a German Jew, who stayed in Germant despite many doubts and reservations, is enquiring about the writer's past and this triggers and avalanche of memories. In fact, it is not a novel compositional trick, but because of Gao's dream-like style, similar to \\"The Soul Mountain\\", it seems still fresh and original here.The chapters, which describe the Chinese past of the main character during the Cultural Revolution are separated by the ones closer to the present. The difference is stressed by the changes in narration between second and third person.Among enemies and friends, career wolves and people desperately trying to preserve their individuality and self-respect, the young writer tries to figure out his own place, which requires a lot of time and effort, many schemes and being always a step ahead of the others. To write and publish in the capital, one must escape the Party purges, must have a job, a right to lodging in a tiny room in the communal apartment, an impeccable past and a perspective of a career within the Party.Initially, the protagonist manages quite well. He becomes a leader of young rebels in yet another uprising, labeling the former previous party officials as \\"The Snake Spirits\\" (name given to all enemies of the system). He is also a lover of one of the Party leader's wife. Thanks to her warning (apparently the proofs of his disloyalty have been found (in the form of the information that in the remote past, just after the war with Japan, his father was in the illegal possession of weapons), the writer finally realizes that he will never be able to find for himself a safe place in the communist structures, allowing him creative freedom. Only then he decides to escape, initially hiding n the far away, mountain village, under the pretenses of rehabilitation through physical labor. After a long period of creative hibernation and waiting, he manages to leave China and stay abroad permanently, getting the status of the political refugee.This seemingly realistic plot is spiked with the descriptions of events from emigrant times, the weird dreams pestering the protagonist and the masterful portraits of people who he met in China (the whole gallery of human types, from small cheaters, through people using their professional positions to the good and bad purpose, to intellectuals broken by the system) and outside (especially interesting are the female characters - already mentioned Margarethe and Sylvie, a person whose personal experience separates her like a chasm from the protagonist; it is interesting to notice, how her character is the opposite to the writer's). Various motivations and life attitudes are shown very clearly and convincingly, so that the reader can rest assured, that in each regime everyone has their own free will and our life choices depend on our will only.The parallels to Gao's life come to mind automatically during reading. The protagonist is not from the working class (his father, like Gao's, works in a bank), he is educated, writes and then destroys his writings, afraid that they can be discovered and used against him (Gao had burned all his manuscripts before leaving China), during his years in exile he cannot visit China... It is hard not to wonder whether \\"One Man's Bible\\" is a kind of the catharsis, as the writer is shown as a person who to reach his goal - to write and publish - does not hesitate to become an opportunist. Although he is trying to live in agreement with his conscience, he makes mistakes, which he later regrets and which affect other people's lives. If Gao writes here about himself, he definitely does not try to excuse his actions or to show himself in the best light...The autobiographical style makes \\"One Man's Bible\\" less contemplative and looking more like a \\"traditional\\" novel than \\"The Soul Mountain\\", but here again comes back the motif of integration with the rural people and respect for the antique Chinese traditions - for example, the scene of conversation with the old doctor and description of his handbook are beautiful).This novel is worth recommendation, especially, because the access to the Chinese writers who describe the country's reality well and at the same time their books present the high level of artistic achievement, is limited, and Gao's works are banned in China (apparently, they are available on the black market, but not published officially), therefore it is very likely that they contain accurate observations (like the Polish, Soviet or other emigrant writers, to which I can relate)."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"This is a semi-autobiographical novel by the noted Chinese author Gao Xingjian, winner of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is an account of the trials and travails of an intellectual caught in the vicious and deadly turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, a particularly brutal period in the history of Communist China which lasted from 1966 to 1976 and saw many people relocated, killed, or starved for no good reason. It is fascinating and awful to read about how people turned on each other in order to survive during this period. The protagonist does the same, manages to outwit each threat, and eventually flees China. The book is well written and compelling, but in my opinion too long, with too many episodes not germane to the main theme. For example, the author describes an aborted affair with a young woman who had a scar on her breast. This scar inhibited him from having intercourse with her, and later she returns and reproaches him for his cowardice. The significance of the scar is never explained, and the relevance of the whole episode to the remainder of the book is tenuous at best. There are a number of similar episodes which could have been left out without the book suffering as a result. Moreover, there are a number of long stream of conciousness chapters which become repetitive, rehashing as they do the insecurities and uncertainties of the protagonist. However, I would nonetheless highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the modern history of China, especially during the Cultural Revolution."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"I read and loved &quot;Soul Mountain.&quot; I've lived five years in China myself, and I found the work extrememly moving and meaningful. It's maybe my favorite book. It defies description.This book, &quot;One Man's Bible,&quot; however, does not defy description. It is a vanity piece by someone who wrote the book that won the Nobel Prize for literature. Like, it seems, many others, it took me quite a while to get through it.Interesting in places, but that's the best it does."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"Chinese Literature should have taken great pride in having finally won its first Nobel Prize last year. However, instead of applauding, Chinese writers (both in and out of China) were at first shocked when the winner was announced, then hurried to get the only two novels by Gao Xingjian, which the Taiwan publisher rushed to reprint after initial print runs failed to inspire the public's imagination.Reading the two novels, Soul Mountain and One Man's Bible, which the Swedish Academy highly praised and principally based their award on, turned out to be not only a disappointing but also an insulting experience. Soul Mountain is by no means a novel, let alone a good one.I have read the reviews in both the English and Chinese media and found that no one has given a clear brief of the book. Nobody really can. For it is a horrendously heaped hodgepodge of travel notes combing chaotic choreography, superficial legends, sinister folklore, fragmentary historical events, random thoughts, hazy memories, artificial feelings, scrappy jottings, ethnic customs, fake fables, folk songs, parodies of ancient Chinese novels, trivial and totally irrelevant encounters, shallow political and literary comments, pseudo-philosophical accounts, and erotic fanatics with monotonous female characters.One has to admit that it is shrewd to use a modernist-like narrative that instead of giving names to the characters, uses \\"I,\\" \\"you,\\" \\"she\\" and \\"he.\\"In this largely autobiographical book, \\"\`I' travel in the real world,\\" Gao explained in the book and in a lecture at Stockholm University in 1991. \\"\`You' are an imagined \`I' who wanders in a fantasized spiritual world, \`She,' then is the derivative of the lonely You,\\" he said.\\"The dissolution of \`She' caused the alienation of \`I,'\\" the author enigmatically rigmaroled in the lecture, \\"then emerges \`He.'\\"\\"All this is better understood when not closely examined,\\" wrote Richard Eder in a review in The New York Times. He is right, because neither Gao's eloquent lecture nor his characters can withstand any close examination.Occasionally (in two chapters toward the end), when the author becomes too eager to make comments about himself, his work or some phony philosophical thoughts, he finds it sounds awkward to use \\"I\\" or \\"You\\" as narrator, so he shifts to \\"He.\\"After closing this 500-plus-page bogus book, one is guaranteed to remember no characters, no storyline, no details and no beautiful prose. And forget about the stream of consciousness one might expect from a modernist novel, for the book is almost entirely devoid of psychological probes. To sum it up, one will not grab anything at all from reading the book and will become more baffled than ever about anything Chinese. Readers will not feel in the least the philosophical approach Gao explained in his lectures and his English translator parroted in the introduction, that Soul Mountain is about an individual's struggle between resisting collective forces and longing for community warmth.I can almost see how desperately some reviewers tried to find something philosophical, something beautiful or something quotable in the book, so they would be able to lift the Nobel-winning book up to a certain level. Unfortunately, finding nothing by the end, some went with the English translator's introduction.So far, the translator, Mabel Lee, has taken most of the blame for the book's coarseness and obscurity. This writer certainly has no intention of glorifying Lee's translation, for mistakes and inaccuracies could easily be picked here and there throughout the book (well, if the whole book is nonsense, why can't a translator add a little more?). What must be pointed out is that Gao's original is as dreadful as the English translation, if not worse. Grammatical blunders and misused characters can be easily found throughout the Chinese text. Who said Gao is a Chinese language master? Only the Swedish Academy, certainly nobody Chinese. It would invite ridicule for any Chinese person to praise Gao. The language, as well as the content, in his second novel, One Man's Bible, was reduced to such a level that many Chinese writers can find no other word but \\"trash\\" to describe it.The fact that Gao's books were consigned to oblivion immediately after they were released to bookstores in Taiwan (before their author won the Nobel) was not because they were too avant-garde for the general reading public to understand, but because of their awful quality. The adulation around him now is for his crown and political purpose only.Nothing better describes what Soul Mountain is than Hans Andersen's fairy tale The Emperor's New Clothes. This writer simply has to say out loud that the \\"Chinese emperor\\" is indeed naked!I certainly have not read all Nobel laureates&iexcl; works, but I believe there could be no greater scandal than this one in the Nobel literature prize's history. With the generous intention of honoring Chinese writers, the Swedish Academy has instead played a big joke on international society and Chinese people everywhere. I have no doubt that the Nobel committee will bitterly regret their blunder before they begin trying to select the next winner.

I've only finished half the book and someday, if I ever run out of things to read, I may pick it up and finish it."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"This is a fantastic autobiographical novel about the author's experiences under Mao's China and how it affected him and others. The subject matter itself is enough to reccomend this book because we rarely get insights into this closed world and must strive to understand it as it emerges as a world economic power.The author uses an interesting techinque of detachment where the main character is also the narrator who speeks most often in the third person. Irme Kertesz in his novel \\"fatelessness\\" beautifully dscribes how people can survive even the worst suffering, such as the holocaust, by detachment of soul from body. In \\"Fatelessness\\", the protagonist survives the concentration camps by escaping outside himself and comes to not only view his suffering and surroundings in the third person but becomes so detached that the physical pain, wounds, illness and suffering of his own body are described and experienced as a thiid person. This mode of escape was subconcious and persisted after the war, leaving a permanent scar of detachment that leaves the reader wondering how the protagonist will relate in peacetime.Gao has evidently experienced a similar form of coping mechanism that is evident in the sections of the novel that take place in the present, during his expatriat years. It becomes manifest by his casual serial sexual encounters with women who also have similar problems of forming lasting bonds and attachments because of trauma (rape etc). Gao's inability to form a lasting personal bond extends to his lack of attachment to China, his people and his new home, career and friends. Though his insights are [rofound, Gao's emotions and actions are superficial and dream-like.The most brilliant technique is his use of the word \\"you.\\" The detached narrator (Gao)uses this word to refer to the subject (Gao)as if he is writing for and talking to himself. I have only seen this technique used in Gao's other novel translated into English \\"Soul Moutain.\\" Later in the novel, when describing the past he uses \\"him\\" to describe the subject \\"Gao\\" living in Mao's China. The Narrator uses \\"you\\" to refer to the Gao in the present, expatriat state.The use of \\"you\\" and \\"him\\" has a multilevel effect on the text and the reader. \\"Him\\" Gao of the past becomes \\"You\\" Gao of the present - a different level of detachment. \\"Him\\" Gao is the Gao of the present describing the Gao of the past as if from a distance, as if that person no longer exists and is dead or lost. The \\"You\\" Gao is more familiar, closer, intimate yet detached, a different, mature Gao of the present who is having these relationships, having his plays performed and struggling with the present novel and his past. If a man is the sum of his experiences we are left still wondering who the real Gao is and if he knows himself. It is as much a discovery of Mao's oppressive China as an effort of self descovery -- both painful.The other effect of the use of \\"You\\" used by the narrator to describe Gao in the present is the author subtly drawing in the reader, to place him or herself in Gao's place, to become Gao. \\"You\\" also refers to the reader. We are invited to become Gao in our imagination as we read the text. The simplicity of one word creating so many layers of meaning and effect on the text and reader is on par with Jose Saramago's penchant for a lack of puntuation in many of his works.This book is indeed something special, ingenious, and genuine. You may walk away haunted and disoriented, angry, frustrated, helpless and questioning your security. But as Gao makes clear at the begining, the experience of a Chinese mind under Mao can only be compared to the Holocaust under Hitler. Here East and West share a commonality of humanity at its best and worst, a common suffering and experience and a place to begin a dialog of understanding. Evil takes on many forms but it's effects on the human soul are universal."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"To this day, the bizarre, cult-like events of the Cultural Revolution remain a prime focal point for Chinese novelists and, especially, memoirists. Writers from Adeline Yen-Mah, Jung Chang, Jan Wong, and Anchee Min to Yu Hua, Mo Yan, Dai Sijie, and Yan Geling have plumbed the depths of political capriciousness, human debasement, and the sheer will to survive in their own lives or in those of their fictional characters. Yet few if any Chinese writers have dared examine the effects of the Cultural Revolution on their later, post-Tiananmen Square massacre (1989) lives. Gao Xingjian's semi-autobiographical novel, ONE MAN'S BIBLE, is the first I have encountered, and the results are hauntingly devastating.The story opens in a Hong Kong hotel in 1996 with the unnamed Chinese narrator (an internationally successful playwright) and his temporary paramour, a white Jewish woman of German descent named Margarethe. Theirs is an affair of mutual convenience and simple animal lust, but it is also a continuation of two largely hopeless searches for human closeness and warmth even as both characters deny that they seek such a thing. Margarethe works insistently to draw out the narrator's past, asking him to tell his life's story and suggesting that he turn it into a book. The narrator for his part insists that such a thing is not possible, that \\"things in China can not be explained by language alone,\\" yet the book of his life unfolds before us in chapters that alternate (for the first half of the book) between his present-day encounter with Margarethe and his autobiography.What emerges from this approach is a haunting tale of a rational, intelligent man trying desperately to cope with the utter irrationality of the Cultural Revolution. At first a nonpolitical citizen of Beijing, the narrator decides that he can best survive by becoming a faction leader. Having established his revolutionary bona fides, he then lays low and chooses his moves carefully, ultimately realizing that his next move is to the countryside, to keep his head down as a peasant farmer and teacher for perhaps the rest of his life. To maintain his sanity, he secretly writes about his feelings and experiences, keeping his papers well-hidden from nosy neighbors. Over time, he discovers that survival under Mao requires repeated acts of selfishness and disregard for the feelings of others, particularly the women who pass through his life, offering sexual temptation coupled with the threat of personal ruin. Ultimately, Margarethe returns to Europe and disappears from the alternating scenes, leaving Gao to examine ever more intensely his own past, his failings and regrets and lost relationships. He never shares with us the manner in which he \\"escapes\\" from China, partly because it doesn't really matter and partly because, in a psychological sense, he will never escape.By using the alternating chapters, the author establishes a clear divide between history and the present while simultaneously illustrating how that history impinges on the narrator's current life. Gao takes this structure even further by bifurcating the narrator himself, referring to his present-day self in the second person (you) and to his pre-escape self in the third person (he). Yet they are clearly just variations of the same person; the narrator's past is an inescapable part of his present. He is scarred for life by the Cultural Revolution, and the lonely, distant, untrusting person he has become is a direct reflection of the persona he was forced to adopt in order to survive those times. He has learned to be a soulless user of others, and little else.This is a dark and haunting examination of life and survival during the unimaginable events of the Cultural Revolution and its aftermath. Timed and placed in 1996 Hong Kong just before the British turnover over that island to the Communist government in Beijing, it is also a fascinating metaphorical contemplation of modern China, a nation of soulless users lusting after money the same way his narrator lusts after women. Gao Xingjian emerged from relative obscurity (at least outside of China) to become his country's surprise first Nobel Prize winner for Literature. In ONE MAN'S BIBLE, Western readers can get a sense of why he was chosen. Deservedly so, it would seem."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"I just finished reading One Man's Bible and loved it!It is the story of a chinese man - a writer. Throughout his story, told by jumping to the past and back to the present, Xingjian narrates what life was like in China after Mao's Cultural Revolution and how the changes the country went through affect the lives of people.The narrator, who refers to the main character only in third and second person, conveys the loneliness of men through these times. Despite the changes in government during Mao's time, the constant is that everyone was to be deemed an enemy, there was no one to turn to (think 1984 without the futuristic stuff), when there was always some reason to punish people.The subsequent depersonalization that creeped into people's lives when they were not allowed to think by themselves, translated into a mechanical 'blending in' for survival, the loss of freedom in every aspect of life, and the harsh struggle to recover his individuality after all has passed, make for a great novel.A word of advice: keep track of the character's names in a notebook and try to read something on Chinese history before delving in. It will make it easier to follow."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"One Man's Bible is a profound meditation on the excruciating effects of sordid political oppression on human spirit. The sobriety of writing bespeaks a dignity, which is an awareness of existence, and it is in this existence that the power of the frail individual lies. In a laudably detached voice, Gao Xinjian stipples a vivid picture of human frailty, repression and suffering under the totalitarian regime that exists only in memory, like a hidden spring of spring gushing forth a deluge of feelings that are difficult to articulate.The book, unlike many of the contemporaries that expose austerity of life under Red Horror, is shockingly realistic and yet not a tale of suffering, at least that is not what Gao intends it to be. The delineation is so genuine and faithful to the reckless truth and excruciatingly painful purging that only men in Gao's generation can identify with. The reality is almost too heartrending to bear, even in words: the acrimonious politics, the class struggles, and a society that is riddled with paranoia and fear under such taut repression and miasma.Gao reflected on his childhood and adolescence, cudgeled his memory of China's most obstreperous times, and yet found an incredulously detached voice as if he is an outsider to all the horror. His narrative in the book is almost a form of joy without any connotations of morality. He is indeed like an outsider who narrates transparently the events, who scrapes off the thick residue of resentment and anger deep in his heart and articulates his thoughts and impression with amazing equanimity, and audacity.The result is a brand new voice in modern Chinese literature, a genre that deviates from post-modernism. It is a pure form of narration in which he contrives to describe in simple language the terrible contamination of life by politics, the tragic infringement of human rights, and at the same time manages to expunge the pervasive politics that penetrates every pore and sense. One can realize that Gao has carefully excised the insights that he possesses at the instant and in the place, as well as shoving aside his present thoughts.The meaning of the title is at total loggerhead to any preoccupied speculation that readers might possess prior to reading the book. Gao contrives not to write about politics though he means to accent his memories during the dark period. The outcome is a stunning account of man person's fate is being miraculously and calumnously determined with surpassing accuracy than the prophecies of the bible, attributing to the policies and regulations that fluctuate so frequently, according to the bitter contention of Party members.As accurate as it claims to be, the dossier, which exists for each individual, is generally inaccessible to the general public, does not necessarily reflect the truth (including mentality, thoughts, political stance, and affiliations) of individuals. People learn to wear a mask, to extinguish their voices, to hide their true feelings deep at the bottom of their heart in the midst of paranoia. Everyone seizes the opportunity to put on an act to score some good points for himself. Nobody dares to look one another in the eyes for fear of betraying any allegedly reactionary or counter-revolutionary thoughts.The sense of time is warped as Margarethe, Gao Xinjian's Jewish lover, stirs up his memories of the embittered childhood under the shadow of Mao in a hotel room during pre-handover Hong Kong. Though a fictionalized account, Gao has engaged in a dialogue that produces a state of mind that allows him to endure the pain of articulating the painful events. To him the country doesn't exist but exists only in memory that the country is possessed by him alone, and is thus a one man's account. The book is an epistle of freedom that is obtainable only through seizing the moments in life and capturing instant-to-instant transformations.2004 (11) MY"},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"Part of why Gao Xingjian's book \\"One Man's Bible\\" has such an impact for the Western audience is that many of us who have heard of the Cultural Revolution in China still have no adequate experience that helps us understand it or its impact on the Chinese people. Xingjian's detached style may be the only way to deal with this and not go crazy. So many of the details are startling. When he relates how his father's ownership of a gun some 30 years previously is held against him so that he's threatened by the dreaded \\"reactionary\\" & \\"counter-revolutionary\\" labels is amazing to the Western mind. To hear of families split apart as educated parents are sent for 8 years of \\"re-education\\" in rural labor camps is shocking. When those in political disfavor become ill, the hospital becomes the ideal method for assassination. I believe it's because of this subject matter that the book has such an impact.There is also another underlying theme of human isolation. Surrounded by people, the main character cannot let anyone get close to his heart and emotion. He interprets freedom as an absence of love; and this is perhaps the saddest aspect of the book. Xingjian's series of lovers from the German Marguerite to his first love Lin and the many other casual affairs reflect the satisfaction of the basic hormonal drives, but leave an emotional detachment that precludes real intimacy. On a purely human level, this clinical self-examination is put under a harsh light.The novel's construction uses some of the techniques that made \\"Soul Mountain\\" also seem fresh & \\"un-Western.\\" The alternation of time periods, flashing back and forth from past eras in China to the present detachment works to produce a tension in the novel. Use of various persons (e.g. I, he/she) including second person (you) narration adds a variety; whereas more accepted Western standards would look for consistency. People may react negatively to the book because we're used to a plot line where a story is told. Xingjian's story is told here, but it's in more of a travelogue format than the traditional structure that builds to a climax. Xingjian's tale seems to travel to anti-climax, much as life often can seem mundane or routine.Some of the philosophical chapters near the end did not connect with me as well. The book does seem to end simply because the author put down the pen. But all in all, this is an important book. My family watched the film \\"Balzac & the Little Chinese Seamstress\\" the other night. I found myself using Xingjian's book to fill in many of the details about the re-education camps for my family. Translated works may lose some of the original nuance and impact, but Mabel Lee did a good job with the translation. I often would ponder an unusual image. This is an excellent mind-stretching book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"One Man's Bible is not easy to read, as it is complicated both in form and content. An autobiogaphic novel of a chinese writer during Mao's Cultural Revolution....The book deals with the thoughts, happenings and loneliness of one man, who struggles to find himself in the middle of political and culural turmoil in China.Nothing is good or bad, everything is simply different shades of gray. What's acceptable one day is punishable the next. Nobody wants (dares) to take any type of political stance, in a changing world.Anxiety and vulnerability are in every single paragraph, as the writer is obcessed with finding the meaning of life in casual sexual experiences.Everyone is forced to wear a mask, which allow them to blend in to the everchanging panorama of things. Identity is nonexistent.Regaring form, the book jumps not only from time to time, back and forth, but is also narrated in second and third person, which complicates things a bit.As Gao clarifies during his Nobel acceptance speech, he wites for himself, and by doing so, provides an insight into twentieth century maoist China.In summary, a bit heavy...."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"\\"One Man's Bible\\" is the first of Gao Xingjian's two novels that I have read. I had anticipated an in-depth, inside look at life in Communist China. I got that but not in the manner I had come to expect. Xingjian portrays a society that was certainly a repressive one but yet one in which evolving standards enabled the hero to be both victim and active participant. The book weaves itself around in time so that, for the first two thirds of the book, the chapters go back and forth between past and present. This has the effect of letting us know that the hero survives whatever crisis he faces as we go along. While this minimizes some otherwise suspenseful moments, it also enhances our interest in other subjects. For example, we learn very early in the book about the hero's failed marriage but we never find out anything more about the particulars until the last third of the book.This book certainly appears to be autobiographical fiction and we see our hero, Xingjian, develop as an artist and find his own personal freedom in his art. Yet he often has to hide or destroy the very things that give meaning to his life lest he seem \\"different\\" from the standard. We follow the development of Red China through to the near present when relaxed repression alows persons like Xingjian to emmigrate.The person that Xingjian has become is not a very likeable one. He is focussed solely on himself. His relationships with women, and there are many of these, seem to center almost exclusively on sex. His marriage that failed was apparently not his fault but he seemed determined never to commit himself to anyone else after that. I found myself engrossed in his story but not in himself. As I reflected on this, I came to the understanding that Xingjian had a lifetime struggle to avoid becoming just another one of the masses. In struggling to maintain his individuality he seems to have succeeded too well. Perhaps this is the greatest statement he was able to make about the evils of a communist society."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"Gao's penetrating and honest insights about Chinese people, the Cultural Revolution, and his personal experience and feeling enable him to create a book that is as realistic and beautiful as books created by Mark Twain. It is a great achievement!"},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"I highly recommend this book. Initially I found it difficult and the sequences with Margarethe were perhaps a little bit tiresome but warming up to the story I got a lot out of it. I don't agree that the horrors of the Cultural Revolution were just like the purges and fascist regimes in other parts of the world. Instead of simple oppression by evil regimes against suffering citizens there was instead millions of little civil wars in every commune, every factory, every office across the country.The style is a little detached at times but this adds to the atmosphere. The writer doesn't try to create victim-heroes but shows what it was like for the compromised majority. A world dominated by fear and compromise, favours furtively delivered and favours frantically called in. Beatings, up-rooting and death are common in a situation where one is not allowed to be neutral, one must take sides to survive. It was corrosive to all human relationships and leaving a generation traumatised. One can only wonder what it really meant to experience it, or what it would be like if social purists or Christian Reconstructionists came to power in ones own country.The description is thorough and uncompromising; the experience of being caught up in the events well communicated but it is neither a confession nor an accusation. It is ultimately the tale of ordinary fearful people put in terrifying circumstances where every thing you ever did or said could betray you. At the end there is a sort of acceptance and personal reconciliation.Read it, its good."},{"Title":"R & D: Competition, risk, and performance (Economic report series)","review":"When Gao Xingjian won the literature Nobel in 2000, not many people had ever heard of him. That has hardly changed much since then. It was one of the most obscure decisions taken by that mysterious committee in Stockholm.Gao had been mainly a playwright, a poet, and a painter while still living in China. He emigrated, and he became a French citizen in 1998. He has published 2 novels, which have hardly made him a household staple. Stories and plays have also been translated.This is his second novel, a mixture of fictionalized memoir and musings of various kinds. It hops back and forth in time and space. Most time is spent during the 60s and 90s.I had bought the book years ago, but had hesitated before reading it. Now I found it interesting enough to read it, but probably not good enough to deserve a major literary award. Based on this book, my own official verdict is: the Nobel for Gao was an odd decision, but not the worst decision ever taken by the funny Swedes.I can't say much about the language. The translation may be good or bad, it is for sure not particularly appealing. You will not love it for its elegance.Hongkong before the return to China is the place of the 'contemporary' story, the 'now' of the first person narrator. The Cultural Revolution, as if invented by a Kafka & Orwell team, is the center piece of his flashbacks.A man tries to be himself, to find space, physically and otherwise. Oppressed sexuality looking for ways out. The broken relationships, the distrust, the ever watchful Party. The uncertainty of memories. The daily change of focus of prosecution. Thoughts of a dictionary of this version of newspeak. The coverage of the Cultural Revolution in this book is \`average'. It is not a historical treatise and it is not as intensive a personal experience as one finds in other books.Where I can't follow Gao is this:'What was life? Only Heaven knew...''Freedom was not a human right conferred by Heaven.'He uses such terms of speech too frequently for my taste, and he is far too vague about their meaning. What is this man's bible? The title seems to suggest a spiritual search, while the narrator is really rather free of spiritual interests. He wants freedom and is unabashed about it.Maybe the title is just misleading (no fault of the translation). What Gao is saying: he is free of 'isms', he shares his 'bible' with no one. One man's bible, and nobody else's. You are your own god and follower. Extreme individualism as an act of self defense. Understandable, but not endearing.Another critical issue: Gao writes things like 'she is too intelligent to be a woman'. Somewhat antediluvian, this attitude. He needs women physically, but can't stop condescending.An encounter with a Jewish woman from Frankfurt in Hongkong in the 1990s is the narrative frame of the novel. Between sex they discuss things that he would rather gloss over. He wants to forget, she doesn't let him, she says she needs to remember and wants him to tell her. It is a difficult relationship. We feel he mainly wants the sex, while she resents that and becomes 'difficult'. She makes him open up but feeds him little about herself. He distrusts the bits and pieces of masochist confession that he gets out of her.This is all not great, and certainly not a master piece. I do not recommend it strongly. But sometimes an imperfect book is a good use of your time."},{"Title":"Jane Austen (Obras selectas series)","review":"This Canterbury Classic version of Jane Austen's four best novels is a great value purchase.

Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor -- and the omnibus \\"Jane Austen - Four Novels\\" brings together four of her most enduring novels (although admittedly the overall list is rather small) -- filled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope.And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable. And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality.\\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love.The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the foul Eltons).And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly --each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well.Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).\\"Jane Austen's - Four Novels\\" draws together her best round of novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines."},{"Title":"Jane Austen (Obras selectas series)","review":"Made a great Christmas gift for my wife.

Meet the Monsters by Jane Yolen and her daughter Heidi Stemple might actually be scary to 3rd graders because of the vivid illustrations, but fifth graders are delighted - the scarier the better. The authors collaborated on the book through the Internet via e-mail rather than working together in person, and I think the idea of that kind of collaboration is an important way to illustrate yet another use for the Net. Unusual for a picture book, it has a bibliography. Students can use their card or electronic catalog to search for books on the bibliography and hopefully grasp the idea of research as a skein of knowledge. Finally, the presentation of monsters from so many different cultures can lead to other folktales or research on a specific monster as well as the creation of new monster stories. Like so many of Jane Yolen's books, Meet the Monsters touches on human emotions, fear and humor. Her inclusion of monster fighting methods can also provide discussion of how one does protect oneself in a scary world."},{"Title":"Meet the Monsters","review":"Meet The Monsters By Jane YolenBook reviewer Jake age nineMeet the Monsters is another one of Yolen's masterpieces.

It is designed for readers between the ages of 4 to 8. The book attempts to describe various monsters and ways to defend against them; however, the text, despite being a poor example of proper grammar and extremely difficult to follow, is really a very grotesque and violent description of how these monsters terrify, kill and devour innocent children. For example: The text states how a vampire \\"drinks blood\\", \\"your blood&quot;, \\"from your neck where the big vein beats under your chin\\", \\"the Jugular\\". It states that the Sphinx \\"...eats flesh\\", \\"Human flesh\\". Referring to Frankenstein's Monster, it states that Frankenstein was \\"made like a patchwork quilt, with bits and pieces of dead people all sewn together\\". The text states that you may see the Gargoyle \\"...scratching itself in nasty places.\\" Finally, in the description of the Ogre and Ogress, the text reads \\"they like to eat people. They like people burgers, and people meatloaf, and especially people pizza.\\" The illustrations alone are more than enough to be quite concerned about. The vampire illustration depicts a wide-eyed Dracula type monster with blood dripping from his fangs and an equally grotesque vampire bat perched on his shoulder. In front of this monster is an unsuspecting fear stricken young girl on her knees in a graveyard. The illustration of the Ogre and Ogress shows the face of a fear struck young boy as he watches a man, a woman and a young boy eat ground up human flesh, complete with eye balls. Despite the fictitious nature of the book, the illustrations and text are clearly inappropriate for the books intended audience. Both the text and illustrations are more apt to instill fear in young children rather than to stimulate their imagination. Processing the real from the imagined in the mind of a young child is often times a difficult task which usually requires parental influence to assist children with the distinction. This book does nothing to assist parents with that responsibility. I do not recommend this book to any audience. A big disappointment by a quality author and illustrator."},{"Title":"The confessions of a hoaxer","review":"Mr. Abel,You inspired me yet again mate.

Except for W.D. Ehrhart who got Avon to print an early anthology in l985--which was promptly &quot;dumped&quot; , no American publisher has touched the subject of Vietnam War poetry. Now we have Mahony's From Both Sides Now with its multi-faceted approach and a pretty sharp intro by its editor. A fine text for classroom use since it affords a view of veterans from both sides, as well as other more well-known poets including Sharon Olds and Philip Levine,etc. The anthology is well-organized, and in some cases especially poignant since it presents poems by poets whose work is not known to the American public. This is an extremely accessible book, rich with the real loss and melancholia of our longest war."},{"Title":"From Both Sides Now: The Poetry of the Vietnam War and Its Aftermath","review":"This book was exciting in two ways. One, the poetry was wonderful, combing poets who are quite famous with poets who are published here for the first time. Second, it recreated the Vietnam experience in a way I hadn't experienced in years. I especially enjoyed reading the dozens of poems in this book that were written by young Vietnamese-Amercan and Amerasian poets."},{"Title":"Barrayar","review":"Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan universe obviously struck a cord with the people who vote for the best science fiction novels of the year. Four of them, The Vor Game, Falling Free, Mirror Dance, and this book all won a major award. I have not read Mirror Dance (yet), but of the other three, this book is the best of them. There is something more mature about the story, and the storytelling is more compelling.Perhaps it is just me, but the story of Lady Vorkosigan, the former Captain Naismith from the planet Beta, is more interesting than that of her son Miles (the hero of most of Bujold's novels). Since she is an outsider (as are we, the readers) in the world of Barrayaran customs, we get a handy tour guide. She also seeks the same explanations we do when the twisted Barrayaran honour system kicks in, and these exchanges greatly enhance the reader's experience of Bujold's fictitious universe.For those that need a road map: this is a prequel novel, taking place about 20 years before the events of Bujold's other novels in the series. The main characters are many we have met before: Miles's parents, his cousin the Emporer (here a child of 5 years), his security chief Illyan, and a number of others. The plot: the old Emporer has died leaving his 5-year old grandson as the legal heir. Lord Vorkosigan (Miles's father) becomes Regent, much to the chagrin of some of the other Vor lords who were vying for more power. Ultimately, a power play takes place with a palace coup engineered by one of the other Vor lords.Like the recent Star Wars prequel trilogy, fans of the series will not find much suspense in the overall arc of the story. Many of the main characters are in later Vorkosigan books, so there's no life/death suspense there (of course, those that haven't read the books that were published earlier but take place later in the universe's timeline won't suffer this problem). Again, just as we knew that Anakin would become Darth Vader at the end of Star Wars Episode III, we also know that Miles survives the gas attack and whatever else might befall him in his fetal state. However, it's not so much the destination but the journey that makes the book so compelling. Because it's so well written, and the characters so interesting, we are drawn in and turn the pages eagerly awaiting what will happen next.I think there is one other reason why this book is better than others in the series: here we finally have the female author writing a female main character. There is something too ... touchy-feely about Miles that never quite rings true. He is sometimes a female-tinged carricature of a young man, which is not surprising, I suppose. In this book, the depth of feeling and the details in the female characters feel so much truer than any of her male characters.For those that haven't read any of the other books in the series, don't listen to what the fans of the series tell you - you can jump in anywhere. This book can be readily enjoyed by anyone not familiar with the extended Vorkosigan universe. In fact, as the strongest of the series, I would actually recommend starting with this book."},{"Title":"Barrayar","review":"To start with, if you haven't yet read Shards of Honor, the first novel in the tales of Miles Vorkosigan (even though it doesn't actually feature Miles, it's about how his parents met), STOP, go back and read it before approaching Barrayar. You'll be glad you did. These two novels, written seven years apart, tell one complete story arc. How that came to be is an interesting story.Shards of Honor and Barrayar form the beginning of the Miles Vorkosigan series. (Bujold's novel Falling Free takes place within the same fictional universe but, being set approximately 200 years before Miles' birth, features none of the series' familiar characters. Eventually you'll want to read Falling Free, but it doesn't matter when; you can insert it into your Bujold reading experience anytime.) Shards of Honor is Bujold's first novel (not merely the first novel she ever sold, but the first she ever wrote, thus disproving the axiom, \\"All first novels are unsaleable trash\\"). She begins writing it in December 1982. In mid-'83, having worked through the Shards material and about a third into what would eventually become Barrayar, Bujold realizes her manuscript is becoming too long to submit as one book (the \\"wisdom\\" at the time being a thin manuscript is more likely to be picked off the slush pile than a thick one). Bujold finds a logical breaking point for her tale (Cordelia's arrival on Barrayar), puts it in final draft form, and mothballs the partially finished \\"rest of the story.\\"Bujold submits Shards and begins working on another book, The Warrior's Apprentice. She's about halfway through that when Shards comes back rejected with an editorial suggestion she tighten it up. She finishes Warrior's, then cuts about 80 pages out of Shards, giving her two good unpublished novels. In 1985, around the time she finishes her third novel, Ethan of Athos, Warrior's makes it over the transom at Baen, and suddenly she goes from unpublished wannabe to successful novelist with three books (Shards, Warrior's, Ethan) SOLD. Shards is published in 1986.Fastforward to 1989. Bujold has written four more books, Falling Free, Brothers In Arms, Borders of Infinity (a short story collection), and The Vor Game. Then the program-book editor of Philcon, a long-established SF convention in Philadelphia, asks Bujold to do a short story or outtake to donate to their program book. Remembering the unfinished novel fragment of years before, she troops up into her attic, retrieves the pages, reads them and decides to complete it as a novel. After all, it's already a third finished, right? And in 1992, Barrayar won the Hugo Award for Best SF Novel of the Year.Shards of Honor stars Captain Cordelia Naismith, commander of a survey team for the Betan Expeditionary Force, and Captain Aral Vorkosigan, victim of a mutiny on his Barrayaran warship. Both stranded on an unexplored alien planet, officers on opposite sides of the Betan-Barrayaran War, they reach an agreement of honor: they will trust and rely on each other for survival as they travel across a planet seemingly intent on throwing all its resources into killing them before they can reach Aral's ship. And then there's the little problem of overcoming the mutineers.... In the process of their adventures, Cordelia and Aral fall in love.Barrayar deals with her first experiences on that planet, leading up to the birth of her and Aral's son Miles (though there is an epilogue showing Miles at age five). Both Shards and Barrayar are told from Cordelia's perspective. Thereafter in this series Miles, with very few exceptions, takes center stage. Never again will Cordelia be the main character. But for these two books she emerges as one of the most well-realized, loving and vulnerable but still tough-as-nails female SF protagonists ever.The next book in the series you'll want to read is The Warrior's Apprentice, which picks up Miles' life at age 17."},{"Title":"Confessions of a dirty ballplayer","review":"Johnny Sample was like an acid that ate at the NFL's racism. He was a statement within a statement for what was right. He was like an electric shock like the raised fists of the 1968 Olympics at Mexico City.

This is a glimpse of football the way it was meant to be played......not the mamby pamby game it is today."},{"Title":"Confessions of a dirty ballplayer","review":"The controversial Johnny Sample speaks his mind in this autobiography of his childhood and college days as well as his 11 year career as a top cornerback in the NFL and later the AFL.Sample was considered a troublemaker and a dirty player, and in this book he doesn't say too much to dispel that reputation. His in-your-face attitude on the field as well as his refusal to put up with the lousy treatment black players received in those days were virtually unheard of at the time. It's no wonder he was eventually 'blackballed' from the league (if you believe what he writes, and he does make a fairly strong case).The book also gives some insight into Weeb Eubank and his coaching style, the untimely death of Eugene 'Big Daddy' Lipscomb, and the New York Jets' rise from AFL also-ran in 1965 to the champions who shocked the world in Super Bowl III (1969). At the end of the book Sample spends considerable space rating the best (and worst) receivers and quarterbacks he faced during his 11+ seasons, as well as his \\"all-star\\" team of toughest opponents he ever played against. Of course his opinionated style makes for some interesting and sometimes shocking reading.Although hardly great literature, I found the book fairly entertaining and informative, as should most readers who were fans of those years of pro football."},{"Title":"THE ICE AGE","review":"Something destructive has happened to noble England, Margaret Drabble enlightens us in the two epigraphs that open \\"The Ice Age.\\" Sure enough, the novel's main character finds himself enmeshed in an apocalyptic tale. \\"It was as though he had strayed into some charged field, where death and disaster became commonplace.\\" (page 22) I genuflect to English literature's concern for values, and I no less feel that reverence toward this very fine book.We must look to the plot for what has gone wrong with England. Anthony Keating, the main character, is a typical middle-class man of British society. He finds his fate in college by eventually pairing up with Giles Peters, a wealthy property developer, despite his high level of idealism. He is seduced by a materialist lifestyle. Anthony is thus a representative of \\"economic\\" England. He marries Barbara Cockburn and has four children, but \\"Babs\\" is an unfaithful type. He later finds a more agreeable union with Alison Murray, who has two children from a previous marriage with Donnell. Although Anthony's two brothers prosper, Anthony experiences trouble physically and financially. He has a heart attack, which forces him to plan rest into his life. His company, Imperial Delight Company, which he thought would make him wealthy, goes bust.After buying a house in the country, Anthony has found time to reflect on the meaning of his life. Why does he feel a spiritual void? Anthony exhibits sound thinking and soul-searching and ultimately decides that Man must think about the nature of God and the possibility of religious faith. Alison's sensible and loving nature is a helpful complement to Anthony while they are together at High Rook House. Len Wincobank, a business associate whom Anthony admires, languishes in prison for fraud he has committed. Alison's daughter, Jane, who has travelled to Wallacia, a communist, East European country, is arrested and charged with hit and run. Alison visits with her and returns to England while she is still awaiting trial. When Anthony goes, however, at the urging of a Minister named Humphrey Clegg, he fails, through a mishap, to leave the country with Jane in the plane. He winds up in prison serving a sentence of six years for espionage. This is a disturbing irony.Ms. Drabble describes the sinister economic conditions that have brought Britain's problems in. Materialism has had a negative impact on people's lives. The economy and materialism are unpredictable forces to the individual, who relies exclusively on them. Finances hold anxiety. Therefore, men like Anthony live with disillusionment. Materialism requires a value system in order to comprehend and cope with daily life. Society has thrown away its cherished values. It is no surprise, then, that Anthony says, \\"I have learned nothing.\\" The sense of values in life can mean the difference between the rootlessness of Tim, an out-of-work actor, and Kitty Friedmann's well-knit family. Anthony achieves the realization that faith is necessary to man, but he is a doomed man.The presumed hope of the coming generations, in the novel, is undermined by this atmosphere of materialistic difficulty. \\"Would they survive? How could one tell?\\" The only way out of this predicament is for people to give spiritual, i.e. ethical, values a higher priority in their community planning. Man needs God in life. Six years in prison is not a dignified destiny for Man. Ms. Drabble is absolutely lucid about Anthony Keating's remarkable potential as a Good Man. However, as a dying breed (of the old order), he cannot be sure that the next generation will choose honorable paths that will exalt Britain's diminished destiny. Let's hope so, one and all!"},{"Title":"Saint Peter and the First Years of Christianity","review":"I enjoyed this book.

It manages to be not only about what it's like to give birth to a disabled child, but about the particular nuances and responses of a family, about a marriage, an older child's attempts to navigate these waters, the narrator's complex, ambivalent but ultimately loving and couragous response to the child she has borne. Nothing is simple in this book--not Rachels' progress, not her family's response to her, not the medical world that sometimes seems to hurt her as much as it helps her, not the waiting and waiting to see what Rachel will become. Nonetheless, this is a story not only about endurance, but also about the complicated, powerful workings of maternal love."},{"Title":"Loving Rachel:A Family's Journey from Grief","review":"Jane Bernstein has done an amazing job describing the heartbreak of the initial diagnosis and the ensuing challenges of raising a child with special needs.

Had to buy this for class, but made it much easier to bear with."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"This gripping tale describes the physical and psychological struggles of a wounded Vietnam veteran. Paco was the only survivor in his company after they were hit by a deadly Viet Cong attack, and his story is told not by him, but by the ghost of one of his dead comrades. Paco suffered some nasty wounds, one that mandates a long and incomplete recuperation in veterans hospitals. Upon his discharge, Paco not only suffers physcal pain (walking with a cane), but bewilderment and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Aimless and lacking job skills, Paco lives as a drifter, moving between manual jobs and staying in flop houses. His best position comes as dish-washer at a small-town diner, where he feels welcome and valued. He meets a few ladies and experiences some happiness, but he cannot escape his past. That past includes living on pain-killers, an inability to describe his experiences to anybody, and war flashbacks. Those flashbacks provide communications with dead comrades, and give readers a strong look at the sordid life of soldiers in Vietnam; an existence of tension, drinking, whoring, fear, and occasional deadly combat.This book is not for the feint of heart; the descriptions are raw, women are presented as sex objects, and the sentences sometimes run overtime. Still, author Larry Heinemann (himself a Vietnam Vet) has captured the essence of life as a combat soldier in this concise and powerful read."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"This seller had great customer service.

It gives me chills to just think about that.I know there is room in the world for different opinions, but I just can't help but feel that those who question the books writing style and content just don't get it. This book is very powerful, and I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"I read this book with eager anticipation because I had read Heinemann's Close Quarters, which I rate as a great book. I had also read that Paco's Story was a National Book Award winner. What a letdown. Even though Heinemann's considerable talent at writing text shines through, this story just didn't seem very good to me.Heinemann's a veteran, so I hesitate to write this, but the feeling I got in reading this book was that it's like tabloid sensationalism. It seemed like the war part of the story was overblown to appeal to people looking for that kind of story and the back home part of the story was either mindnumbingly dull or voyeuristic. Not a great formula for an appealing book - and it wasn't, in my view. I'd recommend Close Quarters heartily, but I only gave this as high a rating as 3 stars because the text writing is well done - it's just wasted on this story."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"Paco's Story brings a depiction of war's destruction to man to the forefront of our generation's history. The protaganist, Paco has a resilience of both body and soul that allows him to not succumb to death's grip after being nearly devoured by devasting military devices. His recovery is slow, and there is much to recover from. The book includes abundant but necessary detail to describe the pain of severe combat wounds. We as readers can only imagine in our mind's eye the horrific physical and mental anguish sustained by Paco. Paco's adjustment to a more &quot;civilized&quot; world is slow, but deliberate.

Its additional contribution lies in its exploration of the challenges facing the veteran upon his return to the U.S.The novel is unsparing in its criticism of a country that was all to eager to send young men off to fight in a controversial war in the jungles of Southeast Asia, but not so enthusiastic about dealing with them when they returned, wounded both physically and psychically. The novel also presents a world in which the soldiers on both sides are dehumanized by guerilla warfare and surrender to evil.What is Paco's story? It's a story of a grunt who survives a firestorm attack that kills all of his comrades; who clings to life desperately in a hospital far from home; who returns to the States with a cane and a complex of scars disfiguring his body; who lives day in and day out with the knowledge that he lived a life in Vietnam that he can explain to almost no one on the planet.We see him arrive in a small town via bus, looking for work. We watch him encounter fellow Americans who haven't a clue about what he has endured on their behalf and who do not appear to want to know. We return with him to experience the drudgery and brutality of life in a faraway land and the horrible day that changed his life forever. We listen to him commune with the ghosts of the men with whom he fought in Vietnam.Finally, we see him depart the town as suddenly as he came, having discovered that a girl upon whom he has spied and fantasized sees him as a disgusting freak.This is a bitter, eloquent novel that reminds us that we should never forget the soldiers who paid dearly for their service to the country. The wounds they suffered overseas should never be compounded by wounds inflicted by their own countrymen."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"This book gives a glimpse into the toll that war takes on those who survive. No one but those who endure it can truly fathom the horrors of PTSD, but for the rest of us who want to understand, this book is the best I've read yet. Paco wanders through his life finding some solace in washing dishes in a small diner in Texas, losing himself in his work and barely surviving mentally from day to day. The style of writing drew me into Paco's suffering. Although it is fiction, it is written by a Vietnam vet and left me wondering how many Pacos there are among us. His story is one that may well haunt you long after the final page is read."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"When I first started this book, I had to put it down for a few days and read something else. The rambling \\"device\\" at first put me off as annoying. I warmed to the unusual style, however, on the second try and was amply rewarded. As a Vietnam veteran I can be easily offend with the \\"loser\\" image of a returned veteran. But this is misleading. Paco is severely wounded and simply wants to work hard (most likely a penitent) and be left alone. He finds his safe harbor in Ernest, the owner of the Texas Lunch diner, where he washes dishes (washing away his sins, yes yes I get it). Ernest's ramblings about combat on Iwo and Guadalcanal add a great coda and understanding. Heinemann really brings these characters to life, especially the talk about combat and how they feel. The most intriguing character is Jesse, another vagabond Viet vet who stops for dinner. As I am also a former paratrooper, Jesse's rantings and observations are priceless. Pay attention to what Jesse says about the \\"proposed\\" Vietnam Memorial. Understand Scruggs's idea came about in March 1979, with Heinemann publishing excerpts of this book starting in 1979 (winning the Book Award in 1987). But Cathy gives us a view of how others see us, no matter how unfair that may be. Cathy at first sees Paco as \\"cute\\" then \\"ugly\\" as she observes him night after night with his nightmares. What Paco reads in Cathy's diary is what many civilians felt about us deep down and their refusal to help in reintegration. One final unrelated note: one reviewer of this book may be unaware that Caputo served in Vietnam, whereas Clancy never served in the military. Heinemann is the real deal, with characters very real to me and my experiences."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"Paco's Story, while revolving around a fantasy, is full of the reality of a bloody mindless war.

Sole survivor of his unit's ambush, he has returned to the States to look for work. Left with painful injuries that require powerful painkillers every day, Paco encounters both curiousity and discrimination from the locals in the small town he ends up in.Paco's story is written with graphic, lyrical language that brings his horrific war memories, and his trying to fit in as a veteran of a war that nobody really understood, to life. Heinemann writes in an unusual, dream-like way that just draws the reader in, until they feel like they are feeling what Paco feels. He writes of Paco's seemingly mundane experiences and transforms them into something cathartic. A must read for anyone interested in Nam."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"Paco Sullivan arrives in the town of Boone on a bus, without two dollars to his name. He's the physically and psychically devastated sole survivor of a fire fight in Vietnam, his wounds so bad that the medic who first treated him demanded a transfer and gradually drank his own life away. The America that Paco returned to is profoundly disinterested in his wartime experiences. Young people seem not to even know about the war and older folks, like Ernest Monroe, an ex-Marine veteran of Iwo Jima, who gives Paco a job washing dishes at his Texas Lunch diner, are more interested in telling him their own war stories.Paco is haunted by memories of Vietnam and, quite literally, by the spirits of his dead fellow soldiers--in fact, they narrate the book. As he tries to put together a &quot;normal&quot; life, his continual immersion in the dishwashing sink seems to represent an attempt to wash away past sins--atrocities committed during the war--and a kind of rebirth through baptism. He gradually develops a strange voyeuristic relationship with Cathy, the flirtatious niece of the owners of the Geronimo Hotel, where he's staying. But in the end, the dynamic between them turns out to be something very different than what he believes it to be and as the story ends he gets back on the bus and heads out of town.This isn't a bad novel by any means, and it's certainly better than Toni Morrison's Beloved, which it rather notoriously beat out for the National Book Award, but I found that much of it simply didn't work for me. The unusual narrative device, of letting the dead speak, quickly loses it's charm and becomes sort of artificial and intrusive. It becomes especially distracting during passages where the spirit guide renders Paco's thoughts and feelings. The story itself is kind of an amalgam of clich&eacute;s from the popular culture's rather deranged view of the war. In particular, there's one scene in which he participates in a gang rape that is purely obligatory, rather than growing organically out of the story. The author is a Vietnam veteran, so I'm hesitant to simply dismiss it as pandering, but one senses that it is there because Heinemann thinks the reader expects it to be.The odd narrative structure, Paco's lack of any life outside of his mundane job, and the derivative nature of the war scenes, all serve to prevent us from feeling any connection with Paco. Talk of fictional personae coming to life on the page is relatively silly, but these factors continually remind us that he's merely a character. To a degree, we admire the inner drive that keeps him moving forward, but we have no idea where it comes from or why he keeps on. Ultimately, this is the only occasionally affecting story of a survivor whose survival, though admirable in itself, fails to convey any broader meaning to the reader.GRADE : C+"},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"Paco's story has some clever conceits: there is the narrator, who only reveals himself slowly and carefully, as a ghost from Paco's decimated company in Vietman, and appears to have some companion who he calls James; but we are never told who James is, and why it is necessary for the narrator to tell him Paco's tale. Paco himself is a type of ghost. For the protagonist of an entire novel, we get extremely little insight about Paco qua Paco. Even his odd name, Paco Sullivan, hints at some wider, more humorous story, which is never exploited in this novel. Paco acts more like a ghoul than the narrator, who in compelling ways, is more fleshed out than Paco. We know Paco is wounded physically and psychologically, but we never get his own voice. It is reflected through others, but it lacks immediacy. Yet even with this vital flaw, Paco's story is a moving elegy to war, its victims, both dead and alive, and the confounded human ability to forget the horrible price of waging war itself. And as a Vietnam novel, Paco's Story catches the cadences and vocabulary of the war with great nuance. Again, a novel like this illustrates the great power in writing vernacular slang with dexterity and skill."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"Larry Heinemann provided his readers with an exceptional Vietnam novel. It is exceptional because, unlike most novels about that tragic era, it contains a very important moral. The extremely brutal rape of a Viet Cong woman by Paco and his comrades causes them to acquire a negative karma that will only be removed when they are destroyed. Alpha Company paid the price...Fire Base Harriette was supposedly a safe place. Only Paco would survive the devastating fire attack which took place. He did not, however, escape his fate. Crippled, scarred for life, Paco must deal daily with the payback for his actions. He is in a constant state of physical discomfort. His sleep is usually disturbed with horrible nightmares. Worst, perhaps, of all, has been the reduction of his life quality to that of an inanimate object. The people who come into contact with Paco can see no further than his disabilty and scars.&quot;Paco's Story&quot; is quite readable and presents a realistic appraisal of karmic law. Mr. Heinemann has penned a book which will never be limited by its time-frame. It is a story with a very clear moral: &quot;what goes around comes around.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"This book worked for me. I was drawn into a life, a sad unremarkable life on the outside but a life filled with courage and dignity inside. Paco has a story so horrific, so painful that he can't share it with anyone but the dead who haunt him. He can't escape his experiences or his pain. He can't comprehend why he is still alive. He can't relate to those living ordinary lives. He cannot share his terrible story. He is going through the motions of living on the \\"outside\\" but really living to deal with his inner demons.Paco's story powerfully shows the alienation of soldiers from society when they come home. It shows the gulf-too wide to be bridged between the GI and the ordinary person. It shows the indifference and lack of interest the average person has in what was sacrified or what a soldier has gone through. It is also a story about the brutalization of men-forced to kill and commit unspeakable acts of violence. Paco's story is told in a simple way, yet is packed with universal truths. It is hard to look at these truths even in a book. I wept for Paco and my brother and the other maginalized veterans. I'm re reading the book and its even more powerful the second time around or I'm just understanding more."},{"Title":"Paco's story","review":"PACO'S STORY is the definitive novel of the Vietnam &quot;conflict&quot; as told from the point of view of a lowly soldier in the thick of the fight.Author Larry Heinemann's use of language is so lyrical that the prose here has a rhythm that is musical. His descriptions are graphic enough that the reader almost can smell the blood, hear the screams, taste the fear.At times, PACO'S STORY is painful to read, but that is a direct consequence of Heinemann's mastery of the topic. This novel deservedly won the National Book Award.PACO'S STORY is as significant report of the Vietnam era as CATCH-22 was of World War II."},{"Title":"The Japanese Twins","review":"The \\"Yesterday's Classics\\" version of The Japanese Twins by Lucy Fitch Perkins is delightful. These are books I read and loved as a child, shared with my children, and now want to pass on to three families of grandchildren. While I've been looking for copies of the old out-of-print books, some of them are really collector's items now and out of my price range. This reprint includes the illustrations and looks very similar to the originals.Beware of the version which may be available from Tredition Classics. (I ordered The Dutch Twins from this publisher.) There is a huge difference, and I should have heeded the warning of one reviewer about the lack of illustrations in Tredition Classics. The latter has none of the charming illustrations I loved as a child. It doesn't even start each chapter on a new page, but just runs them together. Even though the little \\"take a look inside the book\\" link shows the illustrations and something akin to the original fonts, that is completely deceptive.Unfortunately, it's sometimes hard to tell which you are ordering. So, look carefully. Luckily, the easy return policy is available if you end up with an inferior product!Although I've only seen the \\"Yesterday's Classics\\" for The Japanese Twins, I'm going to bet on it for the other books in this series.

I have not yet finished reading this book, but I do look forward to doing so."},{"Title":"Bibliography Of The Algonquian Languages (Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins)","review":"This book was first published in 1891. However, the vast majority of primary source materials, in many Algonquian languages, had already been written down by that time. Therefore, this work still has a lot of relevance, to anyone interested in studying this fascinating subject.Please note, incidentally, that this is a bibliography of \\"Algonquian\\" languages, as opposed to \\"Algic.\\" The latter term was devised as an umbrella designation, to allow the inclusion of the northwestern Californian native tongues known as Yurok and Wiyot. These languages are now known to be distantly related to the eastern Algonquian languages, but no such relationship was yet established in 1891, when Pilling's book was compiled. Therefore, don't look here for materials having to do with Yurok or Wiyot.The Pilling bibliography includes information on finding articles and records in old state historical society records, from various states. For this reason, among others, it still has a lot of value. If you would like to seek out more recently compiled resources, you could try \\"Bibliography of Algonquian Linguistics,\\" published in 1982, by David Pentland and H.C. Wolfart. Or, for still more recent resources, ask your local librarian to help you seek out the 2003 issues of the newsletter \\"Algonquian and Iroquoian Linguistics,\\" ISSN 0711-382X, edited by John D. Nichols of the Department of American Indian Studies, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.

Click on \\"Mailing Lists,\\" which is near the right hand side of the bar. When you get to the page entitled \\"Welcome to the Mailing Lists Area,\\" click on the first option, \\"Browse Mailing Lists Archived on the LINGUIST Site. \\" The third archived list is called ALGONQDICT. Click on the red title of the list, then look down near the bottom of the page. You will be able to browse through listserv archives from October, 2003, to the present. If you look for the e-mail addresses of the list subscribers, they are famously helpful and friendly to anyone with an interest in this little-known topic.To business... there are 2,245 titled entries in the Pilling book. Of these, 1,926 relate to printed books and articles. 319 have to do with what were unpublished manuscripts, at the time that this book first came out. I would like to point out here that many of these \\"unpublished\\" entries can be located today. You may need to use your imagination, and try a few different spellings of Algonquian words in the titles you seek. But ask your local librarian to help you use OCLC/Worldcat to hunt around on the internet. You'll be surprised at what you might turn up in old archives, etc.Entries vary quite a bit in content, and in length. For example, the entry for John Eliot, (the seventeenth century \\"Apostle to the Indians,\\" and translator of the bible into Massachusett), is a full fifty-seven pages long. This totally eclipses the number of pages of all other scholars. For example, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft warranted ten pages of entries, and the great James Hammond Trumbull only has seven pages devoted to his work. Other entries are much tinier. Pilling made up all kinds of oddball categories, as a matter of fact. Again, you will probably benefit from using your imagination, in concocting topics to search for.Entries are alphabetically arranged, all in a single alphabetic sequence. There are not separate sequences for subjects, authors, or titles. No siree. Therefore, for example, under \\"G,\\" you will find entries for papers authored by people with the last name \\"Gordon,\\" followed by entries concerning the gospels, followed by an entry on grammars in various tongues. \\"G\\" also contains entries on the Gros Ventre tribe, and, of course, many individual authors. Oftentimes, the word \\"author\\" really means \\"translator,\\" if you want to be precise.Entries typically give an author's name, the work's title, some publishers' information, a quick description of the contents, and often a few paragraphs about the significance of the work, or the author/translator. Finally, mention is made of whether James Pilling or one of his associates actually had seen the volume in question, (which is the case 95% of the time). Again, this information is often enough to dig up copies today, using OCLC/Worldcat.One additional useful feature is the chronologic index, on pages 577-614. This index places the entire contents of the book in chronological order, item by item. This can help to draw attention to relationships between entries that you might otherwise not have perceived. This can be particularly useful for the earlier entries, when the number of tribes communicating with whites was relatively slight.I myself have used this book to track down materials pertaining to the old native tongues of New England. I can tell you, it has called my attention to quite a few items that I would never have known existed, without this fine resource. Whatever your particular Algonquian linguistic interest might be, I think this book can probably be a lot of help to you.

It provides superb information about the weather fax, including an excellent and easily portable manual for the various symbols. It has two areas for improvement:1) It sticks to the two-dimensional depiction of weather that is common to the average person. Although there are a couple of illustrations showing altitude, the author could easily have put in a few pages on the rotation of the earth, the 500 mb level, and how weather on the surface cannot be understood without underestanding what is happening at the 18,000 level. As my instructor put it, the high-level troughs are the chicken that hatches the surface level (scrambled) egg.2) It does not make the connection, at least that I could see, between the vital importance of making your own observations at 00 and 12 Zulu, so that when you finally receive the weather fax six or seven hours later, you can compare reality with what was provided. This also applies to forecasts--you can keep them, compare your own observations as the time passes, and get a sense of the difference.Add the above, and read \\"Mariner's Guide to the 500-Millibar Chart\\" by Joe Stenkiewicz and Lee Chesneau, and Google for &lt;Lee Chesneau> to find his web site, and you'll have all you need to move to the better three-dimensional interactive viewing of weather and weather charts.I also recommendThe Weather Wizard's Cloud Book: A Unique Way to Predict the Weather Accurately and Easily by Reading the Clouds"},{"Title":"Understanding Weatherfax","review":"Very helpful for anyone who considers themselves a world traveller on the waters.

Collingwood has produced a little book detailing how the concept/idea of nature changed throughout western history (notably any Chinese or Indian construction is left out). Collingwood has a very deep understanding, especially of the Greek philosophers, and one feels his familiarity with their work in contrast to later philosophers such as Spinoza or Descartes. He bases his study of this change on three fundamental principles he has singled out to describe &quot;nature&quot; within each period. These periods are defined by the Greek/middle ages period extending from 500BC to around the 14th Century, the Renaissance period extending from the 15th Century to the late 19th and the modern one from there onwards. In each case he characterises the conception of nature as, (in a book of 180 pages)1. Greek period: nature as a living organism, 70 pages.2. Renaissance period: nature as a machine, 20 pages.3. Modern period: nature viewed as evolving, 60 pages.the remaining pages are introduction of the main trends. Collingwood in each case analyses the general view within the period and provides examples in each case although his treatment of Aristotle is meagre when compared to Plato. the Renaissance view is not as developed as the other two and many philosophers of note are not discussed. In the 18th Century Locke is briefly mentioned as is Hume but Berkeley and Kant are given the floor. Of the 19th Century Hegel is the main one although other German idealists are barely mentioned eg Fichte, Schelling, Schopenhauer; in fact the other contributers to this trend such as Schiller and Goethe are not mentioned even when they often gave the original impetus to such an approach. In the modern period no philosophers other than Alexander and Whitehead are really discussed with the main drive being allocated to the physicists who developed quantum mechanics and relativity although Bergson is briefly discussed more as an aside and brief sojourn away from the modern trend a kind of throwback to an earlier time.Collingwood criticises the main theories of each period and once again it is the ancient philsophers who he understands best and his description of their ideas is the fullest. His critiques appear just in this era but varies as he discusses the other periods. In some cases I feel his criticism is unjust especially when it does not seem that his statements apply. Overall the study is in depth and justified and much can be learned from this book instead of having to read each philosopher in turn. Nonetheless Collingwood is one man and the book represents an opinion with good justification throughout. A fuller study would have taken years to write and been produced in several volumes, instead Collingwood cuts it down as much as possible and looks at the bare bones. A worthy study, at times illuminating."},{"Title":"The idea of nature (A Galaxy book)","review":"R.G. Collingwood (1889-1943) is perhaps best known for his aesthetics and for his distinctive approach to the philosophy of history. His interests and background ranged much more widely, and a consistent feature of his work is to clarify the relations between domains of thought held to be distinct, such as religion, art, history, science and philosophy. In this work, he aims to clarify the aims and scope of natural science, by examining the historical development of the idea of nature. He identifies three broad historical periods in which investigations into the natural world coincided with philosophical reflections on the methods and presuppositions of such investigations. Nature, he argues, was conceived along radically different lines in each of these periods, with the implication that natural science must be understood in light of and in relation to history.Perhaps this thought has become a commonplace since the appearance of Kuhn'sThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and given the rise of \\"History and Philosophy of Science\\" departments at major research universities around the world. It was a radical insight in Collingwood's time, when the positivist assumption that natural science and its results and proper methods are independent from history tended to dominate philosophy departments, even if it was at odds with what Collingwood took to be a growing recognition among some scientists that the natural world and its processes are themselves historical and evolving.In rough outline, Collingwood argues that the ancient Greeks conceived of nature along the lines of a living organism - or considered that the living organism was the paradigm of a natural thing. To understand Thales' proclamation that \\"all is water\\" requires that we not think of water as a dead, inert, material stuff, but as a kind of dynamic, self moving substance (or how else could we reconcile that claim with another famously cryptic claim by Thales that \\"all things are full of gods\\"?). He argues, by contrast, that the early modern or renaissance thinkers responsible for the \\"scientific revolution\\" conceived of nature mechanistically, as a kind of machine, an aggregate of parts that exert forces on other parts. Note that this is a radical shift: whereas for the Greeks (as Aristotle put it) things in nature are self moving, for the Renaissance thinkers nature is inert, which means it can't move itself but has to be pushed. To read Aristotle with a mechanistic conception in mind, is to radically misread him. The modern or twentieth century conception of nature, Collingwood argues, was pointing in a new direction, towards a conception of nature as an evolving historical system. Not only Darwin, but quantum mechanics and ecology can be thought of along these lines. To understand a natural system or process rightly according to these (then) new approaches is to recognize it as having come to be what it is as a result of an ongoing history of interactions with other systems or processes.Collingwood's study is obviously of historical interest, but also for its methodology, for exemplifying a rigorous philosophical approach to the history of ideas, and for its important implications regarding the relations between history, science and philosophy. Scientists, he argues, need to understand the methods and teachings of history as much as historians and philosophers need to be attentive to the results of natural science, which can only be understood properly in light of history."},{"Title":"The idea of nature (A Galaxy book)","review":"The author died before the manuscript has been completely prepared for publication, so you will have to cope with some minor language deficiencies. However, although the book was mostly written in the 1930's, the abundance of original and unfortunately unnoticed important ideas just in the Introduction itself (the first 27 pages) will more than repay your efforts.To wet your appetite here are some fragments from the end of the Introduction.*****************************************************************************\\"If an historian had no more means of apprehending events that occupied more than an hour, he could describe the burning down of a house but not the building of a house; the assassination of Caesar but not his conquest of Gaul; ... the performance of a symphony but not its composition. If two historians gave each his own answer to the question: 'What kind of event happen, or can or might happen, in history?' their answers would be extremely different if one habitually thought of an event as something that takes an hour and the other as something that takes ten years; and a third who conceived an event as taking anything up to 1,000 years would give a different answer again.... In general, making things takes longer than destroying them. The shorter our standard time-phase for an historical event, the more our history will consist of destructions, catastrophes, battle, and sudden death. But destruction implies the existence of something to destroy; and as this type of history cannot describe how such a thing came into existence, for the process of its coming into existence was ... too long to be conceived ..., its existence must be presupposed as given, ready-made, miraculously established by some force outside history.... I have quoted late Mr. Sullivan's remark that the second law of thermodynamics applies only from the human point of view and would be unnecessary for an intelligent microbe. ... [A]n intelligent organism whose life had a [much] longer time-rhythm than man's might find it not so much unnecessary as untrue.The natural processes that come most easily within ordinary human observation, it may be, are predominantly of a destructive kind, like the historical events that come most easily within the knowledge of the historian who thinks of an event as something that takes a short time. Like such an historian, the natural scientist, it may be, is led by this fact to think of events in nature as in the main destructive: releases or dissipations of energy ...; to think of the natural world as running down like a clock or being shot away like a store of ammunition. ...May it not be the same in the world of nature? May it not be the case that the modern picture of a running-down universe, in which energy is by degrees exchanging a non-uniform and arbitrary distribution (that is, a distribution not accounted for by any laws yet known to us, and therefore in effect a given, ready-made, miraculously established distribution ...) for a uniform distribution, according to the second law of thermodynamics, is a picture based on habitual observation of relatively short-phase processes, and one destined to be dismissed as illusory at some future date, when closer attention has been paid to processes whose time-phase is longer? Or even if these long-phase processes should continue to elude human observation, may it not be found necessary to dismiss the same picture as illusory because, according to the principles of evolutionary physics, we shall find ourselves obliged to postulate such processes even though we cannot directly observe them?\\""},{"Title":"The idea of nature (A Galaxy book)","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has ever tried to think about &quot;nature&quot;.

The characters are unlikeable and I found it impossible to discover a single thing in their personalities to relate to or appreciate. Their reasoning is far fetched and their behavior immature. The plot is choppy and over the top. I cannot think of a single reason why the hero and heroine would love each other. There is little opportunity for the development of a relationship between Jack and Gus and yet they carry on as if it's perfectly natural. Gus ultimately falls in love with a man who, as far as she knows, is a kidnapper, a hired criminal, a murderer and a thief. She shows little concern over that fact at all, which only emphasizes her inherent selfishness and stupidity which is not in the lest bit redeemed by her ultimate goal to be a responsible person. They have few, if any, redeeming characteristics between them. Their sexual attraction is wild and reminiscent of bad porn rather than attraction bordering on love. This book isn't about romance of any kind and if it's supposed to be erotic, the thrill is weakened by the terrible personalities of all the characters."},{"Title":"Bush Yoga","review":"I found this book to be very funny and witty.

Marquand novel about wealthy northeastern society. In this book Tom Michael comes from a family whose fortunes have been wasted away by a father who never learned the value of a dollar, nor how to produce more, so he turned to gambling, and when that didn&#8217;t work, to suicide to solve all of his problems. Tom fell in love with the girl from Warning Hill, where lived the rich. Her father was a self-made man that wielded the power of his wealth as do so many such people. He became class conscious, despite his own humble beginnings. At the time that Marquand wrote his novels such &#8216;telling on&#8217; the rich was considered daring. No such attitude exists now, so that any value in reading Marquand lies in how well he told his story, both from the point of view of writing craft and storytelling. Having won a Pulitzer Prize for one of his novels, he was certainly esteemed by his peers, and I personally always enjoy reading his books. I find that he wrote well, and told good stories."},{"Title":"His Convenient Wife : Italian Husbands (Presents)","review":"I so disliked this book that I did not want to finish it.A marriage of convenience.

YUCK."},{"Title":"His Convenient Wife : Italian Husbands (Presents)","review":"Jewelry-designer heroine wants to dismiss her husband's sexy PA's statements about being his mistress but seeing her come out of his room in the middle of the night confirms her fears. Heroine wants a divorce especially since her recent miscarriage no longer gives him any reason to stay married to her & she's lost hope of him ever loving her. But Hero won't give her one & seduces her instead. Her confession of her reasons for wanting to end their marriage is met with his anger & immediate abandonment. Will Hero give her a divorce after all?-----------------------------------SPOILERS: Don't read below if you don't want to know the book's details--------------------------------------------------------This was an emotionally-involving Hamilton book. Hero & heroine's tendency to make assumptions & not communicate it directly with each other made their romance poignant & kept the storyline going. Their electric sexual chemistry & sex scenes added to the excitement.I didn't like Hero's insensitivity & cluelessness re: heroine's feelings about her miscarriage & their failing marriage. He blamed her for believing he cheated on her & left her for 3 months instead of seeing her side of things. He didn't even stop to consider that his PA blatantly lied to her about being his mistress at least 2x & seeing her come out of his room in the middle of the night in her lingerie may have added fuel to her suspicions. He also failed to consider that his habit of turning his back on her right after sex & not having sex with her without telling her why after she told him she was pregnant may have made her insecure about his feelings for her. And being constantly away from her for weeks at a time especially right after her miscarriage could've worsened her view about lack of affection for her. In my opinon, Hero needed to grovel but instead it was heroine who apologized for misjudging him. He did apologize for leaving her to cope with the miscarriage at the end. Both of them had major problems in communicating directly about their assumptions & opinions about each other. But they seem to have crossed this barrier in the end. Their HEA is conceivable.Recommended with some reservations about Hero."},{"Title":"Removing the Sting","review":"I devoured this book in one sitting and came away feeling refreshed and uplifted. I admit to being a bit biased as I know the author, Pauline Neck, personally as she is a member of my writing group, but feel I know her much better now.I think this book would be helpful to anyone familiar with not only Parkinson's disease, but any kind of discouraging medical diagnosis. Pauline's determined positivity is a real asset to coping with life, in whatever way it presents itself. Her decision to redeem adversity by encouraging others is inspirational.While the book chronicles Pauline's personal journey, it also includes a useful appendix of Parkinson's disease-related organizations. It would make a great gift for anyone with a similar diagnosis. Besides the appendix, the book is accented with photographs, prose and poetry, and inspirational text.A great first, Pauline. Let's hear some more."},{"Title":"Removing the Sting","review":"Being the daughter of such an incredible woman is not easily put into words. The pain that my mother has gone through has made her the wonderful woman she is today. After reading Removing The Sting, I have a new understanding of who my mother is, and what a wonderful story she has written. It is hard to understand Parkinson's but this book not only helps those with Parkinson's but the family dealing with this disease as well. I recomend this book to everyone, it will make you appreciate everything that you have in this life so much more. Thank you Mom for writing this book, I am very proud of you and always will be."},{"Title":"Removing the Sting","review":"This book is a must read for those suffering with a chronic illness. Pauline makes such a creamy smooth blend of part memoir and part self-help that you don't even know where one leaves off and the other begins. Written in everyday understandable terms, I found it very easy to read. She writes how her faith has opened many doors and paved the way to a happy and wholesome lifestyle. Surrounded by family and friends, she exudes warmth, courage and selflessness. I highly recommend this book &quot;Removing The Sting&quot;."},{"Title":"Adventures of Baron Munchausen","review":"Whenever you have the desire to just let your imagination go with some total escapist reading, you can't really go wrong with any of the Munchausen stories. The movie of the same title by Terry Gilliam is also wonderful. These are good stories to read to a fairly young (like between 5 and 10) year old child, but I find them entertaining as well. I'm not sure how the other reviewer could find them 'dull', but I suppose it's a matter of taste, and perhaps imagination. This book was written in an eloquent rather baroque way, and is a bit flowery in it's language. The language used relects the time, teller and story however, and is appropriate. Another good fantastical escapist book is 'The Worm Ouroboros' by E.R. Eddison."},{"Title":"Adventures of Baron Munchausen","review":"If you are looking for an edition of this book that has illustrations by Gustave Dore, do not purchase this. As of 01/29/10, if you search for books with Dore's work in them, this turns up. There are no illustrations with this version. My rating is in no way related to the story or any other aspect of this edition, which seems fine, and is quite entertaining."},{"Title":"Adventures of Baron Munchausen","review":"There is a photograph of me with an illustrated copy of Munchausen taken when I was a sweet 5 year old. I was taken with the great fibber then and now that I'm 63 I'm still taken him. Many of the tales I can remember quite well.The more important aspect of this short book is the background material on the author and associated detail.I chased the Munchausen book for some time as literature for my grand daughters to compliment, Stauwel Peter, and Max und Moritz and I wanted them in English. I always balked when the author was given as Raspe until my research showed an seed that Munchausen was not his own author.The tales are short and the reader can interpolate and ad lib which is not only good for bedtime stories but an incentive to enhance the listeners' imagination.All in all the book brought back fond childhood memories, consolidated knowledge of publishing in Europe for the 18th century and there-abouts and well worth the effort to obtain.An excellent book who's stories will enhance the imagination and not confuse tall tales with any semblance of truth. Great for imaginative childrens' bedtime stories, adding a touch of \\"classical language\\" to enhance critical and imaginative language experience."},{"Title":"Adventures of Baron Munchausen","review":"The edition on this book is known as the Pantheon edition, very collectible from 1946. It is the one filled with art by Gustave Dore on nearly every page. It was made in a black cloth binding, with an image on the front cover in gold gilt. The paper inside looks like old parchment in a nice creamy color. It was not published with a dustjacket. If you are not familiar with the tale of the Baron, I suggest you give it a try. It is the wild journeys of a most eccentric man and his companions. The story has people with amazing talents, and he meets some old mythical characters and gods along the way. This is a great addition to any library of classic books."},{"Title":"Adventures of Baron Munchausen","review":"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen is one of those tall tales sort of books. However, in the Baron's case, these are pretty extreme, not just stuff about big fishes. He goes on and on about all the stuff he has got up to, where he has been, who he has been, what he has ruled, what he has invented, etc. It was all pretty dull though."},{"Title":"Horizons","review":"The edition before the newest one available for use online. Toting an eBook can be problematic, so sacrificing some different illustrations and occasionally different questions for having the information easily available - awesome. Does not substitute for the potentially required text but very reasonable cost makes it worth it."},{"Title":"Horizons","review":"These tapes are an excellent addtion to(and really a necessity for anyone who uses)the corresponding textbook, HORIZONS.

The 2000-2001 TLA Film and Video Guide seems more comprehensive to me than your typical movie review guides. The only thing I believe that could be improved upon is a larger Stars to Movies index. Many stars are not listed here but I like to keep the book at my side when trying to recall some of the many videos I've seen. It's well worth the money, I believe."},{"Title":"TLA Film and Video Guide 2000-2001: The Discerning Film Lover's Guide","review":"After reviewing several Film guides (Maltin, Video Hound, Variety) I settled on this one because it had just enough character and plot synopsis mixed with the right dose of criticism to help separate dogs from the divine. The reviews are fairly even handed, refreshingly honest and un-pretentious. They even find worth in bubble-gum farces whose adolescent fun may be just right for a side-splitting laugh.Nevertheless, some times they praise too many mediocre films with a star system (1 to 4 stars) which is not descriminating enough. Too many films get 3 or above. A 3.5 star suggests a great movie just short of classic. A 4 star is awarded to must-have classics. If youre looking to find a rare gem of a movie, this star system doesnt tell you much. On the other hand, if you read the individual reviews, you have more information than you need to make good movie selections. Finally, it would be nice to have a larger index and some narratives on style, genre, and their views of film criticism to give the full breadth of their reviews more balance.Overall, Im quite please with this film guide despite its very small limitations."},{"Title":"TLA Film and Video Guide 2000-2001: The Discerning Film Lover's Guide","review":"TLA's Film and Video Guide 2000-2001 is the definitve guide for movie-goers to locate quality movies they have not yet seen.In the first morning of perusing TLA's films by genre and choosing Suspense, then Action, I was able to make a list of nearly 100 films I'd like to rent/review.

It is full of large colour plates of exceptional quality, showing the most excellent pieces of ceramics from all over the world. Each plate is accompanied by explanatory text. In addition each chapter starts with a short but very good historical introduction. The chapters are: The Near East, Egypt and the Mediterranean -- Greek vases -- The kilns of ancient Rome -- Ceramics of the Islamic world -- European Majolica -- European porcelain -- North American ceramics -- Chinese ceramics -- Korean ceramics -- Japanese ceramics. I would recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn about the history and the wonders of ceramics. For the experts in this field this book should also be of interest, mainly for the beautiful colour plates. This is a wonderful and valuable book."},{"Title":"After the Russians","review":"AFTER THE RUSSIANS: Eastern Europe Joins the West. By Donald Read Shanor and Constance Collier Shanor. Xlibris. 363 pages. $19.54.Review, Vineyard Gazette, December 6, 2004, by Phyllis MerasNowadays, with all eyes on the Middle East, most of us forget about Eastern Europe. Certainly we were concerned during the war in Yugoslavia, but we've gotten rather ho-hum about the former East Germany, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Not the Shanors of Edgartown, however.For many years, Don and Connie Shanor lived in Europe where Don Shanor was the Eastern European correspondent for the Chicago Daily News. Neither the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall nor their 1992 move to Edgartown has prevented frequent returns to the East, however. And they have kept themselves apprised of the concerns of these seven Eastern nations seeking to revive after decades of stagnation under Soviet rule.In After the Russians, the Shanors deal with the economic, social, environmental and political problems that still beset the 113-million inhabitants of these countries. Now all are in the NATO military defense alliance, but only some in the European Union which is improving their economic status. Romania and Bulgaria are still seeking EU membership, but because of intolerance, environmental issues, human rights abuses, shady politics and shaky economic practices, they remain on the EU waiting list. It is vital, not only to Europe, but to the world, the Shanors believe, to have all these countries become full-fledged partners in Europe's protective alliances.Recalling the history of the region, the Shanors explain why it is so difficult for Balkan peoples to be tolerant. Lack of tolerance has caused delays and been a major impediment to EU membership.Borders of these countries, down through the centuries, have altered, depending upon whether Turks (long occupiers of today's Hungary and Bulgaria); Austrians and Hungarians (in the 18th, 19th and into the 20th century many of these lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), or Germans (20th-century occupiers) ruled.Goerlitz lies in eastern Germany just at the Polish border. On the other side of a river is the Polish city of Zgorzelec. Once its inhabitants were largely German. But at the end of World War II, when it fell under Russian guardianship, the Germans were ousted and the homes they had occupied became Polish homes. Now that the Wall is down and all Easterners travel freely, the nervous Poles want to know how soon it will be before the old German householders try to reclaim the properties they once held in today's Poland.Such fears do little for neighborly relations. Skinheads thrive in handsome, historic Goerlitz - a showplace of Renaissance and baroque architecture. German shoppers cross the border to buy goods that cost less in Poland than in Germany, but, their money notwithstanding, they are not made welcome there.There are the same sorts of antagonisms in Hungary and Romania, where centuries of wars have left a large Hungarian population in Romania and many Romanians in Hungary. Each minority seeks equal rights for its people with the majority, but the past is never forgotten and the minorities are treated with fear and animosity. Turks remain in Bulgaria - descendants of Ottoman soldiers left behind in the 19th century. In the past, they were usually treated fairly, but now Bulgarian nationalist extremists view them as a political threat. Similarly, there is nationalist extremism in Slovakia that would deny rights to minorities. And, virtually eveywhere in the East, those Roma - gypsies- and those Jews who survived the Holocaust are considered secondary citizens.Crime is rife in much of Eastern Europe. After the downfall of Communism, the Italian Mafia arrived. Now a Ukranian-Russian Mafia is said to be making inroads into Slovakia. Bulgaria has long been renowned for corruption and crime. (No one ever forgets the outspoken Bulgarian &eacute;migr&eacute; writer assassinated in London with a poison pellet fired from an umbrella in 1978 nor the 1981 attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul in which Bulgarians were involved.)Although, ostensibly, the Communist party is out in the East, former Communists still are in control of the government in Romania where criticalmembers of the press have been jailed. Political executions and jailings have ended in the East, but there are still questionable practices in police stations and prisons.In the Czech Republic, the economy is affecting the publication of books. In the former East Germany, the dismal economy is depleting the population as young people head to the West seeking jobs. Although Romania has valuable oil reserves, it lacks the money to buy the crude oil imports it needs to keep its refineries going. Privatization of business has, for many Eastern nations, become anathema.Virtually everywhere in the East, contaminated slag mounds surround abandoned mines and plants and Soviet-built nuclear plants of questionable safety still operate.In addition to the need to resolve all these problems and then welcome all of Eastern Europe into the EU as it has been welcomed into NATO, Russia must not be forgotten, is an additional message in this book. There must be more financial aid offered by the West to the economically failing Russians, in the same generous way that Marshall Plan monies were offered to rebuild Europe after World War II. Only with a stable Russia, with economic and democratic goals like those the nations of Eastern Europe have painstakingly been embracing, will there be a stable Eastern Europe. Only with a stable Eastern Europe, in union with a stable Russia, will there ever, truly, be secure peace across the European continent.Now that the flighty days of summer have ended, this is a good book for anyone with an interest in Eastern Europe to stick his or her teeth into. It isn't light reading, but there is much to learn and much to ponder in the Shanors' After the Russians."},{"Title":"Cowboy Boots","review":"This book is so fun!

Your eye is naturally drawn to the 22 rare Mexcian coins inlayed across the pair...but what is more astounding is to discover that the tooling pattern on this \\"matching pair\\" each completely different on the right and left boot. The difference is difficult to detect because the design is so well balanced. An amazing tribute to the rich history and culture of Mexico.Page 25. \\"Ray Jones Boots 1960-1970s with Eagle Inlay.\\" Ray Jones was famous for the \\"plain\\" stitched boots he made for working cowboys.

Take the \\"Syl\\" off, and you have his real identity. I have never read this book, and I never will. Endorsing this man and his work is an insult to Celine herself. Sylvain says he has all these contacts with Celine, her staff, etc. but he has never met her, which I find very odd. If you REALLY want to know about Celine, read her AUTHORIZED biography and autobiography. If you really love and admire Celine, DO NOT humor this man."},{"Title":"Passion Celine Dion: The Book: The ultimate guide for the fan!","review":"I think I now know more about the person who wrote this book than I do about Celine. Buddy, no one cares!According to Mr. Beauregard, Sony and the entire music media business would crumble and collapse without him. His \\"passion\\" for Celine goes far beyond being a fan and straight into obsession. I think it would serve Ms. Dion well to post a guard outside her door when this guy is around.There is some interesting stuff in the book, but it's nothing that's not in any of the other books about Celine Dion."},{"Title":"Passion Celine Dion: The Book: The ultimate guide for the fan!","review":"This is what you call &quot;overkill.&quot; How many books need to be written on Celine? The only book you need to get on her is the official biography and maybe her autobiography. This book by Sylvain is a waste of money. He is widely known among the Celine Dion community on the Internet as an arrogant loud mouth who spreads rumors that turn out to not be true. I don't know how in the world he got this published. Trust me, if you want an accurate book on Celine buy one that is official."},{"Title":"Passion Celine Dion: The Book: The ultimate guide for the fan!","review":"\\"Passion Celine Dion: The Book\\" is, to begin with, the contents of the old \\"Passion Celine Dion\\" website. Though the webmaster, Sylvain Beauregard, closed the \\"Passion\\" site's virtual doors in September 2003, the extent of his work continues to live on through this book.This book is intended neither as a biography nor as a picture book. It's a reference guide, containing exhaustive information on the singer's releases of albums, singles, b-sides and chart information. While several b-sides, rare songs and remixes are not listed, the author does his best to cover as much as possible in the 244 pages of information.In fact, the only thing missing from the book that was on the website are the lyrics and translations. However, that is understandable as the lyrics are under copyright and cannot be reproduced for the purposes of gaining a profit. The information contained within the pages of this book go from her humble beginnings to March 2002 -- the release of the \\"A New Day Has Come\\" single and album.I, for one, have gotten as much use out of this book as I did with the website. The book provides for at least one of my reasons for visiting the \\"Passion\\" site. One reason was for the extensive discography information, which I have since expanded upon for my own Celine Dion fansite. The other reason I visited his website was for the lyrics, which I am also working on providing in my website.This book is not for the new fan. It is for one who's already a diehard, like myself. Forget what you've heard about Sylvain and judge the book on its own merit. It has much to offer, especially for those who are curious as to the statistical data of her career up to Spring 2002, the music-oriented geeks, and the fans who must have EVERYTHING pertaining to her on their book and CD shelves. However, if you want a biographical account of her lifestory, you will want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Passion Celine Dion: The Book: The ultimate guide for the fan!","review":"I have many problems with this book. I am indeed a fan of Celine Dion's, yet, I feel too many meaningless boring books have been written about her life. I am not a huge Dion fan yet I have read most of the English texts on her life.I am not farmilar with who this author is and I do not understand why he goes on and on about his education, his affiliation with Dion, and the work he put into his self proclaimed \\"Best website ever on the singer\\". This indeed does not sell the book, it only builds up to what I have found to be a pointless factual boring book. This book is great if you are interested in chart performance and album sales.If you are looking for a great read on Dion's life stick with the Authorized Biography or the book that Dion wrote herself, much more entertaining. This book is much hype and leaves the reader totally dissapointed and confused about why they purchased it. Please don't waste your money! I feel this book is a product of some type of twisted obsession and it's almost like this person thinks Dion owes him something because he simply created a website for her???? Did that make her the global superstar she is today?? I think not! Yet, he has used her name and image to further his own projects and has made money off Dion's name. This book is no better than the other trash that has been written about the singer.

By our arrival in Miami Beach she could already point to the many seagulls and tell me that they were looking for food. The simple story and illustrations were a wonderful introduction to many of the things she encountered at the beach including the waves, shells, seaweed, sandcastles, and crabs (but as a Maryland native she already knows all about them - steamed with plenty of Old Bay seasoning, that is). Now weeks later, rereading the story brings back memories of her trip and lots of enjoyment. Highly educational and fun."},{"Title":"DK Readers: Day at Seagull Beach (Level 1: Beginning to Read)","review":"&quot;A Day at Seagull Beach,&quot; by Karen Wallace, describes a day in the life of a mated pair of seagulls. Directed towards beginning readers, this book combines an easy-to-read text with full color nature photography on every page.As do the other volumes in this series, this book contains a &quot;Picture Word List&quot; at the end. This feature is basically a visual glossary that illustrates each vocabulary word (&quot;pincer,&quot; &quot;seaweed,&quot; &quot;waves,&quot; etc.) with a photograph. This is a good feature that adds to the book's educational value.We see the seagulls tending their nest and their eggs. Much of the book follows the male gull as he searches for food; we see him encounter a crab, a starfish, and other marine life. Overall, the combination of good photography and literacy aids make &quot;A Day at Seagull Beach&quot; a good choice for children."},{"Title":"Judgement Calls","review":"I decided to read this book solely because Alafair Burke is the daughter of James Lee Burke, the master of the crime genre. Also, it would seem, she is something of a family favourite, JLB having named the daughter of his main character 'Alafair' in his long running Robicheaux series. Alafair Burke has now written 3 Samantha Kincaid novels and looks like writing a whole slew more, so it was a pleasure to give her series a hit out.Alafair Burke's first offering is set in Portland, Oregon. Her main character, Sam Kincaid, is an assistant DA. This makes the book more a legal procedural and this point of view is very welcome: many of the established series set in law enforcement place their main characters in the police force or as private investigators. The job of the DA's office is to take the work of the police and ensure the evidence is sufficiently kosher to enable successful prosecution.Living in Australia, I think I have a better idea of how the American justice system works than I do of my own, including the differences in laws between the different states (at least in the states where the crime series I read are set!). I don't know whether this is sad or not, but at least I'm KEEN! Over here we do not have DAs for example, although we do have a Department of Public Prosecutions. I imagine any reader from outside the US has a similar sense of peripheral perception, but we get used to it especially when it comes to good crime series.This book focuses on Sam Kincaid's involvement in a case where a 13 year old heroin using child prostitue is grievously assaulted and left for dead by 2 men. There is quickly a suspect for Kincaid to prosecute, but the case becomes more complicated when an older and similar murder is revitalised and the spectre of a serial killer begins to materialise.My main criticism of the book revolves around the plot's clunkiness. I think this is mainly due to the fact that it IS the first in a series, and number one always seems to have these kind of problems. Burke is keen and she knows her stuff and some of it gets quite complicated. However some of the Oregon law enforcement acronyms are not explained and the US justice system does love its acronyms, all slightly different from state to state. I was also champing at the bit about the identity of the second attacker, Burke is mute on this for much of the book.Further I found some difficulty with the character of Kendra Martin, the 13 year old victim, who was not quite 3-dimensional. Some of the story's importance revolves around the state Kendra was in when the police interviewed her after her attack. She had supposedly been given a shot of Narcan to counteract the effects of the heroin found in her system, something that usually leaves addicts furious and hell bent on only one thing: getting more immediately. She wasn't quite believable as an addict either then, or in her later behaviour. Even after 'only' 9 months of use, she would, I believe, have pursued her drug lifestyle a little more vehemently even after this gruesome attack, especially with the lack of family support Burke creates for her. Kendra is really quite 'tame'.Outside of that, Burke has created some strong characters; her love interest Chuck who is also a cop on the Major Crimes Unit, her newly widowed Dad, her friend Grace and her dog Vinnie. It must be overwhelming setting up a series and getting all your ducks in a row. The criticisms I have of the book never made me want to put it down, just hope that Burke can iron everything out to keep the series rolling. And it appears she has done just that. I've just picked up 'Close Case' and its a cracker.I believe Burke's main audience, readers of crime fiction series, will exercise patience with this book and she will pick up other fans as the series gets stronger. I for one welcome her and her character and the setting onto the scene and will be looking out for more of her Sam Kincaid series."},{"Title":"Judgement Calls","review":"My first book from Alafair Burke, but you can bet I'll be reading ALL of hers starting now. I expected a kind of washed out version of her fathers work, bujt was very pleasantly surprised. She has a fresh style and unique point of view.

This is a classic tale which should convince us that we do not have to like someone to learn great lessons from them. This is an ideal book to be placed on the reading list of every high school student. In a day and time when morals are at an all time low, we need to remind our youth of the utmost necessity to have faith in something and respect for the views of others even though we do not always agree with them. To me, this is among the best of Lloyd C Douglas' work and I have always been surprised that it has not been accorded more recognition than it has. I am very disappointed that the book is not readily available to our youth and I do hope that something could be done about it"},{"Title":"Disputed Passage","review":"This is the third novel I've read by this author. The first two were White Banners and Green Light. I would recommend these as well. Douglas wrote back in the 1930s and his stories hold up well over time.This particular story is about a young medical student in his quest to be a great surgeon. He attends a medical school that is headed by a brilliant yet undeniably lacking-in-social-skills doctor with the improbable name of Tubby Forrester. Dr. Forrester is a strong proponent that doctors must retain an objective distance from patients to be able to implement the best treatment. He and our protagonist immediately butt heads, but as it becomes apparent what promise out budding doctor holds, Dr. Forrester goads as well as aids our hero to push himself to be the best.Dr. Forrester and our hero continue to almost hate each other, but they also work well together. Add to this mix the appearance of an old college mate of Dr. Forrester's who does not espouse the same medical theories Forrester does. This doctor maintains that a patient should be treated holistically and not just for his specific ailment.The themes in this book are surprisingly current. Further, the author writes a great narrative that contains conflict, romance, a touch of humor, and a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Disputed Passage","review":"Not quite as good as &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; but still exceptionally good.

I have a set of 5 books written by him, in a large lot I received. The Robe, being one of them, I assumed the foundational thinking of the author would be Christian.Though it began in a very hostile way toward Christianity, it had the feel of a story with a twist in the works, so I wadded on. The continual heartfelt and subposedly intellectual knocks on the foundations of the Bible made me feel like I was sitting in the classroom of an aggresive, atheistic college professor. The profanity, though considered mild by today's standards, was nontheless gratuitous.Though the humanitarian personality won out in the end, it was a hard fought battle that left the dessimated bodies of theology in it's unworthy wake.I give it 2 out of 5 stars, for a some what interesting read but am shocked that this is the work of a respected minister capable of a work such as The Robe."},{"Title":"Disputed Passage","review":"I gave this book to my wife as a gift and she enjoyed reading every word.

A dull, boring girl, Devnee yearns for beauty and all the wonderful things it brings. The vampire can grant her this wish, and many others, but they come with a price. Devnee begins to learn as she sees friend and foe suffer because of her selfishness, that even though she is beautiful on the outside, the vampire is slowly rotting her from within with her own greediness.\\"The Return of the Vampire\\" is a different type of vampire book, because it really isn't about the vampire.

When Devnee first sees the house, she is intrigued by the tower. Being a lonely, dull girl with no interesting personality or friends, she pictures herself living like a princess in her room on top of the tower. She wishes more than anything to be beautiful, because with beauty, she feels she can make friends easily and achieve anything she wants.When Devnee starts going to school, she meets Trey, Aryssa and Nina who are part of the school's buddy system, and show her around. Devnee thinks Trey and Aryssa are really friendly, but then realizes that like Nina, they were just pretending to be nice with her. Devnee feels completely rejected.Little does she know that there is a vampire living in the tower room where she now lives; a vampire who can make her wishes come true, who can make her really beautiful and have everyone befriend and adore her. In the beginning, all her dreams come true when the vampire makes her beautiful and all the kids start noticing her. But then she realizes this vampire does his work for a price; a price that could destroy Devnee's life if she is not careful.When Devnee realizes that she is borrowing her beauty from Aryssa, by sending Aryssa to fulfill the vampire's appetite, she knows that she is under the vampire's power, because in order to stay beautiful, she needs to supply the vampire continuously. Is there any hope for Devnee to keep her beauty and escape from the vampire?Review: I actually read \\"The Cheerleader\\" before I read this book, because they both involve the same vampire, and are part of \\"The Vampire\\" series written by the same author. I must say I enjoyed this book better than \\"The Cheerleader\\" mainly because this story felt more believable.For one thing, I liked the fact that unlike \\"The Cheerleader\\", this book actually mentions Devnee's parents and involves her mother to the plot twist. I felt like the author also expresses Devnee's reactions very realistically, where Devnee feels angry towards Victoria one minute for nominating Aryssa as the Sweet Heart for the Valentine's Day dance, but in the next minute, wishes that she were as nice as Victoria, or sad that William fancies Victoria for her smartness rather than her looks.Although I really enjoyed reading the book throughout, I felt the ending was a little rushed and could have been written better, or in more detail. But other than that, I thought this was a well written vampire book by Caroline B. Cooney.If you enjoyed reading this book, I would recommend reading the others in the Vampire series, namely \\"The Cheerleader\\" and \\"The Vampire's Promise\\"."},{"Title":"The Return of the Vampire (Point)","review":"Caroline B. Cooney has written another offbeat thriller that hits closer to home than most of the teen pulp written these days. Devnee's yearning for beauty and acceptance reminds us all of the times when we do not feel special or worthwhile.

The other forest creatures hear this chirping and finger Timmy (not the forgetful squirrel) as the culprit. They confine Timmy to a prison that Timmy can't get out of on account of his size. Timmy ends up making friends in that prison with a male chipmunk. The wife's of Timmy and his new friend chipmunk soon meet each other and then go off to find their missing husbands. They succeed, and Timmy is set loose of his prison when the wind breaks the tree apart.This story can be a little hard to follow, but I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing.

I vaguely remembered the Potter books from my childhood and was sure that it would be nice.Although the story is somewhat hard to follow, here is the basic storyline....It starts out very nicely with a squirrel and his wife, preparing for winter; gathering and storing nuts. Timmy stashes his in a hollow tree. A roving band of forgetful squirrels can't remember where their nuts are and begin to fight. About this time, a bird comes by and randomly begins to sing \\"who's been digging up my nuts\\" (Beatrix goes out of her way to explain that this is not mean spirited, but just the normal song that a bird would sing) Naturally, the gang of squirrels thinks that Timmy has stolen their nuts and they beat him severely, and stuff him in the hollow tree, through a small hole that results in the breaking of his ribs. His wife is distraught when he doesn't come home and goes to look for him. Meanwhile a chipmunk, who has left his wife to live in the hollow tree, holds the injured Timmy hostage (Think \\"Misery\\") while he force feeds nuts to him to prevent his departure through the small hole. Assuming her husband won't return, Timmy's wife continues collecting nuts and dumps them into a hole, that just happens to be inhabited by the chipmunks estranged wife. Mrs. Chipmunk shows Mrs. Squirrel where the husbands are camped out, but refuses to go in to get Timmy because she is afraid that Mr. Chipmunk will bite her. So the husbands stay in the tree and eat nuts for a good while, until a storm blows the tree down and Timmy can excape. The squirrels are reunited, but the stubborn, violent chipmunk chooses to stay in the stump and be rained upon, rather than go home to his wife. After catching a bad cold, he still needs to be scared off by a bear before he will go home to his wife. The lesson of the story...Timmy & his wife lock up their stash of nuts from now on. This was a terrible children's story."},{"Title":"Witchblade Volume 10: Witch Hunt (v. 10)","review":"This is a well done graphic novel. It is my favorite along side of Batman.

We join the story while our hero lies comatose in a hospital bed. We learn over time she was injured by some kind of nasty monsters and eventually we learn why.Her old partner Jake is a constant presence in the book as is a new male lead--Detective Patrick Gleason. Gleason is sent to investigate why Sara is in the hospital. A mild love triangle ensues. It is a love of Brady Bunch ferocity. In other words, the boys get cranky and mope around but no one gets any. Meanwhile, Sara is fighting, fighting, fighting for her life and, naturally, has to save her hapless partners and the rest of the free world.Ron Marz said he wanted to move away from the T&A; and instead focus on the story. That seems fine but he seems to have missed the fact that it was ironic T&A.; That makes it okay, right? His pronouncement seemed more like misplaced piety or perhaps some lingering embarrassment over his association with the series. Whatever his motivation, I couldn't really see too much difference, in that regard, between this one and any others in the series.The art of Mike Choi is serviceable but very different in tone from Michael Turner's amazing work in the series. To give Choi credit, if I'd started with his, I wouldn't have thought twice about it. I think the difference is style more than quality.The story definitely had a beginning and an end, and a reader unfamiliar with the series could easily step in and enjoy it. I'm trying not to give away the plot, but it includes shop-worn elements such as secret societies of priests, other dimensions, elderly, mystical Asians and a betrayal by an old friend. I am always hesitant to write reviews of comics out of fear of people knowing what a true dork I am. This book won't do anything to help me appear more enlightened, but it was a pretty fun read."},{"Title":"Dig This!

Secondly, the content did not disappoint. Overall, a good experience."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"In his second book on the paranormal, Paul Eno hits another home run and proves he's at the top of his game as a paranormal investigator and author. Baseball analogies aside, Eno manages to engage and intrique his readers again, just as he did with 1998's Faces at the Window.In Footsteps in the Attic, he lays out his utterly unique and ultimately convincing view that what we call &quot;ghosts&quot; are really far more complex, and really arise from slips in time and alternate universes. This based-in-fact scientific explanation makes this book stand out among the many Halloween &quot;scare&quot; books on the market now that read more like fiction.And from the story of a disappearing house to an apparently troubled classroom in an elementary school and his dire warnings about parasites and the use of Ouija boards, Eno tells a far scarier tale than those fiction-inspired haunting stories ever could. This is because everything he writes about comes from his personal involvement in these cases.For anyone interested in truly understanding the paranormal, or even opening your mind to the possibility of its existence, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"In the world of the paranormal, we're routinely faced with two voices, the believer and the debunker. In this refreshing take on the world of \\"ghost sightings\\" we're given a third choice, a rational voice that balances the previous two with scientific insight and theories that span the gap from quantum physics to metaphysics.In Paul F. Eno's worldview, \\"ghosts\\" can be caused by several different phenomena, from \\"standing waves\\" or low frequency sound waves, to time displacements, and from visitation apparitions to parasitic entities. We learn about each of these through actual cases Eno has investigated. Each sighting is taken seriously and examined with an even-handed manner that allows for any possibility.His hypotheses are well researched and although he is careful to point out that he is not a scientist, his work reflects the findings of some of the greatest minds in \\"new\\" or quantum physics.If you're ever troubled with what seems to be a haunting problem, this book should be your first line of attack. In fact, you may want to keep it on hand just in case. This modern Ghost Buster may not carry around a power pack, but his methods are going to be a whole lot more effective if you are ever face-to-face with the real thing."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"This book is that increasing rarity in the paranormal world - an original account written by an actual investigator with a thoughtful approach to his subject. It covers an array of paranormal experiences from ghosts to time slips to parallel universes - and again, all original and thought-provoking.

And I'm buying his previous book."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"While the stories in \\"Footsteps in the Attic\\" weren't anything shocking or amazing in most cases, I found them more believable because of it. Eno's simple, no-nonsense style presented the facts of each investigation in logically order.I was struck by the way Eno would attempt to explain any paranormal activity in non-paranormal terms. This approach gave quiet credence to everything from his personal written accounts to the photographs in the book.Furthermore, I enjoyed Eno's scientific approach to explaining the existence of ghosts. I found it very plausible, and supported much more strongly than previous explanations I had heard. Eno laid evidence as he saw it on the table repeatedly throughout the book, but always in what I felt were appropriate moments.If you enjoy ghost stories, paranormal events, or even speculating on the afterlife this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"I will start this review with a few quotes from the book that will help you understand how the author(paranormal investigator) explains the paranormal events in the book and how he addressed them to help the people involved and sometimes remove bad entities from their houses.These following quotes are from the introduction.Quote 1. In quantum reality, all of us, whether \\"living\\"or \\"dead\\" are intimately united in very concrete ways. Time as we understand it doesn't exist. Our sense of \\"self\\" is and illusion. All that ever was and all that ever can be exists all at once - in multiple, parallel universes.----------This is the concept of parallel universes, also known as the \\"multiverse\\".Quote 2. I don't believe that ghosts are \\"spirits of the dead\\" because I don't believe in death. In the multiverse, once you're possible, you exist. And once you exist, you exist forever one way or another. Besides, death is the absence of life, and ghosts I've met are very much alive. What we call ghosts are life forms just as you and i are. I certainly don't believe that ghosts are just video - like \\"recordings\\" on the environment.Quote 3. My experience is that there are three basic phenomena that people experience as ghosts: space-time displacements, parasites and what traditionally are known as visitation apparitions. For any of these to become apparent to an observer, electrical and geomagnetic factors that effect quantum reality have to fall into place. These include electromagnetic fields at the sight, minerals in the soil, the height of the water table, and proximity of high tension wires.Quote 4. What i call \\"ghosts from elsewhen\\" essentially are conscious glimpses into other areas of space-time. As long as the electromagnetic \\"ducks are in line\\" these space-time displacements can happen to anyone, anytime, anywhere. I believe they occur at points where two or more universes overlap.Now i will discuss the chapters of the book.Chapter 1 Ghosts From Elsewhen. Involves ghost stories where the author believes the ghosts are living people in parallel universes. And that you are able to see or hear them due to electromagnetic influences where universes overlap.Chapter 2 Tortured Souls. This chapter involves ghost stories similar to chapter 1. Living people in parallel universes who, \\"while in emotional distress\\", are inadvertantly projecting themselves.Chapter 3 The Parasites. Involves stories of bad entities and poltergiests. The author believes these are entities that live in the void, that feed off of negative, sad, depressed emotions of humans. Can also be referred to as demons by some people. In these stories the entities are attracted to humans in these forms of emotional distress or people who open doorways with things like Ouija boards.Chapter 4 The Ancestors. Discusses connections to the departed and how they can help you.Chapter 5 Death: The Final Frontier? The authors views on death.I believe this was a fairly good book. It is mostly ghost stories with the authors theory mixed in. But let me reassure you that the stories themselves don't get bogged down with his theories. He gets most of his theories out of the way in the introduction. The stories themselves gave me more than a few chills. They were definitly worth reading. And whether you agree with his theories or not, it can be nice to check things out from a different perspective."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"I ripped through this book in a couple of sittings, and literally could not put it down. Paul Eno offers up some fascinating and, what I would call, groundbreaking theories about what exactly ghosts are, and where a lot of those strange little occurrences we have come from. His quantum mechanics approach may set any preconceived notion you have about why we see ghosts on its ear. Be prepared to consider a completely new perspective. The theories are not \\"dumbed-down\\" for those of us who have not made a study of quantum physics. They are explained in clear, thoughtful, and concise terms that any lay-person can understand.The theories he poses go a long way in explaining the extreme and persistent d&eacute;j&agrave; vu I have experienced all my life. The chapter on parasites gave me much insight into what that shadowy little wisp I had in my benign little middle-class house was, why it gained strength over the course of almost two years, and then turned not-so-nice after all. A trusted psychic told me at the time that the thing I had was not human, and that I had picked it up through Tarot cards, both of which Mr. Eno verifies with his explanations.This is paranormal investigation at its finest. Paul Eno has set himself apart as a top-notch investigator of the paranormal. He and his team investigate, with methodical precision, each of these ghosts, poltergeists/parasites, and \\"tortured souls\\" with intellect and compassion. After reading this book, I will NEVER touch a Ouija Board again. Much information is here for the taking - highly recommended for anyone seeking an alternative explanation which is not afraid to deviate from the norm."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"This book was better than faces in the window, although it was good too, This is a book I will keep in my library."},{"Title":"Footsteps in the Attic: More First-Hand Accounts of the Paranormal in New England","review":"Truly an amazing read. My advice is to be very skeptical and test everything. The scientific (quantum reality/multiple dimension) theory to me is very plausible, and although science is biased towards the nonexistence of God, it's slowly moving to its own realization that there is God, and there is intelligent design.

The Earth has travailed to bring forth this &quot;First Mystery, and Sophia/Jerusalem came forth. One must read &quot;She Who Is&quot;, Elizabeth Johnson, along with The Sophia of Jesus Christ, found in the &quot;Nag Hammadi Library, James Robinson. Also, these prayers are accurately in line with the writings of Jesus Christ in the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, G.R.S. Mead. Without Sophia no one reaches the Pleroma to become Angels for Jesus and Sophia, whom He called himself, and his wife, in Heaven. Wonderfully written, such a beautiful love for Sophia, a childlike love, with no conditions on her. She is the Matrix, the Eternal Womb of all Creation, and you have done well in accepting her, and giving her to the world. The Apostle Paul wrote about her, see &quot;The Gnostic Paul&quot;, Elaine Pagels. All his writings are Gnostic in the Bible. Those who find the First Mystery, will be forgiven and forgiven, and escape the judgement of Jesus Christ. The world must accept the writings of Jesus to have on the whole armor of defense-with Sophia they have that armor in the spirit world. Thank you from the depths of my soul. Your book will go all over the world that &quot;She is the Holy Spirit, and Lord."},{"Title":"Then Will Come Night and Darkness","review":"I picked up this book not knowing what to expect, and within a few pages, I was hooked. For a relatively small (215 pages) novel, much develops and deepens in all the important realms: intimacy, mystery, fantasy; love, loss, life. The characters are vivid and stay with you - I found myself wishing they'd lingered even longer. This is not a \\"light\\" book - but it ultimately offers catharsis and redemption, despite its seemingly sad ending. Highly recommended for the discriminating reader."},{"Title":"Then Will Come Night and Darkness","review":"Jennifer Lawler has a knack for providing just the right amount of information. In Then Will Come Night and Darkness, I found myself following the plot like a kitten follows a piece of string. Each time I thought I had it, the string was tugged in a different direction.

In fact, I had trouble putting it down after I started, it is that compelling. The characters are fresh and real -- the author knows them well and the reader ends up caring about them, too, because they emerge as so fully human. Most of all, it's a novel that gives us what we seek in fiction: a deeper understanding of life and insights into our own struggles. If you've ever suffered a loss or endured a drastic change in your life, you'll treasure the earned wisdom and healing power of this moving novel."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"The hardening of the heart is a difficult concept that appears to be a condemnation and has been my struggling point. I have to question how a hardened heart could be a disciplinary act and not a condemnation. One point from the chapters that stuck out was God's loyalty to his promises. After reading through the process of idolatry, hardening and the role of jealousy leading to repentance in Romans, and how that parallels to the Old Testament, I do agree with Meadors. The hardening separates one from God and leads to unnatural acts. It amazes me that God is able to take a sinful characteristic such as jealousy and use it to bring hardened hearts to repentance. While the book showed this clearly for Romans, I still have to contemplate how it works today when we don't have a clear separation like the Jews and Gentile to facilitate the jealousy.Meadors shows how the hardening of the heart is a discipline that God repeatedly uses throughout scriptures. From Pharaoh to Paul's contemporaries, God has hardened hearts as a step in the process of rehabilitation. It is not a condemnation but leaves room for repentance and transformation when Christ removes the veil and the truth can be seen.This is a great resource if you are struggling with the concepts of Idolatry and the hardening of the heart!"},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"\\"Idolatry and Hardening of the Heart\\" written by professor Dr. Edwards is a truly an amazing book. It is both deep and inspiring to read. Edwards looks to answer the issues surrounding Idolatry and the hardening of the heart. As a college student it helped me better understand the destructive power of sin and how Idolatry leads to a hardened heart. After reading this book I feel that I have a much deeper understanding of the issue of Idolatry and why in the end hearts are hardened when they turn away from God. This book really helped show me the importance of the heart and why we need to protect it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a deep yet inspirational read."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart is a very compelling book that helped me better understand biblical theology and some controversial topics that Paul addresses in Romans. I found Paul's multiple references to Old Testament Scripture fascinating and realized how interwoven Scripture is. I gained a greater appreciation for Paul's writing and the way he was able to relate to and gather support from his audience. Overall, I completely agree with the author's conclusions and find his ideas well supported and founded on truth. Every argument had more than enough Scriptural evidence to support its ideas. Meadors really challenged me to dig deeper into Scripture and understand from every angle Paul's message to the church in Rome. I better understand that while God displayed His sovereignty in the hardening of hearts, He did it to accomplish His purposes and to demonstrate His grace and mercy."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"Edward Meadors is a Professor of Biblical Studies at Taylor University. In this book he explores the role of God in the hardening of peoples hearts, through it we can come to better understand God's purpose in hardening peoples hearts, and the role of idolatry in the world both past and present. The book was well structured and showed a large array of the idolatrous practices people have fallen into over the years. The book is very readable, and refreshing because idolatry is mentioned quite often in Christian literature, but rarely is the hardening aspect touched on. The final chapter of contemporary application, and in my opinion the final chapter would do quite well as a stand alone print. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone interested in understanding not only idolatry and its role in our lives, but also the effects of it."},{"Title":"Idolatry and the Hardening of the Heart: A Study in Biblical Theology","review":"The book is a well disciplined treatment of Biblical theology regarding the first two commandments."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"This book will make you laugh and most probably change your perspective on the religion of modern medicine. Mendelsohn candidly brings the shortcomings of modern medicine to light. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I used to be totally trusting of doctors, the way my parents were, but Dr. Mendelsohn made me aware that prescriptions in the long term might not be the way to go. Indeed, the typical old person (and that includes my parents) has a mini-pharmacy in his kitchen, bedroom, or medicine cabinet. Many of the medications are used as \\"watchdogs\\" of other ones. Becoming slave to all these pills and taking them for the rest of my life is not attractive to me. Dr. Mendelsohn assures the reader that there really is a better way to go, but he doesn't go too long on where to look for alternatives. That is something that is left to the reader. In his day, there wasn't much of an Internet. Now, however, there is a gold mine of information about alternate treatments. His book was valuable, though, as a wake-up call.Something that was well-known to cryonicists at the time of the writing of Dr. Mendelsohn's book is that when a person's heart stops beating, causing ischemia in the brain, his brain immediately starts swelling; that swelling clamps the blood vessels feeding the brain. When the heart gets restarted blood circulation cannot take place in the affected areas of the brain, and it is necessary to use calcium blockers and other substances to bring down the swelling and get perfusion. A medical article from 1981 I have from Japan, photocopied for me by a cryonicist, details how a brain surgery was performed that took one and a half hours during which no blood was flowing through the patient's brain; yet the patient came out of the surgery without any neural deficiencies. Neurons apparently do not die any more quickly that any other kinds of cells from blood starvation; the real issue is that they don't ever get blood again when the heart is restarted. I wish Dr. Mendelsohn would have addressed that extremely important matter, but he might not have known about it. I think that doing something about re-establishing blood circulation in the brain would save many a patient in the emergency room. I can only hope that if I have heart stoppage some emergency room doctor will at least try to do it. That is the only significant defect I could find in the book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic was written in the late 1970s, a time when medicine bordered on religion. Back then, Mendelsohn's opinion that doctors cause disease was an uncommon and daring heresy. But now, in 2007, it is quite typical to believe that allopathic medicine is a unnecessary evil. Case in point--the previous 5-star reviewer who notes that \\"Americans, by and large, dislike and distrust their doctors.\\" And without the threat of ingenuous, worshipful patient trust in a corrupt system--what's left to complain about? The corrupt system? This may be the obvious answer, but the corruption is different these days. So much of health care has moved away from reckless overuse of technology and toward \\"complementary medicine\\" that an updated book would be necessary to tackle the new issues that healthcare faces in America.For example: Mendelsohn complains of a health system corrupted by greedy, elitist doctors. In the 21st century, the culprit is more often the big health insurance company, not the lowly GP who usually earns less than a 6-figure salary and struggles to stay in business.So how can this book be dangerous? An example from my personal experience: I suffered from rheumatic fever, a life-threatening condition that killed many people before the 20th century before it was practically eradicated by the use of antibiotics. Why? I was raised in a family where Mendelsohn's attitude was gospel: \\"Avoid modern drugs, they will kill you.\\" So when I got a case of strep throat, I stayed home, stayed away from the evil doctor, and developed a damaged heart valve (a consequence of rheumatic fever). The well-documented near-eradication of rheumatic fever in developed countries since the introduction of antibiotics is one statistic that I doubt Mendelsohn would argue with. Strangely, Mendelsohn avoids mentioning these kinds of statistics--but he's happy to use statistics when they suggest that doctors cause disease.With the caveat that Mendelsohn's blind distrust can be just as dangerous as the blind trust he rails against, Confessions of a Medical Heretic still offers a valuable insight regarding the treadmill effect: medical treatment can perpetuate itself unnecessarily. I would guess that up to 50% of the need for medical treatment could be avoided with better decisions on the part of providers. This does not in any way, however, invalidate \\"modern medicine\\" as a whole."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"A great book and still very relevant, but somewhat outdated. The idea behind the book is the medical profession is riddled with problems and that these problems are, for the most part, swept under the rug. However, this book was published in 1979 and most of the data sighted is from 1970 and before. The author also shows quite a bit of bias against the medical industry and shows this bias more than a realistic view of medical practices.I would like to see the book updated before I would recommend it to anyone. As I said, it's a good premise, but a bit out of date."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"Very very good communication. Despite having an unexpected hospital stay, got my item shipped to me and stayed in communication until I received it. The book was in great condition as described. I'd definitely do business again. Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I think that the book could have been much better if the author had sticked to hard facts instead of delving into his too strongly opiniated beliefs regarding the size of the family, sisters and brothers or birth control. As a model book on doctors and medications, one should read Prescription for Disaster by Thomas J. Moore who reports instead of prescribing religious beliefs. My interest in Mendelsohn's book faded as I progressed in my reading so much so as I discovered his hidden agenda. On page 167 toward the end, he wrote: &quot;If you're not married, think seriously about finding somebody and getting married. If you're married, the most revolutionary act you can perform tonight is to conceive a child.&quot; Obviously, he is a pro life addict. No problem about that, but I was not expecting to find them out so conspicuously and relentlessly in the book. Otherwise, Dr Mendelshon has well deserved gibes at doctors and their Modern Medecine. He should have stayed on this side of the fence instead of telling us what to do with our spouse in our bedroom."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I disagreed with Mendelsohn 21 years ago, and I disagree now. There are just as many patients who want drugs and surgery. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics from their overuse is one result. Most of us don't know Latin and much of physicians' perceived power has been taken over by corporate medicine. There is a lot wrong with the medical profession, but a lot that is right, including the ability to save someone's sorry skin after years of abusing one's body."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"This book is the darling of quacks who, instead of being able to show effectivness and validity for their methods, use it to scare people into thinking that medicine in the year 2000 is still dangerous and ineffective. In reality, this book was valuable when it was published (in the 1970's I believe) and helped correct many of the problems it detailed. Now in the year 2000, medicine has improved greatly and no longer suffers from the problems outlined in this book.Unfortunately for the public, quacky chiropractors continue to reference this book as proof that the medical establishment is a failure and that this makes their abuses tolerable.If you want current information about health care skip this book and purchase Dr. Chotkowski's book, &quot;What's New in Medicine : More Than 250 of the Biggest Health Stories of the Decade.\\"If you are interested in chiropractic information I recommend George Magner's, &quot;Chiropractic-The Victim's Perspective&quot; and Steve Barrett's &quot;The Health Robbers.&quot;Be well."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"+++++The idea behind this book can be ascertained from its title. The word \\"confession\\" means to admit. What the late Dr. Robert Mendelsohn does is to admit truths about what he calls the \\"Church of Modern Medicine.\\" A \\"heretic\\" is a person who professes to heresy. A heresy is any opinion opposed to established doctrines.Thus, Mendelsohn in his book tells us truths and his opinions (based on his excellent qualifications) regarding orthodox medicine. His opinions are angry ones. (I'd be angry too if I spent my entire life in orthodox medicine only to discover that it is not what it claims to be.) Like anyone who is angry, the author occasionally goes off on tangents but overall he sticks to the main premise of the book.What is the premise of this book? Mendelsohn tells us this immediately in the book's opening section called the \\"Non Credo.\\" He states, \\"I do not believe in modern medicine. I am a medical heretic. My aim of this book is to persuade you to become a heretic, too.\\" (Notice, that contrary to popular belief, the premise of this book is not to tell you to stop seeing your doctor.)Each chapter (there are nine) of this book has many truths. These truths are not out-of-date and will probably remain relevant into the far future. Here are just three examples:1) \\"Every drug stresses and hurts your body in some way.\\"2) \\"A healthy society is characterized by strong, positive family relationships and subsequent minimal need of doctors.\\"3) \\"Doctors are not trained to attack the core of any problem, merely to suppress symptoms.\\"Sometimes, the author juxtaposes two truths to make a point. My favorite: \\"All their [that is, doctors'] intentions may be good, but we all know what the road to Hell is paved with.\\"What I really noticed about this book is the author's strong opinions. Here, again, are three examples:1) \\"Doctors in general should be treated with the same degree of trust as used-car salesmen.\\"2) \\"When I meet a doctor, I generally figure I'm meeting a person who is narrow-minded, prejudiced, and fairly incapable of reasoning and deliberation.\\"3) \\"Get used to the idea right away that no single system can or should claim to have an exclusive fix on the dynamics of health.\\"There is even discussion about non-drug medicine. Mendelsohn states, \\"In the Church of Modern Medicine, the doctor who treats without drugs is regarded as a heretic because he or she appears to have rejected the sacrament of medication.\\" Today, orthodox medicine calls such people \\"quacks.\\" One of the people they call a quack, the author mentions, is Dr. Linus Pauling because he wanted to treat without drugs. The late Linus Pauling was a two-time Nobel Prize winner. Question: What gives orthodox medicine the right to call such a brilliant person a quack? His credentials prove otherwise.The book's last section is called, \\"Epilog: In search of the New Doctor.\\" It is an interesting section where Mendelsohn gives his vision of the doctor of the future. This vision has yet to be achieved and my guess is, it will never be achieved.The only problem I had with this book is the lack of footnotes with respect to specific numbers and statistics. When statistics are given, you have to give credit to their source. However, Mendelsohn does supply many references.Another good book on this subject that is less opinionated is \\"The Medical Mafia\\" (1995) by Dr. Guylaine Lanctot. I think this title is a good indicator of its contents.In conclusion, Dr. Robert Mendelsohn's book does a good job in exposing the truths behind orthodox medicine. These truths are what you and your family should know for their own protection. I strongly recommend this book if you want to become aware of these truths.**** 1/2+++++"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"\\"A hospital is like a war\\" Here you have it from a doctor who has been there and done that.

I really liked how the author dug into the philosophical aspects of doctor/patient relationships: the absolute power we give them. And it was neat to find someone -- a doctor even -- who agreed with my perception that doctors have their own secret language which protects their knowledge (their power) and wouldn't you know, it's LATIN. (If you're a devout Catholic be forewarned.) But best of all, this book is absolutely hilarious. You might as well keep your sense of humor in all of this, and I found myself laughing out loud as I read."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I read this book a long time ago, but have never forgotten it. For anyone who has doubts about the benevolence of the AMA, pharmaceutical companies and the allied health industries or has suffered from drug interactions, side effects, long-term effects, misadiagnoses, botched treatments, apathy or arrogance on the part of medical providers, this book is MUST reading. This is one of the first mainstream books to address these issues and to suggest alternative treatments."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"This book is a must for everyone interested in promoting and preserving good health. Sadly, instead of educating the public in proper nutrition, focusing on disease prevention measures, and researching, studying and promoting the use of effective natural cures, the far removed from nature western medical establishment is indoctrinated into subscribing and relying entirely on pharmaceutical drugs, many of which are ineffective and produce debilitating, dangerous and sometimes lethal side effects.The cruel reality is that the self serving pharmaceutical drug companies with the assistance of the FDA suppress information and access to healing herb remedies and natural cures in order to keep the public ignorant and completely dependent on their profitable patented drugs. Have cancer? They will make sure you have no other choice but to buy their highly expensive, minimally effective poisonous drugs combined with maiming medical surgical procedures.The pharmaceutical industry will do everything possible to protect their profits and make us stay away from any natural cures such as the Alpha Omega Lab's \\"Cansema\\" herb combination treatment which effectively cured cancer in thousands of people including my mother.Pharmaceutical companies and their well paid partner, the FDA, will promptly accuse those natural healers and God sent angels of quackery and will see to it that anyone who offers effective natural cures will face swift persecution and unjust prosecution. If interested, you can read the full story of the original Cansema and the unwarranted FDA raid of Alpha Omega Labs posted by Chris Gupta on the web.There is no doubt there are quacks to watch out for in this world, but make no mistake, there is no quack larger than the pharmaceutical conglomerate. The suppressed and hidden truth is that the effective (and inexpensive) cures for ALL deceases are available out there in nature, right now. With a little ingenuity and persistence, open minded regular folks can do their own research and educate themselves with printed material available in libraries, bookstores and the internet.Thanks to the loving work of angels walking the earth - people of good will among us, anyone can find out about effective and inexpensive natural cures for cancers, degenerative diseases and chronic ailments. But be warned, don't expect your personal physician to support you on this life saving task. Most physicians although well intended are brainwashed. Many are so vested on pharmaceuticals they are completely unaware of and against natural healing substances and will understandably dismiss their effectiveness as quackery. A selected few are wise enough to break the binds of a hostile and intimidating system, but only the \\"holy and holistic\\" ones like Robert Mendelsohn are courageous enough to blow the whistle so that you and I can save ourselves and the people we love who will listen."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"This is a MUST READ book for every person who is interested in optimum health.

But it is all about the money!!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"Unfortunately for me, I am currently suffering from the side effects of a prescribed medication (the muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine), so I am sensitized.Another reveiwer (A Customer) says that Mendelsohn's 1979 message is out of date. On page 26, Confessions of a Medical Heretic states that in the US, annual deaths from adverse reactions to prescribed drugs run around 20,000 to 30,000 per year. According to my research, current (2013) estimates put this figure at 100,000 to 300,000. So in this aspect at least I would not call Mendelsohn out of date. It's not like the problem has been solved.I love Dr. Mendelsohn, and would follow him anywhere. Wait a minute. That is exactly the kind of blind faith that he was cautioning against. Didn't I learn anything? I would question him everywhere. Actually Mendelsohn passed away in 1988, so he is no longer available for questioning. But one thing I would question is his opposition to national health insurance. Having lived both under it, and out from under it, it seems to me that under it is better. But maybe there is some subtlety that I am missing? Maybe it's something about the insurance part.Anyway, I am sure that Mendelsohn must have had many positive experiences during his long and illustrious career, and he mentions (p. 25) having been proud to have taken part in the miracle of Modern Medicine. But he felt that a cautionary message was needed, so that is what he wrote. Page 167: \\"I have written this book precisely to scare and to radicalize people BEFORE they are hurt.\\"My quick summary review:Pros: Very good rundown of the perverse incentives and shortcomings that actively drive the medical establishment.Cons: Mendelsohn is a bit heavy handed with his Modern-Medicine-as-religion analogy. Not that he's wrong, mind you, but he pounds it. Of course I am not a physician and I do not have his years of experience; maybe if were and I did, I'd pound it too.One thing that HAS changed since 1979 is the internet availibility of medical information. The patient's job is a lot easier since access to a PDR is no longer necessary.This is an excellent book, and until we revamp or somehow generate ourselves a more humane, true health care system, the book is at least as germane as when it was first published. And that's not just the cyclobenzaprine talking either. Applying the principles in this book could save your life, or your quality of life, or that of a loved one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I have been looking for this book for a while.

I'd already had numerous instances where I questioned my doctors. I nearly died when I was younger because of my doctor's mistakes.When I was a small child, I was misdiagnosed with an enlarged heart, but thankfully did not suffer any bogus treatments or surgery. While studying for my BA, I was misdiagnosed with a disease that could have had dire consequenses, and throughout my childhood I received unnecessary antibiotics, including penicillin, and now I'm at the mercy of superbugs. I was later diagnosed (from positive skin tests) with \\"latent TB\\", and have been advised to go through a 6 month antibiotic treatment. In researching the treatment, I found that there is a 1:10 chance the treatment could destroy my liver. No thanks! I've lost friends to the barbaric conventional cancer treatments that supports a money hungry and questionable \\"search for the cure\\".Dr. Mendelsohn spilled the beans about the medical establishment and the AMA over 30 years ago. He was possibly one of the pioneers. Since then, other books like Food Politics, The Great White Lie, How to Get Out of The Hospital Alive, Prescription for Disaster, Heart Frauds, The Medical Mafia, Racketeering in Medicine, The Cancer Industry, and others expose what you rarely hear or read about in the media. The AMA and the drug companies \\"own\\" the media with their multi-million dollar marketing budgets! Rarely do we hear about the many drugs that have been withdrawn, or of the \\"black box warnings\\" or our new prescriptions, or the ongoing scandels within the FDA. Rarely do we hear about the dangers of prescription drugs and the safer \\"non FDA approved\\" treatments that treat illnesses, save lives and CURE diseases (but are prohibited from saying so), rather than create dangerous and often deadly side-effects, that kill over 100,000 people each year-even when taking their FDA-approved drugs as directed! The current system is designed to treat you for life until death. (The more drugs the better) In the meantime, they will deplete your insurance or your bank account. When you die from the treatments or the drugs they'll say, \\"they would have died anyway from the disease.....\\". Rarely do you see a death certificate listing a treatment as a cause of death-unless it's listed as \\"an overdose\\". We usually assume the overdose was on purpose-but often that was the PRESCRIBED DOSE! Sometimes we see \\"they died of complications from...\\", but it was likely from the treatment (or IMPROPER treatment), not the disease.This book will create an appetite in you for more information, and it will make you question why we don't hear the truth from our trusted media. It will give you the courage to question your doctors, and possily motivate you to take better care of your health and the desire to warn others around you about the truth, dangers, and corruption of our US Healthcare system-that is the most expensive in the world, but at the bottom of the list in creating health and wellness.

The sad part is that, except for the fact that lots of the actual procedures, tests and drugs Dr. Mendelsohn wrote about in this book have changed, almost everything else seems to have remained the same.I must therefore disagree with those whose comments here suggest that things are not so bad today, and that Dr. Mendelsohn's book is therefore not as relevant as it was when it was written. For instance, one young resident wrote in his comment that \\"so many treatments which he [Mendelsohn] describes as ineffective or harmful have been replaced or improved.\\" And he concludes that \\"thus, a lot of his criticisms are not applicable to today's medical practice.\\" I'd like to remind people of Dr. Mendelsohn's famous quote (and my very favorite of his wonderful quotes): \\"Doctors don't let go of one medication until they find a more dangerous one to replace it.\\" The same might apply to many medical procedures and diagnostic tests!In his day, Dr. Mendelsohn was a \\"media darling,\\" partly because of his controversial message, and partly because of his brilliant use of witty \\"sound bites.\\" He was on talk shows all the time, and he actually made a difference in the way people viewed our medical system.

Doctors today still get angry if you ask any questions, doctors today still refuse to accept that only patient has a right to make decisions concerning his/her own body. However, I disagree with his comments and attitudes concerning family. The fact that someone is your blood relation is no guarantee whatsoever that that someone would act in your best interest and protect you from unnecessary/unwanted medical interventions. Especialy if your views are a bit more radical than those of the rest of your family. In those matters, I'd rather beleive my lawyer to ensure that my &quot;living will&quot; will be observed, or else they'll be sued. It is still true that doctors are more ften sued for not doing something and not for doing unenecessary things, however from my point of view causing unnecessary suffering for the purpose of minimizing risk for litigation is outrageous. All in all, this book is interesting and easy to read, though I strongly disagree with his views on family especially size of the family. He seems to assume that everybody wants to have dozens of kids, and in his recommendations for home birth once you get married (with which I agree IF you want to have kids, since this is the best way to avoid unnecessary and harmful interventions, including episiotomy which seems to be only surgical procedure for which lack of consent is relative contraindication) he seems to disregard the fact that there are couples who are quite happy to be childfree. Other than his conservative views on family, the book is quite good."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"I've had the pleasure & honor of being seated next to Robert Mendelsohn at a Preventive Medicine seminar in Palms Springs. We compared writing projects, and of course his \\"Medical Heretic\\" was on the bookshelves & piercing thousands of degreed egos. The man struck me as a visionary, entirely unafraid of rocking the traditional boat called health care. In less than 200 pages, this book deftly puts a dagger through the heart of his profession's self-aggrandizement - and does so from the inside out. As a Paramedic, I've carried copies of \\"Heretic\\" for years - in ambulances, helicopters & emergency rooms, causing quite a stir among my medical peers. Thanks to him, I too learned to view medical care with a healthy dose of logic.I want to thank you, Bob, wherever you are in the cosmos. Through this book, your inherent wisdom has helped keep countless thousands of new physicians & paramedics ethically grounded, by providing a moral compass for those of us who happen to be - more often than not - supremely impressed by our own stethoscopes. I also thank you for giving me the strength to get \\"America's Dumbest Doctors\\" into the hands of those in desperate need of learning that in medicine, precious little is as it seems.(K.

It's in the Obstetrician that recommends C-section as a way to preserve your vaginal canal from stretching, it's in the Pediatrician who recommends you supplement your infant's diet with formula, it's in the Dr. who recommends mastectomy in a healthy young woman with family history of breast cancer as a preventative measure.Seriously though, this book is really an eye-opener and importantly what it teaches you is how to protect yourself and your loved ones from the potential harms that doctors can afflict on you whether intentional or unintentional.

The information can be backed up any and everywhere but it's something most people have not thought about. People need to think about what they are doing and why they think a doctor can heal them using random drugs (that they get paid for selling to you) which have not been proven to help anything and have pages of warnings and side effects that are often ten times worse than whatever problem people are expecting the drug to help. I have had the things in this book backed up personally when a doctor told me I would need surgery for a slight hernia. Now think for just a minute: a hernia is a weakened strained muscle, does cutting into it and stabbing it through with a needle and thread to sew it back up really seem like it would help? Yet when I kept asking what I could do to help the injury naturally - he refused to answer, just said that I would need surgery. I went home, looked it up, and all I needed to do was rest, and stop doing the push ups that were hurting it and it's been totally fine - without any surgery!Everyone should read this book and start thinking!!!

Could there be some sort of religions significance of receiving ten of something in two tablets?\\" More seriously, he points out that \\"Modern Medicine is an idolatrous religion, for what it holds sacred are not living things but mechanical processes.\\"Mendelsohn himself may be credited with prophecy in light of the 2005 Vioxx fiasco, as he was writing this in 1979: \\"One of the unwritten rules of Modern Medicine is always to write a prescription for a new drug quickly, before all of its side effects have come to the surface. Nowhere is this syndrome more evident than in the unleashing of the herd of new antiarthritic drugs on unsuspecting patients.\\"Not only most drugs are unnecessary and dangerous, according to the author, but also most operations, and even just being in the hospital, with its germs, poor diet, emotional stresses, and isolation of the patient from family and friends. As to preventive medicine, he states, \\"If this is preventive medicine, I'll take my chances with disease.\\"I ordered the book during a recent strike of family physicians in the Netherlands. Physicians here are not allowed to stay on strike more than three days consecutively. Having lived in other countries where physicians' strikes lasted for months, I was aware that at their conclusion, statistics consistently reveal a drop in mortality during the strike period. However, at the time I didn't foresee that decades later I would become an activist, so failed to keep newspaper clippings to use as references. On the Internet I learned that Mendelsohn refers to physicians' strikes in this book, but I didn't realize that he had already published it in 1979, before the strikes I experienced. Also, unfortunately, he does not provide sources for his claims. In the bibliography he explains that he purposely avoided footnotes so as not to interfere with the reader's concentration on the book itself and because his ideas are plain common sense. He's right that the book is comfortable to read this way, but a claim like drops in mortality during physicians' strikes does need to be buttressed by a source, which I now still do not have.Plain common sense, however, is quite satisfactory a source when he states: \\"What was once an option of a free people is becoming an enforced obligation. ... If doctors didn't want more and more power over the individual, why would more and more medical procedures be showing up as laws?... [N]ormally alert and powerful organizations like labor unions and the American Civil Liberties Union haven't responded to this threat against our freedom. They fail to acknowledge the problem because they subscribe to the religion of Modern Medicine.\\"Mendelsohn's otherwise excellent book goes off on a tangent when he tries to meet the demand for an alternative vision. The new type of doctor he fantasizes is not only unrealistic, but just as much a priest as the kind he disparages, only of a different sect. MeTZelf's alternative vision is to make us a nation of priests by educating everybody in medicine.

For these people, Dr. Mendelsohn's &quot;Confessions of a Medical Heretic&quot; is a must read.&quot;Confessions of a Medical Heretic&quot; is obviously more of an opinionated piece rather than a hard, scientific study, though Dr. Mendelsohn has plenty of statistics in his arsenal to fire at the reader. He compares the medical establishment to a church (&quot;The Church of Modern Medicine&quot;), where patients go religiously and on blind faith, trusting whatever is told to them about their health. A good checkup from a doctor is like the sacraments of the church. He warns that a lot of medication is unnecessary, and often more harmful considering that the side effects of medication are often more severe than the illness it is being used to treat. He also preaches that most surgery is unnecessary, visiting the doctor on a regular basis is unnecessary, and trusting what the doctor tells you could be hazardous to your health. Even if you don't buy into this as you read, he makes a good point that we are our own best judges, in terms of health. We should question what the doctors are doing to us, and we should know all the risks. He also expands on the common belief that the medical profession is moved by money, and that the patients needs are often secondary. Even the merits of things like hospital rules (visiting hours) and the use of tools like the X-ray machine and the stethoscope are called into question. It makes for some interesting reading, but like all things, you should take it with a grain of salt.Dr. Mendelsohn does keep in mind contingencies where medical treatment is essential, like accident or gunshot victims, but he does go overboard with encouraging all people to avoid doctors and hospitals. Maybe this is hard for me to swallow, being raised with blind faith in the &quot;Church of Modern Medicine&quot;. I see a strong need for doctors, and going to the doctor to ensure that my blood pressure, cholesterol, and organ function is all in check is essential to my well being. I cannot take Dr. Mendelsohn at his word and just give it up. But I liked the fact that the book made me think harder about the medical establishment that I have subscribed to my entire life. I guess in that respect Dr. Mendelsohn succeeded in getting his message across to me.One flaw that I feel plagued &quot;Confessions of a Medical Heretic&quot; is the lack of footnoting. He gives some very specific numbers and statistics to back up his points, but he does not quote his sources. In the bibliography, he mentions that his reason is that a) he didn't want to ruin the pace of the book, and b) he wanted his points to be taken as common sense. When presenting hard data, it would be nice to know the source. Not to include footnoting when quoting or giving data is sloppy structuring.Overall, I enjoyed &quot;Confessions of a Medical Heretic&quot;. It is engaging and well written, and is sure to provoke though and stimulate conversation. As with most books of this kind, I do take it with a grain of salt and I am not about to put anything Dr. Mendelsohn says into practice. But this is a book that will give the reader a new perspective on the medical establishment."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Medical Heretic","review":"When I was very young I was shot up with all the available vaccines and came down really sick after each shot.

This lets us willingly submit to our impulses, no longer looking upon ourselves as reasonable, self-determined individuals, but as beings governed by instincts and inclinations\\" (p 189)despite the fact that she considers belief in astrology unreasonable she goes on to list the qualities of each moon sign.you get the feeling from sachs' writing that she finds moon lore curious but she holds no reverence for the moon herself."},{"Title":"The Moon","review":"I always look at the moon. My mother's family was from Transylvania and my &quot;Moon&quot; sign is in Cancer. But, after reading the Moon, I will never look at the moon quite the same. Maryann Sachs has given me a new perspective on and appreciation for cultural mysticism and empiricism. The book is so artfully crafted it borders on the sacred."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"This is a journal by a twenty something educated Baghdad woman writen almost daily from the time of the invasion and a picture of what has happened to her city and her family and how they cope - the lack of electricity, water and safety, the constant explosions and the troops breaking into homes and the loss of women's freedoms. She started out (See Baghdad Burning I) being encouraged but the horror of the last years has changed her outlook. She tells of women now having to be scarfed, wear long dresses and not drive and being terrorized by the fanatics and the military and police.Emotionally, It is hard to read in great gulps but for a full understanding of what is happening to the daily lives of people of Baghdad I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"The collections of blogs written by the Iraqi woman only known as \\"Riverbend\\" in what has become the \\"Baghdad Burning\\" series, is the best source of information to read to know about how the actual Iraqis are living and dying in the occupied country. More than \\"The Assassin's Gate\\" or \\"Fiasco,\\" \\"Baghdad Burning\\" and \\"Baghdad Burning II\\" tell the truth about the Bush junta's imperialist war in Iraq and how it has affected the lives of its inhabitants. With grace and fine detail we learn about the loss of basic resources like water and electricity, the fear Iraqis live under with the threat of militia violence and U.S. commando raids on their homes. We get here a portrait of a nation descending into civil war as an occupying foreign force only makes things worse. Conservative pundits and pro-war screamers should read the sections where Riverbend begs the American people not to re-elect George Bush and where she describes the carnage and outright war crimes that took place with the destruction of Fallujah. What will be striking to many is how easily one can put his or herself in Riverbend's shoes as she describes her battles with the internet and her TV-viewing habits. It is poignant to read an Iraqi attacking Fox News for it's obvious distortion of the facts, of course Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity will claim they know more about what's best for Iraq than the actual IRAQIS. \\"Baghdad Burning II\\" is even more heartbreaking than the first volume because here the nation has descended into the deep abyss in which we are still mired, the terror has arrived in full spectrum and now the streets are truly not safe, the invaders and guerrillas roam the streets and sons and daughters are being slaughtered. What people should find disturbing about reading this collection of blogs is that indeed, our government has decided to raid a nation it does not understand at all, just read Riverbend's comments on the Iraqi elections and on how as the months pass, the people begin to see their government more as a puppet regime, read here about the basic misunderstanding of Iraqi culture and language, customes and tradition. These are not backwards people we can just push around, nobody is. \\"Baghdad Burning II\\" is a powerful, important document for the world, for everyone to read and understand what the consequences and effects are of colonialism, of imperialist war. It is written with a depth and insight priceless for those of us living on the other side which is usually the side that doesn't understand. In the years to come \\"Baghdad Burning\\" will be seen as one of the definitive accounts of life inside Iraq during the war, no doubt future generations will be just as moved, and find it just as important as our generation should."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"That anyone could read this woman's sensitive, heartfelt assessment of what is happening to her country and not be touched by it, is just another example of how this country is continuing to digress instead of make positive progress. How many people have to die in this mindless, spindless war before we all wake up and demand that our government pull our soldiers out and make some attempt to salvage the damage we have done to our reputation and the state of this country.We have not improved the conditions in Iraq, Riverbend's blog is evidence of that. We have not found the \\"supposed\\" Weapons of Mass Destruction. And we have not made Iraq a safer Iraq by killing Saddam. For all of the atrocities Saddam did in his lifetime, we have sadly, put our men and women of the Arms Services in a no-win position so that they too are being forced by their government to cause more chaos than peace.They should never have been sent over there in the first place, and the fact that we as citizens have buried our heads in the sand and allowed ourselves to easily become sidetracked by stupid, ignorant \\"news\\" stories (who cares if Brittany, Nicole or Paris self-distruct?!?)instead of asking, \\"Why won't our government allow us to see the Baghdad that Riverbend discusses in her blog?\\" Or \\"Why is the war being sanitized to the point that our dead are reduced to numbers instead of names?\\" Or bigger why, \\"Why is Bush and his cronies being allowed full reign to do whatever they want and no one is investigating them or demanding some type of hearings?\\"I mean, we were forced to sit through hours after hours of hearings about Clinton's sexual behavior in the White House. One would think that thousands dead on Bush's watch would be worth some type of investigation. I am so tired of people acting as if what is going on in Iraq is for anything other than the personal gain of Bush and those who are in his inner circle. Let's call a spade a spade. When all of the lines and dots are connected, it will become abundantly clear who came out on top in this war, and it wasn't the Iraqi citizens, or the American Armed Forces or the American people. Could it be U.S. Defense contractors? Could it be Oil Contractors?America has a long-time habit of glossing over or simply rewriting history so that we can sleep easy at night. I say, bring on the nightmares. We need to experience restless sleep or no sleep until this horrendous mission of Bush's is done. We shouldn't find peace in our dreams until the killing has ceased. Maybe if we toss and turn a few nights like Riverbend has had to,we will begin to make some thoughtful and unselfish demands of our government and the self-appointed leader of the world, Bush. We will demand that Bush (I refuse to call him president) bring our soldiers home, help in whatever way the Iraqis need us to rebuild their country, and fully acknowledge his wrongdoing in all of this craziness. For good measure, he would admit he is incapable of running this country even one more day and will step down...followed by his band of idiots (Condi, Chaney and the gang).My one hope for Riverbend and her family, now that they have hopefully left Baghdad,is that they are all finding a peaceful place to lay their heads and are finally getting some much deserved rest."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"This should be a must-read for anyone who has forgotten that Iraqis are human. It is a very intense book and the reader cannot help but get caught up in the daily struggle in a hellish world. Too bad those U.S. government officials who do the planning probably will never read it."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"I actually bought these books for a couple of friends, but I have read the original blogs online since the beginning of the Iraq war. The author, a young woman with a good job in the computer field loses her job after the war starts and begins a blog about the daily life and politics of Iraq. Written nder the ghost name of \\"Riverbend\\", it is a fascinating insight into what it's REALLY like to live in Baghdad during this period of war and unrest. She is extremely articulate, witty and has a great sarcastic sense of humor. She evokes laughter at times, but mostly sadness, anger and frustration as the situation continues to deteriorate. As I read her blogs, I found myself always anxious to read the next one. The first-hand account insight you will get is invaluable in understanding the greater impact on the REAL people who are living through this nightmare that was forced upon them. Her writings have won several awards, and having read many blogs from Iraq, I believe hers is the best. Those who I bought the book for said they were engaged from the start and couldn't put it down. It is a fast read, but you will have to visit her website to see how the story continues. I urge everyone to read her books, especially if you want to know what it's REALLY like living in a war zone from an intelligent Iraqi perspective."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"I actually read Riverbend's blog as she wrote it. After she moved to Syria, her writing stopped, so I was glad to be able to get her second book. I hope she and her family moved on to a different safe place! I really grew to love Riverbend like a granddaughter and wish her and her entire family well. I also wish most people could read both of her books."},{"Title":"Baghdad Burning II: More Girl Blog from Iraq (Women Writing the Middle East)","review":"Riverbend is a young Sunni female that writes from the perspective of hating the loss of Sunni power and privilege. She indicates this with her contempt for the Iraqi elections and the new Shia dominated government. She frequently complains of losing the good old days when her family benefited from Saddam Hussein's brutal dictatorship.Riverbend now talks of having to leave Iraq (she is a supporter of the terrorists in Iraq) and going to either Jordan or Syria. She hints that this is just a \\"stopover\\" on her way to another place. No doubt she is considering moving to the United States that she hates so much. Riverbend is an enemy of the United States and should be prevented from visiting the U.S. or any coalition country."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"Blair S. Walker keeps you intrigued with a great mystery line and laughing at the lead character Darryl Billups. I could not put this book down. Blair Walker only has three books published at this time and cannot wait for the fourth."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I had never heard of this author before, but am glad that I've discovered him. There are several aspects to this first book of his. There's the main situation of a Black reporter pestered by \\"crank\\" calls from an androgynous voice claiming that NAACP headquarters in Baltimore is being targetted by terrorists. We experience this through the protagonist's first person, present tense, narration. I've encountered present tense writing before through another author who, in my opinion, misuses the gimmick. However, Blair S. Walker masterfully uses the present tense narration to help create tension. We also visit the perp's consciousness in the usual third person, past tense chapters.This first novel indicates a lot of promise for the author and the series although I presently am aware of only three books with no recent ones by him. There is some weakness, and I felt that the story sort of gets lost for a while in the later chapters while more emphasis is on our hero's romantic life than in the problem of a terrorist. However, this is offset by an honest portrayal of how a professional Black is treated in the predominantly White newspaper environment.If, like me, you've discovered the first three in the series at the same time, do start with this first book. That will make the reading of the following ones more meaningful."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I read the second novel in this series before reading \\"Up Jumped the Devil\\", so I was already familiar with Darryl Billups and his circle of friends, colleagues, and adversaries. The edition I read was as originally-published, in the late 90s, so it reflected pre-cellphone culture.\\"Up Jumped the Devil\\" was even better than the sequel, introducing journalist Darryl Billups as a very likeable hero. Though I have never worked for a newspaper, my undergraduate degree is in journalism, and I have served as a media liaison for the law enforcement agencies I worked for. It's obvious that author Blake Walker really IS a journalist, not a poser, by the way he describes newsroom and editorial politics, relationships with the Baltimore City Police Department, and building a crew of sources.The plot was believeable, and very engrossing.My only quibble with this edition is that the author recently updated the novel, for example, inserting references to Sarah Palin and Barack Obama. He didn't go through the entire book and update everything to correspond to those inserted references, which struck a jarring note when I came across them. Aside from that minor complaint, I really enjoyed this highly plausible story, and spending more time getting to know Darryl Billups. I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"Up jumped the Devil by Blair Walker , as a new author I found this book down to earth with each character believable and at time humorous.The publishers announced that this was a mystery, half mystery and thriller.It kept me still turning the page well after the clock moved past my bedtime.There was just enough side history of the characters that allowed you to get to know them without the over details of the color of buttons or the size of their hats. (bg)Of late new releases are plots around Newspapers and reporters, also themes of late are of terrorism, all newspapers, reporters and terrorism you will find in this new first release.I would recommend this for an interesting one time read. But, not one I would re -read. If, you know what I mean. Although it was one of pleasure while turning its pages.Enough said :)"},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"Although I had a choice of which book to start with in this series, I decided to go with the first so that I could start from scratch. When choosing a first book, we don't always get an authors best writing - sometimes it takes a book or two to settle into a series. That said, I really enjoyed Up Jumped the Devil and plan on following up with later books by this author.Darryl Billups is a Baltimore Herald writer who covers the police beat and often ends up on the front page. He also seems to get involved with the criminal side when they don't care for the coverage or how he writes his articles. He is also a sassy, outspoken guy who doesn't always get along with his fellow newspaper reporters.The plot takes its twists and turns, the men are gruff and the women are tough. Darryl meets a woman that challenges him as well as draws him into her orbit.As he tries to foil a terrorist plot, he finds out just who he can trust and who does not have his best interests in mind. This is an interesting first novel and a great start for a series. Having the lead as a newspaper reporter in a city such as Baltimore certainly opens up plenty of opportunity for future novels, and possibly a TV show or movie - it has that much action and charactor.Mystery fans who love a gritty, hardbitten story with plenty of humor and entertaiment will want to check out this first in the series."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"This story has two point of view characters, one sympathetic and the other a psychopath. Fortunately the sympathetic character gets the first person voice. That's Darryl Billups, black reporter for the white-run Baltimore Herald. Author Blair Walker is indeed a former reporter for Southern newspapers. Actually one point that Walker is making is that Baltimore is a predominately black town served by a white-biased newspaper. He includes what we used to call an Uncle Tom, in this case, an ambitious black reporter who writes to please the white bosses.But mostly this is a smart story about a white supremacist's plans to bomb the NAACP headquarters along with a few \\"statements\\" on the way vs our reporter's attempts to get someone to believe his anonymous caller tipping him off about these plans.And we have a love interest for the subplot. I mostly read women's mysteries, some of which have the same subplot. So it's interesting to see the other side of the formula. I am impressed with Walker's choice. Obviously this is his fantasy, just as the love interests in the women's books reflect their fantasies. So she's young, slender, proud, black, and a single mother. Hey, a guy who is willing to be involved with a young mother and child. More points for Walker and another star for the review.At first I wasn't impressed with the writing, but as I continued to read, I got into the rhythm of the prose. Maybe the beginning was a bit rough. Keep reading. I waited a day or so before writing this review to see if the story stuck with me. It has. And I look forward to reading at least the next two in the series."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"After enjoying recent novels by Journalists Bruce DeSilva, Charles Salzberg and Harold Michael Harvey, I was enthused to find Blair S. Walker and his mystery series. Walker has been with USA Today, New York Newsday, the Washington Post and with the Associated Press. This is the first of the three already available novels, featuring investigative reporter Darryl Billups. A great beginning!Hate crimes are often conceived by a few individuals who have either been indoctrinated from early life or have been hurt by the \\"system\\" in some way. Dillard had been taught by his grandmother who, perhaps unknowingly, taught him to hate anybody that was different from him. Loving his grandmother, he had learned to hate everybody that she spoke against. Now his hate was his only driving force...He had been able to capture the attention of a few individuals that had similar feelings--one had been recently overlooked for a promotion that had been made based upon affirmative action rather than seniority. Another was a demolitions expert, taught while in the armed forces. The other, Rick Allen, was, or seemed to be, merely a groupie, a fan of Dillard...but he was an undercover cop...Dillard had borrowed Allen's truck and had been carrying neo-Nazi propaganda, blasting caps and dynamite when he ran out of gas and got involved with the police. Soon he was in a shootout and had wounded a Baltimore cop, while getting away. He immediately called Allen to let him know that his truck was being held by the police and during the confusion that occurred afterward, Dillard discovered that Allen was a cop! He was the group's first victim...and then there were three...There were several actions they had planned: demolishing the NAACP Headquarters, killing a local Jewish philanthropist who was known to contribute large sums of money to minority groups. Now, however, using the personal loss to Harold Boyles' when he didn't get his expected promotion, Dillard got the group psyched to take revenge by bombing one or more of the company's new garbage trucks. Unfortunately, Boyles' best friend was killed in the blast; Boyles was so upset at what he'd done that he committed suicide. And then there were two...In the meantime, Darryl Billups is dealing with daily issues for the Baltimore crime beat, while trying to stay out of the politics of working for a predominantly white-owned/managed newspaper, and especially with his immediate supervisor, who is constantly trying to put Darryl in a bad light. When Darryl begins getting calls from an autonomous informer, telling about the planned NAACP bombing and the murder of the community leader, he immediately places calls to a homicide police officer with whom he's earlier worked, and to his newspaper. The woman with whom he spoke, however, lied about receiving the information! His supervisor began his campaign to get him off the crime beat, but, instead, Billups continues to receive the calls. The Managing Editor keeps Billups working on the case...I missed an important clue along the way, so I was completely surprised at the end regarding the anonymous caller. But that's alright, because I enjoyed trying to guess who was doing what along the way. The climatic ending was thoroughly satisfying, especially afterwards, when Darryl began to receive job offers and quit his job... having to encounter any form of discrimination on the job is just not worth staying, in my opinion!If you enjoy a good action mystery and would like to see behind the scenes regarding crime reporting and the interaction between the police and the newspaper--what gets reported and what doesn't, sometimes...then I believe you, too, will enjoy Up Jumped The Devil!Perhaps, one day, there will be no hate crimes to be reported in our daily news. Learning more about the participants may be a way to discover and prevent such crimes. I commend authors who create fictional stories based upon what is happening daily in our lives. This one does just that! Highly recommended...Book Received ViaAmazon VineGABixlerReviews"},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"This is a great start to looks to be a series.The novel is more of a character study than a mystery or thriller. It introduces Darryl Billups, a black writer for the Baltimore Herald. He is an interesting character with real relationships - good and bad - with co-workers and women.As we get to know Darryl and his supporting cast, we also learn of a white supremacist out to wreak some havoc and ultimately blow up NAACP headquarters. We watch him as he plots with his co-conspirators and commits his acts of violence. The two story lines are nicely woven together by anonymous cryptic calls Darryl gets that predict the mayhem.The writing is good. There was one irksome point - forgive me for voicing my peeve. Darryl claims to be a stickler for words and proper grammar. On several occasions, this comes up in his relationship with Yolanda who is not as erudite as he. Despite this self-professed grammar snobbery, when Darryl narrates, he frequently says \\"Me and Yolanda\\" or \\"Me and Whomever\\". It only irks because of his vanity about word usage. Ok, I'm glad I got that off my chest.Darryl is a terrific character and so is Yolanda. Their relationship is fun to watch. The plot is good even though it seems to take a secondary position to Darryl's life. This is a very good book and I look forward to reading the sequels."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"Let me first say this - don't judge a book by its cover.

From the very beginning, we know who the chief bad guy is and, because the book is one in a series of Darryl Billups 'mysteries,' we can be pretty sure that he is the hero and will prevail. So, where's the mystery?Though Darryl's relationship with the new lady in his life, Yolanda, and her son is nicely handled, the plot has several improbable howlers. The author asks us to believe that the bad guy could be released from jail on a technicality, literally the same day he got arrested for hijacking a police car, kidnapping the cop driver, and attempting to kill the cop, eyewitness and and fingerprint evidence notwithstanding!!! Also, an undercover cop (shadowing the same bad guy) disappears for days, and the bad guy isn't even pulled in! I don't know in what universe the author lives, but this ain't happening in the real world.The book has a nice pace to it, and the office politics wiil be recognized by anyone who as worked for a large organization.

In the midst of trying to determine if the caller is legitimate or a crank, he also has to deal with the day-to-day deadlines and office politics of his newsroom.The plot itself is of moderate interest, but it didn't grab me and hold my interest; rather, I plodded through the rather laborious writing half out of interest to see how the conflict is resolved, but mostly out of some vouyeristic interest in the office politics: who is assigned what story, how is allied with whom on the editorial staff, etc. I guess I am more of a gossip than I imagined. That I found the minutae of the book more interesting than the main plot is why I give the book such a mediocre rating.The racial politics of Baltimore (in the coverage of the news, in the politics in the newsroom, and in the warning phonecalls Billips receives) also held my interest, all the more so as I assume to some extent, Walker (himself a former reporter in Baltimore) is writing from personal experience. As interesting as I found this, it still was not enough to make up for what is, at the end of the day, pretty average writing about what is a pretty well-used plot (consider the number of films on a similar topic - or the entire run of the series \\"24\\" and you get the idea.) I'm afraid I can't recommend the book."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I read mysteries not for the mystery but for the characters and the writing. This is the type of mystery that Walker has written, since you know whodunnit right away. Blair Walker's weaknesses lie mainly in his characters, rather flat and typical, rather than individual, as well as in his dialogue - to me, a bit predictable. Robert Parker needn't fear for his rep. Walker's humor didn't get to me, although it may entertain others. It's not that Walker can't create characters, but he doesn't create enough of them. The hero, Darryl Billups, is the most rounded - not surprising, since he is the part-time narrator (when he isn't in a scene, Walker switches to Mr. Omniscient). He is the one character I cared about, but I did indeed care.Walker's assets include a talent for rendering complex action and in pacing the narrative. He also manages to include lagniappe - the insecurities and obstacles faced by the Black professional, the \\"reality gap\\" suffered by white supremacists and their overestimation of themselves. The terrorists here think of themselves as Jedi masters and yet screw up in the first pages. The style is what I'd call enthusiastic. It aims to throw off sparks. However, the writing - the choice of words - could be sharper. There are also some fairly slack metaphors which seem to have gotten in via Walker's enthusiasm.I suppose comparisons are both odious and inevitable. This isn't up to Mosley's Easy Rollins books, but it is overall a good, fast read."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I read the mystery as part of a Black Literature discussion group here in suburban Maryland, outside DC. Good story. Humor. Action doesn't fade when the events begin to come together in the denouement. I identified with Darryl Billups more than I did with Easy Rollins in Walter Mosely's \\"Devil in a Blue Dress\\", although the latter had a better story line. Since our discussion group quickly got off the subject of Walker's book, I missed the opportunity to talk about the newspaper journalist's life, and places and scenes mentioned in the story about Baltimore. I will read Mr. Walker's next work as well."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I like almost all mysteries and this one did not disappoint.

Blair walker has created a character (Darryl Billups) that all African-American men can identify with. We watch Darryl deal with everyday problems (work, women and family)while trying to stop a horrific hate crime. This book is a must for any collection."},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"Blair S. Walker can keep pace with his Chesapeake Bay area contemporaries Laura Lippman and George Pelecanos. Problem is, at least in Up Jumped the Devil, he doesn't do so consistently. And that's too bad, because writing from an African-American perspective about a predominantly black American city that alternately struggles with and tries to ignore racial issues, his voice could be an important one.Which isn't to say that it can't be, or that Walker doesn't write a heck of a potboiler, either. The chapters spent with the criminals seemed to be better written that those spent with Darryl Billups. That may be because Walker takes fewer chances in those scenes, and because he takes great pains to make Billups human and less-than-heroic. The narrative chances don't always work out - examples would be some odd, one-off chapters that Walker writes third person about ancillary characters, or some chapters that switch from the third person perspective of a supporting character to Billups' first person narration.At worst, these unconventional choices just make you scratch your head. They do help create a pace that adds to the suspense - it's not crystal clear that \\"we're in the third act, so the detective must be one step behind the criminal\\" or some such. Walker should be able to better integrate these quirks/innovations better into future outings. And I am interested in future outings, because as I said at the outset, it's clear that his is a voice that has something to say. In a nation where the majority of those incarcerated for and victimized by crime are African-American, crime fiction needs to include statements by artists whose experience allows them to comment on why the statistics read that way.(A nit-picky aside: according to the copyright page, Up Jumped the Devil was originally published in the late 90s. The version I received had been \\"updated\\" to include references to Barack Obama, Sarah Palin, and other 21st century cultural figures. But when ubiquitous current technology like cell phones would substantially change plot details, these \\"updates\\" are nothing but distracting. To whatever editor or publishing exec thought this would be a good idea - it's not. There's nothing wrong with a story set in the late 90s.)"},{"Title":"Up Jumped the Devil (Darryl Billups Mystery)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book and looked for more by the author. It is a fast moving story with well developed characters and keeps the readers interest to the end. I don't usually like reading dialects but this book manages to use it appropriately and not to irritate the reader.The book gives a perspective on black/white relations in the US and, particularly, in the newspaper business. This focus on newspapers also gives a general appreciation about how stories are chosen and developed. Some of it is as expected but there are some surprises.The book is a good read for men or women and shows signs of being the first of a series.

Either way, one minute it feels as if he is trying to tell a story about the ugliness of racial, ethnnic, and religious bigotry through the use of three men who style themselves as white supremecists. The next it is a story of a black man's perceived struggle on a major newspaper with white management to whom, from his perspective, he won't \\"bow\\". Once I was able to get past the dual story which didn't mesh well it was an interesting read. The book did not hold my attention in a way that compelled me to keep reading but when I picked it up I my interest was held for several chapters.

As he sets out on his mission, not to find out who done it, but who is making the calls, his life becomes more complicated as he attempts to gather all the pieces to fit into the mysterious puzzle. Blair S. Walker becomes a Master storyteller in this intriguing novel, packed with action, suspense, and drama. The main character is not the usual detective, but the intelligent Newspaper expert, anxious to go on a quest that could land the paper's Top headline story. I highly recommend this book to all mystery lovers, who enjoy drama and conspiracy, blended with humor. The author created a likeable hero, filling each page with interest and excitement as the reader craves for more. There is never a dull moment as we witness terrorism, race hate, politics, and personal relationships. Walker covers the pages with so much conflict, which gave me flashbacks of the sixties, while he keeps you guessing page-after-page on who will fit into the shoes of the anonymous caller.

As I understand it, the books selected are often those that were overlooked when they were first published, and slow sales resulted in their not being picked up for future runs. Blair S. Walker's Darryl Billups mystery series ended with the publication of three books, of which \\"Up Jumped the Devil\\" was the first. One of the things that drew me to the book was the locale in which it was set, as I worked in Baltimore for almost a year back in the 1990s,have since visited it many times, and \\"Charm City\\" remains one of my favorite places in the mid-Atlantic region.In reading the book, it was obvious that Mr Walker knows his city. I was familiar with many of the locations used throughout the novel, which is important to readers who have spent much time in a locale that is central to the book. I also liked the character of Darryl Billups, who came across immediately as smart, witty, and talented, but unfortunately for my taste did not have enough backstory supplied by the author. I wanted to know more about him than just the sketchy information supplied by Mr Walker. In addition, the character of Mark Dillard, the domestic terrorist, was chillingly real. Unfortunately, most of the characters at the newspaper office where Darryl worked sounded like something out of Warner Brother's central casting in the days of contract players.For the most part, I liked the format/plotting of the book --it is mostly told in alternate chapters from Billups' point of view and the point of view of the white racist domestic terrorist who wants to blow up the national headquarters of the NAACP. A chapter about the homelife of one of Darryl's co-workers was a distraction, as was the romance of Darryl and a nurse he met while in the hospital recovering from a beating while covering another story. I just didn't believe Yolanda as a real person, and didn't feel that the romance added anything to the storyline. But the biggest problem I had with the storyline was with the identity of the informant, as there was really little previously related in the book to connect the person with the terrorist -- it seemed forced and contrived. The final action scenes that took place on the streets of Baltimore contained the best writing of the book -- very thrilling and exciting and told at a breakneck pace.It was apparent to me that there was some ham-fisted attempt at editing to bring the book into the present (the original was published in 1997, fourteen years ago) by references to President Obama and Sara Palin. This failed miserably, as other aspects of the book were very much of the 1990s -- no cell phones, computers referred to as \\"word processors,\\" coupled with an odd incident of Darryl being able to send an a relatively unimportant e-mail message to co-workers, but not thinking to do so with vital information to the police or to the NAACP. The unevenness of the book and the editing resulted in my giving it a three rating, but I am willing to give the other two reprints in the series a try if given the opportunity, as I found Darryl Billups as charming as Baltimore."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine 4 CD Set (Audio CD)","review":"Bruce Wilkinson's Secrets of the Vine CD is great for me as an Innkeeper.

From her days at the Yale School under Paul de Man (a figure whose complex legacy is at much frank question in her work, and here in particular) to her pioneering translations of Derrida to her arduous interventions as the premiere (and most nuanced) interpreter of Deconstruction in the so-called 'Culture Wars' to her renowned classroom teaching, Dr. Johnson has brought her unique voice to reflectively examine and influence debates in the academy, legal scholarship, psychoanalytic theory, and cultural life at large. \\"Mother Tongues: Sexuality, Trials, Motherhood, Translation\\" (2003), one her last published works, takes up and addresses many of the questions and topics - poetic language, sexual difference, translation, ideology - that have driven her best work thus far, but does so with an unmatched personal candor and capacity for earnest reflection, and demonstrates how Dr. Johnson's fundamental commitment to a radically rigorous and ever-critical practice of reading has been distilled into a thinking of incomparable insight, graceful sensitivity, and urgent emotional power.\\"Mother Tongues\\" offers an intricate architectonics of readings. Most prominent among these are treatments of Sylvia Plath, Charles Baudelaire, and Walter Benjamin, figures on whose works and biographies Dr. Johnson has herself spent a life of loving attention and scholarly reflection. Interweaving history with textual commentary, Dr. Johnson less collapses oppositions between intra- and extra-diagetic claims (that is, between stances that respectively emphasize a sola scriptura close-interpretation of literary texts \\"on their own terms\\" and a consideration of the historical and cultural contexts of their authors' composition of them ) than shows how each perspective sheds productive light on the other and challenges our hasty assumptions of what reading and writing should or shouldn't be or do. \\"Is there any relation, then, between the writing of scholarship and the writing of letters?\\" Johnson asks, \\"Does the existence of an addressee-and an address-change the nature of writing and also its relation to history? What are the correspondances in correspondence?\\" The limits of authorial authority and readerly insight themselves are open and ever-probed questions in Dr. Johnson's work, and it is trademark of her style and critical commitment here that the texts Dr. Johnson reads emerge not reduced in meaning but rather enlarged. Indeed, Dr. Johnson's erudite portraits of the lived experiences of the authors she reads, and of the dramas that haunted them (Plath's often misunderstood relation to her parents and roots in a German language she could never bring herself to learn ; Baudelaire's tangled and erratic relations - financial as well as emotional - with his mother ; Benjamin's friendship with Gershom Scholem, his obsessions with Paris' architecture, and his own, ever-deferred, and ultimately unrealizable pledges to learn Hebrew and leave Europe entirely) make the poems and prose Dr. Johnson reads take on an added poignancy and existential force that even jaded readers will be unable to gainsay. And it is a mark of the depth of Dr. Johnson's thought that while there are figures who \\"Mother Tongues\\" addresses at less length (Sappho, Lowell, Flaubert, Mallarm&eacute;, Woolf, Sexton, Derrida, Adorno), their inclusion never feels unnecessary, rote, or unproductive - rather, in each instance, these and other authors play cogent roles and receive concise, clear, and oftentimes strikingly persuasive original treatments that lack neither in depth nor in complexity, and which clue the reader in to roads of inquiry yet to be taken, suggestive challenges of thought yet to be embraced.To the extent that the nature of reading and the question of interpretation are fundamental concerns for Dr. Johnson, the stakes are high - because a rigorous questioning of what it means to read and interpret what someone else has written cannot ever stop at questioning those assumptions about the nature of writing others might take to be given. As does Deconstructionist thought at its best, \\"Mother Tongues\\" proceeds ever-ready to reflect back on its methods and terms (and the terms of literary scholarship as a whole) with an eye towards unsettling our hidden assumptions-even when questioning those assumptions can provoke discomfort and incomprehension. Indeed, Dr. Johnson is equally at home contesting what, exactly, we fail to say when we invoke a dislike of 'realism' as gritty or somehow scandalous (\\"If any reality were desirable, why would we need realism to see it?\\") as she is challenging a knee-jerk reaction to 'art for art's sake' (formalism, Johnson notes, was also an aesthetic anathema for Nazis). Rigorously capable of thinking the ambiguities of our common assertions of meaning-making and textual understanding through to conclusions that are no less striking and revolutionary for being initially paradoxical, Dr. Johnson takes as a particular targets modes of thought marked by a foundational yearning for a lost unity - of a universal language before Babel, of a poem's 'meaning' before it is put on paper, of self-same coherence before a text is translated from one language to another, of a unified and harmonious complementarity between man and woman, of undifferentiated and blissful connection between mother and child - and asks what work these pleas for holism lost do and what wishes and relations they deny. With a lucid understanding of the claims and commitments of other disciplines and discourses (from Marxism to sociology to a lucidly explained and deeply understood psychoanalysis that includes not just striking readings of Freud and Lacan, but of Klein and Winnicott as well), Dr.Johnson does not shirk from asking us to reverse and reconfigure the basic conceptual formulas that structure how we think and read: \\"Might poetry be an attempt not to address the mother, but to hear her voice? Is poetry a way of being addressed?\\" and \\"How might a language unmediatedly refer if reference itself is mediation?\\" And she is likewise unafraid of suggesting answers of simple elegance and jaw-dropping provocativeness - thus, in response to the question of language and mediation above, Dr. Johnson writes: \\"The problem, I think, is that we tend to think of Adam's language as similar to God's. But God's speech is creative to the extent that it is not based on similarity. Not, at least, until the creation of man. A God that tries to make a being similar to himself is already a God that takes himself as an object, a God who is well on his way to the sin of self-consciousness.\\"That 'Mother Tongues' addresses questions of foundational import and steps with wide-ranging fluency from questions of sexual to linguistic difference, or from between several key texts, does not mean, as one might worry, that arguments are abandoned once their immediate use dissipates or that concepts drop out in the name of rhetorical momentum - nor does the text ever grow dry or stale. Rather, with an ear for language and precision of vocabulary on par with the poets she reads, Dr. Johnson weaves her text's many themes and players together such that each thread progresses and recurs, warp and woof, enriched and ever more textured as the book proceeds. Dr. Johnson writes with pointed humor (reading the charges in Baudelaire's censorship trial, she notes \\"[the indictment's use of] 'religious' and 'public' make as strange an opposition as 'self' and 'full' in gas stations\\") and a plentiful real-world wisdom beautifully phrased (on Baudelaire and his mythos of intoxication: 'Boredom is the flip side of intoxication: the more you take a drug, the more of it you have to take to get the same effect, the mere repetition and routinization of an addiction becomes more and more necessary as it becomes less and less effective - the quest for stimulation becomes the incapacity to feel\\"; on the marriage of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath: \\"It was simply that perfect complementarity between was stifling. In a perfect fit between two people, there is really only room for one. But everything depends on who we think that one is.\\"). And it is when Dr. Johnson's reflections turn most personal, and touch on the essence of what it means teach and to learn, to compose literature and to help others read it, that her prose grows most achingly beautiful (\\"The failure of the most gifted teacher is precisely to censor the student through the act of always being right\\"). It is in these moments of frank pathos that 'Mother Tongues' shines not just as a brilliant reading of a set of challenging and influential authors, nor as a unflinching meditation by one of America's greatest readers and teachers on recent intellectual history (and in which she has been a key player), but as a profound and original literary work in its own right.It is hard to resist using, particularly in praise, a language of mastery - especially when confronted with a masterwork (albeit one whose ethos gives little credence to fictions of power). Those familiar with the disciplines Dr. Johnson has so impacted, of course, need no introduction and little encouragement to eagerly await her work, but it would be to enact precisely what Dr. Johnson teaches against if other potential readers were to be lead astray by the too-easy labels of movements and controversies - for Dr. Johnson's writing offers a profundity and humane relevance with an accessibilityand elegance that reaches well beyond the academy in appeal and implication. \\"Mother Tongues\\" asks, with earnestness and rigor to the end, what it means for us to live and read embodied as we are, and of how we can hope to proceed, linked to the languages that Mother and other us alike, more fully into the reflections and relations that give our lives and our literatures their felt power. Particularly in the wake of Dr. Johnson's death (she passed away in August 2009), \\"Mother Tongues\\" stands as an eloquent testimony to the power of her own work and thought."},{"Title":"Grandpa Loves","review":"Our young reviewers enjoyed this sweet story about a grandpa and his grandkids, and agreed that this read-aloud for young children will make the listener feel good.

Yet Ellis Peters still keeps her writing style and has points to make. She will keep you off balance so you are not sure that you know the answer. In an interview on the DVD of Brother Cadfael - A Morbid Taste for Bones (1994), Ellis peters said that because they have trouble adapting her stories for video, which she would attempt to simplify the stories.Although I have read the book and am sad that they did not make a video of this journey, I must say that Stephen Thorne's reading gives an added dimension to the story allowing you to race ahead or contemplate the past as he make the characters come alive with his unique voice for each.This of course is book 15 in the series and so many things have been said, does not need to be said again.

Brother Haluin, a monk of Shrewsbury, takes an ill-considered vow to make a penitential pilgrimage in reparation for a long-ago sin. His vow-and the extremes to which he goes in fulfilling it-have less to do with Christian teaching about sin and repentance than about stubbornness, control and what today we might call a Type A personality. The modern reader may wonder about the mindset in which an abbot could approve such a fanatical exercise, but our difficulty is at least moderated when Brother Cadfael is sent along to keep things under control. Mysteries abound as the journey unfolds, and uncharacteristically in this series, the alert reader can understand one key clue before Brother Cadfael sees its significance."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"When you can see some of what is coming at you for pages in a mystery, then it is not doing what it should be doing. This is the problem I found with The Confession of Brother Haluin. Previously when Peters has sent Hugh Beringar to court then we have court intrigue find its way to Shrewbury.This time, we do not. We find very little in the way of additional detail about Saint Peter and St. Paul's though we do hear about the brothers who work in the scriptorium as that is where Haluin has found his skills to be valued.As we delve into the story, we see so much earlier than Cadfael what is taking place, that it leaves me wondering why the story was even written. Then the body. All good mysteries are murder mysteries and so there must be a body.But we don't get to the body for such a long time, and by then we know the heart of the mystery so the motive for there being a body is too evident.The reason to read the story is to pass time and keep up with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"Not the best Brother Cadfael mystery, by any means. For most of the book, Cadfael is just along for the ride as an improbable plot rattles and bumps along like clockwork around him. Indeed, there are so many happy coincidences and long-concealed dirty deeds to be fortuitously revealed that the hand of Peters' genteel God has to assert itself about once a chapter, or the whole contrivance would sputter out.With Cadfael on 'hold,' there was a chance for other characters to make an appearance and an impact. Alas, everyone else in the novel is pretty much a stock \\"type\\" who would not be out of place in any generic English country house murder mystery.And as a mystery, it's a disappointment. The central murder is more a case of poor communications than an act of passion or malice. No one is ever punished for it. Indeed, the identity of the killer is not narrowed down further than one of two people, and the two candidates are the least-defined characters in the book who appear more than once. And the malicious act that lies at the heart of an eighteen-year-long conspiracy is just -- petty.I re-read \\"The Confession of Brother Haluin\\" recently. When I picked it up, I realized that I could not recall anything about the plot. Was there some reason I had read this Brother Cadfael mystery once and never again?Yes, there was."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"Brother Haluin suffers a horrific, crippling accident and lies near death.

Then a murder occurs. Cadfael unravels the mystery, the sinner atones insofar as possible, and Haluin finds peace.The mystery in this story was not very mysterious, but the Cadfael stories derive their charm from characters and relationships more than from mystery.

A very good book, as are all of Ellis Peters' Cadfael stories."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"THE CONFESSION OF BROTHER HALUIN is the fifteenth installment in Ellis Peters' Cadfael series. These tales provide a romanticized vision of life in twelfth century England, making the times seem so pleasant that you almost want to live there. The countryside is lovely, there is generally a hint of romance in the air, and life moves at a measured, unrushed pace. No pavement, no pollution, and no hustle and bustle. Glossed over are the poverty, poor nutrition, disease, and general stench (people rarely bathed). Life, especially in the cloister, is peaceful and idyllic.In this story, Brother Haluin is badly injured in a fall. Fearing for his life, Haluin makes a sickbed confession to Cadfael and Abbot Radulfus. He tells of a burden of guilt, carried since his youth, over a love affair that ended badly. Upon his recovery, Haluin pledges to embark on a pilgrimage to his old home. With Cadfael as his companion, he makes the hard journey only to meet with some surprises. A murder soon follows. Is there a connection between this new death and Haluin's troubled past? Trust Cadfael to uncover the truth.This story poses some intriguing problems, but the answers are frequently quite transparent. Suspense and surprising twists aren't Peters' strong suit. Instead, she specializes in pleasant tales with happy endings, delivered in a beguiling prose style. She runs true to form in THE CONFESSION OF BROTHER HALUIN. The outcome is a happy one, if not hard to see coming, and the experience is a pleasing one.Like most of the books in this series, THE CONFESSION OF BROTHER HALUIN is a very ordinary mystery. What makes this and the other Cadfael tales enjoyable is the pleasant world Peters creates and the charming, unhurried way in which she tells the tale. The Cadfael books are nice to read and, on the strength of that, I recommend them. You will find them especially enjoyable if you like a bit of history and some romance along with your whodunit."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"BUT! Now Brother Cadfael belongs to history, and the readers who love him so.Start at the beginning and READ THIS SERIES! Miss Peters had an unparalleled gift for conjuring the most beautiful images with her words. I mean, how many people can write about the grim and gritty middle ages and almost make you want to live there? When Cadfael digs in his garden and breathes in the scent of his herbs, you are there, my friend.In this volume we meet Brother Haluin, whom we take to our hearts straight away. This book never fails to wring my heart, and yet leave me with a sweet feeling of satisfaction at the end. A 'keeper'. Like me you will read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"I was deeply impressed by the book. I really like the fact that English monasticism of the early 12th century is presented in a positive light and the characters are so human. Typically, monks are presented as irrelevant to understanding the human condition. Here, Ellis Peters give us a glimpse of a very positive &quot;alternative lifestyle The note of redemption so common in this series was especially striking here. Through unbelievable horrors, strength for good arises."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"In the severe winter of 1142, the roof of the Abbey of St.Peter and St.Paul collapses under the weight of the heavy snowfall. One of the monks assigned to the task of repairing the roof is Brother Haluin who falls and crashes to the ground, unconscious and badly hurt. Cadfael nurses hin through the first night and is present when he awakens and gives a deathbed confession to the Abbot. Recovering, he is given permission to make a pilgrimage to the grave of a young woman that he feels he has wronged and accompanied by Cadfael, hobbles on crutches to the manor where he was formerly employed before becoming a monk. There they meet Roscelin, a noble youth in fosterage there to learn his knightly skills, as was the custom, and to separate him from Helisande, a girl of his own age and, because of his father's second marriage, his aunt! The two has become fonder of each other than was proper and so were separated by the family to prevent incest. At the manor, Helisande's old nurse is murdered and the lady of the manor delights in reminding Haluin that the poisonous herbs, whose use had been taught to him by Cadfael, caused the death of Bertrade, his love. It's an involved but absorbing plot which is sorted out by Cadfael in his inimical style and to everyone's satisfaction."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"Is anyone else sick of audible audio editions as the ONLY digital format available for certain books? I really DO NOT LIKE books to be read to me - I want to be able to read these books myself on my Kindle!"},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"This novel is one of two by Ellis Peters that I've now read. But I'm hooked! Although I've only read a couple of this series about the medieval detective Cadfael, my appetite has been whetted, and I'm certain to read more!Peters' command of the English language is outstanding, as is her precise portrait of medieval times. The intriguing element of mystery that makes detective Cadfael's presence essential to the plot clinches this novel as a romping success.If you enjoy mystery, as well as a writer's ability to make excellent use of the English language with colourful descriptions, you are sure to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"A tight read, but a very predictable plot. The strength and joy of it are Peters's prose and characterizations."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"A quick read book. Brother Haluin is such a great character. To do what he did and then forget about his past is true devotion to God. I loved this one."},{"Title":"The confession of Brother Haluin","review":"When Brother Haluin falls from the guest hall's roof during emergency winter repairs, no one at the Abbey of St. Peter and St. Paul expects him to survive. But survive he does, although he will never again walk without the aid of crutches. During the time when his life hangs in the balance, Haluin confesses sins he has kept hidden throughout his years as a monk; and as soon as he has recovered enough to learn the use of his crutches, he insists on setting off on a pilgrimage to the house where he lived as an adolescent. He takes a vow to make this journey on foot, coming and going, and to spend a night in prayer at the tomb of the young woman for whose death he holds himself responsible. Brother Cadfael accompanies Haluin, both in his capacity as the Abbey's herbalist and because he and Abbot Radulphus are the only ones to whom Haluin has confided his secret.What Brother Haluin finds when he reconnects with his past is not what he expected, and it surprises Cadfael, too. The plot twist resolving the situation did not surprise me; I guessed as much, fairly early on. This didn't detract a bit from my enjoyment, though, because the characters were so well written and even the worst of them managed to gain my sympathy (on some level, at least). As usual in this series, the characters matter far more than the plot does. Which is why I find these books so engaging!--Reviewed by Nina M.

Short enough to be a quick read, but well paced and thoughtful enough to truly engaging, real page turners."},{"Title":"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton","review":"Gil Hamilton is an agent of ARM, or Amalgamated Regional Militia, the world police of Earth. The acronym seems to be more made up to fit the other part of the premise. Gil Hamilton lost an arm in a space accident many years before, and developed psychic powers before gaining a new arm, the ability to project his thoughts as a physical manifestation. Organ legging is the main problem on an Earth where most offenses lead to the death penalty and the harvesting of organs to keep people alive and well. There are still not enough organs to go around, so people are kidnapped and killed for their organs. A chilling tale of Earth as it may become."},{"Title":"The Long Arm of Gil Hamilton","review":"This is a collection of three stories. It is funny to read a detective story set in the science fiction world. A nice afterword by Mr. Niven explains this and more. Mr Hamilton is an agent for Amalgamated Regional Militias (ARM, of course). But, in an interesting oddity, he lost an arm in an accident and gained an ethereal arm (psychokinetic), as well as a replacement from some dead person.'Death by Ecstasy' is a future drug use story. An associate of Mr. Hamilton is found dead in a room by himself. There were enough oddities that Mr. Hamilton and the regular police detective were suspicious that it might be murder. It is a 'locked room' mystery: no one could get in or out, so how ws it done? They figure it out and get the bad guy.I seem to remember something like this in another story. I just do not remember that it was this story.'The Defenseless Dead' develops the theme of using dead or near dead people for spare parts for living people, like arms, livers, retinas, etc. There are legal and illegal sources of these organs and most of Mr. Hamilton's working time is used in finding the illegal organ suppliers.In this story he is trying to figure out why one of those folks would shoot at him. This leads him to another mystery: why were two kids kidnapped a couple of years ago, what happened to them and are they to be attacked again?'Arm' investigates the death of a rich inventor because he was working on a device that could be used as a weapon. It is another 'locked room' mystery."},{"Title":"Scent of Crime","review":"I loved the suspense element in this book. Althought it's geared towards young adults, adults will love it as well. I recommend this book to all mystery and suspense readers."},{"Title":"The Courage to Love Again: Creating Happy, Healthy Relationships After Divorce","review":"Sheila Ellison opens up again in the follow-up book to &quot;Courage to Be a Single Mother,&quot; this time sharing wisdom from her experience in beginning a new relationship after divorce. Through her own remarriage and creating a blended family, Ellison expertly guides the reader into learning how to trust and learning how to CREATE the relationship you want -- taking charge of your own happiness, so to speak. A great book, I'd recommend it to anyone who is finding themselves starting over."},{"Title":"The Courage to Love Again: Creating Happy, Healthy Relationships After Divorce","review":"Ms. Ellison wrote a book for women who are trying to get back into the relationship game after a divorce. Having gone through it herself, Ellison provides a unique perspective on just how devastating a divorce can be to a woman's self-esteem and how dating again really is a process.I liked that she divided her book into two parts and spoke of the inner work that must be done first, and then she addresses the issues involved in starting over. She is a big advocate of getting really clear on what you want and no longer catering solely to the man in your life. Treat yourself and your needs as at least as important as your man's.She believes in making and constantly adjusting a list of what you want in a partner, as well as those things you don't and she cautions about settling for less than you want. She says there are good men out there who are also looking for meaningful, committed relationships so don't use that as an excuse for settling for someone less just because you think it might be your last chance and someone is better than no one.She also has some practical advice about meeting men, dating, sex and even what to say to your children when you are ready. I really appreciated that Ellison does not pretend to know the magic words or the magic time frame but allows that each woman is different and must do things in her own time without great consideration given to all the unsolicited advice a single woman will hear from others.I think this book may provide newly divorced women some good advice about how to first prepare themselves and then how to get back into the dating scene."},{"Title":"The Courage to Love Again: Creating Happy, Healthy Relationships After Divorce","review":"I loved this book.

What I can say is that readers expecting to find the story depicted in the film will not be disappointed. This is one instance where the filmmakers were very true to the novel, in many cases lifting dialogue verbatim from the book. Having said this, I am afraid most will find that the screenwriters didn't leave much. The book is serviceable and we do learn a bit more about Katie and Hubble and the times in which they lived but what becomes apparent is how much dimension and color the movie actually adds to the story. Granted, Laurents is drawing from his own life and writing about his friends and their experiences but somehow their stories work better when we can see them. Redford and Streissand, as well as the rest of the talented cast, imbue the characters with a depth and implied history that isn't as apparent on the page and the movie story, frankly, feels tighter and more focused. As if the author made one final edit. If the reader is simply interested in seeing how the story depicted in the film developed, the book is interesting but compared to the film itself, there is no contest. The best way to experience Arthur Laurents' story is to watch the film by the same name."},{"Title":"Way We Were","review":"for the reader because of what it's about: (1) A woman who loves a man & changes herself because of her love for him, only to find that he can't change despite his love for her; (2) set in Hollywood before & after HUAC & the blacklists. It's interesting for a writer or scholar, too, because it shows how a master playwright & screenwriter adapts to the novel. But Laurents DOESN'T adapt to the form, and I think I know why. He depends on others (actors, directors) to make his plays & screenplays engaging & entertaining; but in a novel, he has to do these himself. He hints that he can't when he mentions rewrites of his chief character's second novel, and the defects he finds in it are those of the book he's writing! Also, Laurents's customary method for constructing plot--mixing & matching from a menu--works well for plays & movies where the writer is the maker of plots, but not in the novel, where manners are more important than actions & motives are more important than manners. Laurents writes a novel like a screenplay, episode by episode, a technique that works for F. Scott Fitzgerald & Terry Southern, because they confine themselves to the superficial & don't seek to explain manners or motives. Laurents tries to explain, and the result is clinical. What we have here is Scott & Zelda transported to the Forties through Sixties, with Laurents fleshing out characters with people he has known or heard about. The result is interesting, not engaging. Still, a good read on a summer's day, if you can get Barbra Streisand out of your ear."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I confess that I did not have very high expectations for this book. I tried it based on a Newsweek recommendation. It starts rather slowly for a modern reader. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I was drawn into and hooked onto the story and the characters. There are some unpleasant stereotypes, particularly of the main Jewish character, but, at the same time, on of the most reasonable characters is also a Jew. The emptiness of life for the rich in Victorian England is well described. It was a fascinating window into the past, made more valuable being written by someone living at the time."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Technically an excellent novel but, unlike the wonderful Barset chronicles, we read of dark dreary cynical people in a decaying English society. I for one was quite happy to turn the last page and leave this world.We find Trollope's usual ingredients here: imperfect people finding themselves in morally ambiguous situations, the moral calculus by which these situations are resolved, Trollope's profound understanding of how important money is (and his surprising insights on liquity and high finance!) the artful manner in which the author speaks directly to his audience, the realistically if mechanically developed plot.But there's hardly anyone to like here. Not Felix Carbury, the closest thing to an evil man I've found in the Trollope novels I've read, not his mother Lady Carbury, not the financial magnate Augustus Melmotte, not the good but intransigent Roger Carbury, not his rival and former friend the meek and mousey Paul Montague. How on earth he found two women to love him I can't imagine. We sympathize with Melmotte's daughter Mary but can hardly come to like her, there not being much to either like or hate in her. There'd be Mrs. Hurtle whom we might like if the thoroughly disapproving Trollope gave her half a chance. But he doesn't; she is American after all.In the end, I break my rule of giving five stars to widely recognized classics, for two reasons. First the ending of each subplot is too engineered and too formulaic even for a 19th century victorian classic. Trollope virtually admits this much by having the editor Mr. Broune tell Lady Carbury how novels ought to always end, and then proceeds himself to follow his character's advice. Perhaps he was warning readers not to expect too much.Second I found the novel profoundly racist in a manner someone like Trollope should never have allowed. Moral relativism is one thing but an apology for immorality is quite another. It's one thing to compromise with a racist world and say \\"we can get this much now, that's good\\" and quite another to say \\"they've gotten enough, let them be satisfied and let us yield no more\\". In his treatment of Jews, Americans, and Europeans of mysterious ancestry Trollope shamefully sets himself amongst the latter.Explicitly Trollope sympathizes with these people and shows them to be noble and good, but he then ties up the various stories hinting it's better not to mix blood lines. If Trollope wanted to offer more than cynicism in this moral tale, then Melmotte's Jewish friend should have gained his English bride and Mrs. Hurtle should have found marital bliss in England. I suppose that wouldn't have pleased Trollope's paying readers the 1870s...Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Read this novel on Newsweek's suggestion for the top 50 books to read over the summer. I didn't realize it was over 1,000 pages. It took awhile, but it was worth it, mostly. I managed to get through a Master's in English without reading Trollope, and while he is no Dickens or Austen, he definitely captures the Zeitgeist of the gilded 1870s of get-rich-quick Madoff-like pyramid schemes, parents who enable their children to be irresponsible losers, cads or player's who only want a good-time girl, phony literary posers, and those who seek fame without talent. Newsweek was right. The novel could have been ripped from The New York Times. It lacks character development, though. And 300 pages could have been deleted without losing any meat. It was a page turner with interwoven tales and intersecting narratives. It was not only a decent satire of London in the 1870s but also of two stereotypical American characters - a wild west woman who supposedly killed her husband and a ruthless speculator from San Francisco."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"... Too many plots, characters not given enough space to breathe, and way too much wrap-up yields a less than satisfying experience. But Trollope is a great writer, and when he's on top, as he is often throughout this book, he is untouchable. The Beargarden is astonishing, and has anyone ever written about so many different wastrels and made them all unique? Georgina and her brother Dolly could make a novel themselves. Poor Marie....desperate to be loved. Very touching stuff.But the main story gets lost under so much weight that the overall novel loses its focus and just stunbles to a number of unconvincing conclusions. My favorite book is He Knew He Was Right. The sub-plots there enhance the story, and the characters are more vivid and less simplistic.If you're here after the PBS series, note please...that series is adapted from this novel. There is a lot missing and a lot changed (all to the worse, I would argue). If you are new to Trollope, I would suggest The Palliser series or HKHWR. This is much less worth the time, though still a sparkling read with brilliant flashes.Anti-Semitism? People are too touchy. The characters are certainly narrow-minded bigots, but Trollope himself is clear and potent. The \\"old, fat Jew\\" is among the most noble, most intelligent, and touching characters in Trollope. A gentleman, a sincere man, and one touched by the ugliness of his world but rising majestically above it."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Trollope weaves multiple plot lines with ease and confidence such that the reader is never in doubt. Trollope explores the thin veneer of civility and sophistication that covered society. Those who are decent and upright differ only slightly from the social climbing, or money-hungry. Trollope exposes the foibles of social climbers and get-rich-quick investors."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"Very many men started up with huge claims, asserting that they had been robbed, and in the confusion it was hard to ascertain who had been robbed, or who had simply been unsuccessful in their attempts to rob others\\" - Chapter XCII.Loved this novel. Definitely one of Trollope's best, with its expansive canvas and characters in all ages, stages, and situations, scrambling to get ahead at someone else's expense. The financial swindle at its heart gets played out in large and small variations--whom do we trust, and why? How can trust itself be traded as a commodity? And what on earth has love to do with money? Everything, apparently.Unlike Dickens and Eliot, Trollope creates rounded, fascinating female characters. His Marie Melmotte and Mrs. Hurtle are some of his best creations, and he's the best capturer of social nuance since Austen. The battles between Georgiana Longestaffe and her erstwhile \\"friend\\" Lady Monogram are brilliant.As for the reviews I read complaining of the anti-Semitism in the books, I think Trollope accurately captures contemporary attitudes, for better or worse. Certainly Georgiana's meditations on the practice of religion, \\"Christian\\" or Jew, are spot-on.If you have time and love a good Victorian novel, this one--to keep with the book's theme--is a treasure."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Despite the typically verbose 19th century style, the story of ambition, greed and hypocrisy is amazingly contemporary.

Ok six more words required to submit..."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"A (too) long tale which simultaneously lampoons a very English form of anti-Semitism (neither religious nor racial but almost entirely social) and exposes the author's own. Not up to the standards of his better known works like the Barchester and the Palliser novels but not so dull as to make one put it down unfinished. Though you are pretty sure that a satisfactory Victorian ending will be provided you want to be sure and you want to know what it is. On both scores some surprises await you."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now is a hugely sprawling, hugely cynical portrayal of Victorian aristocrats and their vacuous, money-centered morality. As with other Trollope novels, The Way We Live Now is best undertaken by serious readers and fans of Victorian literature. Both the massive length and the dark, cynical tone make it a challenge to finish. I found myself wanting to give up on it many times, but persevering was worth it in the end.The Good: The Way We Live Now is certainly a prescient novel. It is easy enough to imagine Wall Street bankers gambling with money they don't have at the \\"bear gardens\\" club or to substitute Bernie Madoff for Mr. Melmotte. Though dark and cynical, Trollope's portrayal of society is just as valid now as it was more than one-hundred years ago.The \\"rondo\\" form is also well done. The plot begins with just a few characters, expands to a whole lot of them in the middle and returns to just the few it began with in the end. This scheme shows a panoramic view of British aristocratic society without becoming decentered and letting the plot get lost.The Bad: As I mentioned before The Way We Live Now is long and dark. Seven hundred pages of narrative about characters that are hard to like is tedious to say the least. It's not just that it is a long book. If there were likable characters that the reader could sympathize with it would be a lot easier to swallow. Yet, none of the characters is likable. I didn't find myself cheering for any of them.The Way We Live Now was written for serialization. Each chapter seems to begin by repeating information the reader has already read. Thus, the narrative is repetitive.While The Way We Live Now gives a panoramic view of aristocratic society, middle and lower class characters appear less often and are complete simpletons. Readers can look to Thomas Hardy or other contemporary writers for a rounder portrayal.Anthony Trollope offers no path to fixing the dystopian society that appears in The Way We Live Now. It's gloomy and cynical. This isn't a true fault of the author, for maybe it is a realistic portrayal of the Way We Live Now...but it is gloomy, so be ready for that.The Bottome Line: The Way We Live Now is a lengthy, cynical work, prescient in it's portrayal of the financial classes. It is a good novel, but it's length and pessimism are not for the most general reading audiences.Visit trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com for more of my reviews."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I consider it to be a tragedy that Anthony Trollope's works are largely forgotten and overlooked by the reading public. So many well-educated people have never even heard ot him, although his novels are some of the best representatives of what a good novel should be! His beautiful storytelling in &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; is just another example of Trollope at his best. A master raconteur, his vivid descriptions and cutting satire make this work one of his most controversial (at least at the time) and indeed one of his most respected. Though his longest work, it certainly does not seem long because he keeps the reader on his toes, so much so, that he is dying to know what will happen next. The best thing about the book, in my opinion, is the fact that it is difficult to find a character whom you can like. Each one, and there are many, has one or more particular faults, and we, as the readers, quickly realize that no one is perfect. Even the sympathetic characters are prejudiced at times. This, I believe, is a marked contrast to Dickensian personnages who much of the time are almost too angelic or cruel to be believable. Trollope give us a lesson in true human nature, one that will be very hard for me to forget."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Often considered Trollope's greatest novel, this satire of British life, written in 1875, leaves no aspect of society unexamined. Through his large cast of characters, who represent many levels of society, Trollope examines the hypocrisies of class, at the same time that he often develops sympathy for these characters who are sometimes caught in crises not of their own making. Filling the novel with realistic details and providing vivid pictures of the various settings in which the characters find themselves, Trollope also creates a series of exceptionally vibrant characters who give life to this long and sometimes cynical portrait of those who move the country.Lady Carbury, her innocent daughter Henrietta (Hetta), and her attractive but irresponsible son Felix are the family around which much of the action rotates. They are always in need of money and Lady Carbury writes pap novels to support the family (and Felix's drinking and gambling). In contrast to the Carburys, and just as important to the plot, are the Melmottes. Augustus Melmotte, who has come from Vienna under a cloud of financial suspicions, has acquired a huge estate for himself, his foreign wife, and his marriageable daughter. Boorish, but determined to become a leader of society, Melmotte provides moments of humor for the reader, though he is scorned by an aristocracy which is nevertheless beholden to him for his investments.When Melmotte becomes the major investor in a plan to build a railway from California to Mexico, Paul Montague, a handsome businessman who has invested in a railroad in America, arrives in town. A ward of Roger Carbury, cousin of Felix and Hetta, he soon finds himself in love with Hetta--and in competition with Roger for her hand. Felix courts the Melmottes' daughter for her fortune, and she falls in love with him while he dallies with a local domestic worker. Investors dash to buy shares in the Mexican railway, with their investments ending in the sticky hands of Melmotte, who has bigger plans.Often addressing the reader directly, Trollope fills the novel with action and subplots which illustrate a wide variety of themes, often depicting his characters satirically to illustrate the social, political, and financial ills of the day. Ahead of his time for his depiction of the lively, intelligent woman whose role is defined (and limited) by her social and financial position, Trollope creates a number of resourceful women--and a number who are willing to do almost anything to marry a wealthy man. As is customary in Victorian novels, the good are rewarded here, and the evil are punished, but Trollope's characters, unlike those by Dickens, for example, usually control their own destinies. Broad in scope, thoughtful in construction, complete in its depiction of 1870s' England, filled with wonderful characters, and absolutely engrossing to read, The Way We Live Now is one of the great novels of the nineteenth century.

It concerns greed, pursuit of position, and fraud in late 19th century London, but most of the story line reads as if it could have been set in 2008, during the financial scandals on Wall Street. There is even a Bernard Madoff type figure in the story. There is also a BBC/PBS adaptation available on DVD. It is also excellent, but necessarily lacks some of the richness of detail that we find in the book. I don't think of Tollope's books as page turners, but I got to a point where I didn't want to put this down. Perhaps in a few years the material won't seem as fresh, but right now it's very timely."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"This work of literature encompassing life among the upper-crust of society in Victorian England is by far the best fictional representation I have ever read.Trollope creates fantastic characters from the saintly/virginal society girl who pines for a lover, to a dastardly gentleman who squanders his families small fortune on rather unsavoury habits such as gambling and less than scrupulous women.Most of this is told through the perspective of the matriarch of one family (Lady Carbury) who's only wish is that her son (a scoundrel at best) marry well and with any luck above his station (which he tries to sabotage at every turn) and for her daughter to marry into wealth at any cost whatsoever. That with the general gossip and the &quot;Newcomer's from Paris&quot; (The Family Melmotte) who left Paris hurriedly it seems under a rather dark cloud of suspicion will keep you glued to this book throughout. It is a very lengthy novel (481 pages) but you will be desperately turning the pages in the Appendix hoping for just a bit more!"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I bought this book on my kindle after seeing it referenced in a newsmagazine. I am new to Trollope but am quickly becoming a devoted fan. His writing is Dickens-like, but easier to read. This work is about a family with a good standing in society but little money. The son is the typical ner-do-well; the mother feels an urgent need to advance him in society by finding him a rich wife. Her efforts lead them to characters whose whose history is just a bit too mysterious; whose worth is substantial but superficial; and whose standing is society is questionable. Fans of English literature will enjoy this book and it's commentary on society, then and now."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Aside from the fact that this book takes place 125 years ago, it could be an end of year round-up for the corporate and political scandals of 2002. Trollope takes a deft look at the conditions of a culture that allow the Melmottes of the world to walk in and wreak havoc, (laziness, entitlement, greed) and one gets a very queasy feeling watching the bubble inflate, followed by the inevitable collapse of the whole house of cards. At least Melmotte doesn't take the whole country down with him. We may not be so lucky.On the down side, I'm guessing (it feels like) these chapters were published in newspaper form before they were assembled for the book, as each chapter contains much unnecesary reiteration, and if you're reading straight through it can be annoying. In addition, Trollope doesn't have Dickens' delicious wit or keen insight into character, and some plots which seem to be headed for the interesting turn of event are instead allowed to dangle or resolve themselves dully. (I'm thinking particularly of Mrs. Hurtle here.) And for me, the fact that there is no one to take a particular interest in, no moral compass so to speak, left me feeling a bit adrift. Yes, people are deeply flawed. But one character who was perhaps a bit less flawed than the others would have given me something to hang my hat on.Still, a page turner par excellence."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is one of Trollope's best books, it involves several storylines, and they are each very interesting and kept my interest all the way through--it has so much to say about life and society that is still true today, and is full of wonderfully believable characters--I can't say enough about this book, except to hope more people will read it and discover Anthony Trollope--I can't see why he wasn't more highly regarded, he is so much better than Dickens in my opinion--in fact I can hardly read Dickens!!"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Enron collapse shows that, as long as we continue to enjoy the benefits of capitalism in the West, Trollope's most famous novel will continue to be timely. This has often been called Trollope's best novel: while it does not contain his best writing (which would be found in individual chapters of PHINEAS FINN and THE LAST CHRONICLER OF BARSET), nor is it his funniest (BARCHESTER TOWERS), it is his most consistently engaging in its details of a railway bubble in mid-Victorian London. The great financier at the center of it, Augustus Melmotte, rises from obscurity to be asked to host a dinner for the visiting emperor of China (which forms a splendid setpiece for the novel) on the eve of his financial ruin. The novel is very exciting and enjoyable, and shows Trollope straining the hardest to meet the standards set by his admitted hero, Thackeray; although this certainly doesn't meet the level of VANITY FAIR, it's still pretty good. There is a bit of a trouble that Trollope has too many subplots going and winds up spending hundreds of pages at the end (long after the work's main action is over) having to resolve them. One of the very best of these ongoing stories, the desperate attempts of the contemptibly snobbish (but still oddly sympathetic) Georgiana Longstaffe to find a husband, is as a result resolved much too suddenly and unsatisfactorily. I would still recommend THE WAY WE LIVE NOW as a fine read--and as a very splendid introduction to Trollope."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is my second Trollope, chosen after reading and enjoying The Warden earlier this year. With The Warden, I was surprised how modern it was and by how much I enjoyed the novel. (I had avoided reading Trollope forever, thinking it was just too dusty and Victorian) I am so glad that I picked up The Way We Live Now as my second outing with the author.The long format (800 pages) gives Trollope time to show his amazing skill with characters. I can only add my voice to the chorus of people justly praising his skill with female characters-- particularly when compared to other writers of the time. Marie Melmotte is generally singled out for praise. I have to confess that I was quite fond of Winifrid Hurtle. This woman has been more sinned against than sinning. She is complex and dignified, and may be the best character in the book.In fact, although the novel is ostensibly about Augustus Melmotte, I would be willing to argue that an even larger part of the book is about women finding happiness in less than typical ways. Whether it is Georgiana Longstaffe or Mrs. Carbury, the woman in The Way We Live Now are making the best choices that they have available, given limited circumstances. I thought that in this sense it was still topical, and very brave.I would recommend The Way We Live Now very highly. It does have a lot of pages, and requires some patience. But, it doesn't require as much patience as one may expect. I promise you, that once you get into it, it is not an effort at all to read. The Gilded Age by Mark Twain could make an interesting counterpoint to this book, dealing as it does with such similar material but from a very different perspective."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"The conviction that the world is going to the dogs is a long-standing one, a proposition borne out by Anthony Trollope's novel about the intersection of high finance and society in 1870's London. Other than to entertain his readers, Trollope's evident chief purpose in writing this novel was to satirize and castigate the materialism and obsession with conspicuous consumption that was so much on disply as Victorian England approached its high summer of prosperity and power.Needless to say, Trollope was one of the 19th-Century master novelists and the book accordingly has many strengths. His insight into character was keen and he carefully details a number of character studies, some of whom are quite fascinating figures. Chief of these is Augustus Melmotte, the mysterious parvenu financier who causes much mischief and ruin to the lives of other characters in the book until he brings about his own destruction through arrogance, cupidity, and vaunting ambition. Other characters are also well drawn though some, like Roger Carbury, are such goody two-shoes as to be rather insufferable.This leads me to one of the chief problems that I had with the novel, the fact that I'm reading the work across such a gulf of time and outlook from the writer's viewpoint that many of the novel's underlying assumptions strike me as ridiculous if not distasteful. Like any other creative work, it is a product of its time and place and reflects the values and mores of its era. A number of elements in the book struck me as either really unpleasant or the result of a very dated, hopelessly obsolete sensibility.This is particularly true with respect to the portrait of Jews in the novel. It is suggested that Melmotte, a thorough scoundrel (although with admitted heroic qualities, like the Miltonic Satan), might be Jewish. Another Jew, Cohenlupe is a fraud and an embezzler. One sympathetic Jewish character, Brehgert, while characterized as honest, is also depicted as a fairly ridiculous figure. I also found the novel's extreme \\"Englishness\\" to be rather trying at times. In particular, I found the romance between Paul Montague and Hetta Carbury rather insipid and couldn't understand how any man in his right mind would prefer a colorless and tame character like Hetta to a woman of passion, spirit, and real guts like the American Mrs. Hurtle. This probably only reflects, however, my own crude American nature.I recommend this book as a good read (summer or beach) for Anglophiles, fans of 19th Century literature, and to anyone interested in British social, political, and economic history in the late 19th century."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"In \\"The Way We Live Now\\", Trollope essentially denounces the \\"get rich quick\\" mentality beginning to permeate the English wealthy and upper middle classes in the mid to late 19th century, as evidenced by rampant speculation in public corporations about which the public typically knew very little. Exactly the same scenarios were playing out in the U.S. at the time and eventually, as we all know, corporations came to dominate the public consciousness in the 20th century and continue to do so today, with corruption and greed often accepted as being synonymous with high standing in a corporation. The events described in this novel would have rocked the entire nation of England for years had they really occured back then. Today, these kinds of events have become almost commonplace around the world with dozens of major corporate scandals revealed over the last ten years. It surprises few today when yet another scheme/corporation fails and erases millions or even billions of dollars in shareholder wealth. The mortgage speculation of American banks was the last big set of scandals but you can count on more coming, with companies in Europe leading the charge.Trollope's heroes (Roger Carbury, Paul Montague, et al) are generally unwilling to engage in such risky speculation and/or simply don't get excited by it, and wish to make their livings traditionally. Trollope's antagonists (Augustus Melmotte, Felix Carbury, et al) are driven by their desire for wealth and some even become consumed by it, ultimately paying a heavy price. Interwoven through this well-developed story of the traditionalists vs. the get-rich-quickers are a couple bizarre love stories and other family drama.The first half of the novel kept me glued. The characters were realistic, narrative & dialogue were both superior, and the plot was exciting. Trollope here is at the top of his game regarding style and plot development. I preferred this first half to Trollope's own \\"Barchester Towers\\".The second half didn't quite manage the suspension of disbelief the first half did. Trollope clearly didn't quite have the end fleshed out when he began this serial novel. He ended up kind of painting his characters into situations from which unconvincing plot devices were needed to resolve their plights. Some things became too predictable. But I must say that though the second half may have been a relative disappointment, it's still written better than 99% of novels written today. It's certainly worth the read as it wraps things up nicely (maybe too nicely).Read the drama for fun, but pay attention to the message and perhaps take action from it. As they say, whoever wins the rat race is still a rat. A rat working for shareholders like Joe Sixpack and the large institutional investors. But since the institutional investors are often public companies too, at the end of the day any public corporation is in fact run by Joe Sixpack. I wonder how excited I should be getting about making it to the top of a company that works to help my boss Mr. Sixpack, whom I've never met, get a better return on his investment?Read it and learn from it. Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"As with so many other classic novels, a summary of the plot devices of Trollope's \\"The Way We Live Now\\" is a sure way to undersell the book's quality. The story involves the romantic/marital/financial (all of which spheres are inextricably linked) maneuvers of several figures in Victorian society. At the center of this activity is Augustus Melmotte, the propriety of whose professional conduct is best left for the reader to discover.Most remarkable about this work is the consistent depth and credibility of its character development. I typically feel a fairly thick barrier preventing my total belief in a fictional character, especially if that character was imagined during a prior century.I found Trollope's work, by contrast, to be one of the finest, if not the finest, example of character development that I've read. Not just one, but most of the inhabitants of his novel are so vivid as to enable the reader to feel their emotions and moral dilemmas, even where their interests conflict with one another. There is no single protagonist in this novel but several, at least insofar as reader identification is concerned.Trollope somehow achieves all of this without a Proustian surfeit of sensory detail; like Edith Wharton, he works by precisely detailing the trains of thought of his characters. Unlike Wharton, however, he achieves this effect with a multitude of characters rather than a small circle of central ones.Trollope's characters seem willfully designed to run the gamut of the spectrum of moral rectitude. For me, the most relatable character was Paul Montague, who is essentially upright and sympathetic but who occasionally commits errors of judgment with which I could readily relate.The character whose company I enjoyed the most, however, was Roger Carbury, who consistently demanded the very highest standard of conduct -- from others, but most of all from himself. Carbury's virtue ultimately prevents him from acting to further his most impassioned desires. He is one of two moral centers in the book; there is another who proves equal to him in moral courage but who cannot be identified here without spoiling some of the plot.At the opposite end of the spectrum are out-and-out rogues - the rascally Felix Carbury, and the unscrupulous Melmotte. Again, I will leave it to the reader to discover just where (if anywhere) are the limits of their skullduggery. It's clear from the novel's beginning that Melmotte takes some liberties in financial affairs; one cannot help but notice, for the first few hundred pages, that any time he is involved in a transaction, cash flows in his direction whereas only railway stock flows the other way. But not for some time is the reader able to judge where his legerdemain stops.Between the moral poles of Roger Carbury on the one end, and Melmotte and Sir Felix on the other, are a whole gallery of other characters - the decent but occasionally weak Paul Montague, the irresponsible but not criminal Dolly Longestaffe (a male), the calculating Lady Carbury, the beautiful, misused Mrs. Hurtle with her dark past, the plucky but naively trusting Marie Melmotte, the fearless and iconoclastic attorney Squercum, the rustic, crude but upright John Crumb, and many others.Testimony to the quality of Trollope's writing is the way he is even able to weave some empathy for a villain. Late in the story, when the pressures of exposure and societal judgment are closing in on one ne'er-do-well, we experience his wretched unraveling. Most of us learn, early in life, the terrible strain of being slowly entangled by our own falsehood; this learning experience enables us to live more honest lives in adulthood. To see a character relentlessly done in by the pressure of his own lies, however justified, is vividly agonizing in Trollope's skillful hands.Also striking about the novel is its cinematic nature. It seems tailor-made to be translated into film, and indeed several of the episodes in the book seem somehow to have been constructed with forethought of the medium. The reader reflexively visualizes the action playing out - even to the extent of imaging the camera lingering foreshadowingly on certain elements of each scene.So deeply did I care about the various characters that, toward the novel's end, I began to hope against hope that two unlucky but virtuous characters could be brought together somehow. This would have required an absurdly unrealistic surmounting of barriers erected earlier by those same characters, and thus the satisfaction of this urge would have robbed the novel of its realism. But caring about the characters as much as I did, I couldn't help but hope.Without giving away the ending, I can't help but remark that, while Trollope concludes the affairs of many of his characters in happy matrimony, the two who prove the novel's moral exemplars are disappointed in all of their self-interested hopes. Is Trollope saying by this that we must choose between being as good as we can, and being as happy as we can?In any event, readers who are looking for timeless characters - characters who will vividly haunt, across the expanse of time, the imagination of the 21st-century reader - need look no further than Trollope's masterwork."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"In THE WAY WE LIVE NOW, Felix Carbury, a London bachelor of a certain class, is pursuing the wealthy Marie Melmotte, whose financier father arranges her betrothal to a stuffy lord. Intimidated yet dogged, Felix also has assignations with the pretty country girl Ruby Ruggles, who is engaged to John Crumb, a tongue-tied yet decent rustic enraged by the debonair Felix. Meanwhile, Henrietta, Felix's sister, is pursued by her cousin Roger, an old fud. But she is in love with ineffectual Paul, who now regrets his reckless proposal to the shrewd and relentless Mrs. Hurtle. Finally, Mrs. Carbury, a widow and the mother of Felix and Henrietta, is pursued by Mr. Broune, a valuable career contact who must be handled just so. Ascendant in these and other tales of romantic foolishness is the financier Melmotte, who has the ability to make big money, as well as august yet questionable social standing. He is the point of reference for all the London characters in THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and the engine forcing the book's mostly futile males into action.If such shenanigans are your cup to tea, by all means read this 800 page novel, which contains beautifully drawn characters, as well as hundreds of pages of amused and forgiving social commentary about England in the 1870's. But for me, this book--surely a work of gentle genius--reads as a minutely-observed story of interminable social and business folly, with too many characters inhibited by what are now quaint and obsolete codes. Truly, it's easy to see why this book and author are GREAT. But, I didn't get it."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Trollope's sharp eye for detail in the social, economic and spiritual aspects of society never fails (although the spiritual aspects that so many enjoy in the Barsetshire novels take a back seat here).Readers following the recent stock market slide and the collapse of Enron will find parallels here, both disturbing and amusing. Mr. Melmotte and his phony railroad joining San Francisco to Vera Cruz have strong links to real-life characters and scams like the criminal financiers responsible for the savings and loan debacle of the '80s and the guys at Enron who are currently facing Congressional investigation.In addition to the financial shenanigans, there is of course a wonderful cast of characters, including Sir Felix Carbury, a wastrel who would rob his own mother (and does), Mr. Roger Carbury, a fine, upstanding man (who always has to deliver -- and receive -- bad news), and Mrs. Hurtle, an American &quot;widow&quot; who knows a thing or two about masculine psychology.Great literature speaks to us across the ages, and The Way We Live Now might tell us something about keeping an eye on our portfolios -- and our ethics."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I have always loved this book and it has been a pleasure to reread it.

It's a good read and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a well-written novel."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"If Trollope were alive now, in our present day and age of greed and lust, his book The Way We Live Now would have fit perfectly.

In this novel, Trollope assures us that good triumphs over evil and being honorable and worthy is the way to go.I am in love with this book. I hope you enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Much has been said about how nothing changes in business and finance. That the same lessons are painfully relearned with echoing outrage from previous events of a similar nature. The Way We Live Now holds parallels to the financial crisis of 2008 as it has with the dot com bubble, the Great Depression and all other such events and their greedy machinations. But what this book actually showcases are the foibles of people in pursuit of wealth. The stinging indictment being we people cannot outgrow our base behaviours. And in that comparison we can match the novel's characters with people we ourselves know, others we learn of in the news and, in fact, ourselves.This is Trollope's longest novel ... his Bleak House. And like that Dickens novel it requires patience but there is reward. This is a stunning satire replete with rich messages. Trollope's characters tend to be a little less full than Dickens but his contribution are never-ending bon mots of observations and critiques. Consider these lines:- \\"He kept his head above water, and was regarded by those who knew about him, but did not know him, a successful man.\\" In one sentence the author captures how society ascribes a pedigree to someone without the requisite facts to do so- \\"And her face was a true index of her character.\\" A terrific brief line which is at once detailed but puts the effort back on the reader to envision the character in fullMy favourite aspect of the novel was the subplot damning the publishing industry. Many of the observations could apply to today's bloggers and self-publishers...those who deliver no new content but get \\"puffed\\" or promoted. This is the Lady Carbury plot line which is deliciously vacuous ... \\"She had no ambition to write a good book, but was painfully anxious to write a book that the critics should say was good.\\" Within the book, too long to quote, is a perfectly scathing passage of the book review process which was obviously visceral to Trollope.The characters sashay through the book attempting to best each other be demonstrating \\"superiority in fashionable intellect\\". This reminded me of the pompous literary and advertising industry events I have attended whereby everyone attempts to prove they are intellectually everyone else's better. By all means pick this novel up but give it generous time to finish. It was one of those books I needed to put down for a few days and then come back to. Finally, beyond the substance of this review, it must be noted that the value-for-money is notable given the version I downloaded was free."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"The Way we Live Now\\", a novel about wheeling and dealing in late 19th century London, surprised me. I don't know Trollope's work as well as other 19th century novelists, so I wasn't prepared for his urban sophistication and lack of sentimentality. It could be a story about the present day, though most literary novelists today are more concise than Trollope and would include more violence, profanity, and explicit sexuality than Trollope did.One of the main question about this story of fraud and attempted cover up and love affairs gone awry is how to interpret the word \\"we\\" in the title. Trollope limits himself at least in this story in ways that Dickens or George Eliot or Balzac did not. Most of the characters are well-familiar with the prosperity of at least the upper middle class, many are ambitious for social advancement. I believe the word \\"we\\" in the title refers to people for whom fashionable society is second nature and also, by extension, to those whose lives depend on the decisions these influential folks make.News reports tell us that there is plenty of corruption and fraud in high places today that affects the lives of ordinary people and Trollope portrays the shenanigans and weaknesses of similar people in his day. The word \\"we\\" in the title does not have universal application, however. Many folks, including some who are powerful and well-to-do, live within their means and do their best to keep from making trouble for their neighbors.Still, this book is well worth reading. Plain as its presentation is, it certainly provokes thought."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"The Way We Live Now\\" is a book from the Victorian era, and it presents a view of English soceity as it relates to money, status, titles, and relationships. Trollope brillantly contrasted the morals and customs of \\"old\\" English soceity against the mostly fleeting, deceitful tactics of \\"young\\" English soceity.Not everything was necessarily better in the past because Trollope portrays a strong hatred of Jews, which surprised me because I haven't read much from this time period. If this depiction was true of the general feeling in the late 1800's, I can understand how this could eventually boil over into the hatred seen in WW2 against the Jews.Trollope created a long, slowly building story where he introduces us to several promiment families -- the majority featured strong parental influences and a mix of children who displayed behaviour in line with the morals and beliefs of the \\"modern\\" times of the story. We also saw a mix of other supporting characters, including a few Americans, which provided an interesting look at how they were depicted compared to the English.Overall, I enjoyed the long journey with these characters. Some I found despicable, some I loathed, but still respected their tenacity, and a few I admired for the choices they made in regards to love."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I listened to tis book on audio, all hundred chapters of it.

This explains the enormous numbers of chapters. Presumably by the time the first chapters were being published the writer hadn't written the end of the book - probably hadn't even decided what the ending was going to be. And it shows. Towwards the end I had the impression that even the writer himself was getting bored, just wanting to get through it and finish the contracted number of episodes before thankfully laying down his pen.Overall a disappointing end to a promising beginning.

And the worst is \\"The Eustace diamonds.\\" But they're all splendid. I fear that we live in an era when one reads only what is in the New York times list, which are generally dreadful. So read them. If that doesn't please you, read Thackeray. In my humble opinion, Vanity Fair is the best novel in the English language, but again there is the vocabulary problem.

There were some parts of it and characters that I liked (Roger Carbury and Mrs. Hurtle) but even storylines I was into in the beginning felt draggy to me towards the end.I found both Paul Montague and Hetta Carbury to be rather insipid and weak. I came to like Hetta a little more by the end as she was able to stand up for herself a little, but I never understood what she saw in Paul. And what did Mrs. Hurtle see in him either?

Published in 1875, it is generally esteemed as Anthony Trollope's magnum opus. I truly cringe - based on this assessment - to imagine what it might be like to plough through Trollope's myriad other novels. The title of the book has, of course, become a modern-day catchphrase, though it has become so generalised that one scarcely knows what is meant by it now.Lest the reader of this review think that mine is simply a modern sensibility not attuned to Victorian virtues and thus unable to appreciate Trollope's plodding, soporific prose, here is what the New York Times (whose archives are thoroughly searchable back to 1851) had to say about Trollope in the paper's 1876 review of this book:\\"We know of few books which are equal to his in the wealth of passages admirably adapted to be skipped; and probably no writer who is popularly read is so much skipped as he is.\\"I'm very much in accord with this Victorian era reviewer and these readers; and though I forced myself not to skip anything, it was trying, to put it mildly. Trollope's fundamental problem is of a piece with what irks one about the self-denying Stoic hero, of sorts, of this book, Rodger Carbury. Here are Trollope's own words describing his alter ego:\\"The man had no poetry about him. He did not even care for romance. All the outside belongings of love which are so pleasant to many men and which to many women afford the one sweetness in life which they really relish, were nothing to him.\\"Of course, he's a saint compared to the loathsome stock-jobber, Mr. Melmotte, the focal point of this tome, and whom many present-day writers compare to Bernie Madoff. But he and this book are a crashing bore all the same. It's all very well to refer to the title of this book in order to seem erudite, cultured and knowledgeable about history at cocktail parties. But just try reading the actual book! You'll find yourself in the same spot as many a Victorian reader did - with your eyelids drooping over the dense prose and wooden characters and storylines."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"It is most when reading (or re-reading) Trollope that I realize how much recent novels suck. Trollope, who regarded novel-writing as a learned trade, shows wider understanding of human nature than twentieth-century, breadloaf-fed artistes. Trollope was the master of personal character. He knew what motivated people, and what faults kept them from behavior they knew was correctThe Way We Live Now is an examination, from a skilled, intelligent early Victorian, of the beginning of capital as worth. Melmotte might be any of current unscrupulous speculators you can name (if you even think speculating is ungentlemanly). I do not personally agree with Trollope as he seems to believe in birth and blood, but I can easily agree that those who buy notice are never worth notice."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is a tour de force by Trollope. Having finished the Barchester series, I decided to take on another while on a trip to San Francisco (featured somewhat in the novel). I think I enjoyed this most of all. It compares best with Thackery's Vanity Fair--there is no hero. Nearly all of its characters are fully fleshed out. Sir Felix finds ways to sink lower than the reader thinks he can sink. Melmotte is a superior version of Kenneth Lay. And Mrs. Hurtle is incomparable, as well as an unadulterated delight. She personifies one of the main themes: the English are spent, and the real life is to be found in America, even for its recognized faults.The novel is long, but this reader was never bored. The plot was a fine thicket which built to a cresendo followed by a cleanly knotted and leisurly and satisfying finish.

The Way We Live Now is far more bleak than most of Trollope's work, yet not irredeemably so. The clear moral focus is still there as is Trollope's acute understanding that there is good and bad in all of us. For all the withering portraits it includes, the main characters are never caricatures. Even moral touchstones such as Roger Carbury are shown in all their murky complexity while they guide us through the still murkier world of speculation, vanity and avarice. And secondary characters such as Lord Nidderdale and Georgiana and Dolly Longestaffe are absolute gems. This is a masterpiece of the first order, one to read again and again and cherish.

He preys on the weaker elements-in the form of dissolute young lords-as he climbs to greater heights in the social world. At the fringe of this social world, one also encounters people just trying to get by--the wife of a dead peer turning out hackneyed prose for example--as they cling to the appearances of respectability.Trollope's description of this world in many ways evokes the Internet bubble of the late 1990's. You see the same types of behavior and meet the same types of characters in this world.In this novel, Trollope has also created two very strong and memorable female characters. Hetta is the daughter of the &quot;lady turned writer&quot; and the sister of a very dissipated peer. Yet she somehow has a sterling character though less than sterling judgement in her suitors. Marie, the daughter of the shady financier Melmotte, is even more fascinating. At the start of the novel, she appears to be a weak little thing who is basically being auctioned off to the bidder with the most prestigious social credentials. However, after a disappointment in love, she finds the strength within herself to beat her father at his own game. Trollope develops characters so fully and with such depth that you feel as if they are living and breathing in front of you.I would recommend this book to lovers of serious literature everywhere. Yes, at times the language is dated and there are some horrifying anti-Semitic passages. But the book is a fully realized portrait of a society that still has relevance to readers today."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"This is the fifth of Trollope's novels I have read and easily the best so far. It does not fall within any of his series but a few familiar characters breeze in and out if you are familiar with some of the other books. This novel in particular for me (along with Trollope generally) has been very useful in my ongoing study of humanity, and particularly women, who I believe Trollope has a rare deftness of touch with, unusual for a 19th century male writer. I have read somewhere that Trollope felt his romantic subplots were somewhat tacked-on to the political or business action in his novels, but in this novel in particular I cannot allow him to make such a claim - it is the best among his novels for descriptions of human feelings and I enjoyed it very much for that."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Considered Trollope's masterpiece this book centers around a brillant cast of characters with inter-connecting lives. It deals with many social and political issues of the time period across all classes. One of my favorite things about Trollope's books this one especially, is that he always portrays his women honestly and gives them strong independent voices. He really understands and accurately portrays all of the feminine issues of the day. All of his characters, men and women have faults and none of them are perfect so it is easy to become so involved and committed to them. I loved this book tremendously and I would have given it all five stars and more but I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Rogar Carbury is one of my favorite male characters that I have been introduced to recently and I wished he could have gotten a better ending. It was well worth the read even though some people might be a bit daunted by its size."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"It's a pity that Trollope is a minority pleasure. Far more readers know Dickens, and comparisons are inevitable. In \\"The Way We Live Now\\" we see all his strengths on display: tortuous but believable plotting, a clear-eyed view of people's frailties, and best of all, his realistic portrayals of women. This latter skill leaves poor Dickens choking in Trollope's dust. In this fine and hugely readable novel, the women are perhaps even more finely drawn than the men, especially Marie Melmotte. At first she is merely a simpering pawn of the plot, but soon shows her mettle.One of the troublesome aspects of the novel is the anti-Semitism of some of the characters. Oh well, perhaps we can accept it as part of the characters' personalities, but still, in the age of Mel Gibson, it makes one cringe.This surely must be Trollope's longest book. But I sped through it, hardly letting the book drop from my hands even for meals. The subjects are human greed, the struggle for position, and the fluidity of class even in Victorian Britain. Everyone must discover this master for themselves."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I read Anthony Trollope's novel after I had seen the BBC mini-series of the same name. Although I had read a lot of Dickens, Thackeray and Elliot I had never read any of Trollope's novels. I am glad that I watched the BBC adaptation because this novel is as delightful to read as those of the famous novelists mentioned above.The story starts with the introduction of Lady Carbury and her good-for-nothing son Sir Felix Carbury but soon many other characters are introduced. Among this the great financier and swindler Auguste Melmotte is the most interesting. As in the Dickens novels, the villains are the most fascinating characters here. There are some side stories like that of Hetta Carbury-Paul Montague and Ruby Rubbles-John Crumb. But to tell the truth, these stories are not as enjoyable to read as the others except that they introduce us to some great characters like Mrs. Hurtle and Roger Carbury. Mrs. Hurtle is very interesting because her ideas of how a woman should take control of her own destiny are very modern. Roger Carbury is in fact the only character who behaves honorably and sensibly throughout the novel with the addition of maybe Hetta Carbury but she is of too little consequence to deserve any interest.Another character to note is Marie Melmotte, Melmotte's daugher who becomes the object of many a titled personality's attentions not because she is beautiful and her family is respectable but because her father is very rich. She evolves through the novel and comes out as one of the strongest characters.Involvement of Dolly Longstaffe and Lord Nidderdale are also very enjoyable because although they are very mercenary in their attitude there is a comic element to their existence.Anthony Trollope's depiction of the society in the Victorian times is very interesting. In the earlier novels that I have read, like Jane Austen's novels of the Edwardian era, although people are governed by monetary concerns, they always take care to stay within some principles like never condescending to marry someone in trade. Here we see that land owners are willing to associate with City people. There is a changing attitude against Jewish people too. I don't agree with the opinions of some reviewers who think the novel is anti-Semitic. Although Melmotte is thought to be a Jew and Georgiana Longstaffe's engagement to Mr Brehgert is considered scandalous by her family, Trollope takes care to express his views about people's hypocrisy when he says the Christians who are outraged at such connections never visit the church themselves. Also, in spite of carrying out transactions with Melmotte, Mr Brehgert comes out as quite a decent and honest man. Another interesting point concerning religion is made through Roger Carbury's friendship of a Catholic priest. Although this side story sounds a bit contrived, it is interesting to note that one of the most respectable characters in the story is quite open-minded about having dinners with a priest though in time he gets annoyed with his over his over-zealousness in trying to convert himself.All in all a very enjoyable satire and though it may look a a bit long to today's reader, I read in almost in a breath except for a few chapters where I wanted them to finish so that I could get to the adventures of more interesting characters."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Despite 135 years of \\"progress,\\" Trollope's novel remains as topical today as it was then. Stock scams, public relations manipulations, social climbing, successful scoundrels, MacMansions...you name it and you will find it in the pages of this acid-dipped tour through the worst of English upper-crust life so mirrored by the recent real estate bubble of our own. As often in Trollope, the \\"good guys\\" may be just too good for words, but the bad guys are simply fabulous! Put aside an hour a day for about a month, and you will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Way We Live Now is one of the finest of over forty novels that Anthony Trollope wrote in his long and productive career. What makes this novel truly great is Trollope's ability to involve the reader in a lengthy and complicated story. Few other writers have Trollope's skill in creating a world that seems as true as our own. From the beginning of the story, we take an interest in the activities of the major characters and find ourselves thinking about them and their problems even after we have finished reading for the day. Trollope's characters are as real as our own family and we think of them as relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Often, we would like to step into the novel and discuss a pressing problem with a character.At the center of The Way We Live now is Augustus Melmotte, the financial wonder of the age who dupes investors with a Ponzi scheme that would have made Bernard Madoff proud. All the characters in the novel are in Melmotte's orbit. He is the most important character in the story. When he departs, page 638 in my edition of the novel, all that is left is to tie up loose ends, and there are many of them. Unfortunately, Trollope takes too long to do so, at least in my opinion. That is the only weakness in what otherwise is a great novel.Few authors have ever described so accurately and well the lives of the ruling class in England. Readers of George Eliot's Middlemarch, or Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or perhaps Dickens' Bleak House and Little Dorrit will certainly want to include these great novelists in the discussion of true artists who create an unforgettable world of the imagination. Trollope not only belongs in this august company, in some ways he is superior to it. Readers of Middlemarch surely will wish to argue with me. Yet Trollope has few equals when it comes to dramatizing the ordinary events of everyday life. His description of each scene is so complete and accurate and his dialogue so real that for the time we are reading we lose any sense of distance as a reader and, as noted earlier, become involved as if we ourselves were a character in the story.I had just finished reading five of Trollope's Palliser novels and decided to take a break from this series before starting The Duke's Children, the final Palliser novel. The Way We Live Now came higly recommended by both professional critics and Amazon reviewers. I add my voice to the chorus of Trollope admirers and enthusiastically recommend The Way We Live Now to all lovers of Victorian literature."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"No need to buy this book, it is interesting enough to read it off your computer screen. I think that says a lot. Very contemporary and thus has survived passage of time, contains a lot of anti-Semite statements which when compared to a Dickens or a Thackeray seemed excessive."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"The Way We Live Now, by Anthony Trollope shows how people react to money. Even though it was written in eighteen-seventy-four, people can still react to the characters because human nature has not changed. Anthony Trollope shows that when money is concerned, people are not very wise. This book is very difficult to focus on because there are so many different characters introduced at once, which makes it hard to follow. However, once you get a grasp on all of the characters, it is a good representation of human nature towards money. This book by no means is easy to read. If your looking for mental stimulation, this would be a very stimulating book for you. This book no doubt, keeps you on your toes. You have to keep your thoughts clear and organized when reading this book, so that you don't confuse the many different characters. This book makes you stop and think about how you would react if you were put in some of these different kinds of situations. For the nineties, the style of writing is simply not exciting, which adds to the difficulty of getting through the book. Another aspect of this book that makes it hard to finish, is the length. It takes a lot of time and energy to finish the book. The book though interesting is not one that can be finished in a short period of time. If you are devoted to sitting down and enjoying a good book, you definitely should consider this book."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"\\"The Trillion Dollar Meltdown\\" by Charles Morris mentions this book and I; a bit of an adventuresome sort thought I would read it.I found the book charming to a fault; I was completely enamoured with the characters; and enjoyed the book immensely.During the entire book tho, I could not help but remind myself that had it not been for the classical style of the writing itself, one would think this book had been written about America's financial industry at present.Definately a great read, and highly recommended that one place it on the Summer Reading schedule.My only complaint is the number of bl&tant; typographical errors, which at times made reading a tad difficult and humourous."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Often considered Trollope's greatest novel, this satire of British life, written in 1875, leaves no aspect of society unexamined. Through his large cast of characters, who represent many levels of society, Trollope examines the hypocrisies of class, at the same time that he often develops sympathy for these characters who are sometimes caught in crises not of their own making. Filling the novel with realistic details and providing vivid pictures of the various settings in which the characters find themselves, Trollope also creates a series of exceptionally vibrant characters who give life to this long and sometimes cynical portrait of those who move the country.Lady Carbury, her innocent daughter Henrietta (Hetta), and her attractive but irresponsible son Felix are the family around which much of the action rotates. They are always in need of money and Lady Carbury writes pap novels to support the family (and Felix's drinking and gambling). In contrast to the Carburys, and just as important to the plot, are the Melmottes. Augustus Melmotte, who has come from Vienna under a cloud of financial suspicions, has acquired a huge estate for himself, his foreign wife, and his marriageable daughter. Boorish, but determined to become a leader of society, Melmotte provides moments of humor for the reader, though he is scorned by an aristocracy which is nevertheless beholden to him for his investments.When Melmotte becomes the major investor in a plan to build a railway from California to Mexico, Paul Montague, a handsome engineer who has been working in America, arrives in town. A ward of Roger Carbury, cousin of Felix and Hetta, he soon finds himself in love with Hetta--and in competition with Roger for her hand. Felix courts the Melmottes' daughter for her fortune, and she falls in love with him while he dallies with a local domestic worker. Investors dash to buy shares in the Mexican railway, with their investments ending in the sticky hands of Melmotte, who has bigger plans.Often addressing the reader directly, Trollope fills the novel with action and subplots which illustrate a wide variety of themes, often depicting his characters satirically to illustrate the social, political, and financial ills of the day. Ahead of his time for his depiction of the lively, intelligent woman whose role is defined (and limited) by her social and financial position, Trollope creates a number of resourceful women--and a number who are willing to do almost anything to marry a wealthy man. As is customary in Victorian novels, the good are rewarded here, and the evil are punished, but Trollope's characters, unlike those by Dickens, for example, usually control their own destinies. Broad in scope, thoughtful in construction, complete in its depiction of 1870s' England, filled with wonderful characters, and absolutely engrossing to read, The Way We Live Now is one of the great novels of the nineteenth century. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"One should be cautious with regard to the consumption of Trollopian tales; they are addictive. Read one and you will go back for another. The Way We Live Now is a delightful novel full of well crafted characters. Winifred Hurtle is fascinating;certainly she is far too much woman for Paul Montague.Doug WilsonBoston"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Picture a world in which a shadowy entreprenour rubs shoulders with the great and powerful, while hard-driving yuppies stop at nothing to be associated with his schemes. Sounds like Ron Reagan's &quot;Morning in America,&quot; doesn't it? Except it is Victorian London. The entreprenour is Auguste Melmotte. The yuppies are the scions of great and small families hurling themselves at his daughter, his phantasmagorical railway (between Salt Lake City and Vera Cruz yet!) company, and the hem of his cloak. And the book is Anthony Trollope's THE WAY WE LIVE NOW.Like all of Trollope's books, this one is as well crafted as any by Eliot or Thackeray; yet the theme and handling are strikingly modern. I came to this book by way of the Barsetshire novels with their depiction of rural clergy. I should have read THE WAY WE LIVE NOW first.Especially worth noting are the surprisingly full characterizations of Marie Melmotte, daughter of the financier, who is courted by her emotional inferiors, and Roger Carbury, a rural landowner who holds aloof from the fray and helps several of the others pick up the pieces from their lives.The only negative is the book's anti-semitism, though it makes several attempts to lift itself from this charge."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Everyone of course focuses on the pitch perfect portrayal of political, economic and cultural corruption as it existed then and as it exists in only slightly modified manifestation now, but because no one commits suicide (with one exception), goes insane, goes into lifetime seclusion, dies of horrible diseases, or starves to death it often seems to be suggested that this story lacks emotional force and psychological depth. I don't share this feeling at all; to my mind some of the portrayals of people trying to find happiness and being thwarted by circumstances, social mores, their own natures and other people compares very well with Austin or Bronte."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"Although I had read several earlier Trollope novels, I did not know of this 1875 book, which some consider his masterpiece, until seeing a DVD of theBBC TELEVISION ADAPTATIONof 2001. Simply in terms of plot, the latter may be superior. For one thing, the role of the great financier, Augustus Melmotte, especially as played by David Suchet is even more dominant. In creating this larger-than-life Victorian precursor of, say, Bernie Madoff, a man for whom credit builds on more credit to create a monstrous bubble of emptiness, Trollope was referring to scandals of his time, but the character is a magnificent creation in his own right. Not for nothing did Auden praise Trollope as \\"the novelist who best understands the role of money.\\" Not that money has ever been far from the minds of any nineteenth-century English novelists, not least the romantic Jane Austen: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" In this novel, there is scarcely a romance or would-be romance that is not affected at some level by considerations of money, though Trollope grades his sympathies very neatly in inverse proportion to the nakedness of the financial motive.In terms of romance, the BBC adaptation is unquestionably better. Hetta Carbury, who Trollope himself later described as \\"weak and vapid,\\" is brought to splendid life by Paloma Baeza. Her lover, Paul Montague (Ciaran Hinds), so weak in the book that Trollope must constantly apologize for him, is given a real profession and emerges as an activist on the side of justice and integrity. On the other hand, Trollope remarked that \\"the interest of the story lies among the wicked and foolish people,\\" and he was right, succeeding especially with the halfway characters who may be foolish, but are not downright wicked. Good though the performances are in the video, Trollope's own treatment of the American adventuress Mrs. Hurtle (whom he repeatedly refers to as a wild cat) and Melmotte's daughter Marie are far richer and more nuanced. Marie especially, who does indeed start out foolish, develops into one of the more interesting female characters in nineteenth-century literature; I kept reading eagerly ahead to find out what would become of her (since this was left open in the adaptation); I can't say that I was especially satisfied, but I certainly cared.One source of interest in the book that you don't get from the adaptation at all is Trollope's commentary on current events. Apart from one brief use of the phrase in the movie, there seems almost no reason for its title, but in the book \\"The Way We Live Now\\" is almost the main subject. There is not a chapter goes by without reference to recent shifts in morality and social acceptability, or to changes in the spheres of politics, the church, publishing, and of course finance. The old ways are represented by two country dwellers in Suffolk, some miles from London. Roger Carbury, the fortyish local squire, is the touchstone of all that is right and clear-thinking, though he is not above some bitter jealousy when he is beaten in his suit for his cousin Hetta's hand. His neighbor John Crumb, the local meal merchant, is shown as so stolid as to be \\"incapable of two concurrent ideas,\\" yet he also is goodness personified, and this tortoise does win his particular race. Trollope also contrasts a whole host of drones and fops, impoverished aristocrats, and hypocritical snobs against the new middle classes, men of commercial substance (or at least apparent substance) who manage the affairs of the nation. But of especial interest to American readers will be the importance he gives to that young country in counteracting the hidebound ways of English society. Trollope's Americans may be a little brash and lack polish, perhaps, but they have a more egalitarian social system, and they get things done. Sometimes it takes a wild cat to do it: \\"Mrs. Hurtle, for all her faults,\\" he concludes, \\"was a good-natured woman.\\" And he doesn't just say so; he shows it!Viewed purely as a narrative, this long book may overstay its welcome at 100 chapters. But as a witty account of the mores of its time and an early view of transatlantic relations, it is eminently worth reading."},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I just finished this nice long read, and I must say it was very well written: Trollope shows us a fascinating view of how the changes in society can affect the people living in it. We are given a view of all sorts of characters: from the volatile, swindler Melmotte to the swaggering, gambling coward Felix Carbury, to his antithesis, his staid, country cousin Roger Carbury, and Felix's silly & conniving mother Lady Carbury, to his sweet & saintly sister Hetta Carbury...the mousey Marie Melmotte, the marriage schemer Georgiana Longestaffe, the wonderful yet fallible Paul Montague, and the independent & brash American, Mrs. Hurtle. These & many other characters collide to give us a fascinating read, as their lives intertwine again & again, on so many levels.The staid & proper upper-crust Victorian society of yesteryear is slowly melting away, as English virtue & honor is being overtaken by lying, cheating, swindling, stealing, and much more. Where being a proper, honorable gentleman used to bring its own reward, now it is the more \\"modern\\" social rules that are taking effect in London society. Will virtue or vice triumph in the end? An excellent read, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Way We Live Now (Penguin Classics)","review":"I would beg to differ with the reviewers who discourage those unfamiliar with Trollope from starting with this book. Because of its modern theme and relevance to our age this should be the first on any new Trollope reader's list.

My heavens, doesn't one want subplots if one is going to commit to 800 pages.All in all, it's a good read. If one is going to read a 19th century 800 page novel, then it damn well better be interesting. And this book is. Personally, I like HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT better than this book.

His series of books on the social life of the Church of England clerics in the Barsetshire novels and his keen examination of British parliamentry live in the Palliser books are works of genius.In the Way We Live Now Trollope examines in microscopic detail the world of Victorian high finance. His chief character is a roguish foreigner Melmotte who makes the baddies at Enron look like schoolboys in duplicity and mendacious dealings. Melmotte is one of the great characters of British fiction and his novel deserves wider readership!Along the way in this massive three-decker we meet Lady Carbury the literary lady seeking mates for her prodigal sonFelix (a thoroughly detestable character!) and her sweet daugher Hettie who is torn between two lovers-her cousin Roger and heryounger swain Paul Montague. Montague has had a long affair with the dashing and beautiful American Mrs. Hurtle. She shows up in the long tale Trollope tells adding to our reading enjoyment to say nothing of creating all kinds of lovemaking complications!Trollope who enjoys romantic triangles also tells the tale of Marie Melmotte who is pursued by the wretched Fexlix Carbury andLord Longstaff a ninny without the sign of a brain!We also meet Ruby Ruggles who is in love with Felix Carbury while her country lover John Crumb seeks to win the fair Ruby and save her from the clutches of Felix.The modern reader may find the complicated details of the business being conducted somewhat tedious and difficult to understand. The work if written today would have been edited.As the book was released in serial form it often is repetitious.Trollope is in no hurry to tell his interesting, complicated survey of Great Britain at the zenith of Empire.Trollope's tale resonates today in our materialistic society where money and power reign.He has a plain style that draws the reader into turning to the next page to find out what will happen.

As the youngling grows up, it too runs from the predator.

Debono does a good job in this book as it gets you to think about thinking. Just as in any book you read, you walk away with some thing useful, you walk away with something you would not find useful, just as you would find something you would agree with and something you don't.For me, it was a good investment in time because I now have in my arsenal methods to think analytically in situations that come about. If for nothing else, this book saves you time in your job and in your life. As a plus, you will be able to understand more of what is going on around you."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"DeBono has some valid points, it's just that I've read most of them elsewhere, however, in other places he contributes original material to the discussion. I fail to see the point of a \\"thinking club\\" which he advocates at the end of this book, the purpose of which is not to solve any problem, but to develop thinking skills. He fails to convince me of the efficacy of such an activity.On the positive side of things, the author said arrogance is not the point of being an effective thinker. It has nothing to do with being superior to other people or being clever. Developed thinking skills relate to the process and quality of the activity.I buy his argument that just because an idea is \\"good\\" does not mean it cannot be improved upon. Seeing options one didn't perceive earlier is an effective way of expanding one's territory. Similarly, he makes a good case for action over perfectionism by saying, \\"If I were to rewrite my manuscripts they would always get better--but never get published as the process of improvement can be never ending.\\"He creates new words in this book and justifies himself in doing so by noting, \\"I believe they ought to be part of the language because without new words we cannot 'hold' new concepts--they just drift off into the old concepts if we have to use old words.\\" Overall this book has some worthwhile points to make about thinking."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"Edward de Bono challenges us in the way we think. &quot;Intelligence is a pontential, but thinking is an operational skill&quot;, he says. This is a more fundamental book, and an excellent primer on de Bono's &quot;thinking&quot; rather than a book on how to do it. He tackles points like &quot;why many intelligent people are trapped&quot; or &quot;why critical thinking is a valuable part of thinking but totally inadequate on its own&quot;. De Bono covers many topics in this book (incl. his famous Lateral Thinking) and some rather abstract excercises I didn't like. Rather difficult topics like emotion, other people, or thinking &amp; doing are included which prove de Bono as the best in the world on thinking. Bravo!"},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"All of De Bono's works are highly inspiring and this book is no different.

From this perspective, the book was not successful. This book is more theoretical rather than providing practical techniques that can be applied to actual thinking. De Bono describes numerous \\"tools\\" that can be used to help thinking. But I felt the way they were presented was too abstract, and there was no structure or organization. It was just a laundry list.I became very concerned about the author's ability to apply his tools when I read the following (page 27): \\"A classic example of this is Darwin's theory of evolution. It is plausible and rational and better than anything else. It is also impossible to prove. Our proof for it rests on our lack of imagination in thinking of a better mechanism.\\" De Bono is apparently unaware of the scientific method and the large body of evidence supporting evolution-it is not based merely on \\"lack of imagination.\\" Perhaps de Bono is an expert on the process of thinking, but maybe he cannot apply his expertise to specific situations. He is too wrapped up in his \\"tools\\" to actually apply them appropriately.If you are looking for practical steps you can take to help improve your thinking, I recommend the book \\"Dumbth\\" by the late Steve Allen."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"Excellent stuff for breaking out of fixed thought forms and attain fun in thinking and be astonishing creative and come up with solutions in a different fashion then ever before"},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"As a tenured law-professor in a school dedicated to teaching lawyers to solve problems creatively, I consider de Bono's book the most startlingly original and comprehensive book I've encountered on the subject.

Not only does he help one grasp how we think, he provides specific ways to think differently and bring structure to the process of thinking. This book is a hidden treasure that I will recommend to many of my professional colleagues and friends."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"REVIEW: I received a copy of this book by accident. I decided to read it anyway since I am a &quot;thinking&quot; personality type and the book looked easy to read. I was expecting the book to read like a hyped-up mass market self help book. I was pleasantly surprised. I found the book very practical, easy to read, and genuine. I picked up a good deal of useful information and helpful methods. These include understanding (within the brain) what makes things seem funny to step-by-step thinking procedures.De bono writes very simply and even when he explains theoretical concepts the explanations are not technical. There is some tendency by the author to regularly cite his many other books and to use his own made up words and acronyms. I found the citations to the other works authentic and not overt plugs. Similarly the use of coined terms and acronyms seemed very practical and not driven by ego as I've noticed with many authors.STRENGTHS: Very practical methods and ideas to improve thinking, easy to read, short chapters. Optional practice activities and not too technical or academic.WEAKNESSES: Some might not like the regular use of coined terms and acronyms. Only cites his own books. Some things explained too briefly.WHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: Anyone interested in improving their thinking."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"This book was a quick read and totally worth the time. De Bono explains many methods to help you keep an open mind about many common situations. He explains that the mind wants certainty in order to take action, but that sometimes to get this certainty, the mind will use a familiar pattern of thinking that may not necessarily apply to the situation under consideration, while ignoring many possibilities. The more our minds use the same patterns, the easier it is to use the same pattern even if the situation doesn't call for it. For example, say you commonly jump on the defensive in personal situations and believe people do things without considering you. You may ignore possible alternatives in many personal situations and use the same destructive pattern to interpret many of your personal encounters. In one section of the book, De Bono compares these patterns of thinking to pouring hot ink on a bowl of jello. The ink will make an indention. Then if you pour the ink and melted jello out, the indention remains. And the next time you pour hot ink into the same jello, the ink will deepen the same indention in the jello. In the same way, the more our minds use certain patterns to interpret the world, the easier it becomes to use the same patterns time and time again. This book teaches you to recognize your familiar patterns of thinking and move beyond them if necessary. A really interesting read. De Bono does not attack Western thought. On the other hand, he simply objectively describes some of the history behind it and the fact that it was necessary and most practical at one time. In the end of the book, he gives a layout for setting up a &quot;thinking club&quot; which if set up would probably resemble Benjamin Franklin's &quot;Junto.&quot; Excellent read!"},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"DeBono counters the misconceptions that creativity and thinking are innate, by providing tools and exercises for thinking. These tools encourage deliberate thinking, and a self-image of &quot;I am a thinker&quot;. The techniques provide mechanisms for focusing, looking at alternatives, and deliberate thinking. deBono introduces his term &quot;lateral thinking&quot; and &quot;po\\" for emphasizing pattern changing and provocation. deBono does not take himself to ponderously, and often sees humor as tool of escaping set patterns (and I was surprised by his &quot;Nor can God have a sense of humor since there can be no surprise ..&quot;). In the area of decision science, there are more techniques available (e.g., risk avoidance, regret avoidance, Bayesian). I also am sure some of his more recent books (this one written in 1982) offer additional tools, but this book provides a good foundation."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"Edward de Bono, the foremost teacher of thinking, has put all the pieces together in this sequel to many of his other books on the subject of thinking. His main point here is that although thinking is man's greatest survival tool and his greatest asset, we tend to take it for granted and invest little time or effort in improving our minds, or our ability to think.Here he explains that intelligent people are often haphazard and sloppy thinkers: That is, that they are not necessarily or inherently good thinkers; and that conversely, poor thinkers, and even unintelligent people can improve their thinking to a surprising degree. Intelligence, according to the author, is the skill with which one's thinking is conducted.As always, de Bono brings his own arsenal of examples and diagrams to drive his many points home. Unlike his five-day course in thinking, which deals with \\"thinking in practice,\\" this book delves into the more abstract and into the philosophy of good thinking habits, and how to achieve them. It is the perfect follow-up to the author's Five-day Course in Thinking.Five Stars"},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"DeBono's genius sometimes gets in his own way, but his work is probably the finest in this area. This specific book is powerful in that can actually help you think with more clarity and orginality. Mr. DeBono is the real deal and this book is worth every penny."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"My Profile: 40+ yo, sales engineer.I write this review after lending book to a good friend. he was unsatisfied because it did not provide a theoretical frame or basis from where to construct a logical thesis. This is precisely what the book tries to avoid, a dogmatic approach to thinking... and perhaps my friend's reaction shows the difference between pragamatic philosophy and those based on \\"first principles\\"..Chapter 4- Perception & Schemes (this refers to the spanish edition 1987 Plaza & Janez) alone is worth the price of the book and is a a principle worth hanging on a frame right in front of your desk, the problems you face in the world are mainly perception problems... and the complexities inherent in it...This is a book to challange your \\"default\\" or habitual mode of your problem solving.. simple but not simplistic.. its the use of the tool what matter.. because it can lead you to a newer perception."},{"Title":"De Bono's Thinking Course","review":"If you can read this book through, the one thing that may really stick in your mind should be the large number of acronyms brought forth by the author:-PMI (Plus, Minus, Interesting)APC (Alternatives, Possibilities, Choices)CAF (consider all factors)C&S; (Consequence & Sequel)EBS (examine both sides)ADI (Agreement, Disagreement, Irrelevance)OPV (Other People's Views)etc etc, all skills supposed to enhance readers' ability to think, to jump out of perceptions and patterns of thinking that the author regards as the biggest block against our creativity. Ironically, the author had reserved only 18 pages for his renowned \\"Laternal Thinking\\", that he had gone thru related methods of \\"Stepping Stone\\" (treat an idea of its movement value instead of just its judgement value), \\"Escape\\" (think of alternatives for things we take for granted) and \\"Random stimulation\\" (open ourselves to influence other than those we directly look for).What had been written so far might seem rather a collection of jargons than an organised passage with clear objectives. However, I assure you that you will get the same bad feeling from reading the book. Perhaps the author had published so many books that it became too hard for him to write a new one with original, flesh, and practical examples and ideas at all. In that case you really want to read something from de Bono, the \\"Six Thinking Hats\\" is a much better choice."},{"Title":"Guess Who Loves Blue!

It begins with an explanation of strategic pricing, and proceeds to cover competition in the market place, segmentation of buyers, pricing and the marketing mix for industrial and consumer goods, as well as the psychology of pricing. Also covered are models for determining price sensitivity, implications of sales staff price setting and negotiation, and finally, legal aspects of pricing.After reading this book, you will understand the pitfalls of pursuing market share at all costs and common mistakes businesses and sales people make when setting or negotiating price. You will view your current pricing structure and strategy in a new light, and be able to spot the weak spots. You'll have a better picture of how to attract the right buyers, those that can be served profitably.The book indirectly touches on topics covered in Co-opetition, and Thinking Strategically, as well as elements of the Theory of Constraints (see Eli Goldratt's &quot;The Goal&quot; and &quot;It's Not Luck&quot; or &quot;Management Dilemmas&quot; by Eli Schragenheim)I can't recommend this book highly enough. As for the other reader who states:&quot;After reading this book, I was able to talk circles around the $20,000 &quot;marketing consultant&quot; we were considering.&quot;believe it, it's that valuable!"},{"Title":"The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Profitable Decision Making (3rd Edition)","review":"Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden successfully demonstrate with practical examples that strategic pricers are diplomats rather than generals, contrary to common belief. Diplomats know that initiating price discounts can undermine the profitability of their business. Price cutting unduly focuses the attention of the customer base on their wallet rather than the value of the product offering to their life/business. Diplomats will carefully look not only at the short-term gain, but also at competitors' long-term reactions to measure the impact of such a move on the bottom line. Furthermore, diplomats do not share the misconception of generals that the ultimate winner must meet every challenge. Diplomats will integrate the product's relevant costs, the customer segments' price sensitivity and the behavior of the competition in their marketing plans. The analysis of those factors will then allow diplomats to weigh the costs and benefits of competition and only fight battles for which the likely benefits are greater than the likely costs. Nagle and Holden also stress the importance of establishing pricing policies consistent with the plans, especially when there is no fixed-price policy. Diplomats must give salespeople incentives to make profitable sales, not sales for their own sake. Salespeople will adapt their sales pitch to the different price sensitivity of price buyers, loyal buyers and value buyers. Nagle and Holden draw the attention of their readers to the fact that a product's price influences the market's perception of its features and benefits and those of other products with which it is sold, the effectiveness of its promotion, and the interest it generates in channels of distribution. They observe that the opposite is also true. Furthermore, Nagle and Holden look at the impact of the choice of an independent channel of distribution on corporate pricing policy. Diplomats must be attorneys specializing in legal pricing or at least hire one. They must consider not only what is profitable, but also what is legal and ethical in establishing pricing policies towards channels of distribution, end users, and competition. Pricing is such a legal minefield that both authors dedicate one chapter of their book to that delicate subject. Nagle and Holden also challenge another idea that many marketers share: The key to profitability is to achieve a dominant market share. Most companies in competitive markets try to be all things to all people rather than excel in serving the needs of particular customer segments. Both product differentiators and cost leaders have demonstrated that targeting a segment of customers and focusing on them pays off handsomely. A third edition of this book integrating the impact of the New Economy on pricing should be a welcome update to that masterpiece. To summarize, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing is a must read for anyone involved or interested in pricing. The content is so rich that I am still discovering new aspects about pricing two years after I read the book for the first time."},{"Title":"The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Profitable Decision Making (3rd Edition)","review":"Yes, I admit.

TCP/IP is fun; credits and debits aren't.Eventually, however, life dragged me into situations that required an understanding of this stuff...not general theory: I needed to intelligently price my products and services. A friend recommended the book, and even though I initially found it hard, I can't stop referencing and re-reading it.I had to re-read the first three chapters, to gain a growing awareness of just what the hell these guys were talking about, because at first their flavor of English was as impenetrable as legalese.But man, what got me to re-read these chapters was a clear understanding that this book was going to provide immediate applicable benefit. It was therefore well worth the investment.Now that I'm acquainted with what they call English I've found the book wicked powerful.

Concerning the value of this book, it is worth the price alone just for the chapter on costings and formula for calculating what level of sales a company can afford to lose/must gain after a price increase/decrease in order to break even.A common complaint about business books is that they are all OK in theeory but contain little in the way of explanations of how to implement - this book however offers not only theory and case study examples but also practical instructions on what needs to be done to improve pricing strategy.

A price is always relative - relative to the alternatives you (or the buyer) is considering. It's also relative to other products of the same company above or below the current price level. It's also relative to the reactions of your competitors and your own power.So you might (or should) think of a price change like a chess move.. One wrong move now may come back on you tenfold."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"This collection includes some of my favourite poems rendering a very wide range of different situations, observations and feelings. To be precise, &quot;The Haiku Year&quot; is a collection of senryu rather than haiku and only few of the poems have any reference to the season. Instead, most of them focus entirely on different aspects of human life. Many of the poems deal with urban life and a modern life-style. Another thing which makes &quot;The Haiku Year&quot; different from many other collections is its tone. It is less formal and shows less decorum than any collection I have ever seen, which I think is great. But if you object to bad language etc, you may find it too provoking. However, to those who celebrate every aspect of human existence, I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"One of the hardest things to do - as a writer - is to keep things succinct. It is so amazing that the group of writers who had 'a haiku year' all manage to beautifully express moments of their lives in a few lines.Though the poems vary in perspective and subject, they convey equally strong emotions. This book is enough to make you want to gather your own circle. And it's small size makes it easy to bring with you wherever you may travel - whenever you are in need of 18 words of affirmation, frustration or love. It's one of the few books I make sure is near my desk at all times."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"The Haiku Year was all that I anticipated and much more! The haiku were really inspirational and enlightening...I found myself looking at the things surrounding me in completely different ways from day to day. And for all you R.E.M. fans out there who stumbled across this book for one reason and one reason only...it is much much more than that. (Trust me, I did the same thing.)"},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"When did you last have a very strong feeling of the present moment, and a simultaneous, visceral understanding of how that moment fits into the context of life? Writing or reading Haiku poetry has a way of stimulating that feeling. The form is so condensed that it can feel sharp and sudden, like the sound of a balloon popping. This little book is a wonderful introduction to Haiku and also inspires the reader to experience the powerful effect of creating Haiku; after all, the folks who wrote the Haiku's collected here are ordinary Joe's like you or me who all decided to just start writing one Haiku each day.The Haiku Year is much more than a delightful collection of interesting poems. It's also a very interesting window into the lives of seven friends. It's a bit like seven personal photo albums all mixed together, which gives it an enticing, voyeuristic feel for the reader. It's also a bit like a puzzle; did the person who wrote the Haiku about the cold pain of an ending relationship also write the one about the exhiliration of new love found?I highly recommend this book as a gift to yourself. Do you know someone who would be very surprised to receive from you a fresh, red rose? Give them this book instead (or along with)."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"Not many people would argue that Japanese Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism aren't valid or relevant religions. They may not be much like the \\"original\\" forms of Buddhism but they are Buddhism and they have much to say (to say the least.) They are just also \\"japanese\\" and \\"tibetan\\" and unavoidably have a context.I am a white American leftist yankee writing haiku, not some Japanese guy from a hundred years ago living on Mount Fuji. The syllable thing is bs anyway, since English syllables do not correspond in length to Japanese syllables.Haiku Year authors never claimed to be Basho or William Higginson for that matter. If you read the Haiku Year you will see that its main purpose is to show a year of friendship and observation (with all its warts) and hopefully inspire other folks to write as well. Its is not a guide to writing haiku or held up as the pinnacle of haiku writing.Muddy Waters is so much better than the Rolling Stones, but\\"Dead Flowers\\" , \\"Monkey Man\\", and most of the Stones stuff rocks on its own merits. It also just might lead you back to Muddy Waters."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"A friend recommended this book, and while I found the book itself fairly interesting by far the best part has been the haiku circle we have created. We do it via email, and try to send a haiku every day to the mailing list. There are about 8 of us who do it regularly, another 4 or so who occasionally participate. It is by no stretch classic haiku, but taking a moment from our day to polish into a limited semi-formal pattern (we try to stick to 5-7-5, but not always, and no other rules - it's haiku if you say it is). We've just completed our first year, and it is very satisfying not only to receive, but also to take that daily meditation to focus on one moment, image, or thought, and try to shine it up to a sharable form."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"If you wish to see the best of contemporary English haiku this is not the book for you. However, it does have an appropriate place in the library. First, the haiku provide interesting insights into the lives of the authors. In keeping to the concreteness of the form, one see the authors' experiences more directly. They write more of what happened rather than what they think about the experience in retrospect. Second, the volume provides an example of an interesting approach to a personal journal - an approach than gains values over time rather than becoming the musings of someone you know longer feel you are. So in a strange way, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"sometimes i think of my father as an aging hippie- a rusty van plastered with bumper stickers, a very liberal viewpoint, and long hair.the haiku year doesn't conform to haiku norms, but it isn't about aging hippies. it's a simple approach to the lives they lead.i have much respect for my dad, and this book is everything about him and and his friends that i love."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"This is one of the most inspiring books I have ever purchased.

The haiku in the book bring laughter and tears, warmth and sarcasm and mostly each of the friends closer to each other.

The intension of THE HAIKU YEAR was to express and inspire. It does this and more. It is not &quot;classic&quot; haiku, it is free. Genius needs no critic. Hortensia... you just dont get it because you have a structured, steeltrap for a mind."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"I discovered this book years ago while randomly flipping through poetry books at a bookstore. I bought it because after reading the authors introduction I felt like I needed to. They wrote a \\"haiku\\" a day to eachother for a year, they admitted that sometimes they forgot, and that their work was not based on the traditional stlye that we are all forced to learn in grade school. The very short, and rather brilliant poetry of Jack Kerouac was their influence. So in actuality the poems in the book are what Kerouac would have called \\"pops\\", and therefore have no syllable pattern, seasonal reference is not required and it would make Basho cry. If you are looking for traditional haiku, this is probably a book to skip.Now, I enjoy traditional haiku as much as anyone. I also have alot of respect for contemporary writers who can adhere to those standards that I, and perhaps many others, cannot. It is not to say that because of this the style should be abandoned, but niether should this idea of a Western form. The poems in this book give that form an excellent start, they embody many feelings and do indeed make the reader look at their life in a new way. I have read it several times over and shared it with friends who agree it has that effect.I love this book because it is modern, involves daily life, and inspires me. I have been undertaking the Haiku Challenge for about five years now with mixed success, but it has made my everyday life all the richer."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"Solid white page broken / by three lines text: Haiku burns / off layers of delusion"},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a &quot;season word&quot; and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson."},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is.

It might be good for advanced classes in &quot;don't let this happen to you!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Haiku Year","review":"This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these \\"poets\\" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho.

However I was not disappointed by its content. This book contains articles written by the legendary trader Richard Wyckoff for his Magazine of Wall Street from interviews with Jesse Livermore. Written around 1921 it a treasure because of the knowledge presented by these two legends. This book covers all the most important principles of successful stock trading quickly and clearly:1. Only trade the strongest stocks in the strongest industries.2. Stocks have seasons and know which ones are currently in fashion.3. Anticipate future trends.4. Get plenty of sleep.5. Have a full understanding of the current economic situation.6. Stay away from other people and influences to keep your mind clear.7. The big money is in the long swings.8.

Installment No. 6 of the story is partially available and free on Google Books. Richard D. Wycoff, author of the contents of this book, was the editor and publisher of that fascinating magazine.Wycoff's interviews with Jesse L. Livermore, as described in this book, are the most comprehensive analysis of Livermore's trading methods that I have seen. They reveal that the aspects of Livermore's trading described in Edwin LeFevre's \\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" and Livermore's own \\"How to Trade in Stocks\\" only partially reveal his approach. The former is a lively story of his development as a trader filled with trading wisdom. The latter reveals his technical method and trading rules. This book, in contrast, shows a stock operator (a synonym for professional trader) who pays attention to economics, business conditions, company fundamentals, market psychology, personal health and fitness and his own weaknesses.There are quite a few direct quotes from Livermore's own lips. For example, he says \\"There is no magic. Investigate before you invest; look before you leap; stick to the fundamentals and disregard everything else.\\" Wycoff emphasizes how Livermore is a master skeptic when it comes to news and tips. \\"Headlines are for the public\\" he says. \\"The real news is buried in the back pages.\\" He is \\"a keen student of human nature\\" and, Wycoff says in astonishment, \\"he has even taken a course in psychology.\\"Wycoff spent time in Livermore's unmarked private offices on Wall Street. He describes how Livermore has a \\"stand-up office\\" where the ticker tape machines are on tall pedestals, the phones are high, and a huge chalkboard fills the wall, all of which enable Livermore to spend all day on his feet. The detailed descriptions of place and conversations and Livermore's revelations lend credibility that Wycoff's writings are the real deal, not the imagination of a journalist jinning up a story.That leads to the most surprising and important revelation in this book. Wycoff says, \\"If the methods of Jesse Livermore were to be told in two words, they would be these: He anticipates.\\" This comment is worth a book of its own. In the chapter entitled \\"How Livermore Reads the Tape\\" Wycoff lists 33 indicators, both technical and subjective, Livermore uses to connect the dots that reveal the state of the trend for a stock, group and the market as a whole. Those indicators gave Livermore a feeling for the market that enabled him to interpret the \\"pivotal points\\" that he describes in \\"How to Trade in Stocks. Pivotal points are turning points where trends reverse. Livermore would wait for weeks or even months for the right \\"psychological moment\\" to enter a trade, then quickly pyramid on success or exit if wrong. He used both price and time stops to keep his capital working and to always have dry powder for the next opportunity.The print in this book is tiny - perhaps 8 point type - and the line spacing is tight, making it a bit hard to read. There is a tremendous amount of information packed into those 32 pages. My handwritten notes span 24 pages of their own.I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about trading.

The residences range from a luxurious junk owned by a Persian marble dealer, to an art-deco-style house owned by a former model and her husband. Though I never saw a picture of the owners, I developed a clearer, more vivid idea of who they are in my head. I learned about Kai-Yin Lo, and her fabulous collection of Ming Dynasty furniture, and David Tang's love of gardens, and classical piano. I also promised myself that someday I would go to Hong Kong and see this beautiful city.Sophie Benge has done a great job with the text and Fritz Von Der Schulenburg's photographs are beautiful.

We bucked 70 pound bales of hay in the blazing sun when we were 15, camped out alone way before then, traveled by ourselves out of the U.S. by the time we were 16 (and, by the way, paid for such trips by holding down 2 jobs and staying on the high honor role).

Either you love this book or hate it, I guess. I'm one of the few that fall in the middle.This book is honest, no doubt. The author puts herself out there revealing way more internal monologue and passing more judgments than many folks would feel comfortable with. I definitely agreed with some of her core philosophies, especially in the need to relax and let your kids be kids, to make their own lives and mistakes, and the need for mothers not to \\"do it all\\". However, to me, the book reads more as a struggle to sort out her grief over her mother's sudden death than an attempt to parent well. It's a tough thing. Her nostalgia in light of that event, while I think it's genuine, makes the book seem off balance; like she views the past with rose colored glasses. Her attempts at humor fall flat because they are trying, ineffectually, like a bad make up job over a black eye, to cover the raw grief she is sorting through. I feel for her, but it makes the book hard to swallow on some levels.It is an interesting book, there is a lot of depth there, but take it out of the library rather than purchasing it. You probably won't need it for reference. It's a one time read."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I read the book and I've read the other reviews and frankly, the negative reviews are so totally off base that it's unbelievable. The book is about not taking things so seriously as a parent, not ignoring your children! Have fun with them and don't give them the mistaken impression that they are the center of the universe - the world just doesn't work like that! I have to admit - I am a soccer mom - but for slacker reasons. I get to spend time with my kids in the car, time in which there are no other distractions than a good laugh with my kids. I don't have to clean my house or cook dinner on soccer trips. When waiting for my kids to be done with practice, I get to read and do other things that I enjoy.Don't take this book too seriously or too literally. Have fun with it and apply as needed.I intend to give this book as a shower present for every new mom I know. It's not about how to parent, it's about how to do it with a good attitude that kids and parents can live with!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This book is not for the modern mom: the mom who plays with her children, looks for the best schools for them, tries to prevent them from injuring themselves, and actually takes photos of them. Muffy proudly denounces all of these practices.This book was annoying. Her \\"slacker\\" approach to parenting amounts to nothing more than being emotionally and physically distant from her children. She is not a huggy-snuggly-sentimental mommy. Her rational is that her mother parented her with a hands-off appoach and she turned out fine. However, the reason her parents were as such is because they worked on a cattle ranch 7 days a week! Why do I get the feeling that Little-Girl-Muffy didn't especially appreciate her parents working every single day, leaving her to play in the dirt with cattle hands as a small child? There are deeper wounds lying beneath the prose of this book. However, she refuses to acknowledge them and comes across as condesending to any of us parent differently from her or her mother (which, thankfully, is most of us). Her children are far to young, her parenting experience barely begun, for her to write a book as smug as this.If you are sensitive to the use of the English language, the numerous incomplete sentences that pepper this book will bother you."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"OH - I get it...slacker is tongue-in-cheek for \\"Oh Muffy, you're doing a GREAT job\\" UGH -- give me a break. I don't really know any moms who read parenting books. I guess the world is full of them and they are all judging me. hm - I say \\"Who cares?\\"...We all do the best we can. This borrowed (thank goodness) book infuriated me and I didn't crack a smile once. More of a biography of her family and home life. She didn't really talk about parenting all that much - just herself. I recommend Erma Bombeck (like others have said) or David Sedaris for a REAL humorous look at life."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I laughed out loud when reading this book more times than I could count as I remembered getting caught (and still sometimes do) up in much of the unnecessary hoopla that she talks about. Her points are valid; trust your instinct, moderation is a good thing, and common sense can go a long way. Yes she does take digs at things, but as long as you remember that they are her opinions and not personal attacks this makes for an enjoyable and at times enlightening read.You will NOT like this book if:1. You want an instruction manual on parenting2. You get defensive if someone expresses an opinion that clashes with your own beliefs3. You can't laugh at yourself (she will undoubtedly disagree with you on at least a couple of areas)"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Played as a humorous book on parenting in the press reviews I read, I was disappointed that \\"Slacker\\" lacks any traditional humor. It is a cynical look at everything that is wrong with parenting guideance and marketing aimed at parents today. Her attitude seems to be that children should only get the bare minimum in terms of attention, praise, and support.Some of her points are valid, such as the alternatives to giving into every toy whim in \\"Toys Aren't Us\\", but I found it most hypocritical for someone raising her children via a nanny to be giving advice on parenting. I am suprised with her don't-child-proof-life attitude that she did not just leave them home alone to fend for themselves!For real humor regarding parenting, borrow your mom's old copies of Erma Bombeck's works!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"You should know before reading Muffy Mead-Ferro's short book that she has a nanny for her two children. That small nugget was tucked into the last chapter of this meandering lazy attempt at countering anything and everything in parenting help books. It's difficult to take a writer seriously when they don't put all of their credentials relating to the topic up front. If someone is going to espouse the idea that being a lazy mom is okay, you should note that you can afford to act this way since you are lucky enough to have hired help. Besides, if your children don't turn out perfect, you'll always have someone else to blame.The idea of the book is that Muffy doesn't want to buy loads of educational toys, put headphones on her abdomen during pregnancy, get warmers for the wet wipes, etc. All the things that many modern (Yuppie) parents are lead to believe are necessary to get their children into the best pre-schools, high schools, and universities. It's a great idea (a lot of this needs to be said), but the author really falls flat when expanding on these ideas. Her rationale for not wanting to do all these things is that her parents didn't and she turned out okay. Fine, but we all know that. Most parents didn't read How-To guides and yet their children still managed to survive and thrive. Mead-Ferro's lack of explication is irritating (as is her literary eye-rolling when talking about other parents) and results in repetitive and obvious &quot;revelations.&quot; The book is a wonderful idea but poorly executed and almost completely devoid of any innovative or interesting ideas. The lack of depth leaves only enough material for a light magazine article. A real shame."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I agree with much the author has to say here---we DO get our kids too many toys, it WON'T kill them to have working parents or to not always be the center of our attention. However, the tone here is just plain grating! The author seems to feel that no-one in the world outside her extended family has ever really gotten parenting right---everyone else in the world is a hovering, overinvolved child-centered fool. I really did search for a reference to other people she might feel have done an okay job---in vain. One can't help but being a bit catty and saying to oneself \\"her kids are pretty darn young, I would really rather take advice from someone with just a TAD more experience and older kids, as it's pretty easy to put the rules in place that she has with the 6 and under crowd\\" I also thought about how despite her often talking about her childhood on the ranch, she mentions sort of in passing how various members of her family became State Governer, and others were lawyers. I wonder if she would feel the same about not giving her kids too much if she had grown up truly not having enough---not enough food, no toys because none could be afforded...etc.But all this is mainly fueled by my annoyed feelings at the \\"better than you\\" tone of this book. I think the author has valid points, and I am sure she's a good mother. I just think she should have waited just a little longer into her parenting career to write this, and perhaps acknoledged that others in the world may have had the same ideas she did!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"The author of this book is certainly not a \\"slacker\\" in the sense of \\"lazy\\". \\"Slack-er\\" as in \`less slack', or more laid-back, maybe, but certainly NOT a slacker - she's an working mother of two (albeit, with outside help), so it's extremely unlikely \`lazy' is even in her dictionary.So what's this book about? A quick summary:1.Don't spend money on un-necessary stuff, e.g. too many toys.2.Why it's not a good idea to spoil your kids3.Why it's not a good idea to over-protect your kids4.Teach your kids to think for themselves5.It's Ok to get mad as long as you express it correctly6.Why it's important to have a life of your own7.Listen to your instincts - kids were being brought up perfectly well, even before all the parenting books (and sites) came to beAll-in-all sensible advice, but not necessarily all that easy to apply, so if you're looking for a quick-fix solution, this is not the book for you.If, however, you're looking for a book that will make you feel more comfortable about parenting your way (as opposed to some author's way) this may well be the one for you."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this book. The blurbs and such suggested that it was a lighthearted jab at the attitude that there are umpteen million \\"requirements\\" for new parents and the narrow-minded, self-congratulatory self-righteousness that sometimes accompanies that attitude. (\\"You mean you didn't childproof your entrance hall?\\" \\"Our baby was signing 'I love opera' by 10 months!\\")Oh my, was I in for a surprise. The author clearly disdains the current high-requirements parenting attitude, but all she's doing is replacing it with her own parenting attitude -- the self-righteousness remains there full force.Examples:- Not only is supporting your children's activities (say, cheering them on at the soccer game) not necessary -- it's actually *bad* for them, because it encourages them to achieve to win your approval instead of for themselves.- Childproofing your home and aiming to protect your children from injury? Again, not just unnecessary but *detrimental* -- how else will your children learn to avoid danger if they don't get roughed up a bit?Really, the author's entire point seems to be \\"Here is how I was raised, and it's clearly superior.\\" (She was raised on a ranch, which she mentions approximately umpteen gazillion times.) In other words, it's the same old parenting-advice guilt trip in slightly different packaging. Late in the book, she tosses out some cliche about parents \\"listening to their own instinct\\" or some such, but that's balderdash -- make no mistake that the instinct she wants you to listen to is *hers*.I don't know where she gets the \\"slacker mom\\" business. She does emphasize prioritizing yourself, including making mothering easier and less time-consuming (and not following this is -- surprise! -- *bad* for your children). But she's not advocating \\"slacking\\" as a concept. Indeed, she goes out of her way to emphasize what a non-slacker she is overall -- if I had a dollar for every time she gushes about what a dynamo she is professionally, I might have gotten back the money I wasted on the book in the first place. She is advocating a particular parenting strategy which happens to include low parental involvement compared to other strategies, but which is lauded as a superior strategy based on results in children, not ease for parents.I have two young children, and I think that we are all disserved by parenting \\"advice\\" that is smug, superior and narrow-minded. Perhaps people who share the authors views will enjoy the book --as she pats herself on the back, she will be patting her likeminded peers as well. And it does make the rather obvious point that the current culture of hysterical consumerist baby-focus is absurd.Beyond that, this book is a total waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I found her annecdotes thorougly entertaining, and often laughed out loud.It should be clearly understood that this is not a &quot;how to&quot; parenting book, and should never be mistaken for one. Instead, it is one woman's account of trying to navigate through the incredibly tricky maze of parenting. Fortunately for us, she she presents her take on the whole thing through a wonderful sense of humor. If you can't laugh at yourself as a parent, perhaps this isn't a book for you.I congratulate Muffy Mead-Ferro's courage to question some of today's &quot;modern wisdom&quot; about raising children and instead, listen to her gut about what's right for her children. And I commend her ability to &quot;confess&quot; about it!I agreed with her about some things in the book and disagreed about others, but that's what makes this book so fun to read. We all have our own styles of parenting and should trust our instincts enough to follow them. Although I consider myself a slightly more experienced mother (I have kids ranging in age from 15 to 4), I gleaned some wonderful nuggets of wisdom from her childhood days on a Wyoming Ranch. These were some of my favorite parts.I have recommended this book to many friends, and have purchased it for several gifts. It's a great read for parents of all ages."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I live in the Suburban Capital of the World and have, at most recent count, 7 hyper-competitive moms on my block. The decision to have a baby honestly hinged on whether or not I could be a parent and not succumb to the frightening way that parents handle parenthood in my area...it's all about coddling the kids and sacrificing their marriages, livelihood and FICO score {{for the children}}. Please! I loved the &quot;slacker mom&quot; ideal and it took me back to my own childhood when children were raised and loved but not spoiled, overindulged and given an unearned sense of entitlement! I sent my copy to my best friend in Virginia who is also a &quot;slacker mom&quot;! She'll LOVE it and be proud to know she's not screwing up her kid by not revolving her life around it!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I will admit one thing right now, I am glad that I didn't read the spotlight reviewers or any other reviewers before I bought this book or even before I read it. I guess the author has touched some sore spots with this little book.As for me, I found this book refreshing. It is honest. I didn't find it bitter or anything. I laughed out loud in places where I even recognize myself and while I don't agree with every single thing this woman said, I enjoyed her perspectives and thoughts. As a mom of twin preschoolers, I have been known to buy excessive amount of toys till in a fit of frustration, give a good part of it away. I am known to scrapbook ~~ which I love to do and count myself fortunate to be able to do that. I still laugh though over Mead-Ferro's description of her first scrapping party (which I have never attended either ~~ I prefer to do those things solo). Sure I am a stay-at-home mom ~~ but I didn't find this book insulting at all.I find it delightful, thoughtful and with good points. So what if she has a nanny? She mentioned that she grew up on a ranch in Wyoming and the stable hands were her nannies. She was just stressing the point what works for her works for her and she is not alarmed to have someone else watch her kids. In fact, she did mention that she's a happier person because she's not trapped at home and feeling guilty ~~ she's enjoying her job and providing a good role model for her children in seeing that work is not bad.She wasn't warped by the fact that her parents worked hard all day and expected the same of her and her brothers. She wasn't warped because of her lack of toys. She didn't lose out educationally because she didn't have all those educational toys (which after seeing how MY two just dump them in the toy box ... she has good points regarding that. Think it's odd that her daughter played for hours with an empty paper towel roll ~~ my two play with my pots and pans, and play choo choo trains with kitchen chairs and yes, with an empty paper towel roll). She was taught responsibility, discipline and work ethics. Was she bored as a kid? Yes. Is boredom a bad thing? No.I think she was just responding to all these parenting books, magazines, videos that are out there and stating the obvious: just thirty plus years ago, parents didn't have all these advantages and people still turned out fine. That doesn't mean that we should ignore our kids ~~ but it's ok once in awhile not to give in to their demands or expectations. It's ok to be the parent of the relationship. It's ok to have your own life as well. It's ok to stop stressing over every little detail of your child's life. And it's ok to have fun. And starting with this little gem of a book ~~ it's ok to do all these things (within reason, of course) and maybe enjoy your children's lives before they grow up. They grow up too fast anyways.10-31-06"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Parenting has got to be the ultimate sacred cow, so I applaud Muffy Mead-Ferro for her willingness to poke fun at the extremes we parents sometimes go to, her ability to laugh at herself, and her belief in her kids, and all kids, to figure at least some things out for themselves -- even if that means a &quot;lesser&quot; role for the parents.I think the title &quot;Slacker Mom&quot; however is totally tongue-in-cheek because it actually takes more effort for a parent who loves their kids to back off than to smother.It is odd that some reviewers found it disingenuous for Mead-Ferro to caution parents about the effectiveness of marketing, since she has had a career in marketing. I felt just the opposite, that she is someone who knows what she's talking about because she's been there. She knows what lengths advertisers will go to and this is the reason she suggests that we parents should take their messages about all the stuff we're supposed to buy for our kids with a grain of salt.Of course there is a contingent who will never think that it's okay for a mom to have a job or a career -- a situation which will almost always necessitate some type of child care arrangement. But in our day and age that is not only unrealistic but a disservice to women, and one reason this book is a welcome relief is that it reminds us working moms that we don't need to feel guilty about it -- it's absolutely possible to be a great parent (and a great example) to your kids, even though you have a career.The ideas of this book are important ones, although they are presented in a humorous (and often self-deprecating) way. I hope they catch on."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"My quarrel with this book is not that Ms. Mead-Ferro has a full-time nanny or a full-time job. And I agree with her philosophy of slacker parenting. My main complaint about \\"Confessions of a Slacker Mom\\" is that it is so boring. Clearly, the intent was a book infused with humor, but the funny parts fall flat because they've already been done to death. Gee, no one else has ever written a parenting book with references to \\"prenatal lunacy.\\" To write about a pregnant woman who is also capable of rational thought--now that would be fresh and original.Much of the book consists of the author's reminiscences about her childhood or the lives of her grandparents on their cattle ranch. These did not hold my interest. It's too bad, because some people are able to write their memoirs and make them charming and interesting to the reader, but Mead-Ferro fails in this respect. Nearly every sentence begins with the word \\"I\\" and I found myself skimming large sections because they were so tedious.The rest of the book consists of the author slyly patting herself on the back because her slacker ways will result in children who are well-mannered, interesting and resourceful. She's probably right there, but many other parents know this too and don't feel compelled to write a book about it.If you want to read a few interesting sentences about the value of slacker parenting, buried in an avalanche of personal memories I recommend that you find this book at the library and save your money for something else."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Guess what, moms aren't the only ones who try too hard to be superparents and try too hard to turn their kids into superkids -- practically deifying them in the process. Dads do it too and I for one have jumped off the merry go round. I have a 3-year old daughter and I would much rather spend some quality time having a tea party with her, or playing with play-dough, or drawing pictures, than driving her all over town to participate in competitive sports, do activities at museums and basically try to show how much smarter and better she is than the other kids. It's incredible to me but in this day and age that seems to make me a slacker dad. Well, so be it. I think kids need love more than they need flash cards. Competition among parents is running rampant these days but I don't think in the end it is doing our kids much good. I am glad there are finally some new books out there (Mead-Ferro's is one but also check out The 3-Martini Playdate and How Not to Totally Suck as a Parent) that are calling foul! Books like these will make some people mad because they won't like the idea that anyone would ever say it's okay to do less when it comes to raising your kids, especially if it might actually save the parent some time and money that could be used for better things, but I say let them go ahead and have their own rat race while the rest of us get back to some semblance of normalcy, giving both ourselves and our kids a break as we &quot;slack off &quot;. Personally I think the Supermom and Superdad era is coming to an end and that most people realize we've gone too far and it's time for the pendulum to swing back the other way. Our kids will find out that holy cow, they're not the only person on the planet, but they'll benefit from that and so will the rest of our society."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This book is perfect for every uptight or intense parent. It's easy-going narative uses humor to bring some sense to the crazy world of raising children today. I laughed so hard that my kids wanted an explanation...but only a parent would understand the humor of this book. It was even funnier read aloud with my spouse - who enjoyed it as much as I did. A quick read - and I'm sure I'll read it again."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Mead-Ferro's book is a slight but highly witty and enjoyable tour of one Mom's battle to stay sane amid the domestic chaos. A clever, sarcastic tone makes it different than all the typical chick-lit Mommy books. My favorite in the genre is still by a man, though--Bruce Stockler's \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" a really hilarious and one-of-a-kind read."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I loved &quot;Confessions of a Slacker Mom&quot; and read it in one sitting. The author's no-nonsense approach to motherhood really appealed to me and I especially loved the chapter entitled, &quot;Toys Aren't Us.&quot; I, too, grew up in Wyoming and as a child I played with sticks and built forts for entertainment. So the first time I walked into Babies R Us, I felt completely overwhelmed by everything I was &quot;supposed&quot; to buy. After reading this book, I know that I am not the only mom that has not purchased a silly wipe warmer. I consider myself a high maintainence person and not so much a slacker mom but very much appreciated Mead-Ferro's advice about listening to my inner voice."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I was so carried away with this book it took two hours out of my wiping noses, diapering, cooking, cleaning, reading, tooth-brushing, maddeningly mundane and extraordinarily joyful life of raising three young childen. Time that I didn't think I had to spare.I loved every minute of this book not only for it's refreshingly honest and common sense approach to child rearing and it's wry and delightfully tongue-in-cheek humor(I laughed out loud enough to irritate everyone), but for Mead-Ferro's ability to expose and let go of the ridiculous &quot;have to's&quot; of the hyper-mom and embrace the truely tender moments of &quot;real&quot; common sense parenting. I heartily agreed with Mead-Ferro that letting your children learn their own lessons and actually believing that they are smart enough to &quot;get it&quot; does not constitute child abuse or even disregard. It is actually the best gift you can give your children--your confidence and belief in them that they can and MAY make their own decisions and that they won't be automatically saved from their good or poor decisions. Gratefully and refreshingly this is NOT another (yet another) how-to (and if you don't how-dare-you) book about being the best mother you can be. It is a book celebrating all the different kinds of mothers (we're all slackers on some level- face it)and specifically the delightful mother that Mead-Ferro is &quot;confessing&quot; to be. Far from being a book that shows ambivalence for being a mother, this book elevates mothers to thinking, creative,and instructive forces in their childrens' lives who are entirely capable of deciding for themselves whether to listen to classical music, buy educational toys, warm their wet wipes or NOT! And mothers who have lives of their own that ther children will see and learn from more than some contrived activity scientifically designed to boost self-esteem. This book relieved me of the pressure of future recriminations by my children (sadly undocumented in elaborate and meticulous detail in commercially and psycologically approved scrapbooks) by convincing me that the children of slacker moms will feel empowered not neglected by the lack of a few insignificant doodles and ticket stubs in a perfect scrapbook. They can make their own!Content aside, the book has a strong and engaging voice that carries you through this quick read like you are listening to an old friend--(one who is really smart and funny).Another part of the book I found to be particularly engaging was the memories of Mead-Ferro's childhood on a Wyoming ranch and her poigniant and loving homage to her own wonderfully unconventional mother and grandmother. I wanted to hear more!I'd like to hear more in general from this author! It was the most refreshing two hours I've spent since the time I burned Penelope Whats-Her-Name's book in a desperate attempt to regain my self respect as a capable human being, and drank a mega-big artificially-flavoured grape shave ice I happened to be craving in one of my pregnancies (I'll have to check my scrapbooks to see which one--oh whoops!)."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"There wasn't one page of this book that didn't make me sigh in relief! I thought I was the only slacker mom til Muffy's words convinced me otherwise. I have found a real soul mate in this author and a friend in this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I thought this book was fun and funny and made some good points that parents today need to hear. I know there are some parents who will never think it's okay to go anywhere less than overboard when it comes to their children but kids would benefit more if parents gave them a little more freedom and showed a little more faith in their ability to do things for themselves. What we're trying to produce as parents is self-sufficient and resilient human beings and we won't achieve that by doing everything for our children and always protecting them from everything in the world around them. I really enjoyed the stories from the author's childhood on a farm because I think most of us were raised by parents who were a lot less hyper about it than parents today, even if we were in the cities and suburbs. I would definitely recommend this book to other parents!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"When I first found out I was pregnant, one of my best friends sent me all the books she had read when she was pregnant with her first. Of all that she sent--and many were good--this one has helped me to keep my sanity. I'm due in 3 weeks and anytime I start to panic about silly things like having the right \\"stuff,\\" I think about this book and relax. The baby-sleeping-in-a-crab-cage story has been the best at getting to take everything a little less seriously and to enjoy this process a bit more.Yes, the author has some benefits that others don't. Certainly, she makes more than I do, but it's nice to know that it doesn't have to be all-consuming and that a person can be a good mom even if she doesn't cease to exist except to carpool children around and be a toy-buyer/picker-upper. I know that sounds like common sense, but sometimes the other books, articles (and posts), friends, family members, and strangers can lay a lot of guilt at a mother's feet.And for the record, the scrap-booking section is a hoot. My mother scrapbooks like a fiend and each book is really a work of art, so I don't have any problem with others doing it. What is funny is the author's reaction to the scrap-booking party itself. I have a good friend who is a college instructor, and I remember her coming to me at the beginning of a semester saying, \\"About ten of my students have posted scrap-booking as a hobby,\\" (she teaches online courses)\\"and I don't even understand what that means.\\" I explained and she said, \\"And that's a hobby? Lots of people do that? I don't get it.\\" So the author's behavior made me think of that. I didn't think my friend was condemning all scrap-bookers. It just wasn't an activity that she understood."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I thought this would be a collection of humorous, self-deprecating essays on what it's like to be a Type B personality in a Type A world. Instead, Mead-Ferro manages to alienate just about everyone (with the exception of her four-person family) in the first couple of chapters.As a humor writer, I learned early on that humor at the expense of self is funny; humor at the expense of others is mean-spirited. Mead-Ferro has no qualms about using just about everyone around her as fodder for her holier-than-thou pen. Got more toys than can fit in a small 2-by-2 box? You're materialistic and setting your child up for a lifetime of unhappiness as she seeks meaning from the store shelves. You scrapbook? You're destined to create an egomaniacal child who views himself as the center of the universe (what child doesn't?).If you were raised on a sprawling cattle ranch, as the author was, you might enjoy this book. Otherwise, walk right by it in the bookstore and head for Anne Lamott's \\"Operating Instructions\\" or even an old Erma Bombeck. They're better-written, and they won't leave you feeling inadequate and rotten."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"No I have not gotten this book I bought a 200$ kindle and yet the kindle price is almost 5$ more than the paper back...

My sister has read it at least as much, as well as my mom. When my sister-in-law became pregnant and started worrying about being a good mom and buying the right stuff, I told her to chill out and embrace her inner Slacker Mom.

If you want a book to make you feel better and a little less guilty about all of the things you should be doing but aren't, this book falls flat. I found some light humor in it but only because I didn't stop and think too much. I was expecting something different from the word \\"slacker\\". I was thinking about how I have to step over and around all of the toys, dirty clothes, and general stuff in my house any day except for the days I spend cleaning and screaming \\"don't just leave that there!\\" I don't really think that not showing up to watch my daughter's riding lesson is being a slacker, I think that it is showing her how much I don't give a crap about what she is doing. I also don't think slacker means watching while one of my children get hurt. I have another word for that and it is too harsh for this thread. I am a firm believer in showing your children how to treat others. With that in mind, I don't want to be in some nursing home in 40 years while my kids don't ever come to visit because they don't want to let me think I am the center of the universe."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I was expecting something different too but I don't think the book ever proclaimed to be a how to book. The title does say confessions. There is a lot of family history in this book. I enjoyed the stories especially since I received this as a mother's day gift for my first mother's day. I learned that I don't have to drag a ton of toys around with us when we travel with the baby and I think the most important think I learned from this book was how to \\"make do\\" as a mother. If you like storytelling you'll enjoy this book. Maybe it could be inspiration for other writers to put down their stories of what they learned from their mothers and family history."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"First off, this Muffy Mead-Ferro person (I hesitate to call her a writer) needs to get hip with what the word \\"slacker\\" actually means. Muffy is NOT a slacker mom. She never was a \\"slacker\\". I bet she isn't even aware of the modern definition of \\"slacker\\" - you know the pop culture one. What is our gal Muffy then? She's someone who grew up on a farm in Wyoming (or somewhere like it, I forget already - but it was obviously a Red State) and basically just tells everyone off for buying their kids a bunch of toys because back on the farm...I hated every single time this woman tried to relate being a slacker to working full time in advertising. I'm sorry, I worked in advertising and considering it's a high-pressure deadline oriented field, I can't really see the comparison. Come to think of it, relating slackerhood to life on the farm....not exactly a direct line either. Was she trying to be funny? Oh wait, I read this book cover to cover and found little actually funny. Her attempts at wit were just trite and sanctimonious bitching and moaning about other moms. (Perhaps the definition of \\"wit\\" got confused like the definition of \\"slacker\\").She's basically just a cranky woman who sounds bitter that back in her day parents weren't overachievers in parenting and that even if they were, her folks still would have been cold and standoffish farm people. Making up excuses why she won't be able to all her kids' soccer games in the future because it will help them build character is really sad. There is a happy medium between not giving a crap and being an annoying overcompensating child-spoiler, and Muffy didn't mention that. Thankfully there are actual funny parenting books out there that do and actually are witty (try any of Vicki Iovine's).I was given this books and I feel ripped off. I don't know whom I feel more sorry for people who paid for this book or Muffy's kids who will probably need a lot of therapy eventually.Don't be fooled by the cover. It's not all slick and modern parenting. It's dull \\"back in my day\\" lectures you can get for free from your Grandma. (Though not my grandma because she actually is funny and will admit that there are a lot of advances in parenting and perks of priviledge that won't ruin your kids)."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I wonder what Muffy would have done with a child who does NOT learn from mistakes, but taught himself to read at the age of three. She rightly encourages moms to use their own brains in child rearing, but she should not denigrate other people's choices if she does not understand them. She writes with a sense of humor that would be funnier if she were wiser."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I picked this book up recently thinking that it would be a humorous look at parenting. It promised to \\"validate\\" me as a parent. Well, the author was condescending, judgemental, and not funny. I felt angry the whole way through the book because I am the parent who spoils her children a little too much, tries to protect her children from physical harm, and has,in many ways, made her children the center of her world. I am educated (doctorate in educational/school psychology) and I have a wonderful husband who is a great father. I love my life and I have 2 great kids in spite of the fact that I am the parent who is insulted the entire way through this book. Apparently \\"slacker\\" now means \\"everything I do is going to create children who are much better adjusted and functional in the world than your children.\\" Funny that this book refers to \\"horses\\" all the way through because I really think that the author needs to get off her high one."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I kept reading to see if it got any better.

What ever happened to raising your kids to the best of your ability because you WANT to, not because someone pressures you to?"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This is a total lack of respect for parenthood. The only reason I give it a two-star rating is because I love the design of the book; it's really &quot;chicky.&quot; The message is to &quot;let the kids do whatever they want as long as they entertain themselves and I don't have to do anything. If they get hurt, they'll get over it and hopefully learn a lesson.&quot; Total nonsense! It's amazing to me that any publisher anywhere would actually publish a book like this with their real name on it. I do agree that kids have too much today and we should cut out some of the activities and hyper parenting...but Muffy (what a name) is off the wall and the one thing we don't need in today's society is &quot;slacking off of parenthood.&quot; She has a few good basic ideas and then all of a sudden she changes them to be all about her and what her mom did with her and her brother to make them more responsibile. It just reads weird and the message is totally lost. There's much better books out there on getting your life organized so things will run smoother and cutting out too many activities for kids helping them get a simpler life. This is what Muffy needs: organization and a new outlook on life. Try the Happiest Toddler on the Block and Mommy CEO for getting it right and getting kids wanting to take on &quot;their&quot; roles with zest. My kids have certain things (chores) to do and we have cut out many activities and then I am more of a slacker mom...but unlike Muffy's kind of laziness, I am way into parenting and family time."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"On the whole, I tend to embrace the ideology of a Slacker Wife more than a Slacker Mom, but that could be because Muffy Mead-Ferro probably refined her writing style and grew as a wife, mother, and author in the year between the two books. (I gave CONFESSIONS OF A SLACKER WIFE 5 Stars--LOVED it!)CONFESSIONS OF A SLACKER MOM seems to dwell more in the homespun memoir narrative of Muffy's life growing up on a cattle ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Although there are certainly some laugh-out-loud thoughts and anecdotes in SLACKER MOM, for all practical purposes, parenting tips and philosophies based on the good old days on the ranch don't seem to apply as readily in modern-day reality--unfortunate, but true.Sherri Caldwell, co-author, The Rebel Housewife Rules: To Heck With Domestic Bliss!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I'm a slacker mom myself, so I thought this book would poke fun at moms who are hyper-parents as well as those who are slacker moms.

She is not afraid to express \\"her\\" opinions about raising children and to step on a few toes in the process. I am a mother of 6 children and am astounded on a daily basis by all the children who have little or no ability to deal with the consequences of their choices. I agree with her premise that children learn more by their experiences good and bad. She writes in a style that is easy to understand and interpret, especially for new parents. Raising children is an ongoing experience and this book helps people see that it is not a competition with your friends, family or neighbors but something that is truly unique to your own style of raising children. The social pressures to raise super kids is enormous - Muffy's idea of getting back to the basics is refreshing and allows parents to take a deep breath and not worry so much about being perfect parents or creating perfect children. I applaud Muffy for taking a stand and writing what you knows in her own heart works for her. Her writing style incorporates wit and humor and keeps you entertained as well as reflective. I recommend this book to any parent or soon-to-become parent as great reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Muffy Mead-Ferro's little gem of a book is long overdue! In this age of &quot;so serious&quot; parenting, a breath of humor and satire is most welcome. Good sense certainly is evident and highly recommended, but what spoke to me most was the love story she wove throughout the pages. Yes, a love story about her Mother and Grandparents. The way in which she opened bits of their lives to her readers was subtle and heartwarming.Back to the humor - I CANNOT wait until Belle and Joe reach their teens and Muffy treats us to her views on that delightful stage of parenting.Signed: A Grandmother &amp; therefore, a teenager parent survivor!!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This book provides a light-hearted look at a handful of \\"over-the-top\\" things some parents do, for what they believe is the good of their children. It is nothing new, it has been happening for generations, but with such a large middle class, in our current society, it has become more pronounced and visible.I enjoyed the book, though at times I found it repetitive. I have had personal experience with a number of the topics she discusses and both agreed and disagreed at times with her various perspectives. In general, though, I do agree with her concept of simplification and parental instinct; instinct really meaning, do what feels right and makes you, as a parent, happy, because happy parents result in happy children.

She's done far more than just share funny slacker moments so moms will feel less guilty, she's given us her perspective, drawn on her childhood on a cattle ranch in Wyoming, on how to raise self-reliant and confident children. She reminds us, in touching and funny ways, that character is not built with educational toys and toddler-gyms.

Definitely people who need to lighten up a bit. Defensive, are we? I thought this book was funny and refreshing. A quick little read, nothing to get all worked up about, anyway -- whether you agree with her or not. For example, I love scrapbooking. She makes fun of it. No need for me to whine about that, or fluff up defensively, she was being funny!If you simply don't think she is funny, I can understand that. We all have different tastes in humor. But I'm referring to those reviews that just reek of defensiveness...Who cares if she has a nanny? What does that have to do with anything? If I had a dollar for every mom that bristled at the mere mention of the word \\"nanny\\", well let's just say I'd be buying a beach house right about now. Why get all bent out of shape at how other parents manage things? Life is too short.If you want to make parenting hard, go ahead, knock yourself out.

I want to be a slacker mom, but society has made that difficult. Once I started reading, however, I was immediately annoyed and disappointed with my choice. The cover shows a woman in high heel pointy toe shoes relaxing on a couch. The book is about a woman who lives on a cattle ranch who shuns scrapbooking and children's toys. Puh-lease! Do yourself a favor. Buy another book."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It was a breath of fresh air in the age of overscheduled, over indulged children. \\"Slacker\\" is truly not a description for this woman. One of the most difficult things to do is to NOT give your children every material item if you have the ability to. Muffy explains how many times less is more. You get creative, active, responsible kids not spoiled, over-indulged ones."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"The Slacker Mom book was like a breath of fresh air in the life of a guilt driven try-not-to-be-slacker mom. The author asked and answered questions that I've always had about surviving my children, and having them survive me without damage. I think this book can give you a view of motherhood with the saving grace of a little distance and humor. Read it and laugh, then go enjoy your kids."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I loved her matter-of-fact approach to kid-rearing, and most of the book reflects this attitude... like, for instance, a new baby doesn't care what you put it in to sleep. This approach has stood me in good stead through an often-overwhelming deluge of baby-store paraphernalia.However, I was annoyed later on in the book by her defensive approach to the idea of moms (specifically herself) working outside of the home, and found this inconsistent with her general feelings of caring for her kids. She explains that children are enriched through exposure to a variety of caregivers... enriched, perhaps (if we are lucky enough to afford halfway-decent English-speaking, knowledgeable caregivers -- most of us aren't!), but perhaps traumatized also by the absence of the one person they thought had committed to care for them forever.Anyway, a good book, funny, touching and true in many ways, but the last section was definitely a turn-off for this reason."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I read about 80% of this book and found it to be pretty amusing, but it got old quickly. Sure it was funny, mean in some ways, but funny. But just like the books and articles, websites, and parenting advice columns she tries to put down, she is just another extremist shouting in the wind. I think that this book is a must for anyone that has more than one parenting book in their library, or is spending more time trying to get their 12 hour old infant into Harvard than focusing on spending time with them and enjoying it."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This woman didn't waste that much time hearing or seeing her kids at home, nor even her money. She had a NANNY. The nanny is her real secret, the one who will allows this mother to be a slacker one. Imaging being her kids's nanny, the parents don't waste any cent buying toys, no disposable diapers, save all the money and just pays the nanny to entertain the poor fellas, wash the cloth diapers, hears their crys,etc. This woman is the exact copy of Mrs. X (the nanny diaries), dispensing parenting tips. She never mentioned that her ranch mother had no nanny at all but she needs one. With the kids taken care of (by a surrogate mother), she can be free to earn her money giving ideas to parents on something that she is not doing."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I came to this book as a single mom looking to find some humor and relief in a book that would combine a bit of reality with the goals of good parenting. Instead, I found it to be rather condescending and dismissive of other parenting styles. There are certainly flashes of wit, but in truth the ideas could have easily been contained in a few paragraphs. I felt that my time was not well spent in reading this book. I knew about half way through that I didn't like it, but I kept going in a hope of finding the \\"good stuff\\". My hopes were not rewarded. The author has a nanny. That's not \\"slack\\", it's wealth. I couldn't even pass it on to my friends because I really didn't like it."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"There is a difference between being a &quot;slacker mom&quot; and being downright negligent. Her flimsy justifications for letting her children hurt themselves cross the line between the two. I kept waiting for the chapter where she lets her children find out the consequences of not wearing seatbelts by having her slam on the brakes while driving and letting them fly through the windshield. This book is un-funny in the extreme, and if I could give it zero stars I would gladly do so."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I agree with the basic premise of the book and I actually am pretty much a \\"slacker mom\\" as described in the book; don't over indulge kids, let them learn from their mistakes, etc. But...the author feels the need to paint caricatures of moms that do things a bit differntly and to put them down in order to justify her own high and mighty opinions. She accuses moms who do scrapbooking of creating \\"shrines\\" to their children. Makes her living in advertising but complains about the pressure to buy, buy buy. She writes as if parents who stay home, enroll their kids in a few classes, go to some of their kids games, etc are all idiots. One reviewer said this book has a hidden conservative agenda, a friend thought it was written by an extreme liberal -- call it what you want, it's just extremely bad. This book is not even funny. The worst book I've read in memory."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I can sum up everything quickly for you: Muffy doesn't believe in toys, preschool, scrapbooking, gymboree or any modern convenience for you and your baby. If you are a mom interested in reading parenting magazines, attending baby play groups or enjoy treating your child to the new Leapfrog toy - don't read this as she sucks the enjoyment out of you. This book will not teach you anything, nor will you have a good laugh. It's not a confessional, it's her explanation of why her way is right."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, expecting a humorous take on parents who overindulge their children - the kind of humour of &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; or the Shopaholic books. Instead, I found a conservative agenda masking as humour. Yes, there were some funny parts and Mead-Ferro makes some excellent points about not buying all the latest gadgets for children, that parents can parent with less paraphernalia and should let children figure things out for themselves (learn from their own mistakes). But a lot of it comes across as whiny justification for Mead-Ferro's &quot;pull yourself up by your bootstraps&quot;, no-nonsense attitude. And when she says it's okay to hit your children once in a while if you're really mad and want to get something through to them, well ... if anyone wrote a book saying it was okay to whack your wife once in a while to get her to listen, there'd be an uproar.Don't bother with this book. Spend the time hugging your children instead."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I read all the reviews before typing this and I was not really surprised by some of the negative ones. Hey, this is America in an election year, and you have to expect some victims of the \\"class warfare\\" propaganda swirling about us. (and *gasp* the horror of being called a conservative! whatever that was supposed to mean) Still, I don't see anywhere in this book that Muffy described neglecting her kids or not wanting to parent them, let alone NOT parenting them. Hiring a sitter and working isn't the same as not parenting your kids. Sounds like some of the negative reviewers aren't in their happy place as parents... (I live in an area where a half dozen kids is the norm and the kids are the only identity the moms have, so by heck they aren't going to stand by and read about a mom who sees herself as a real person aside from mommyhood. It gets quite vicious.) The most hilarious review was the one from the woman who has no kids. Whoa, honey, are you in for a reality check.That said, Muffy has written a witty book about teaching your kids to cope with life. She has a self deprecating tone tempered with a very loving approach to her own family, at all generational levels. Her parenting approach has absolutely nothing to do with privilege; her observations would hold true at any socioeconomic level. Lord knows I have been on a tight budget while parenting just the way she does, and it didn't matter whether I had the money to make other choices or not. The choices I have made with my kids were all based on what was best for them and their achievement of successful adulthood. I got criticized when I didn't pull my third grade son from the Mean Teacher's class; I told him to be nice to her, and that he might as well learn right now how to manage when under the control of difficult people. That taught him that I had total faith that he COULD cope. It was a \\"slacker mom\\" choice on my part, but it was \\"slacking\\" only in a joking sense. That is the thrust of this book.As a final note, in my opinion anyone who doesn't see the hilarity in the frantic act of competitive scrapbooking is wound too tight to appreciate the intelligence in Muffy's methods. (I don't think she makes fun of scrapbooking because her mom didn't meet Muffy's needs in that department! How bizarre is THAT theory? She obviously has plenty of great memories without a stinkin scrapbook. She jokes about it because the moms who are the biggest freaks about it actually neglect their kids to do it---I have first-hand knowledge on this one.)I loved this book and I am in the ranks of those who will \\"gift\\" it to new parents. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Finally!!! I am given written permission to let my kids be kids and me be an imperfect Mom and human being. I am the mother of two boys, three and six, and frankly watching them make their own mistakes, and letting them see me make mine, is what I think makes our family special. I live in a place where kids have day planners and birthday parties are budget breakers.Confessions of a Slacker Mom is not the typical parenting book. It is a refreshing insight into the thoughts and concerns of a mom just like me, who realizes money and &quot;stuff&quot; can't fix every problem or guarantee your success as a parent.My favorite memory of the book is &quot;if your kid doesn't have stitches by the age of seven, you are over protective&quot;.If you think you can bail your kids out of every problem and prevent every scratch and scrape (why would you want to?) then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I have never submitted a review to Amazon before, but after reading the few negative reviews to this book (which are the minority, thankfully) I feel compelled to do so. It is clear to me that the people who disliked this book simply did not get it. The term \\"Slacker\\" is clearly meant in a joking manner. The author does not condone child neglect, nor complete lassitude as a parent. She does, however, condone the conscientious \\"holding back\\" of a loving parent, in spite of the temptation to constantly meddle in your child's life, so that they may learn a thing or two for themselves. If I had to summarize the main message of this book, it would be that children whose free time is constantly supervised and dictated by an adult will grow into less imaginative, less resourceful, and whinier adults than those who actually got to forge their own way a bit. I strongly agree with the author on this point, and was relieved to have this belief validated by such an entertaining and wonderful book. It was a fun, laugh-out-loud, enlightening read that I plan on giving to every new Mom as a shower gift."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"This book made me LAUGH OUT LOUD, and generally helped relieve some of the stress of parenting. It also helped me feel I was doing some things right, like trying to take time for myself. A must read for moms, and dads!After my daughter was born, I read a lot of books and articles in magazines. The more I read, the more I got stressed out about all the information, and not doing EVERYTHING exactly like all the books/mags said. Eventually, I learned to stop reading all that stuff and follow my instincts. I only reference books now for medical reasons.You could say I'm on the stricter side of parenting by the way, and this book supported this, not that it's at ALL about how to parent."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I'm sorry, I can't take seriously anything that a woman named Muffy with a nanny has to say.What's wrong with moderation here? Why does everything have to be win/lose in this society...working moms vs. stay-at-home moms, slacker moms vs. Type A moms? Nothing is that black and white. I am sick of the media spinning every possible subject re parenting and women into an all-out war. Somewhere in the middle, in my opinion, is the best path.Work if you have to or want to, but be there and show up for your kids. Let them know you love them and support them, but carve out a little time for yourself, too, whether it's a chair massage once a week or a weekend trip with the girls!Some days I am a slacker mom, some days I am a type-A stressed-out mom on deadline, some days I am stay-at-home domestic scrapbooking mom, some days I am overprotective mom, and some days I am \\"I don't feel good today, you're just going to have to figure it out yourself\\" mom. And you know what? I think I'm a great mom. I have a happy kid who does great in school and is learning that life is not perfect and people are multi-dimensional and ever-evolving, not one-note characters in a book! That's good enough for me."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewer: great idea, poor execution. I also thought that not mentioning her nanny till the last chapter was disingenuous, and it diminished and undermined this ultimately classist book.I actually agree with many of the author's points: I don't think parents are helping their children by being pushy and overprotective. However, I couldn't stand how she attempts to disguise her obvious lack of interest in actually parenting her kids as a simple rejection of current hyper-maniacal parenting trends. She justifies her apathy by telling herself (as well as her hapless readers) that by depriving her kids of her time and effort, she's somehow instilling &quot;ol' fashioned&quot; values in them. If her hired help approached the job of raising her children with such cavalier attitudes, I bet they'd be fired!Also, the title is way off. This book should be called &quot;Confessions of a half-assed mom&quot; or &quot;Confessions of an otherwise preoccupied mom.&quot; Ms. Mead Ferro really isn't a slacker, a term I feel somewhat protective of as a Gen X-er who spent years living in Seattle, a slacker stronghold. The author, who is a baby boomer, by the way, keeps reminding us that although she may be a lazy mother, she's a very hard worker when it comes to her career in advertising. No self-respecting slacker would ever boast this much about being such a hard worker. She doth protest too much.Two lines in this book especially annoyed me:She writes about how life isn't fair, and &quot;I don't even wish it was.&quot; Easy for someone in her position to say.At the end of the book, Ms. Mead-Ferro writes: &quot;And maybe, most of all, I don't need marketing campaigns to make money off my good intentions to tell me how [to raise her kids].&quot; I found it inordinately hypocritical for someone who makes her living in advertising to write this, as she may have even profited from such marketing campaigns herself!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I appreciate her confessions around her so-called slacker parenting style. I also agree that our parents and grandparents must not have done everything wrong or we wouldn't be here and be semi-successful. Our society does create a lot of pressures for moms to give everything to their child, and Muffy rightly calls us onto the carpet for giving into our children too often. I wholeheartedly support her philosophy on limiting your child's toys, for example.However, she is speaking from a position of privilege - she herself notes that each of her children has their own bedroom even after she has written a chapter telling us it's ok (even preferable?) to bunk our kids together. Additionally, she could have eliminated a few pats on the back of her grandmother and mother (and herself for that matter), and the book would have been much easier to finish."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"What a fun book! I laughed all the way through...and nodded my head in philosophical agreement. Mead-Ferro has whittled parenting issues down to their base level, challenging many to review their motives for parenting choices.For us fellow-slackers, she's provided an easy read (making me feel accomplished that I finished a book while raising 3 boys under age 5), as well as constant belly laughs that are key to surviving parenthood!A great gift book, especially for a first-time mom!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"Finally. A book that speaks to the other side of hyper-competitive parenting. The moment I opened this book, I felt like I had found a new friend.Mead-Ferro's parenting philosophy is that less is more when it comes to kids. Simplifying kids' lives actually forces them to be more creative and resourceful.After I read this book, I got rid of six garbage bags of toys and donated them to charity. The day after I did this, I noticed a complete difference in my two toddler children. They appreciated the toys they had and found new ways to play with them.Mead-Ferro writes that the more we parents do for kids, the less prepared they are for the real world. She is not suggesting that we should let our babies run wild in our houses sticking forks into outlets. But over-childproofing has its downside, too. She reminds us that we are doing our children a disservice by trying to create a world where nothing bad happens to them.Of course, it's easy to understand why parents might forget this. Who wants to watch their kids fail? Mead-Ferro's stories illustrate that failure is sometimes life's best teacher.Mead-Ferro's book isn't just a book about parenting philosophy. It's a lovely memoir highlighting her own childhood. I especially loved reading about her grandparents' legacies and how they overcame hardships through perseverance.A fabulous, fabulous book!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"at last, a book about parenting that doesn't make me feel like a total loser!i laughed from the beginning to the end of this book. as a fellow slacker mom (and a single mom at that), i completely understand where she's coming from. i'm sure that playing mozart to your baby while in the womb is culturally enlightening and soothing to the soul, but i don't see it as a necessity. i didn't do half the things all these doctors and parenting advisers tell you to do, and my daughter is just about the smartest kid in her class, reading 2 or more levels above her current grade. i believe it's not so much to do with making sure you have the correct lamaze toys in your child's crib or painting the proper stimulating colors on the walls that will propel your child to success in life as the values you give them and the examples you set.i was surprised to see that some readers were so horrified by this book. mead-ferro is certainly not telling anyone that this is the path they should follow to attain parenting success; it's just her own perspective on raising her kids and exploring her relationship with her own mother. what's wrong with that? and you do have to let kids make their own mistakes. though it's hard to do, sometimes you have to let them fall and get up on their own. it happens in life all the time, and the sooner kids learn that, the better. you can't protect them from everything. while i wouldn't advise letting your kid jump off the roof, you have to accept the fact that they ARE going to touch the stove (so to speak) at one point or another to see if it's really all that hot. you may be able to stop it today, but there's always tomorrow.i think it's easy to judge when you're looking in from the outside. when you become a parent and see how hard it is to raise kids, to just get them through each day without killing themselves or losing your own sanity, it puts things into an entirely different perspective. i myself thought i would do all those wonderful, enriching things when i had a child. then reality set in. working a fulltime job and then coming home to deal with my daughter, i'm lucky if i have the energy to fix her dinner and read her a story before putting her to bed. despite that, my daughter is a happy, well-adjusted child who knows that she is loved. if she grows up to be a decent, honest person who can find love and fulfillment (in whatever she does in life), then i think i've done my job.hey, for those parents out there who have the time and inclination to do all these hyper-parenting activities, i say go for it. more power to you. bottom line, everyone is going to raise their kids in the way they see fit. not all methods work for all people. whatever parenting methods you use, if you love your kids and do the best you can, that's all anyone can ask for."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"I bought this book because I thought the premise was fantastic. At what point in our lives did we decide that everything must revolve around our children? However, this book does a very poor job of fully developing and talking about this idea. Additionally, she never comes out and says what the age of her children are which leads to me to believe (at the time of publication) the author was not even in a position of authority to really understand about being a slacker (i.e. she had not gotten into her kids wanting to play soccer, baseball, do ballet, art, cheerleading, etc. etc.). However much I paid for this book was too much!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Slacker Mom","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book and when she gave it to me I imagined myself rolling my eyes. However, I am truly glad I read it. I am not one to question my own judgment and have never really read advice columns or self help books. This book was a quick, easy read that made me take a look at my parenting and reconsider my approach to certain things. The author is not, nor does she claim to be, a parenting expert. Her advice is full of wisdom that comes from her life experience as a well-rounded, hardworking and sucessful person.

Every other generation -- we're talking thousands of them -- knew how to raise its children without all the parenting experts so can't we figure SOME things out for ourselves? If we do I firmly believe that growing up will be easier on our kids (it will be easier on we parents, too, as Mead-Ferro suggests, to the horror of some readers), and that when they ARE grown up they will be better off because they'll be self-sufficient!

The current age thinking is not on track IMO and I think a little throw back to the \\"good ole days\\" would do us some good.

She accuses moms who do scrapbooking of creating \\"shrines\\" to their children that will over-inflate the kids egos - I don't \\"scrapbook\\" but know that those that do use it as a hobby or creative outlet that may be appreciated some day down the road by their kids, not something that will make the kids selfish.

It is especially relevant to students of African American religious creativity, and students of colonial and postcolonial cultures (re: their religious creations).He is both learned and enthusiastic, concise and at the same time mind-blowingly insightful.

Long\\"Hope this one is more helpful than the last. . .: )"},{"Title":"Significations: Signs, Symbols, and Images in the Interpretation of Religion","review":"\\"Significations\\" is an important book. It is for neither the non-specialist nor the casual reader, but it is a significant work of analysis concerning American religious history and thought. Charles H. Long, emeritus professor of the history of religious at the University of California, is admirably qualified to produce this book. He has spent many years writing on the American religious experience, and his work sparkles with his characteristically challenging ideas. As a collection of previously published essays on a single theme, this book also contains a wealth of thought about the religious concerns of American society.Long explores the use of signs and other types of imagery as indicators of religious health. He notes this in his introduction: \\"The religion of any people is more than a structure of thought: it is experience, expression, styles, and rhythms. Its first and fundamental expression is not in the level of thought. It gives rise to thought, but a form of thought that embodies the precision and nuances of its source.\\" Accordingly, he defines his subject with broad strokes and seeks to illuminate the whole of American religious experience from his investigations.Of special importance in the essays in Long's concern about understanding and interpreting the religious heritage of African Americans. As an African American in the United States, he confides that the work presented here is largely an attempt to \\"make sense of my life\\" (p. 8). In each essay he seeks to explore the possibilities of thought rooted in the religious experience born of black traditions.One of the most important concepts Long expresses is his belief that Americans of all backgrounds must develop a religious theology of freedom. Such movements have arisen periodically in the nation's history, most notably in the evangelical crusade against slavery in the decades before the American Civil War and the civil rights crusade of the 1950s-1970s. He asserts that opportunities for such a theology of freedom abound, and concludes: \\"The visibility of the black community in American is out challenge and our opportunity to develop a theology of freedom-a freedom for humanity-a new humanity\\" (p. 141).Not all readers will easily grasp Long's complex analysis. He fills this powerful and thought-provoking with jargon and elusive ideas that require careful unpacking. But his thoughtful, compassionate attempt to merge the study of the history of religious thought with the consideration of current issues and symbols makes this a worthy book for serious contemplation."},{"Title":"Significations: Signs, Symbols, and Images in the Interpretation of Religion","review":"In Significations Long presents us with an intensive, thorough, and refreshingly deep look into the modern religious experience.

For this book, he put his eye, and talent, into capturing the essence of sea turtles, particularly the Pacific green sea turtle, or honu.Ching's experiences with sea turtles on French Frigate Shoals and the main Hawaiian Islands resonate in his illustrations. An artist who has looked deep into the black eye of the honu created these paintings. The text is factually accurate, in part because of Ching's knowledge, but also because he collaborated with George Balazs, probably the most knowledgeable person regarding the Pacific green sea turtle on this planet (learn more about Balazs in the book Fire in the Turtle House: The Green Sea Turtle and the Fate of the Ocean, by Osha Gray Davidson).Great pictures, factual text, and a neat critter... this book is a winner."},{"Title":"Sea Turtles of Hawai'i","review":"Met the author - wonderful man with beautiful island energy.

I bought it thinking short stories about WWII would be a great easy read book with very exciting story lines. In no way was this book even close.

Out of all the writers there is one or two that keep your attention but for the most part the writers have done a very poor overall job.

These ranged in quality from the semi-respectable (Argosy) to the not so respectable (a veritable slew of titles, such as Stag and the right-out front For Men Only). They featured stories of spies, derring do and jungle intrigue, but they primarily contained war stories. Lots and lots of war stories. The covers often told the tale regarding the type of quality you could expect within; this was particularly true of Stag, which featured damsels who were either in distress (especially with respect to the state of their undergarments) or inflicting distress upon U.S. soldiers who were tied to chairs and doing their best to appear panic-stricken. All of these magazines, alas, are long gone, or at least don't seem to have the circulation they used to. I was reminded of them, however, by the publication of a mammoth volume of war fiction titled VICTORY.VICTORY is a companion volume to COMBAT, both of which are edited by intrigue-meister Stephen Coonts. VICTORY is a doorstop of a volume, weighing in at well over 700 pages and consisting of ten previously unpublished pieces by masters of the war story. The stories in VICTORY range in length from fifty to over one hundred pages; if they had appeared in any of the adventure magazines, they would have been serialized. Most of the stories in VICTORY would or could have found a home in Argosy, though one --- \\"Blood Bond\\" by Harold Robbins --- is definitely Stag material. More on that in a minute.The stories in VICTORY do not glorify war. Far from it. All of the stories are set during World War II, with the exception of \\"Honor\\" by Ralph Peters, set immediately thereafter. It is difficult to pick an immediate favorite; the average reader may have several, for different reasons. Coonts's own \\"The Sea Witch,\\" which opens VICTORY, begins as a fairly predictable tale with an unpredictable ending and that utilizes an unexpected technique to catch the reader flatfooted.\\"Blood Bond\\" is typical Robbins. It is a spy story, dealing with a plot to kill Hitler, and stands apart from the other tales due to its unrelenting scatological narrative. Robbins writes the way James Bond really thinks. Though Robbins, gone for several years now, had his share of detractors, he never inflicted boredom on his audience, and this previously unpublished work continues his streak, even in his absence.David Hagberg's \\"V5\\" concerns the German rocket that could have turned the tide of World War II and the Allied military and espionage components that feverishly work together, though at some distance, to ensure that the project never makes it off the ground.Peters's \\"Honor\\" deals not with Americans in the war but with a German officer in the war's aftermath, trudging through the nightmarish ruin that is postwar Germany as he tries to return home to his wife. The conclusion of \\"Honor\\" is predictable, almost from the first paragraph; it is the journey, not the close-to-foregone destination, that is important here.The biggest surprise in VICTORY may be \\"The Eagle and the Cross\\" by R.J. Pineiro, a tale of an American pilot who is sent to the Eastern front to train Russian aviators during the final months of the Battle of Stalingrad. The bittersweet ending is perhaps the most haunting of any tale in the book.With VICTORY Coonts again demonstrates that his talent as a writer is matched by his editorial abilities. While this volume is aimed at a more narrowly defined audience, the quality of the stories involved should, for the most part, satisfy the more discerning reader of any genre. Recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Victory, Limited Edition","review":"Stephen Coonts could write a dictionary that was entertaining reading. Just remember this is a collection of different authors introduced and edited by Stephen Coonts only. I could not find the synopsis of the contents anywhere so I am introducing them here.Story 1) Stephen Coonts asks what happens when you load a Catalina flying boat with five tons of bombs, a half-dozen machine guns, and a crew that walks a fine line between valor and suicide. In the Pacific theater of war, the Japanese Navy is about to discover the answer to that question in The Sea Witch.Story 2) Ralph Peters follows a German officer in the starving days after World War II as he makes his way on foot back home, where a defeat more terrible than the Allied victory awaits him.Story 3) Harold Coyle takes us to the fierce fighting in the Pacific, where the Japanese and the Americans clash over a strategic airfield on the island of Guadalcanal. Their battlefield will earn the nickname Bloody Ridge from both sides.Story 4) Harold Robbins takes us back in time when victory could be had on the Normandy beaches if a reluctant hero managed to stop the Master of Europe - with his blood.Story 5) R.J. Pineiro brings the Eastern Front to light as a young American pilot is ordered to train Russian pilots in the new American-made P-39D Aircobras during the final months of the brutal battle of Stalingrad in the winter of 1942.Story 6) David Hagberg sends the OSS and MI6 behind enemy lines in Germany to stop the one weapon that can win the war for Hitler and Nazi Germany, an electromechanical guidance system that can launch missiles not only across countries but across the ocean and hit the United States.Story 7) Jim DeFelice takes us to the height of the war when information was bought dearly on both sides. When an American pilot parachutes into Germany to gather information, he lands right in the middle of the viper's nest - a place more deadly than anything he could have found in the skies above.Story 8) Jim Cobb sends a special detail of PBY Catalina flying boats hunting for a hidden enemy radar station that provides the Japanese Navy with an edge in the war for the Pacific.Story 9) Barrett Tillman brings us into a gruesome fight as a Marine Corps flamethrower unit attacks Japanese defenders on tarawa Atoll in November 1943.Story 10) David Ing takes us into the world of espionage as the Army Air Force becomes convinced that a Nazi superweapon can reach New York and Washington. As an interceptor is rush-developed, a plane-crazy young Texan begins to suspect that someone on the team has an agenda all his own..."},{"Title":"Victory, Limited Edition","review":"Fiction about World War II is practically redundant. How can you make up anything that is both plausible and that didn't actually happen?May as well read non-fiction.The writers in this anthology sometimes ape reality. Sometimes they write, as one reviewer implied, as if it were 1946 and the Saturday Evening Post were still publishing WW II pulp. Which, I guess they did for longer than that.Two stories involve sneaking around behind German lines to steal aircraft. One has the protagonist beating more bad luck than could possibly be imagined and the other has a series of good luck and the requisite square-jawed (presumably) American hero.One has a mixed team of heroes also beating odds to destroy a fictional German wonderweapon, a tale which would have been excusable in 1946. but not much later.The PBY stories are interesting for different reasons. One has to do with fighting and killing for its own sake. The lead character is bounced from a dive bomber squadron because he is so intent on getting hits that he gets hit, gets his crew killed, and so forth. At the end, the killing is obviously without purpose but the characters go on as if it were the most important thing in the world to continue. One wonders if there are people like that, or if normal people become like that in war.The other PBY story has a characteristic of war fiction when the war is a world war. To be important, instead of being one more unit expended amongst millions expended, the characters have to deal with a single, small, vulnerable but hugely important choke point or obstacle. The Guns of Navarone, for all its adventure, was all about a single battery of heavy artillery which could damage British naval operations in a narrow strait. But, for plotting purposes, the Brits really, really needed to operate unhindered in that narrow strait.In this case, the naval battle of Guadalcanal, one of whose results is renaming a body of water \\"Iron Bottom Bay\\", or, later \\"Iron Bottom Sound\\", has a major operation depending on finding some mystery about Japanese reconnaisance and destroying it. Only the characters in the story can do it. If they fail.... Wow. Nevertheless, given the formula is old, the story is extremely interesting.Flame at Tarawa would be a run of the mill procedural about a flame thrower operator on one of the worst Marine assaults in the war except that it is recounted in the voice of a much older man looking back at himself and the circumstances. I found it moving and unconventional.Hanger Rat has a skewed ending, but its depiction of what might be considered a precursor of the Skunk Works, manned by Texas barnstormer mechanics, is a great picture of the entire process and the Texas cultures surrounding pre-war private flight. That it turns out to be science fiction is not relevant.\\"Honor\\" has nothing at all to do with combat, except as the protagonist remembers it, but instead gives us an insight into a foreign world view, logical as to its consequences but entirely strange as to its premises.I hate to say this, but the book would be a reasonable one to get from a library, but not to buy. Get the non-fiction.A non-fiction analog would be the ancient \\"Combat. Pacific Theater\\" and \\"Combat, Pacific Theater\\". The stories are short--short stories, get it?--and varied as to operation and character, but they're true."},{"Title":"Victory, Limited Edition","review":"More good than bad is this admittedly uneven anthology of World War Two tales.

To me, the two best stories by far deal with combat missions in a PBY flying boat in the south pacific in early WW2, they are fast paced, have good character development, show the authors spent some time with historical detail,and ,finally,seem plausible. It goes down hill from there to me, but everybody has their favorites on the smogasbord! In short, if you are old enough to remember war pulp stories and enjoyed them, then you will probably enjoy this compendium; if not, you may find many of the stories too tedious or far fetched to maintain your interest.

Stories by Harold Robbins and David Hagberg belong in a different espionage anthology and there is a truly boring and glaringly out of place story by Dean Ing, who is a much better writer than this.

Well before this particular title went to print I was aware of Capstick's fondness to create length and dramatic effect, but I still found myself marveling at the ways he transformed this largely uneventful safari into a two hundred-page novel. The \\"Opus\\" of this particular adventure would have be the lion that nearly \\"had them all\\" and eventually took something like nine shots to kill. After reading this book I came away with very two distinct impressions. The first would be that Capstick did not come across as a veteran professional hunter who was out for the pure love of the sport. He might have been a seasoned pro with countless lion to his credit but descriptions given throughout this book left me wondering. Another clear impression I took away was that the primary reason he took this trip was so he could write the book. Most sportsmen, past and present, look down on this as it questions some essential reasons behind hunting. Even the legendary ivory hunter James Sutherland, took the time to mention his distaste for this practice in his classic The Adventures of an Elephant Hunter. I also came away sensing a fair amount of animosity between Capstick and his hired professional hunter. Peter was critical of his Professional Hunters(PH) field tactics and all but blamed him and his equipment for the troubles during the lion hunt. This \\"no holds barred\\" type of writing may come across as refreshing too many but it is truly rare to see one PH openly criticize another in this way. In the end, his PH would probably had a \\"take it with a dash of salt\\" opinion of Peter's written account of their times together. When aked about my own opinion, I would have to concede that the glossy color photos are really the only reason I have for keeping it on my shelf."},{"Title":"Peter Capstick's Africa: A Return To The Long Grass","review":"I enjoyed Death In The Long Grass and Death in the Silent Places.

But it wasn't what I've come to expect from Peter Capstick. It was missing his signature turn of a phrase, his wry humor, and engaging storytelling.

Capstick lets you feel the heat,the hunt, the time.

This was written before there was a Next Generation, and even before The Wrath of Khan Movie. It was actually written before Star Trek the Motion Picture, but was published after the movie's release. What this all means is that we are privvy to a lot more Star Trek history and backstories than the author was at the time he wrote this novel.Anyway, to get to the plot. Captain Kirk's past catches up with him as the King of Shad, that he originally transported into exile years ago, must be returned to his planet to help the Shaddan empire return to its former glory. The King trusts no one other than Captain Kirk to take him back home. The reunion between the King and Kirk is bittersweet, as the King is quite old and frail.In order for the King to regain his throne, he must have the Crown of Shad. The King had put the crown into hiding 18 years ago when he was being sent into exile. Now the Kings only daughter, Mr. Spock and Dr. McCoy must go to the harsh world that hides the crown to recover this royal relic.There are some very nice character moments between Spock and McCoy as they try to recover the crown and protect the royal princess. There is also an amusing side story with Chekov. The one negative thing about the novel is there are a few loose ends - such as a female Klingon - what did they do with her, and another subplot involving the royal retainers. Otherwise this is a brief, taut and interesting story. Fans of the original television series will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"Call me sentimental but I really liked this story. Spock and McCoy work together to protect and facilitate the ascension of a young woman to the throne of her war torn world. Part adventure story, part coming of age story, and not a bad commentary on the subject of leadership, this story held my attention throughout and may even warrant additional readings. Even staunch fans of the venerable Captain James T. Kirk will be pleased to see that the team of Spock and McCoy are themselves capable of not only saving the day - but also carrying a storyline through the majority of the novel. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"Howard Weinstein is a long-time Trek fan, and the writer of the animated episode &quot;The Pirates of Orion,&quot; so it isn't surprising that he has a feel for the characters of Star Trek. He also has a deft touch as a writer. This is the first of several novels he has written, in addition to comic books, and the result is the best ST book since David Gerrold's effort.A surprise birthday party for Dr. McCoy is interrupted by a call from Starfleet Command to divert to Starbase 22. When there, Admiral Harrington informs them that the civil war on Shad has turned, and it is time for the exiled king to return. Captain Kirk had been stationed on Shad at the time of his exile, year before, when the war had been going badly enough that the royal family was deemed endangered enough to go into exile on a planet some parsecs away. The Klingons had been quietly supplying the rebels, hoping to disrupt the entire sector by the fall of Chad's government.When the Enterprise reaches Orand, the queen has died, and the king is aged and infirm. But their daughter is now an adult, and will be the one to assume the monarchy. But first, the ritual crown must be retreived from a different world. Only the true ruler of Shad can wear the crown, so the question will be, can young Kailyn perform the task? It won't be easy, with Klingons trying to disrupt the mission, as subtly as possible. To circumvent the surveillance, Spock and McCoy set off in a shuttlecraft with Kailyn to retrieve the crown, while the Enterprise proceeds. But, there is a spy on the king's staff, and the Klingons follow the shuttle. Now, Kirk must find the spy, and Spock and McCoy must keep the young princess safe while they deal with both the natural forces of the planet and the troublesome Klingons.Weinstein has a good ear for dialogue, and nothing about this story feels forced, as many of its predecessors were. The characters flow along with nary a ripple, and the comic relief of Chekov and the extra ten pounds is deftly handled. Weinstein has a special feeling for McCoy, and his feelings of growing old in the story are very well-written. The characters who enter the path of the Enterprise crew, from King Stevvin to Shirn O'tay, are natural and do not seem out of place in the Star Trek universe. This is simply a good story, and an excellent setup for the regular characters."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"The book reminds of the TV episode -&quot;Friday's Child&quot;. The plot and storyline are discussed in other reviews, so I won't bore you again with those details. The storyline and plot is written very well and stays on course and doesn't deveat. The character development follows Star Trek canon. The main ST character in this story focuses is McCoy's relationship with the ordaned young female ruler of the planet Shad. Is he a father figure to her? A lover? Is he reliving his youth? Read and find out. McCoy and Spock (and others) are together on a planet searching for the crown to help make this young woman become ruler. The usual interplay of emotions between Spock and McCoy develops. Kirk is not on this &quot;quest&quot; with McCoy and Spock. So, will McCoy, Spock, and the others find this crown and help restore this young woman to the throne of Shad? Oh! Of course! The Klingons are involved in this story too!Read on..."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"I loved this simply because McCoy was the main character. I don't think the author developed the other characters too well. I don't think Spock would ever hug someone in front of McCoy. Also, amazon doesn't have this, but I just bought mine from Books and Company in the US about a week ago. They must have taken this off the shelf rather quickly."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"This is a very good book and one that I would recomend to anyone that likes the old Star Trek series of novels."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"Near-perfect. Great for McCoy fans. A short, tight, planetbound adventure, with a lot of character development and personal conflicts rather than space battles. (See also \\"Planet of Judgement\\".) The movies handled Kirk's feelings of growing old, and this book fills in McCoy's experience of same. I really like how he argues with himself and tries to sort out his own state of mind. He's not a paper cutout. Ditto Spock, Kirk, and the original characters.Kailyn's coming-of-age is like a beloved fable being retold: it's an old story, but deftly handled, no part overdone or unbelievable. Not at all Mary-Sueish. Heartwarming without being sappy, with lots of fun twists. It could have been a great episode (and in fact the author wrote for the Animated Series). The writing is compact, with excellent dialogue. A breath of fresh air compared to the many fluffed-up, overly talky, predictable ST novels out there."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"This is one of the very early tie-in novels. The story opens by revealing an incident early in Kirk's career though the later portions focus heavily on McCoy and Spock.Very early in his career Kirk was assigned to a planet with a valuable mineral deposit and a civil war. Kirk convinces the ruling monarch to take his family and flee the conflict rather than stay to fight but instead of being able to return in a few months the exile has stretched to 18 years. Now peace seems near at hand and the Enterprise has been dispatched to return the king and his daughter home. Unfortunately the king's health is failing and his daughter must prove her worthiness to inherit the throne. McCoy and Spock are sent to aid her in her quest while Kirk and the Enterprise keep the Klingons and the Federation at bay.The plot seems to have elements taken from various other (non-Trek) sources but they are put together fairly well. The characterizations of the Enterprise crew is handled reasonably well, particularly McCoy making this a treat for fans of the good doctor."},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"mccoy and spock are the center of this trek adventure..and when written by someone who knows the characters, that's a pairing that's tough to beat...I had a great time reading this book...lots of great character interaction between Spock and Bones, all wrapped in a pretty intriguing central plot...deinfelty recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Covenant of The Crown","review":"The Covenant of the Crown is one of the earliest Star Trek books and may be a little difficult to find, however, it is worth the search. The author does an excellent job of developing both Spock and McCoy's characters beyond what we were allowed to see in the original series. The story line is good and the little princess who grows into a competent, compassionate queen during the course of the book shows McCoy's paternalistic side and even brings out a little emotion in the unflappable Mr. Spock. The book is not long, but it is a great read. I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I would definitely recommend this book; it helped both by helping me to identify and diagnose my own tendencies and difficulties in this area and by suggesting strategies to address the symptoms."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I first read this book in 2003 when I had five young children and had just moved from a small apartment to a large house. It helped me very much. I have since let others use it without a return to me so I bought this book to replace my missing one."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I purchased this book to improve my Time Management Skills. I have good time management skills but they could be improved. This book however, is better designed for those who need basic instruction. I did pick up some good tips and discovered a few basic practices that I was not doing - like putting time frames with my daily to do list.The author is an expert at organizing and approaches time management with the same outline as she would clean out and organize a closet. For me this approach was somewhat awkward. But for you maybe it works? Overall a helpful book chock full of examples and step by step instruction, but it will not take its place with the classics in the field."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I bought this book mainly because I saw it in a Levenger catalog. The approach is wholly different from all of the other time management books that I have read. The author doesn't try to tell you concrete steps to live your life, she shows you a process that will allow you to live your life in control. This is in stark contrast to what I have read in the past, and I found it completely refreshing. As a result, I feel that I am living more in accordance to my big-picture goals, more fully in the moment, and more in control. I have actually been more productive and felt better about myself. The author encourages you to embrace your own psychology and learn how to work with your personal quirks to achieve better time management. That in itself was worth the cost of the book. I plan to reread this book once every so often to make sure that I'm keeping it current in my mind. It's that good."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Read both organizing from inside out and time management from the inside out and I would recommend this books to anyone who is serious about taking control of time and their stuff.

Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"What sets this book apart from other books about time management is the consideration it has provided to several parts touching one's life. It does not only cover management of your career schedule, it has touched as well on the importance of ensuring that the other, probably more important, aspects of life are equally kept in check with time. Just like Martin Gover'sTime Control - Taking Control and Achieving Goals (Creating Lifestyle), the author has also given specific stress on how adequate management of time and schedule will totally redefine the quality of life one is living. As a whole, the proven strategies shared in this book will help you gain a better experience in your journey through life."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Julie Morgenstern's books are always right on the money and offer great ideas.

This book helped me to view time in a different way and actually get things done."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"This was a good book. It had a lot of interesting ideas - think of turning your time into a container, for example. However, I wished that the author would have stuck to a clear system. She makes it clear that no system works for everybody - you have to personalize it. That makes the reader feel like they are back at square one in some sense."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I just got this book because my business coaching clients often have issues with running a business, often by themselves, and finding enought time to have a life.

I keep recommending it and will continue!"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Time ManagementI sit here with a to-list. These lists are not new to me. I have kept to-do lists for a long time. They used to be simple lists like shopping lists.Feed the petsClean litter pansOrganize (kitchen or filing cabinets or desk)Write at least three pages in my novelPrep for classes (I am a college instructor)Correct papersClean house (Sort of goes with organizing)After I read Time Management From the Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern, my to lists changed and so did my schedule. For one thing, I began paying attention to how much time things took. I started timing projects.I used to write A B or C beside each project. I had gone to a time management seminar once, and this was the one technique she gave. The projects marked \\"A\\" had to be done today. The projects marked \\"B\\" could or should be done today, but could be put off for another day. The projects marked \\"C\\" could be put off for now. B and C projects might move up the list tomorrow or the next day. I did this for years even though it did not work. It gave me permission to not get to projects when they were marked B or C. There was some 60/40 rule. Get to 60 percent of your to-do list and give yourself permission to drop the rest. Maybe the rule was 40/60. I don't remember. It wasn't working, but I knew no other way.Then I read Morgenstern's book and she taught me a few tricks. Note that I finished readig the book over a month ago, so I have tried the tips. She asked her readers to pick three projects and to write beside each project the estimated time one had to spend on those projects. Then time the project. Is there a difference between expected time and actual time?So I timed myself cleaning litter pans, making beds and correcting papers. I did this for several days until I got an average. There was not a big difference between my estimated times and the real times. But the important thing is that I was paying attention to how long projects take. I started lookin at how long other projects would takeI took Morgenstern's advice and started writing time allotments beside each item on the to-do list. I found some things could not be estimated. Writing a page in my novel could take five minutes or fifteen. Sometimes I had to look up character's traits; sometimes I had to delete a page and start over.Correcting papers could take fifteen minutes or half the day. It depended on how many papers came in. I had to be flexible.I also started looking at how I used my time and when I did things. I used to do laundry and cleaning in the mornings. I wanted to get it done and over with early in the day. But these household projects took time and energy. By the time I turned to my writing and creative work in the late afternoon, I was tired and drained. I didn't want to write. I wanted to relax.I changed the schedule around. Writing and creative work would come first and then the housework. Housework in the late afternoon actually gives me an energy boost. Wow! I can get more done.Laundry is a project that can be placed in a large time slot; even one designated for something else. . Sorting takes five minutes or less. Putting clothes in the washer and then the dryer takes five minutes or less. Folding takes slightly longer. Yes, the time adds up, but it cannot be done all in one twenty minute slot. I put off laundry to the evenings or I paired it with correcting papers. Getting up and moving gives me energy, and I found I could get less bored with a task like correcting school work with a few laundry breaks. So now I was getting to my writing and creative work. Before the writing was often neglected. Thank you Ms. Morgenstern.Another project I often neglected was exercise. My weight has been creeping upward and I have doctor's orders to lose weight, so exercise was important. When I started marking off time for it, I started getting to it. Because I exercised to CD's that I love and didn't play too often, I looked forward to the music and the exercise time.I have no more time now than I did before I read Morgenstern's book, but now I am getting to the projects that I need to get to. The house is cleaner - I did not entirely stop doing housework - I just shifted its time slot.Time to move onto another project on the to-list. Thanks, Again Ms. Morgenstern."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Julie Morgenstern is one of my favorite organizing authors. One of the longest-recognized organizing experts, Julie has a way of breaking down the process to simple steps. Taking action in easily managed steps makes a daunting task - like managing time - doable.Her book, Time Management from the Inside Out, Second Edition: The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule -- and Your Life takes the same principles from her signature book on organizing spacesOrganizing from the Inside Out, Second Edition: The Foolproof System For Organizing Your Home, Your Office and Your Lifeand demonstrates how to apply them to the specific case of managing time:* Analyze and Strategize - what's going on now and what are your life goals for the future?* Sort, Purge, Containerize - categorize your main activities, get rid of excess (busy work), and group like activities to save time in execution.* Make a (Floor Plan) Time Map - based on your week as a manageable unit, designate specific times to perform routine actions. Ex. Pay bills on Saturday morning, do grocery shopping on Thursdays after work, make follow-up calls at 4 pm each weekday.Of course, Julie includes real-life examples showing how time mapping works in the diverse worlds of a business executive and a working mom.I'd suggest you check the book out from the library first. There is some work involved in priority and goal setting as in any time management course. The rewards are definitely worth the initial time investment in my opinion. You can view a copy of my time map here and make comments/suggestions. ;-)"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"Julie Morgenstern has created an easy-to-read book describing a complete program of organizing your life. I like the book's set-up because it is also easy to read in segments, even out of order."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"This is a great book for anyone who is looking for a simple, easy plan for time management. Morgenstern's approach to time management seems better and simpler to follow than other books I've read on time management, because it allows for the interruptions of daily life, both those of our own doing and those brought on by others, whether it be a spouse, children, or boss.Morgenstern breaks down a plan for time management in easy steps, and her plan has flexibility even for those who feel that time management is only going to stifle their life. She also offers suggestions for considering why certain time management issues plague you. For example, she suggests that time management issues may be due to being easily distracted, the unwillingness (or lack of foresight) to schedule time for tasks. She then offers solutions to these problems.I like that she also touches on such practical steps as how to find the right planner for you. After struggling for years to keep my calendar on my phone, only to be forgetting appointments until the last minute (or altogether), Morgenstern's book gave me the permission I needed to just go ahead and purchase an old-fashioned paper planner. It may weigh as much as my laptop, but at least I show up for appointments!I also liked the section on goal setting. Tying your time management to your goals, and giving you a good overview of how to set realistic goals for yourself, offered me a great tool to move forward in some areas of my life where I have bigger goals, and let go of areas where I don't.I think this would be a great book for anyone who is interested in managing their time and their life better."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"The author does not preach a rigid structure that you cannot maintain. She helps you to identify where you spend your time and whether or not you are working towards what is important to you, not how she thinks you should be organizing your time. The steps to help overcome procrastination behaviors and other psychological obstacles are excellent. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I desperately needed better time management skills, and I was at my wit's end about managing everything, until I checked this book out of the library. Halfway through reading it, I bought it from Amazon.com. I knew that quickly that this was the book I needed. I love Julie Morgenstern's emphasis on literally mapping out your time, learning what's truly important to you, emphasizing that in your schedule, and letting unimportant things go. Since then, I have a better sense of what I need to do each day, and now I create a weekly calendar based on what I need and want to do that upcoming week. It's a disciplined-but-flexible approach that works for me better than anything else has. I also bought her book on getting organized from the inside out. Sixty-five pages into the book, I had already organized my bedroom - a huge disaster area - with ideas from it. And it's stayed organized ever since. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I found the author's first book, about organization, to be both inspiring and helpful on a psychological level, though many of her practical tips were just common sense. If you never read that book, you will find this one to be useful in the same manner, but if you've read the first, you don't need the second. Essentially, she markets time as a commodity like objects, except it has to be stored efficiently in a day instead of a basket or closet. Her main thesis, which you don't need an entire book to learn, is that you have to know how long a task takes in order to schedule it effectively. Once you have a realistic idea of what you need to do and how long it will take to do it, you should be able to handle your time - unless, of course, there are external, internal or technical obstacles to this. An external obstacle might be working, raising a family, and suddenly having an aging parent to care for. An internal obstacle might be an inability to say \\"no\\" when asked to take on yet another task when your schedule is already packed. A technical obstacle might be as simple as not having a calendar (electronic or paper) so you have to rely on your memory for appointments and projects. This book can be awkward at times, since the author is clearly modeling it on her wildly successful first book, from the title to the set-up. Not all of time management fits into the same categories as space and object organization. And, as in the first book, many of the tips she gives are just common sense. Also, some of the advice is a little dated in this economy; hiring someone to do tasks for which you don't have time is not necessarily possible for people who are unemployed or underemployed. Overall, I'd go with her first book and adapt it for yourself, rather than work with this one. However, it isn't a bad book and is certainly easy to follow."},{"Title":"Time Management From The Inside Out :The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule and Your Life","review":"I have several of this author's books.... it is all related... organizing, keeping minimal stuff, time management, etc. I have been working on being organized and time management improvement for the last 9 months and feel that I have about 3 months to go!

Techniques change over time to match how you work with time.On to the book. Julie covers time's relationship with space. Which is interesting because most don't think about it that way. She covers why you must think of spatial vs electronic vs etc when choosing your system.The standard time management techniques are in here of course. What surprised me was the emphasis on delegating because it isn't a book for managers. She brings up an excellent point though - delegating isn't just for subordinates.

The actual advice is very rudimentary, and seems outdated.This may have been fixed in the second edition, but I was annoyed at this suggestion: \\"If you're a new mom who is breast-feeding and sleep-deprived, you can catch up by . . . having someone else give the baby a bottle once a day so that you can have a few extra hours of uninterrupted sleep.\\" An extra feeding while mom sleeps -- for an older baby and only occasionally -- will probably not be a problem, but a feeding every day while the breast is not also being emptied will almost definitely sabotage breastfeeding. I hoped that it was simply because the book was outdated, but it was published in 2000! As a breastfeeding counselor, I deal with the other end of this scenario, when moms who have done just what the author recommended are trying to recover their milk supply, and it's frustrating to still see this advice out there.Otherwise, though, I particularly liked the exercises on defining your goals and how your activities relate to them, mostly in the middle of the book."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],x={key:0},W={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",M,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",x,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const O=d(C,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-cbd9168a"]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/15.md","filePath":"people/15.md"}'),q={name:"people/15.md"},R=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(O)]))}});export{D as __pageData,R as default};
