In teaching geochemistry, I realized that the best examples for many chemical processes are drawn from the study of ore deposits. Consequently, we initiated a course at The University of Cincinnati entitled \\"Sedimentary Ore Deposits,\\" which serves as the final quarter course for both our sedimentary petrology and our ore deposits sequence, and this book is based on that teaching experience. Because of my orientation, the treatment given is perhaps more sedimentological than is usually found in books on ore deposits, but I hope that this proves to be an advantage. It will also be obvious that I have drawn heavily on the ideas and techniques of Robert Garrels. A number of people have helped with the creation of this book. I am especially grateful to my students and colleagues at Cincinnati and The Memorial University of Newfoundland for suffering through preliminary versions in my courses. I particularly thank Bill Jenks, Malcolm Annis, and Dave Strong. For help with field work I thank A. Hallam, R. Hiscott, J. Hudson, R. Kepferle, P. O'Kita, A. Robertson, C. Stone, and R. Stevens.

The study specifically focuses on UUM administrative staff. In order to achieve the research objectives, the study employ a quantitative research method, mainly survey where questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The research population is UUM administrative staff in Sintok main campus. The study is significant to the body of knowledge, policy makers, practitioners and academicians. Since most of literatures on perceived benefits of Islamic work ethics are theoretical, this study will add on the stock of knowledge on Islamic ethics through empirical contributions. Therefore, it will contribute to knowledge on this field. Policy makers and Islamic corporations can design their code of ethics to incorporate Islamic values and this will have great positive impact on their performance as well as economic growth. Future researchers can explore more on other variables as well as expand the size of the study in order to contribute more to knowledge. Ethics and morality are core values of all divine religions. All divine religions that are revealed by Allah to His messengers with divine books promote ethics and morality. According to Mayne ethics runs deeper than the internal compass and describes a social system or societal structure of moral codes that govern virtuous action. From a secular perspective, ethics change from group to group and society to society. But from the Christian perspective, ethics should be concrete and governed by God. Christian ethics does not change from society to society, as secular moral codes may do, Christians are a single group adhering to the ethical code of the Bible, rather than multiple sects adhering to differing laws and customs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ro1ODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PHP MySQL Website Programming: Problem - Design - Solution","description":"The aim of this text is to define a good methodology for creating a web site (with functionality that is used on many different kinds of sites, and that programmers may well be working on in the future) by identifying problems, surmising solutions to those problems, and then implementing those solutions using modern development practices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vnIrzQEACAAJ&dq=PHP+MySQL+Website+Programming:+Problem+-+Design+-+Solution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eunoia","description":"In a five-chapter book of experimental verse, each chapter uses only one vowel, with the vowel taking on its own personality, in a volume that also includes other poems about vowels and language in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cShYAwAAQBAJ&dq=Eunoia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Koloa: A Kauai Plantation Town","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zCtLAwAACAAJ&dq=The+Story+of+Koloa:+A+Kauai+Plantation+Town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minor Miracles (Will Eisner Library)","description":"Presents stories of ordinary people affected by the appearance of enigmatic characters and unexplained events which turn their lives around.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-dEDJB17prcC&dq=Minor+Miracles+(Will+Eisner+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Records for ISO 9000 Compliance","description":"Brumm reviews and interprets each paragraph of the ANSI/ISO/ASQC Q9001-1994 standard that implies or specifically states a records requirement.

The story is at once the age-old tale of utopia and dystopia and the saga of Americans at mid-century, with a history of economic depression, the midwestern dust bowl, and two world wars. First published in 1957, The Green Kingdom was Rachel Maddux's first novel, an ambitious undertaking that had occupied nearly twenty years of her life. Central to the novel is the act of creation - from naming the plants and animals of the kingdom to bearing children. Both Justin Magnus and Erma Herrick discover the wellsprings of their creative energy as they discover the kingdom and, finally, each other in a story that is by turns mystical and realistic, the product of a vivid imagination and keen powers of observation. The Green Kingdom itself is a metaphor for whatever circumstances can make a person feel some control over fate. To live in the Green Kingdom is to inhabit what Maddux calls \\"the climate of potentiality\\", and to read The Green Kingdom is an intense experience in which we imagine our own responses to this land that Maddux so carefully delineates.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oOtJAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Green+Kingdom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Little Instruction Book - Getting Published (Writers Little Instruction Bk)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ROw2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Writer%27s+Little+Instruction+Book+-+Getting+Published+(Writers+Little+Instruction+Bk)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ride with Your Mind: An Illustrated Masterclass in Right Brain Riding","description":"In this volume, Mary Wanless discusses the underlying principles of riding as she sees them.

Valuable artifacts are mysteriously misplaced by a prominent archaeological institution. Three celebrated astronauts perish in a suspicious fire after voicing their criticism of the US space program. Yet our world s most powerful agencies hastily dispel these alarming reports as conspiracy theories, and bury them in padlocked archives. The fact is that a suppression syndrome exists in our society. Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries exposes the startling degree of truth behind the rumors. Jonathan Eisen has collected over forty intriguing stories of scientific cover-ups and programs of misinformation concocted to conceal some of the most phenomenal innovations in mankind s history. These no-holds-barred accounts force us to confront the naivet  and danger of trusting our academic and political leaders to act always for the common good. Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries presents documented evidence that corporate self-interest, scientific arrogance, and political savvy have contrived to keep us in the dark about technological breakthroughs or interplanetary contact that may shift the current balance of power. Prepare yourself for a revealing look at the research and development to which we ve been denied access. Suppressed Inventions and Other Discoveries begins by examining the ties that bind the medical establishment to powerful pharmaceutical corporations. Then it details the struggle of the independent research against Orthodox Science and its code of conduct, the Scientific Method. Next, the book investigates the cover-up of information concerning UFOs and extraterrestrial life that s certain to make you reconsider what you thought was science fiction. The final section discusses just a few of the numerous alternate energy resources and fuel savers that, if put on the market today, would soon run the fossil fuel monopolies out of business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=caMNee9ybUQC&dq=Suppressed+Inventions+and+Other+Discoveries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The secret of Pooduck island,","description":"A tale of a boy on a wild island off the coast of Maine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-sDAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+secret+of+Pooduck+island,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"White Biting Dog","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2DsCtAEACAAJ&dq=White+Biting+Dog&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On your own in the wilderness","description":"What Thoreau proved a century ago about returning to nature will still work today. There is an inexpressible thrill in the intimate study of primitive country, the workshop of nature, the appreciation of wilderness technique. Unspoiled regions possess a quiet beauty and peace no artificiality, no crowds, all woods uncut. There is unbounded satisfaction and pleasure in successfully meeting the challenge of the wilderness. The two requirements for man in the North Country are knowledge and equipment. Colonel Townsend Whelen and Bradford Angier have combined their vast experiences camping and bivouacking to produce the perfect guide to peace and utter freedom. If the wilderness calls you, they invite you to join them and talk together about how to live in it. They explain what from their experience they found to be the best ways of entering wild and unspoiled country, of finding their way through it, and living there in comfort and safety. On Your Own in the Wilderness is their explicit direction on how to escape to an earthly Paradise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cP01DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Men and Women in Qing China: Gender in the Red Chamber Dream (Sinica Leidensia)","description":"This volume is a comprehensive analysis of constructions of gender in the great Chinese novel, \\"The Red Chamber Dream.\\" It provides a fascinating discussion of issues such as bisexuality, virginity, sexual power and parenting in the context of Qing dynasty China.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dnuck22J0zYC&dq=Men+and+Women+in+Qing+China:+Gender+in+the+Red+Chamber+Dream+(Sinica+Leidensia)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sad Story of Burton, Speke, and the Nile; or, Was John Hanning Speke a Cad: Looking at the Evidence","description":"This is a study of the famous controversy between Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke, fellow explorers who quarreled over Speke's claim to have discovered the source of the Nile during their African expedition in 1857-59. Speke died of a gunshot wound, probably accidental, the day before a scheduled debate with Burton in 1864. Burton has had the upper hand in subsequent accounts. Speke has been called a  cad.

While the unique legal status of American Indians rests on the historical treaty relationship between Indian tribes and the federal government, until now there has been no comprehensive history of these treaties and their role in American life. Francis Paul Prucha, a leading authority on the history of American Indian affairs, argues that the treaties were a political anomaly from the very beginning. The term \\"treaty\\" implies a contract between sovereign independent nations, yet Indians were always in a position of inequality and dependence as negotiators, a fact that complicates their current attempts to regain their rights and tribal sovereignty. Prucha's impeccably researched book, based on a close analysis of every treaty, makes possible a thorough understanding of a legal dilemma whose legacy is so palpably felt today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=maQwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Tribes,+treaties,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Encyclopedia of Cacti","description":"An illustrated reference that provides information on all types of cacti, including notes on care and cultivation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3PvtPQAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Encyclopedia+of+Cacti&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"C# Class Design Handbook","description":"This book presents an introduction to the C programming language, featuring a structured approach and aimed at professionals and students with some experience of high-level languages.

Dewey's experiments at the Labora-tory School reflected his original social and educational philosophy based on American experience and concepts of democracy, not on European education models then in vogue. This forerunner of the major works shows Dewey's per-vasive concern with the need for a rich, dynamic, and viable society. In his introduction to this volume, Joe R. Burnett states Dewey's theme. Industrialization, urbanization, science, and technology have created a revolution the schools cannot ignore. Dewey carries this theme through eight chapters: The School and Social Progress; The School and the Life of the Child; Waste in Education; Three Years of the University Elementary School; The Psychology of Elementary Education; Froebel's Educa-tional Principles; The Psychology of Occupations; and the Development of Attention.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGYWAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Southampton Row (Charlotte and Thomas Pitt)","description":"When a clairvoyant is found murdered following a late night saeance, Thomas and Charlotte Pitt become entangled in a battle over a crucial seat in Parliament when they discover that the wife of one candidate participated in the fatal saeance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=COhZf931jA4C&dq=Southampton+Row+(Charlotte+and+Thomas+Pitt)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divorce Talk: Women and Men Make Sense of Personal Relationships","description":"Taking a new look at divorce in America, Catherine Reissman shows how divorce is socially shared, and how it takes crucially different forms for women and men. Drawing on interviews with adults who are divorcing, she treats their accounts as texts to be interpreted, as templates for understanding contemporary beliefs about personal relationships. Riessman looks at the ideology of the companionate marriage: husband and wife should be each other's closest companion, and in marriage one should achieve emotial intimacy and sexual fulfillment. These beliefs imply a level of equality that rarely exists. In reality, most wives are subordinate to their husbands, most husbands want neither \\"deep talk\\" nor small talk that women want, and many husbands resent their wife's ties to kin and friends. To explain divorce, women and men construct gendered visions of what marriage should provide, and at the same time they mourn gender divisions and blame their divorces on them. Riessman examines the stories people tell about their marriages--the protagonists, inciting conditions, and culminating events--and how these narrative structures provide ways to persuade both teller and listener that divorce was justified. Although divorce is invariably stressful, many people believe that men suffer less than women. This is an artifact of what Riessman calls the \\"feminization of psychological distress\\"--traditional ways of measuring distress reflect women's idioms, not men's. Departing from a literature that casts divorce in only negative terms, she finds paradoxically that women sense rewards, even as they report hardship. There is a shakeup in gender roles, and women more than men feel they gain a fuller idea of who they are. The author allows us to enter the points of view of her subjects, while her analytic approach makes links between the self and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-gxrQgAACAAJ&dq=Divorce+Talk:+Women+and+Men+Make+Sense+of+Personal+Relationships&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Viking Achievement; the Society and Culture of Early Medieval Scandinavia","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aLdNcAAACAAJ&dq=The+Viking+Achievement%3B+the+Society+and+Culture+of+Early+Medieval+Scandinavia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"STRANGE INVASION","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ml9GAAAACAAJ&dq=STRANGE+INVASION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dragon Hunter's Handbook","description":"Born into grinding poverty, McIntosh was a few days old when he was given by his young mother to her parents to bring up.

This New York Times bestseller vividly chronicles the stunning decline in Woodrow Wilson s fortunes after World War I and draws back the curtain on one of the strangest episodes in the history of the American presidency. Author Gene Smith brilliantly captures the drama and excitement of Wilson s efforts at the Paris Peace Conference to forge a lasting concord between enemies, and his remarkable coast-to-coast tour to sway national opinion in favor of the League of Nations. During this grueling jaunt across 8,000 miles in less than a month, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke that left him an invalid and a recluse, shrouding his final years in office in shadow and mystery. In graceful and dramatic prose, Smith portrays a White House mired in secrets, with a commander in chief kept behind closed doors, unseen by anyone except his doctor and his devoted second wife, Edith Galt Wilson, a woman of strong will with less than an elementary school education who, for all intents and purposes, led the government of the most powerful nation in the world for two years. When the Cheering Stopped is a gripping true story of duty, courage, and deceit, and an unforgettable portrait of a visionary leader whose valiant struggle and tragic fall changed the course of world history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mbm_DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bassett","description":"Uses interviews to trace the history of the Bassett family, who settled on the border of Colorado and Utah, and looks at the family's connection with famous outlaws of the day","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x7qFAAAAIAAJ&dq=Bassett&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"REFLECTIONS ON LEE; A HISTORIAN'S ASSESSMENT.","description":"A contemplative look at what made Lee the man he was, and how the man was made into a general he became.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NMPjwAEACAAJ&dq=REFLECTIONS+ON+LEE%3B+A+HISTORIAN%27S+ASSESSMENT.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Risking Everything: 110 Poems of Love and Revelation","description":" Listen, are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?

Editor Michael Scammell and translator Philip Boehm bring us a brilliant novel, a remarkable discovery, and a new translation of an international classic. In print continually since 1940, Darkness at Noon has been translated into over 30 languages and is both a stirring novel and a classic anti-fascist text. What makes its popularity and tenacity even more remarkable is that all existing versions of Darkness at Noon are based on a hastily made English translation of the original German by a novice translator at the outbreak of World War II. In 2015, Matthias We?el stumbled across an entry in the archives of the Zurich Central Library that is a scholar's dream:  Koestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, M?rz 1940, 326 pages.  What he had found was Arthur Koestler s original, complete German manuscript for what would become Darkness at Noon, thought to have been irrevocably lost in the turmoil of the war. With this stunning literary discovery, and a new English translation direct from the primary German manuscript, we can now for the first time read Darkness at Noon as Koestler wrote it. Set in the 1930s at the height of the purge and show trials of a Stalinist Moscow, Darkness at Noon is a haunting portrait of an aging revolutionary, Nicholas Rubashov, who is imprisoned, tortured, and forced through a series of hearings by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he re-lives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and betrayals of a merciless totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Koestler s portrayal of Stalin-era totalitarianism and fascism is as chilling and resonant today as it was in the 1940s and during the Cold War. Rubashov s plight explores the meaning and value of moral choices, the attractions and dangers of idealism, and the corrosiveness of political corruption. Like The Trial, 1984, and Animal Farm, this is a book you should read as a citizen of the world, wherever you are and wherever you come from.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NwuUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great American ghost stories","description":"Sixteen spine-tingling tales from the dark side of our nation's literary history include \\"The Gray Champion\\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne, \\"Ligeia\\" by Edgar Allan Poe, plus fables by Sarah Orne Jewett, Henry James, Mark Twain, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Ambrose Bierce, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Frank R.

The prayers reveal the universal activity of the Holy Ghost in the life of the Christian. By what in theology is called \\"the law of appropriation,\\" the effective agency in the economy of redemption is attributed to the Third Divine Person. That this appropriation is not the indulgence of mere poetic fancy on the part of the theologian is made manifest by the words of our Divine Saviour, at the close of the Last Supper. It goes without saying that there is an indivisible oneness in all the activities of the Divine Nature, as exercised outside the circle of the Divine Life proper. Yet the utter distinction of the Divine Persons from one another is a truth on the same level as the absolute oneness of the Divine Nature which each possesses in its fullness. The Second Person alone became incarnate. Neither the Father nor the Holy Ghost took flesh. On the Son alone, through the humanity He assumed devolved the role of cancelling out sin and meriting redemption for mankind. His part in this divine drama ended, in a certain sense, with His ascension into heaven. The Third Divine Person then appears on the stage as the chief protagonist in all the succeeding scenes which have their denouement in eternity. He carries out the, vork of redemption by forming the souls of men to the life, von for them by Christ: He had inaugurated the work of redemption by forming Christ Himself in the womb of Mary. All this is adumbrated in the Saviour's parting words to His apostles on the eve of IIis death. He intimated to them that, in a mysterious manner, His own part in their supernatural formation was drawing to a close, and that His place in that work was to pass to another. As the Word of God, that is the Living Expression of what God is, it had been for Him to reveal God and God's mind. He had spent three years developing for them and for others the divine message. He had spoken clearly: men heard His words: but their souls did not lay llold of tIle implications of what He had said to them. The apostles caught the terms but missed the meaning of the sentences which were woven of these terms. Jesus says so explicitly: what is more He implies that it could not but be so. \\"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will teach YOU the truth. The Holy Ghost will teach you all things and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.\\" (St. John XVI. 12, 13, and XIV. 26). Christ's exposition of Divine Truth was but part of a whole process. He revealed: it belonged to Another to carry that supernatural doctrine into the very spirit of men and to cause the intelligence to be illuminated by it. The apprehension of Christ's meaning which was to come only after Christ's exaltation is to be due entirely to the active intervention of the Third Divine Person. Not only does the Holy Spirit enlighten the mind, He, as well, strengthens the will, so that it does not falter in face of the rude discipline of life that becomes of obligation on the apprehension of the Divine Truths. The moral code of Jesus is the logical consequence of the lofty status which He reveals as the condition of man when redeemed. Noblesse oblige. Born of water and the Holy Ghost, the Christian is an adopted child of God and co-heir with Christ. His actions must, of moral necessity, be stamped with the dignity that is his. But no external teaching, no stirring exhortation, will suffice to enable the Christian to play worthily the part that has been assigned to him. There is needed for this a divine energy working from within. The Holy Spirit imparts this divine energy. The Passion generated the exhaustless reservoirs of the divine power. The Holy Ghost engineers the connections between these reservoirs and the soul of man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P9nUsgEACAAJ&dq=Come,+Holy+Spirit+(Small+Prayer+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winner Takes All (Hawk and Fisher, No 2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sV4vAAAACAAJ&dq=Winner+Takes+All+(Hawk+and+Fisher,+No+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vastu Shastra : The Indian Counterpart to Feng Shui","description":"The book covers the basic principles of vastu the vastu purusha.

Are only the few elect? Rather than typically beginning with the preconceptions of systematic theologies, Dr. William Klein takes up this question by searching for a biblical theology of election. He surveys the OT contexts of God's choosing individuals--prophets, priests, kings--to serve divine purposes, and considers God's election of the nation of Israel as his special people. This OT study proposes that God's election is both individual and corporate, but not always determinative. Individuals entered the people of God by birth, but not all the people found salvation. Faith in Yahweh was required. This book traces these elective understandings through the intertestamental literature, identifying continuities and shifts. The bulk of the study, and the heart of the argument, focus on the New Testament. Klein identifies concepts of election, and relationships between writers in the gospels, the Lucan material, Paul's writings, and the rest. The new covenant, God choosing the church in Christ, emphasizes election as corporate, while the individual election of Jesus' disciples and of Paul raises the question whether such chosenness is necessarily salvific. In closing, Klein discusses the most engaging and divisive questions around God's election, and offers a real challenge to today's church.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BKQmCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews (Konemann Classics)","description":"When in 1740 Samuel Richardson published his novel Pamela, Henry Fielding was first stung into writing his lively parody Shamela and then inspired to produce, in a spirit of mocking rivalry, the immortal comic romance Joseph Andrews.

This gothic mansion outside New Orleans, Louisiana, is surrounded by a swamp haunted by treasure-hunters who seek to cancel each other out and a mysterious creature from out of space and time. The protagonist of the story, predestined to host the ancient amulet, is a former heroin addict whom we first see in Atlanta in an abandoned house that he calls his. The joy of his first addiction-free day is shattered by shootings of rival cutthroats that rattle his dwelling. The text enacts a historical archaeology that takes the reader from the post-Civil Rights era in America to ancient Egyptian civilization. This brilliantly told story also stages a palimpsest of literary paradigms including magical realism, postmodernism, the detective story (in which Worthy would be the action hero), and the picaresque novel, to cite only a few.

At the heart of the book lies the crux of modern debate concerning the State of Israel: Is Israeli society building upon the values stipulated in its original mandate, the Declaration of Independence signed in 1948 - namely, \\"freedom, justice and peace\\"? To what extent could alternative Israeli policies advance rapprochement with the Palestinian people? How relevant is the concept of social justice today in the building of Israeli society? Who's Left in Israel? asks pertinent questions without shying away from difficult answers. Some of Israel's leading thinkers and experts from Israeli academia, journalism and public life investigate the pressing issues that face the modern State of Israel, including: Does Israel's changing geo-political situation require a new direction in current Israeli political thinking? How can the establishment alongside Israel of an independent and viable Palestinian state promote the real interests of both peoples? After over fifty years of neglect and discrimination, how can Palestinian Israelis achieve equality as citizens and self-expression as Palestinians? How is the Occupation viewed in Israel and in the international arena? What are the causes behind growing socio-economic splits in Israeli society? How can the present relations between religion and state, which many Jews regard as coercive, give way to ensuring freedom of conscience and religious pluralism? and What is the status of women in Israel? These questions provoke meaningful and resonant debate. The radical political perspectives and alternatives presented in this book challenge long-held ideas about how Israel should conduct itself as a political entity, drawing on both past and present political discussion in Israel. Ultimately, the contributors arrive at a highly original and controversial portrayal of Israeli society and present a blueprint for a radical new path for Israeli politics. Contributors include: Shulamit Aloni, civil rights activist and founder of Ratz and Meretz; Uri Avnery, journalist and head of the Peace Bloc; Prof. Nadim Rouhana, sociologist and director of an Arab research institute; Tamar Gozansky, former MK (Hadash) and champion of social equality; Amira Hass, author and journalist; Dr. Ilan Pappe, historian; Prof. Menahem Klein of Bar-Ilan university, an international expert on Jerusalem; Dr. As'ad Ghanem, co-director of Sikkuy, an association promoting equality for Arab citizens; Gila Sversky, a founder of Bat Shalom; Prof. Galit Hasan-Rokem, lecturer on Jewish literature and poetess.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sXNtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Who%27s+Left+in+Israel%3F:+Radical+Political+Alternatives+for+the+Future+of+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curious George's ABCs","description":"George's friend teaches him about all the letters of the alphabet in \\"Curious George's ABCs.\\" This board book with sturdy pages is perfect for little ones learning to recognize letters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k54GswEACAAJ&dq=Curious+George%27s+ABCs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Am I a Hindu?

Author Linda Godfrey began investigating this story and soon found herself in the middle of a national sensation. Nobody has ever been able to prove whether the beast is a flesh-and-blood werewolf or will-o'-the-wisp, demon dog, or noble animal. But the author gives the reader plenty to chew on.

Of these, fewer than one per cent will make it into print. David Armstrong was one of the one per-centers, his first crime novel plucked from the slush pile at a major publisher and published to acclaim So far, so good. But it rapidly became clear to Armstrong that being a published novelist is not always as glamorous as it seems from the outside. There are the depressing, ill-attended readings, the bitchy writers' conventions, the bookshops who have never heard of you and don't stock your book. All of these will be familiar to any writer who, like Armstrong, falls into to the category euphemistically known in publishing as 'midlist'. The reality is that for every JK Rowling, there are 1,000 David Armstrongs; for every writer who is put up in a five-star hotel and flies first class courtesy of their publisher, there are 1,000 who sleep on friend's floors during book tours and dine at motorway service stations... Witty, acerbic and wise, How Not to Write a Novel lifts the lid on publishing. From agents to editors, publicists to sales reps, it explains the publishing process - and how to survive it - from the point of view of a non-bestselling writer. A unique book, it is essential reading for anyone who dreams of getting their novel published - and for anyone curious about the inside workings of the publishing game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3BmKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477-1806 (Oxford History of Early Modern Europe)","description":"The Dutch Golden Age, known for its renowned artists and writers, was also remarkable for its immense impact on the spheres of commerce, finance, shipping, and technology.

If you believe that there are times and places when the choice an individual makes to speak or be silent, to eat or fast, to remain seated or to stand up in a crowd, to stare and remember or to walk on by and forget, can be as powerful as a president s command, a congressional appropriation, or a military incursion, then this book is for you.

Ann Gray draws heavily on verbatim quotes from discussions to provide a rich description of different types of household micro-cultures and to give readers more direct access to the women themselves and the ways in which they accounted for their own experience. Video Playtime addresses questions of domestic technology as well as those of taste and cultural preference, particularly in relation to class, addressing the dynamics of power within existing social and cultural relations and thereby setting the analysis within a much wider social context.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IKmJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Constructive Postmodern Perspective on Self and Community: From Atomism to Holism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1W0dAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Constructive+Postmodern+Perspective+on+Self+and+Community:+From+Atomism+to+Holism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Inheritance (Regency Romance)","description":"Beguiling Vanessa Tarlton knew the risk when she accepted a position in the house of Nicholas Leighton.

Those with whom the schools do not succeed become scientists.\\" So begins Knut Schmidt-Nielsen in his autobiography The Camel's Nose, a fascinating reflection on his life and more than forty years of studies and adventures in locations ranging from the Sahara Desert to the Arctic Circle.One of the world's most prominent animal physiologists, Schmidt-Nielsen has throughout his career sought answers to seemingly simple questions: How can camels go for days without drinking? Do marine birds drink seawater? Why don't penguins' feet freeze? How do animals find food and water in the desert? By asking questions about the animals around us, we learn more about who we are, and the answers Schmidt-Nielsen discovered have not only helped us understand animals, but have provided us with insight into fundamental principles of life and survival.In The Camel's Nose, Schmidt-Nielsen relates the story of his life and work, interweaving tales of his childhood in Scandinavia and his personal and professional struggles in the United States with first-hand accounts of field work in Africa, Australia, and around the globe. He recounts how he sought out peculiar problems of animal form and function and details his remarkable discoveries. He also provides a glimpse into the personal life of a world-renowned scientist, from the rewards and difficulties of growing up in a family of scientists to the challenges of his early career to the redeeming power of love later in life.The Camel's Nose reveals a passionate curiosity for seeking out and finding answers. The reader is fortunate to share in Schmidt-Nielsen's lifelong quest and to be given an inside look into the life of a scientist who has witnessed the better part of a century of breathtaking discovery and change.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jRlXPS0KnHwC&dq=THE+CAMEL%27S+NOSE:+MEMOIRS+OF+A+CURIOUS+SCIENTIST.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE INCREDIBLE PLANET.","description":"The Incredible Planet is John W.

This book challenges the common assumption that American Indian prophecy was an anomaly of the 18th and 19th centuries that resulted from tribes across the continent reacting to the European invasion. Tom Mould's study of the contemporary prophetic traditions of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians reveals a much larger system of prophecy that continues today as a vibrant part of the oral tradition. Mould shows that Choctaw prophecy is more than a prediction of the future; it is a way to unite the past, present, and future in a moral dialogue about how one should live. Choctaw prophecy, he argues, is stable and continuous; it is shared in verbal discourse, inviting negotiation on the individual level; and, because it is a tradition of all the people, it manifests itself through myriad visions with many themes. In homes, casinos, restaurants, laundromats, day care centers, and grocery stores, as well as in ceremonial and political situations, people discuss current events and put them into context with traditional stories that govern the culture. In short, recitation is widely used in everyday life as a way to interpret, validate, challenge, and create the world of the Choctaw speaker. Choctaw Prophecy stands as a sound model for further study into the prophetic traditions of not only other American Indian tribes but also communities throughout the world. Weaving folklore and oral tradition with ethnography, this book will be useful to academic and public libraries as well as to scholars and students of southern Indians and the modern South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nvfdkFy7MmwC&dq=Choctaw+Prophecy+:+A+Legacy+for+the+Future+(Contemporary+American+Indians)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falkland Islands Shores","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9U03AAAACAAJ&dq=Falkland+Islands+Shores&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pricing for Profitability Activity-Based Pricing for Competitive Advantage","description":"Three things can happen when establishing a product price. A price set too high is a lost sale that could have been profitable at a lower price. A price set too low is rewarded with unprofitable work. Only when a price is set appropriately does a company make both a sale and a profit. Just as activity-based costing and activity-based management revolutionized the cost accounting world, activity-based pricing will bring a disciplined approach to developing pricing. Activity-based pricing examines the relationships between price, cost and sales volume and how this relationship effects profitability.

Shows how Chi Massage employs one s own internal energy to promote rejuvenation ? Presents Chi Massage techniques for every organ and bodily system ? Provides a daily practice routine that requires only 5 to 10 minutes to complete The Western concept of massage primarily concerns muscle manipulation. In the practice of Chi Massage, internal energy, or Chi, is manipulated to strengthen and rejuvenate the sense organs--eyes, ears, nose, tongue, teeth, and skin--and the internal organs. The Taoist techniques in this practice are more than 5,000 years old and, until very recently, were closely guarded secrets passed down from master to student with each master often knowing only a small part of the complete method. In Chi Self-Massage Master Mantak Chia pieces together the entire system of Chi Massage into a logical routine, revealing the methods used by Taoist masters to maintain their youthfulness. He explains the energetic theory behind Chi Massage and how negative emotions affect the organs and nervous system. By practicing the exercises outlined and following the daily routine that requires only 5 to 10 minutes to complete, readers can strengthen their senses--most notably vision, hearing, and taste--detoxify their internal organs and glands, help control negative emotions, relieve stress and constipation, and improve their complexion, teeth and gums, and overall stamina.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mV0oDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronicles of the Witch World","description":"The legendary, seminal second Witch World trilogy, together in a single edition for the first time, Lost Lands of Witch World In the 1960s Andre Norton's career took a fateful and important turn.

Watson was a figure alternately eminent and notorious. Born before the Civil War, he lived through the turn of the century and past the close of the First World War, pursuing his career in an era as changing and paradoxical as himself. In the nineteenth century, Watson championed the rising Populist movement, an interracial alliance of agricultural interests, against the irresistible forces of industrial capitalism. The movement was broken under the wheels of the industrial political machine, but survived into the twentieth century in various  fantastic shapes...to be understood mainly by the psychology of frustration.  Political frustration transformed Watson as well, from liberal to racial bigot and from popular spokesman to mob leader. In this biography, through careful study of public and private writings, and through objective and tolerant exposition, Mr. Woodward has attempted to solve the enigma of this man who did much to alter his times and who was, in turn, altered by them.  Mr. Woodward s biography of Watson is a model of its kind. It has all the obvious qualities of scholarship, thoroughness and impartiality. It has, in addition, a sympathetic understanding of broad social movements, a mature appreciation of character, an original interpretation of economic facts and factors, an incisive criticism of political techniques, and a literary style that is always vigorous and sometimes brilliant.  H. S. Commager, New York Herald Tribune Books  Mr. Woodward s biography of Watson constitutes the best one-volume history that has appeared of that first crop of social ideals, politically garnered in Populism...Mr. Woodward s biography is also valuable in that it is something more than the story of Populism. It is a striking portrait of a man.  W. A.

Offering a poetics of alphabetization and explicating the alphabet's tropes and rhetorical strategies, the author demonstrates the far-reaching cultural power of such apparently neutral statements as \\"A is for apple.\\" The new market for children's books in the eighteenth century established for the \\"republic of ABC\\" a cultural potency equivalent to its high-culture counterpart, the \\"republic of letters,\\" while shaping its child-readers into consumers. As a central rite of socialization, alphabetization schooled children to conflicting expectations, as well as to changing models of authority, understandings of the world, and uses of literature. In the nineteenth century, literacy became a crucial aspect of American middle-class personality and subjectivity. Furnishing the readers and writers needed for a national literature, the alphabetization of America between 1800 and 1850 informed the sentimental-reform novel as well as the self-consciously aesthetic novel of the 1850s. Through readings of conduct manuals, reading primers, and a sentimental bestseller, the author shows how the alphabet became embedded in a maternal narrative, which organized the world through domestic affections. Nathaniel Hawthorne, by contrast, insisted on the artificiality of the alphabet and its practices in his antimimetic, hermetic The Scarlet Letter, with its insistent focus on the letter A. By understanding this novel as part of the network of alphabetization, The Story of A accounts for its uniquely persistent cultural role. The author concludes, in an epilogue, with a reading of postmodern alphabets and their implications for the future of literacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-I-iaD04_oC&dq=The+Story+of+A:+The+Alphabetization+of+America+from+The+New+England+Primer+to+The+Scarlet+Letter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of Successful Teaching","description":"A newly revised edition of this classic work, exploring the diverse qualities essential for teaching in today's educational environment.

Our world is awash in false dichotomies: \\"You're either for us or against us, good or evil, 'born again' or 'left behind.'\\" Virtue is virtue, and vice is vice, but is it really that simple? Are the rules of proper conduct that black and white? With extraordinary clarity of thought and word, Dr. Robin Meyers argues that there are seven vital, life-affirming attributes everyone must embrace to lead a full life-and that in fact not only are these virtues not the opposite of evil, but that each is based on urges and instinct that are similar to the Seven Deadly Sins. Pride is a sin; Self-worth is essential to life. Envy is a sin; Emulation is essential to life. Anger is a sin; Righteous Indignation is essential to life. Lust is a sin; Holy Eros is essential to life. Gluttony is a sin; Communion is essential to life. Greed is a sin; Wanting Wisely is essential to life. Sloth is a sin; Contentment is essential to life. This isn't a philosophical treatise (although after reading this book no reader will ever think about morality in the same way again). The Virtue in the Vice uses personal stories, pop culture examples, and anecdotes from both the contemporary world and the Bible to create a practical plan for living. This book will help people embrace the ambiguity of life and the moral clarity that comes with honoring their own rights and needs and those of their fellow man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rST_PAAACAAJ&dq=The+Virtue+in+the+Vice:+Finding+Seven+Lively+Virtues+in+the+Seven+Deadly+Sins&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"By the Rivers of Babylon: Fifteen Sermons","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bc1ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=By+the+Rivers+of+Babylon:+Fifteen+Sermons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You can win at office politics: Techniques, tips, and step-by-step plans for coming out ahead","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tbIoAAAACAAJ&dq=You+can+win+at+office+politics:+Techniques,+tips,+and+step-by-step+plans+for+coming+out+ahead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aspects of the novel","description":"A series of 9 lectures covering the story, plot, characterization, and pattern and rhythm in the novel","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vzBtSnA4rLAC&dq=Aspects+of+the+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Danserye (vol. 2)","description":"In this sequel to The Complete Mandolinist, world-renowned mandolinist Marilynn Mair expands on her previous method books, presenting over 100 compositions that span 5 centuries, works she has thoughtfully edited or arranged for mandolin. Each piece is accompanied by a paragraph or two of musical context, and the book also includes 24 short essays on the evolution of musical style, drawn from Marilynn s decades as a Professor of Music History. Music by great composers like Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, and Beethoven mixes with interesting compositions by little-known mandolin composers like Piccone, Barbella, Leone, and Gervasio, works Marilynn has discovered during her performing and recording career. Concert pieces range from quite easy to very advanced, with most lying between those two extremes. In addition to music of the Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th Century, Marilynn includes contemporary pieces by some of her favorite composers writing today. This book holds a musical world Marilynn has compiled and presents to you.

Teilhard would agree. \\"We are surrounded,\\" he says, \\"by a certain sort of pessimist who tells us continually that our world is foundering in atheism. But should we not say rather that what it is suffering from is unsatisfied theism?\\" He sees a universe in movement where progress is the spiritualization of matter and its opposite is the materialization of spirit. Teilhard opts for progress. The Divine Milieu is the divine center and the divine circle, the divine heart and the divine sphere. The book is written for those who listen primarily to the voices of the Earth; its purpose is to provide a link to traditional Christianity (as expressed in Baptism, Cross and Eucharist) in order to demonstrate that the fears prevalent in contemporary world society as it abuses its very foundation - Mother Earth - may be better understood by the Gospel path. Teilhard's primary purpose is to show a way forward which he sees as the \\"Christian religious ideal\\". The Foreword is by Thomas M. King, S.J., Professor of Theology at Georgetown University, and author of Teilhard's Mysticism of Knowing, editor of The Letters of Teilhard de Chardin and editor of Lucile Swan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=miPKwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Divine+Milieu:+In+a+Newly-revised+Translation+by+Sion+Cowell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Hypnosis: The Complete Manual for Health and Self-Change [Second Edition]","description":"First published in 1992.

She could neither read nor write, and she was the reviled victim in a public rape trial, rejected by her father, and later abandoned by her husband. Nevertheless, she was one of the first women in modern times to uphold through her work and deeds the right of women to pursue careers compatible with their talents and on an equal footing with men. This edition features a new introduction by the celebrated critic and writer Susan Sontag. ? Anna Banti, the pen name of Lucia Lopresti, was born in Florence in 1895. Trained as an art historian, she turned to novels, stories, and autobiographical prose in the 1930s. Artemisia, her second novel, published in 1947, is the most acclaimed of the sixteen works of fiction she published during her long life, and is considered a classic of twentieth century Italian literature. Her last, harrowingly confessional novel, A Piercing Cry (Un grido lacerante), appeared in 1981. Banti also wrote art criticism and monographs on painters (Lorenzo Lotto, Fra Angelico, Vel?zquez, Monet), literary criticism and film reviews, and translated novels by Thackery, Colette, Alain Fournier, and Virginia Woolf.

Rauschenberg's vitally important and productive career spans this revolution, reaching beyond it to the present day.

Drawing on new materials from French, Vietnamese and Cambodian archives, it reconstructs a time during which France struggled to give meaning and substance to its Protectorate over Cambodia. It traces the lives of failed colonists  most notably Thomas Caramen, who all constituted a challenge to the colonial enterprise by muddling its social, cultural and racial boundaries. In its consideration of the critical role played by these colonists, this compelling book shifts away from governor-generals, grand discourses and the simple view of colonialism as  colonizers  versus  colonized , to explore how things actually worked themselves out on the ground. It examines in particular the 'civilizing mission' and educational initiatives; the slow destruction of the indigenous justice system; the policing of sexual relations between colonisers and colonized; the theft of Cambodian land and taxes by the colonizing power; and the brutal repression of resistance wherever and whenever it appeared. Overall, Muller reveals the crucial role played by indigenous middlemen and marginal Europeans in the rise of the colonial state, and tells the fascinating tale of a Frenchman who came to represent everything that the colonial state dreaded.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o8N_AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Indifferentism; or, Is One Religion as Good as Another?","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RylUAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gods Themselves","description":"In the twenty-second century Earth obtains limitless, free energy from a source science little understands: an exchange between Earth and a parallel universe, using a process devised by the aliens.

Which baptism, he wondered, had the most authority: the one a person received in infancy, or the one received as an adult after a conscious conversion. Should he, as one who had been baptized in infancy, be baptized again, after his conversion, in order to be a Christian in the Biblical sense, or was the baptism he received as a child valid? In seeking an answer, he studied the Bible and the copious literature on both sides of the question. Now, in this book, cast in dialog form, Dr. Saarnivaara offers the result of his study, examining the question exhaustively from both sides. Some of the questions which are thoroughly discussed are: Was infant baptism practiced in the time of Christ and the Apostles? Did Christ want His Church to practice infant baptism, or baptism after conscious conversion? Does the New Testament teach baptism as a means of grace, or as an act of obedience and confession of faith? What does the Bible teach as the relationship between baptism and regeneration? What was the practice and teaching of the post-Apostolic and the Ancient Church? What was the original method of baptism: immersion or pouring (or sprinkling)? In developing his theme, Dr. Saarnivaara has set forth the pros and cons of this age-old and still acute problem with admirable exactitude and lucidity. It is easy for the layperson to comprehend, but it is not superficial reading. From the thousands who regard religious problems like baptism worthy of thoughtful consideration and study, however, Dr. Saarnivaara's book should receive keen attention.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r3KvCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MARS 2000: The Complete Guide to Robotic and Human Exploration of the Red Planet","description":"The principle investigator for the ChemCam instrument on the Curiosity rover and a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Wiens traces the ups and downs of the new era of robotic space exploration through his own experience working on some of the important projects over the past decade.

The poems in Jack Bedell's What Passes for Love show all that and a little lagniappe. From a midnight chari vari, to the Fete de la Roulaison (the Grinding Festival), to newlyweds making love in the cane field and fishing tales galore, Bedell writes about the many sides of Louisiana's Acadian culture and its people. Poem by poem, this collection builds an honest, evocative, and sensitive world of stories told by a writer with an obvious love of place. Love in the Cane Field-After the Grinding The young groom wakes to stars and October chill to find a trail of bedclothes disappearing into the children's cane. There's nothing left of the festival, save the smoke that lingers- above the burned fields. The cane's been pressed, the trucks readied for the trip to town. Here and there nighthawks skim the clearing for mice. There's no other movement above the rows as he gathers wood for the. fire. He tries to think of the evening they've just passed alone, the lines of her back beneath the moon, the hope of money this year's cane will bring, but cannot keep his mind from what waits for her between the stalks-snakes left from summer, sinkholes yawning for her legs, blades left carelessly about. He does not blink until the cane parts, releasing her to the clearing naked and smiling, stronger than he knew. In the fire's glow he sees a spider web stretched across her stomach, hip to hip, the shine of her skin against the night, her eyes closing slowly with each step toward him. Next year's growth surrounds them in the dark, and morning holds its breath across the fields.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pElaAAAAMAAJ&dq=What+Passes+For+Love+(Texas+Review+Poetry+Chapbook+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sixty Glorious Years: A Tribute to the Douglas Dc-3 Dakota","description":"Sixty Glorious Years Pearcy Subtitled: A Tribute to the Douglas DC-3 Dakota.

America is a great country, a fact that is often overlooked with all the bickering and negativity in our culture today. And what makes us great, states Bill Halamandaris, are ten core values that have always been found in the spirit of the American people: Compassion, Opportunity, Responsibility, Equality, Valor, Ambition, Liberty, Unity, Enterprise, Spirituality. In 10 short chapters, Halamandaris explains why each of these values forms the foundation of our country, from our Founding Fathers to today's popular culture. He then shows how and why each of us should instill these values in our daily lives, not to return to an outdated ideal or to throw back history, but to step forward together into a brave new world. At the end of each chapter, Halamandaris tells the story of 4 to 5 contemporary Americans who are inspiring examples of lives well lived. Some of these people are famous; most are ordinary people who have chosen to do extraordinary things, like the school girl who has served 350,000 meals to the homeless and the man who has made it his business to hire only people no one else wants. The Heart of America is not about philosophy or finger-pointing at either side in the culture debate; it is a call to arms to be the best we can be every day. The Heart of America Foundation is a national non-partisan, nonprofit humanitarian organization whose mission is to teach the values at the heart of America and to help people, particularly children, learn that they can help themselves when they help others. Their programs include: The Youth Ambassador Program uses dynamic, service-minded youth leaders to inspire children in schools around the country to recognize their potential for social service. Heroes of the Heart recognizes and honors individuals and corporations who perform remarkable volunteer services. The Heart Corps offers financial credits for college to middle school and high school students who volunteer in their communities. Books from the Heart finds books that are not being used and distributes them to needy children and school libraries. Speaking from the Heart is a professional speakers bureau of more than 200 active youth and adult speakers, with all proceeds going to charity. The National Community Fund is an umbrella organization that donates to worthy charities promoting public service around the country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_QYMQAACAAJ&dq=The+Heart+of+America:+Ten+Core+Values+That+Make+Our+Country+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Holy War: Dispatches from the Home Front","description":"What does the \\"war on terror\\" and a new era of religious ferocity look like to an Englishman living in the Pacific Northwest?

Raban reflects on the Bush administration's manipulation of the threat of terrorism to undermine civil rights. In diagnosing what has gone wrong in the Iraq war, he emphasizes the US failure to understand the history of the Middle East and its loyalties of religion and ethnicity.

Now, he focuses exclusively on the contained world of the farm animal, revealing startling, irrefutable evidence that barnyard creatures have feelings too, even consciousness. Weaving history, literature, anecdotes, scientific studies, and Masson s own vivid experiences observing pigs, cows, sheep, goats, and chickens over the course of five years, this important book at last gives voice, meaning, and dignity to these gentle beasts that are bred to be milked, shorn, butchered, and eaten. Can we ever know what makes an animal happy? Many animal behaviorists say no. But Jeffrey Masson has a different view: An animal is happy if it can live according to its own nature. Farm animals suffer greatly in this regard. Chickens, for instance, like to perch in trees at night, to avoid predators and to nestle with friends. The obvious conclusion: They cannot be happy when confined twenty to a cage. From field and barn, to pen and coop, Masson bears witness to the emotions and intelligence of these remarkable farm animals, each unique with distinct qualities. Curious, intelligent, self-reliantmany will find it hard to believe that these attributes describe a pig. In fact, there is much that humans share with pigs. They dream, know their names, and can see colors. Mother cows mourn the loss of their calves when their babies are taken away to slaughter. Given a choice between food that is nutritious or lacking in minerals, sheep will select the former, balancing their diet and correcting the deficiency. Goats display quite a sense of humor, dignity, and fearlessness (Indian goats have been known to kill leopards). Chickens are naturally sociablethey will gather around a human companion and stand there serenely preening themselves or sit quietly on the ground beside someone they trust. For far too long farm animals have been denigrated and treated merely as creatures of instinct rather than as sentient beings. Shattering the abhorrent myth of the  dumb animal without feelings,  Jeffrey Masson has written a revolutionary book that is sure to stir human emotions far and wide.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RbxeFLpNnxUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Die Creol Taal: 250 Years of Negerhollands Texts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0RlrgEACAAJ&dq=Die+Creol+Taal:+250+Years+of+Negerhollands+Texts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mathematics of Gambling","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OlBvNQAACAAJ&dq=The+Mathematics+of+Gambling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pacific Northwest: A Photographic Tour (Photographic Tour (Random House))","description":"The most comprehensive collection of photographs of the Pacific Northwest marine life published!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mc8TAQAAIAAJ&dq=Pacific+Northwest:+A+Photographic+Tour+(Photographic+Tour+(Random+House))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Glory of life","description":"The aftermath of Franz Kafka s love affair with Dora Diamant is legend: refusing to honor his instructions to destroy his work when he died, Diamant saved Kafka s writings and letters that were in her possession. These were later taken by the Nazis and are still being sought today. Her importance for Kafka s literary legacy makes their all-too-brief relationship even more intriguing. Set over the course of his last year, The Glory of Life is compelling fictional re-imagining of this fragile, tender romance. In July 1923, Kafka is convalescing by the Baltic Sea when he meets Diamant and they fall in love. He is forty years old and dying of tuberculosis; she is twenty-five and seems to him the essence of life. After a tentative first meeting, the indecisive Kafka moves with Diamant to Berlin, a city in the throes of political upheaval, rising anti-Semitism, and the turmoil of Weimar-era hyperinflation. As his tuberculosis advances, they are forced to leave the city for the Kierling Sanatorium near Vienna, a move that threatens the paradise they have created. The first of Kumpfm ller s novels to appear in English after his acclaimed The Adventures of a Bed Salesman, The Glory of Life is a meticulously researched and poignant portrait of one of the most enduring authors in world literature. Beautifully crafted, this book is an evocative rumination on the power of love and friendship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j1crDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alternative Economic Models of Transition.(Book Review): An article from: Journal of Economic Issues","description":"Documents the major processes, performance, institutions, problems and policies associated with global political economy.

The final outcome is not yet in full focus, but real progress has been made in the transition to electronic documents providing the aviation industry with a clear direction. This book looks at a combination of industry initiatives and airline successes that point to the next steps that operators can take as they transition to fully integrated information management systems. Although the route has not been fully identified, it is evident that a key to successful long-term efficient information management is industry-wide cooperation. The chapters are authored by a range of experts in operational information management, and collectively, they outline ways that operators can improve efficiency across flight, ground and maintenance operations. Considerations and recommendations are identified and presented addressing the following priorities: Safety-critical information and procedures Human factors Information security Operational information standardization. The readership includes: Airline flight operations managers and standards personnel, Airline operating documents and publication specialists, Airline information managers, Commercial pilots, Airline maintenance managers and personnel, Manufacturers and vendors of aviation products, Aviation regulators and policy makers, Aviation researchers and developers of information technologies, and Military technical publications specialists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KwlBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atonement, Christology And The Trinity: Making Sense Of Christian Doctrine","description":"For many believers today the doctrines of Atonement, Christology and the Trinity seem like puzzling constructions produced by academic theologians. They are cast in unintelligible forms of thought derived from Platonism or from feudal society, and for many their existential relevance for life today remains unclear. This book introduces these doctrines and proposes a reinterpretation in the light of the claim of many Christian mystics that ultimate happiness is to be found in enjoying the loving fellowship of God. This claim is amatrix of faith in terms of which these doctrines are shown to be relevant for the life of faith of believers today. Furthermore, since this matrix can be defended within all three Abrahamic traditions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the proposed understanding of these doctrines can also contribute usefully to the necessary dialogue between these traditions in a globalised world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cVYAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corporate Governance and Chairmanship: A Personal View","description":"The book: discusses and explains the central issuse of corporate governance; provides practical advice to chairmen and directors on their roles and responsibilities; and surveys the major codes of practice that have been developed throughout the 1990s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KhPcr-LPQbIC&dq=Corporate+Governance+and+Chairmanship:+A+Personal+View&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Incarnate: Story Material","description":"An enthralling new work by one of America's foremost experimental writers.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AP Success - World History (Peterson's AP World History)","description":"Provides test-taking strategies, a subject review, and two practice tests.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NQPPwAEACAAJ&dq=AP+Success+-+World+History+(Peterson%27s+AP+World+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trouble Man","description":"A chronicle of the triumphant artistic career and troubled personal life of one of soul music's greatest legends depicts the drug addictions, disturbed relationships, and financial woes that beset Marvin Gaye's life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RCmNQgAACAAJ&dq=Trouble+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deceit (Charnwood Large Print Library Series)","description":"Thriller.

We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook--or even better, creating a startup with the potential to be the next Google or Facebook or Uber. We see software coders becoming millionaires or even billionaires before age 30 and feel we are failing if we are not one of them. But there is good news. A lot of us--most of us--do not explode out of the gates in life. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke), and after graduating, worked as a dishwasher, nightwatchman, and typing temp before finally finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of Forbes magazine. There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains doesn't mature until age 25--and later for some. In fact our brain's capabilities peak at different ages. We actually enjoy multiple periods of blooming in our lives. Based on several years of research, personal experience, and interviews with neuroscientists and psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, Bloom reveals how and when we achieve full potential--and why an algorithmic acuity in math is such an anomaly in terms of career success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-8kEAAAQBAJ&dq=Late+Bloomer:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thanksgiving Day Murder (Christine Bennett Mysteries)","description":"A CELEBRATION OF ABUNDANCE BECOMES A DAY OF LOSS.

Accountants, attorneys, and wealth managers all need to know about these responsibilities. But what, exactly, is meant by the term fiduciary standard? What must advisers do to be sure their procedures meet legal and ethical standards? This book identifies the 27 Prudent Practices, organized under the Five Steps, that were developed by the Foundation for Fiduciary Studies measures that professionals can take to demonstrate that they accept, understand, and are fulfilling the role of a fiduciary. Financial advisers and others offering investment advice will add meaningful value to their practice and show tangible evidence of what sets them apart from the pack. Attorneys, CPAs, and others serving as trustees will possess the knowledge to determine whether or not their clients  investment portfolios are being managed appropriately. Plan sponsors will know what to look for in selecting investment consultants and in giving employees the disclosures and information they need. The most far-reaching trend in the financial-advisory business today is the move toward a fiduciary standard of care. This book establishes for the industry a credible investment-decision process that will meet the growing expectations of investors and regulators for integrity, transparency, and disclosure of fees and conflicts that affect their returns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jaoN0Hjc0d4C&dq=New+Fiduciary+Standard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Control of Nature (Thorndike Core)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lw85AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FireWire System Architecture: IEEE 1394A (2nd Edition)","description":"FireWire (IEEE 1394) is an emerging technology that provides high-speed serial bus communications.

It's a perfectly typical day for Lowell Mitchell at her perfectly ordinary university in Massachusetts. She goes to class, chats with friends, and retires to her dorm room. Everything is normal until suddenly it's not in the blink of an eye, Lowell is gone. Facts are everything for Police Chief Frank Ford. He's a small-town cop, and he knows only hard evidence and thorough procedure will lead him to the truth. Together with the wise-cracking officer Burt Cameron, the grizzled chief will deal with the distraught family, chase dead-end leads, interrogate shady witnesses, and spend late nights ruminating over black coffee and cigars. Everyone tells him what a good, responsible girl Lowell is. But Ford believes that Lowell had a secret and that if he can discover it, this case will crack wide open. Considered one of the first-ever police procedurals and hailed as an American mystery milestone, Last Seen Wearing based on a true story builds suspense through its accurate portrayal of an official police investigation. Hillary Waugh, who earned the title of Grand Master from the Mystery Writers of America, went on to create several memorable series, but this classic crime novel ranks among his finest work. This next installment in the Library of Congress Crime Classics series will keep readers in suspense until the final page.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iO_5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Simple Guide to Marine Aquariums","description":"The Simple Guide to Marine Aquariums covers all aspects of setting up and maintaining marine aquariums.

As the Lipari carried Janine and her family to Casablanca on the first leg of a perilous journey to safety in Cuba, she would read through her tears the farewell letter that Roland had slipped in her pocket:  Whatever the length of our separation, our love will survive it, because it depends on us alone. I give you my vow that whatever the time we must wait, you will be my wife. Never forget, never doubt.  Five years later  her fierce desire to reunite with Roland first obstructed by war and then, in secret, by her father and brother  Janine would build a new life in New York with a dynamic American husband. That his obsession with Ayn Rand tormented their marriage was just one of the reasons she never ceased yearning to reclaim her lost love. Investigative reporter Leslie Maitland grew up enthralled by her mother s accounts of forbidden romance and harrowing flight from the Nazis.

His letters, expertly collected, translated, and edited here by Harvey Sachs, will give readers a new depth of insight into his life and work. As Sachs puts it, they  reveal above all else a man whose psychological perceptions in general and self-knowledge in particular were much more acute than most people have thought likely.

The first generation of trance work, the traditional hypnosis that still holds sway in most places, considers that both the conscious mind and the unconscious mind of the client are, to put it bluntly, idiots. So trance work involves first 'knocking out' the conscious mind and then talking to the unconscious mind like a 2-year old that needs to be told how to behave. Milton Erickson created the second generation of trance work. He approached the unconscious as having creative wisdom and each person as extraordinarily unique. Thus, rather than trying to programme the unconscious with new instructions, Erickson saw trance as an experiential learning state where a person's own creative unconscious could generate healing and transformation. At the same time Erickson, for the most part, carried the same low opinion of the conscious mind. Thus, Ericksonian hypnosis looks to bypass the conscious mind with indirect suggestions and dissociation and depotentiate it with confusion techniques.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DWggBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Strike: Prima's Official Strategy Guide (Command & Conquer, Red Alert 2 & Yuri's Revenge)","description":"In a Time of Modern War, Can You Be a Great Leader?

What was the first inkling? What were the steps and missteps along the way? How was the process experienced by the creative person as it proceeded? And what are the implications for the psychology of the creative process? Each chapter focuses on a specific creative endeavor, situating the work in the context of domain, culture, and historical era. Then it traces the development of the work from what we know of its beginnings to its fulfillment. Qualitative materials interviews, notebooks, diaries, sketches, drafts, and other writings allow a story of the creative process as lived to emerge. The narratives exemplify established concepts in the psychology of creativity, propose broadening some, reveal the need for modification, and suggest new ones. Application of phenomenological frameworks illuminate the episodes in new ways as well. The case study approach proves again that each episode is unique, yet themes and variations come into view when the episodes are considered together in a final reflection. From Darwin s theory to an unusual jazz sound, here are 11 fascinating stories of how specific works took shape. Psychologists, students interested in creativity, and all those intrigued by the process in any creative field will find this book essential reading.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZKdMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ministry of the Shofar","description":"The Shofar is one of the earliest musical instruments known to man.

One of the first Melvilleans to advance what has since become known as the  theory of the two Moby-Dicks,  Olson argues that there were two versions of Moby-Dick, and that Melville s reading King Lear for the first time in between the first and second versions of the book had a profound impact on his conception of the saga:  the first book did not contain Ahab,  writes Olson, and  it may not, except incidentally, have contained Moby-Dick.  If literary critics and reviewers at the time responded with varying degrees of skepticism to the  theory of the two Moby-Dicks,  it was the experimental style and organization of the book that generated the most controversy. Passionate in his poetry, Olson was no less passionate in his reading of Melville. Impatient with what he regarded as traditional forms of literary criticism, Olson engaged his own creativity to write a book as robust, original, and compelling as Melville s masterpiece.  Not only important, but apocalyptic.  New York Herald Tribune  One of the most stimulating essays ever written on Moby-Dick, and for that matter on any piece of literature, and the forces behind it.

But unless we as parents help nurture those talents, our gifted children can become bored, socially aggressive, or, ironically, underachievers in the classroom. Here is a practical, informative, and authoritative primer for raising and educating our gifted children from pre-school to adolescence. Beginning with sensible strategies to determine whether--and in which areas--your child is gifted, this book takes parents through selecting an appropriate day-care center, a school, and a home reference library. It helps us figure out where our role stops and the school's role begins, as well as detailing ways to keep our children's creativity alive and how to cope with sibling rivalry and our own doubts and fears.

The revolutionary developments in tactics and equipment meant that whole divisions could now be inserted behind enemy lines to initiate surprise attacks. However, the risks taken by these brave soldiers, both Allied and Axis, cannot be overstated, with horrific losses suffered by both sides. This book gives an overview of airborne warfare during World War II, looking not at the German, American and British paratroopers involved in the war, covering their recruitment, training, tactics and battle conduct, and the battles they fought. Covering Operation Mercury - the German assault on the island of Crete in 1941 and the first strategic use of airborne forces in history - the tragic British attack on Arnhem in 1944 and the American airborne assault near Utah Beach on D-Day, this book traces the evolution of airborne warfare throughout the war and gives an insight into the experiences of the brave men who dropped into battle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U1hGvgAACAAJ&dq=Combat+general&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crime Brulee (Culinary Food Writer)","description":"Accompanying her husband to an academic conference in New Orleans, food writer Carolyn Blue decides to take the opportunity to write an article on Cajun cuisine, but her trip takes an unexpected turn when he friend Julienne mysteriously vanishes from a dinner party after an argument with her husband.

J. Simpson.","description":"The black man suffering at the hands of whites, the white woman sexually threatened by the black man. Both images have long been burned into the American conscience through popular entertainment, and today they exert a powerful and disturbing influence on Americans' understanding of race. So argues Linda Williams in this boldly inquisitive book, where she probes the bitterly divisive racial sentiments aroused by such recent events as O. J. Simpson's criminal trial. Williams, the author of Hard Core, explores how these images took root, beginning with melodramatic theater, where suffering characters acquire virtue through victimization. The racial sympathies and hostilities that surfaced during the trial of the police in the beating of Rodney King and in the O. J. Simpson murder trial are grounded in the melodramatic forms of Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Birth of a Nation. Williams finds that Stowe's beaten black man and Griffith's endangered white woman appear repeatedly throughout popular entertainment, promoting interracial understanding at one moment, interracial hate at another. The black and white racial melodrama has galvanized emotions and fueled the importance of new media forms, such as serious, \\"integrated\\" musicals of stage and film, including The Jazz Singer and Show Boat. It also helped create a major event out of the movie Gone With the Wind, while enabling television to assume new moral purpose with the broadcast of Roots. Williams demonstrates how such developments converged to make the televised race trial a form of national entertainment. When prosecutor Christopher Darden accused Simpson's defense team of \\"playing the race card,\\" which ultimately trumped his own team's gender card, he feared that the jury's sympathy for a targeted black man would be at the expense of the abused white wife. The jury's verdict, Williams concludes, was determined not so much by facts as by the cultural forces of racial melodrama long in the making. Revealing melodrama to be a key element in American culture, Williams argues that the race images it has promoted are deeply ingrained in our minds and that there can be no honest discussion about race until Americans recognize this predicament.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M4T3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Strategies for Including High School Students","description":"All high school students want to feel they belong and this is particularly true of students labeled emotionally disabled.

Now that she s moved out of the world s most famous bachelor pad and into her own delightfully chaotic world on Kendra as wife to NFL star Hank Baskett and mother to their newborn son, we ve watched her hilarious antics as she adjusts to domestic life. But how much do we really know about the fun-loving star? In this humorous and optimistic, sometimes heartbreaking, but always unfailingly honest memoir, Kendra reveals the highs and lows of her extraordinary journey. She wasn t always the quintessential girl next door. Before she was a reality television superstar, Hugh Hefner s girlfriend, or one of the most popular Playboy cover models ever, Kendra was an athletic tomboy whose father walked out on her family when she was a little girl. She grew into a rebellious teenager with a serious drug habit before she quit cold turkey and beat the odds to graduate from a high school that almost didn t give her a second (or third, or fourth) chance. Following her rocky teenage years, an out-of-the- blue phone call from Hugh Hefner changed everything. Kendra dishes candidly about life in the Playboy Mansion: the sex, the parties, the show, and even her relationships with her Girls Next Door costars Hef, Holly, and Bridget. She tells the true story about how she and Hank met and built a relationship in secret while she was still Hef s girl- friend and a public face of Playboy. Finally, she reflects on the slew of unexpected changes in the short space of a year that have brought her sliding into home from Playboy party girl to wife and mother with a blooming Hollywood career. If you think you ve seen all of Kendra, think again. She s only warming up. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zF6v7bX__SQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Utopistics: Or Historical Choices of the Twenty-First Century","description":"The founder of world-systems analysis explores what we can expect in the twenty-first century. The twentieth century has witnessed both the triumphs and failures of the dreams that have informed the modern world. In Utopistics, Immanuel Wallerstein argues that the global order that nourished those dreams is on the brink of disintegration. Pointing to the globalization of commerce, the changing nature of work and the family, the failures of traditional liberal ideology, and the danger of profound environmental crises, the founder of world-systems analysis argues that the nation-state system no longer works. The next twenty-five to fifty years will see the final breakdown of that system, and a time of great conflicts and disorder. It will also be a period in which individual and collective action will have a greater impact on the future than has been possible for 500 years. Utopistics distills Wallerstein's hugely influential work on the modern world-system in an accessible way. This fascinating and provocative look into our collective political destiny poses urgent questions for anyone concerned with social change in the next millennium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bP9qQgAACAAJ&dq=Utopistics:+Or+Historical+Choices+of+the+Twenty-First+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Understanding Calculus Concepts","description":"Confusing Textbooks?

Importantly, this guidance emphasizes the need for differentiated approaches to care for people who are established on ART, such as reduced frequency of clinic visits, use of multi-month drug dispensing and implementation of community ART distribution. The adoption of these efficiencies is essential to improve the quality of care of people receiving treatment and reduce the burden on health facilities, particularly in resource limited settings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vItUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excel Annoyances: How to Fix the Most Annoying Things about Your Favorite Spreadsheet","description":"A guide to handling a vareity of quirks, bugs, and hidden features found in Microsoft Excel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ac3PVZhcQSoC&dq=Excel+Annoyances:+How+to+Fix+the+Most+Annoying+Things+about+Your+Favorite+Spreadsheet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Magic for Writers","description":"Shows you how to boost the success potential of your writing project, whether an article, speech, story, book, play, or advertising, by elevating and energizing - charging up - the language in which it is written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3WLqPQAACAAJ&dq=Word+Magic+for+Writers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When No One Understands: Letters to a Teenager on Life, Loss, and the Hard Road to Adulthood","description":"When Amanda first came to Dr. Sachs for treatment, she had attempted suicide more than once. Withdrawn and cynical, she refused to speak during her therapy sessions. Determined to connect, Dr. Sachs tried something unconventional: he wrote letters to Amanda between sessions and invited her to write back, thinking she might feel more comfortable opening up in this way and indeed she did. This correspondence gradually built trust between them, helping her to survive and ultimately to heal. When No One Understands consists of twenty letters that Dr. Sachs wrote to Amanda over the course of her therapy. In these letters, Sachs reaches out to Amanda with the core message that there is nothing wrong with her that adolescence is painful, complex, and challenging for everyone and that her emotional pain deserves to be honored, openly explored, and viewed with compassion. Dr. Sachs also addresses many of the common questions and concerns shared by all teens on such topics as relationships, breakups, drugs and alcohol, parents, family dynamics, and more. Along the way, Dr. Sachs offers adults an inspiring image of a truly open, human-to-human relationship between an adult and a teenager. Parents, mental health professionals, guidance counselors, educators, and others who work with teens will see how they might also bring honesty, compassion, and humility to bear in their interactions with young people in order to create truly healing and supportive relationships.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z2Q_2nHG7RUC&dq=When+No+One+Understands:+Letters+to+a+Teenager+on+Life,+Loss,+and+the+Hard+Road+to+Adulthood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emotional Rescue: The Theory and Practice of a Feminist Father (Thinking Gender)","description":"This text examines feminist mothering theory and psychoanalytic theories of narcissism.

Here is Fenton s 1967 biography, back in print, as a wonderful source for a new generation of readers.

As I finish the book, I feel I have succeeded.\\"-George Soros from the Preface Critical praise for Soros on Soros \\"If you have ever wanted to sit down for a candid conversation with a phenomenal financial success, George Soros's book provides the opportunity. You will meet a complex man and a first-rate mind.\\"-Henry A. Kissinger \\"The best expert on Soros is undoubtedly George Soros! After all, who is better equipped to tell us what he really thinks and how he thinks, a matter of some importance given the fact that he has translated a remarkable personal financial success into a truly generous and historically significant effort to promote postcommunist democracy.\\" -Zbigniew Brzezinski \\"The best X-ray of the mind of the master yet.\\" -Barton M. Biggs \\"George Soros brings a lot more to the world of finance than the intuition and nerve of a born trader-and in Soros on Soros he's no longer bashful about telling us about it. A philosopher at heart, George attributes his success at investing to a theory of the interaction of reality and human perception. What really drives the man now, with a personal fortune beyond all personal need, is a different kind of strategic investing-investment to build in Eastern Europe the kind of open societies he came to value in his own life.\\" -Paul A. Volcker Financial guru George Soros is one of the most colorful and intriguing figures in the financial world today. Now in Soros on Soros, readers are given their most intimate and revealing look yet into the life and mind of the one BusinessWeek dubbed, \\"The Man Who Moves Markets.\\" Soros on Soros interweaves financial theory and personal reminiscence, political analysis and moral reflection to offer a compelling portrait of the world (and its markets) according to Soros. In an interview-style narrative with Byron Wien, Managing Director at Morgan Stanley, and with German journalist Krisztina Koenen, Soros vividly describes the genesis of his brilliant financial career and shares his views on investing and global finance, politics and the emerging world order, and the responsibility of power. Speaking with remarkable candor, he traces his progress from Holocaust survivor to philosophy student, unsuccessful tobacco salesman to the world's most powerful and profitable trader and introduces us to the people and events that helped shape his character and his often controversial views. In describing the investment theories and financial strategies that have made him \\"a superstar among money managers\\" (The New York Times), Soros tells the fascinating story of the phenomenally successful Soros Fund Management and its $12 billion flagship, Quantum Fund. He also offers fresh insights into some of his most sensational wins and losses, including a firsthand account of the $1 billion he made going up against the British pound and the fortune he lost speculating on the yen. Plus: Soros's take on the devaluation of the peso and currency fluctuations internationally. He tells of the personal and professional crises that more than once threatened to destroy him and of the personal resources he drew upon to turn defeat into resounding victory. And he explains his motivations for establishing the Soros Foundation and the Open Society Institute through which he worked to build open societies in postcommunist countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Finally, turning his attention to international politics, Soros offers keen insights into the current state of affairs in Russia and the former communist bloc countries and analyzes the reasons behind and likely consequences of the West's failure to properly integrate them into the free world. He also explores the crisis of the ERM and analyzes the pros and cons of investing in a number of emerging markets. Find out what makes one of the greatest financial wizards of this or any age tick. Soros on Soros is a must read for anyone interested in world finance and international policy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h2GuJ0xnhFUC&dq=Soros+on+Soros:+Staying+Ahead+of+the+Curve&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The critique of judgement,","description":"Kant's Critique of Judgement analyses our experience of the beautiful and the sublime in relation to nature, morality, and theology.

In contrast to the infamous violence and rage of forced school busing within the city in the 1970s, METCO has quietly and calmly promoted school integration. How has this program affected the lives of its graduates? Would they choose to participate if they had it to do over again? Would they place their own children on the bus to suburbia? Sixty-five METCO graduates vividly recall their own stories in this revealing book. Susan E. Eaton interviewed program participants who are now adults, asking them to assess the benefits and hardships of crossing racial and class lines on their way to school. Their answers poignantly show that this type of racial integration is not easy-they struggled to negotiate both black and white worlds, often feeling fully accepted in neither. Even so, nearly all the participants believe the long-term gains outweighed the costs and would choose a similar program for their own children-though not without conditions and apprehensions. Even as courts and policymakers today are forcing the abandonment of desegregation, educators warn that students are better prepared in schools that reflect our national diversity. This book offers an accessible and moving account of a rare program that, despite serious challenges, provides a practical remedy for the persistent inequalities in American education.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Bx4rrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Other+Boston+Busing+Story:+What%60s+Won+and+Lost+Across+the+Boundary+Line&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"2DO Before I Die : The Do-It-Yourself Guide to the Rest of Your Life","description":"What's on your list?

Mori, who studied fashion in Tokyo and art in London and New York, has become one of the freshest young artists working in the '90s, and this book, which is the first on her work, comprehensively catalogs her upcoming exhibitions. Recent video work by Mori has included such works as Nirvana (shown at the '97 Venice Biennale), in which the artist depicts herself making symbolic Buddhist hand-gestures as she floats above the Dead Sea. Still another piece is a video in which Mori, in futuristic space wear, rolls a crystal ball through an airport to the haunting melodies of a Japanese song. These works involve a surrealistic interplay of imagery which suggests something akin to the art of Yayoi Kusama, the costs of funk icon George Clinton, science fiction, and the film works of Matthew Barney.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3XJQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Mariko+Mori&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"METAMORPHOSES","description":"The modern, unacademic idiom of A.D.

Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profound as it is playful. In this groundbreaking novel, an influential favorite among a new generation of writers, Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity. Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . . Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history. But the story doesn t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky. As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon. Praise for Cloud Atlas  [David] Mitchell is, clearly, a genius. He writes as though at the helm of some perpetual dream machine, can evidently do anything, and his ambition is written in magma across this novel s every page.  The New York Times Book Review  One of those how-the-holy-hell-did-he-do-it? modern classics that no doubt is and should be read by any student of contemporary literature.  Dave Eggers  Wildly entertaining . . . a head rush, both action-packed and chillingly ruminative.  People  The novel as series of nested dolls or Chinese boxes, a puzzle-book, and yet not just dazzling, amusing, or clever but heartbreaking and passionate, too. I ve never read anything quite like it, and I m grateful to have lived, for a while, in all its many worlds.  Michael Chabon  Cloud Atlas ought to make [Mitchell] famous on both sides of the Atlantic as a writer whose fearlessness is matched by his talent.  The Washington Post Book World  Thrilling . . . One of the biggest joys in Cloud Atlas is watching Mitchell sashay from genre to genre without a hitch in his dance step.  Boston Sunday Globe  Grand and elaborate . . .

One of the most common criticisms of the U.S. plan to invade Iraq in 2003 is that too few troops were used. The argument often fails to satisfy anyone for there is no standard against which to judge. A figure of 20 troops per 1000 of the local population is often mentioned as the standard, but as McGrath shows, that figure was arrived at with some questionable assumptions. By analyzing seven military operations from the last 100 years, he arrives at an average number of military forces per 1000 of the population that have been employed in what would generally be considered successful military campaigns. He also points out a variety of important factors affecting those numbers-from geography to local forces employed to supplement soldiers on the battlefield, to the use of contractors-among others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HFeEPhDZl6oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robots: From Science Fiction to Technological Revolution","description":"Presents an overview of the history of the robot, culled from interviews with experts such as scientists, surgeons, manufactures, science fiction writers, artists, filmmakers, and provides information on the role they play in daily life and speculates on their future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PqQeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Robots:+From+Science+Fiction+to+Technological+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holy Spirit: His Gifts and Power","description":"Part of the contemporary value of Owen's work lies in the way it gives us biblical teaching and principles that can be applied to what we observe in the life of churches today.

The first part of the book explores the minimal role that judicial intervention played for much of the twentieth century in public utility industries and how deregulation presents fresh opportunities and challenges for public law. The second part of the book explores the role of public law in a deregulatory environment, focusing on the positive and negative incentives it creates for the behavior of private stakeholders and public institutions in a bargaining-focused political process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Vmdy7t0dnq4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Social Ladder","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cZgsAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing the Laboratory Notebook (American Chemical Society Publication)","description":"Describes in general how scientists can use handwritten research notebooks as a tool to record their research in progress, and in particular the legal protocols for industrial scientists to handwrite their research in progress so they can establish priority of invention in case a patent suit arises.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GGhQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Writing+the+Laboratory+Notebook+(American+Chemical+Society+Publication)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Office Ladies/Factory Women: Life and Work at a Japanese Company","description":"First Published in 1990.

After getting mugged on vacation, in what she will always think of as the Paris Incident, she decides to find out. Agatha soon learns that running her own detective agency in the Cotswolds is not quite like starring in a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of dames in distress with big shoulder pads, her clients are ladies with missing cats and a man whose son has run off with his car. Agatha even worries that she might be outclassed by her sixty-seven-year-old secretary, Emma Comfrey. But then wealthy divorc e Catherine Laggat-Brown walks in with their first \\"real\\" case. Mrs. Laggat-Brown's daughter has received a death threat, and when Agatha thwarts an attack on the girl at a dinner dance, she recognizes an opportunity to show what Raisin Investigations can do. Even better, the case gives her a chance to reunite with her long-absent friend, Sir Charles Fraith. As they scour the Cotswolds in search of leads, Charles' insights prove invaluable and his charms irresistible, leading poor Emma to fall madly in love with him. As ever, Agatha bumbles her way through the case, trying her friends' patience and flirting shamelessly with the chief suspect.

He wears a suit and tie; he has an office on Wall Street and another one in Los Angeles . . . and he sold his first business at the age of 14 for more than a million dollars. He invested that money in a partnership with Inner City Broadcasting, one of the most prominent African-American owned businesses in the country, and now is heading the relaunch of their signature magazine, InnerCity. According to People magazine, Farrah is the only African-American teenager to rise from public assistance to a business mogul without being in entertainment or having a family connection. Reallionaire tells Farrah s extraordinary and touching story. When he was just six, Farrah s mother became seriously ill, prompting his decision to provide for this family, and he spent the first $50 he ever made taking them for a real sit-down dinner. At the age of eight, he founded his first business club. By fourteen, with a million dollars in his pocket, Farrah was well on his way to business success. Each stage of Farrah s progress is marked by one of the principles of success he learned along the way, creating not just an extraordinary story but also a step-by-step primer for others to create success in their own lives with honor; charity and compassion. In the tradition of great motivators and leaders, this is both an instructional book and a story to inspire others to live life to the fullest.

Also inhabited by a sturdy race of generous people no taller than the average table, the realm is surrounded by a forest occupied by friendly bears.

Young seminarians who were studying for the priesthood during that time were profoundly affected by the radical changes initiated by Pope John XXIII and also by the often- virulent opposition from other members of the hierarchy. Confessions of a Serial Celibate is the account of one such seminarian whose life was profoundly transformed during those turbulent days. With poignant wit and honesty, the author describes his sometimes painful journey of faith, from the security of rules and dogma, to the ambiguities of social concern, and eventually to the freedom of laughter and detachment. Central to this journey is the author's gradual recognition of what he calls the \\"Catholic Operating System,\\" that underlying behavioral program which has determined the thoughts and actions of Catholics for the last seventeen hundred years. Anyone who has begun to perceive a discrepancy between organized religion and his or her own spiritual values will find Confessions of a Serial Celibate a stimulating and enjoyable read.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5AajmAEACAAJ&dq=Las+Vegas+Rite:+The+Coyoteman+Chronicles+-+Book+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who Killed Mona Lisa?

His approach frees them to discover acceptance of themselves and of their children. The ages twelve to eighteen are often the most challenging and trying years for adolescentsand their parents. No other phase of life is characterized by so much physical and psychological change happening so quickly. And frequently the child parents had loved and understood becomes a teenager they hardly recognizethe child who loved music grows into a teen who wants to play video games rather than the piano; or the little girl who loved dolls becomes a teen who loves staying out with her older, rebellious boyfriend. The Good Enough Teen, however, shows you how to see your child's evolution as a window of opportunityfor you, for your child, and for your entire family. Rather than having you brace for your offspring's adolescence with your eyes shut and your jaw clenched, this book will help you to understand the invisible transformation teens are experiencing, as well as the ways in which your own adolescence intimately influences this understanding. You will find yourself better able to see even your child's most exasperating behaviours as steps in his or her striving towards maturity, rather than chronic problems or meanspirited efforts designed to make you miserable. The Good Enough Teen presents a developmental overview of what parents can expect from their children during adolescence, then delineates the five stages in the journey towards accepting a child for who he or she is. With prescriptive tools and strategies for parents, including checklists, quizzes, and exercises, and numerous case studies from the author's own practice, The Good Enough Teen is vital help for any parent with a teenager.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=85dNk0JL-vYC&dq=The+Good+Enough+Teen:+Raising+Adolescents+with+Love+and+Acceptance+(Despite+How+Impossible+They+Can+Be)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bushwhacked","description":"A simultaneously rollicking and sobering indictment of the policies of President George W.

In his  most accomplished work to date  (Los Angeles Times), master of historical fiction Robert Harris lures readers back in time to the compelling life of Roman Senator Marcus Cicero. The re-creation of a vanished biography written by his household slave and righthand man, Tiro, Imperium follows Cicero s extraordinary struggle to attain supreme power in Rome. On a cold November morning, Tiro opens the door to find a terrified, bedraggled stranger begging for help. Once a Sicilian aristocrat, the man was robbed by the corrupt Roman governor, Verres, who is now trying to convict him under false pretenses and sentence him to a violent death.

In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America--addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland. With a great reporter's narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma's campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive--extremely addictive--miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin--cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico's west coast, independent of any drug cartel--assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico. Introducing a memorable cast of characters--pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents--Quinones shows how these tales fit together. Dreamland is a revelatory account of the corrosive threat facing America and its heartland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=blSIDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dreamland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foreign Language Teacher's Internet Yearbook","description":"Educators, professionalism and politics offers ways of understanding how and with what consequences national systems of education and the work of education professionals are being reregulated in the context of contemporary global transitions. Globalization does not just create transnational organizations, relations and practices; it also transforms nation-states by creating more complex education spaces that impinge on the work of educators and the learning that they enable, globally, nationally and locally. This volume of the World Yearbook of Education focuses firmly on the educators themselves. It documents the way educators encounter and renegotiate ideas and practices that travel globally as they seek to enact their established professional projects. This framing recognises that educators  spaces, work and identities are historically anchored in national institutional trajectories, but are both disturbed and renewed as globally mobile ideas and practices \\"touch down\\" within national systems of education. The chapters examine the effect of global transitions on educators and education, and offers new perspectives on educational work in different parts of the world today. They challenge bleak assessments of teacher de-professionalization and idealistic narratives about professional development. Chapters highlight the significance of educators  occupational boundary work and the resources and networks they mobilize through their professional projects as they make and remake education in national spaces. The volume tracks: Re-regulatory trajectories evident in national education spaces and their impact on educators; The way educators renegotiate globally mobile ideas, practices and national institutional trajectories, as they mediate global formations emerging in the national space; and The kinds of mediations and resources that enable education professionals to engage with the politics of professionalization. This volume of The World Yearbook of Education will be of great interest to Education researchers, graduate students, teacher educators and education policy-makers.

Emphasizing spirituality as a unifying factor, the author states: \\"If spirituality were practiced sincerely, one would rise above all religious barriers, expanding the Self to embrace all humanity, even all creation. Religiosity divides, spirituality unites.\\" Building a Noble World is not just a book about spirituality. It is about practical life. It includes topics such as how to stop terrorism, the reformation of the United Nations, the unification of the Indian subcontinent, a solution to the Kashmir issue, Tibet?s spiritual link with India, the author?s own experience of shaktipat, and the science of yoga.

Mr. Barton, a curate, with an income of eighty pounds a-year, with an angelic but sickly wife and a host of hungry little children, allows himself to be duped by the title of a 'Countess Czerlaski,' the handsome English widow of a Polish dancing-master. The countess quarrels with her brother, Mr. Bridmain, and throws herself on the hospitality of the Bartons. Her visit lasts beyond all reasonable time, the unfortunate couple are eaten up by the expense of providing for her, Mr. Barton's character is aspersed on account of his kindness to her, and Mrs. Barton dies of working for her. Mr. Barton loses his curacy, goes into another neighbourhood, and, after many years, revisits his wife's grave in company with his children. The next story tells how the Rev. Maynard Gilfil loved Tina Sarti, an Italian orphan, who had been brought to England by Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel, and lived under their shadow in a dignified country house.

Insisting that they were truly representative of the race's potential, black elites espoused an ethos of self-help and service to the black masses and distinguished themselves from the black majority as agents of civilization; hence the phrase 'uplifting the race.' A central assumption of racial uplift ideology was that African Americans' material and moral progress would diminish white racism. But Kevin Gaines argues that, in its emphasis on class distinctions and patriarchal authority, racial uplift ideology was tied to pejorative notions of racial pathology and thus was limited as a force against white prejudice. Drawing on the work of W. E. B. Du Bois, Anna Julia Cooper, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Hubert H. Harrison, and others, Gaines focuses on the intersections between race and gender in both racial uplift ideology and black nationalist thought, showing that the meaning of uplift was intensely contested even among those who shared its aims. Ultimately, elite conceptions of the ideology retreated from more democratic visions of uplift as social advancement, leaving a legacy that narrows our conceptions of rights, citizenship, and social justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BYYLBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russia's Japan Expedition of 1852 to 1855","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZeI0AQAAIAAJ&dq=Russia%27s+Japan+Expedition+of+1852+to+1855&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A short history of ethics (Fields of philosophy)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C5z8vwEACAAJ&dq=A+short+history+of+ethics+(Fields+of+philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terry and the Pirates: Raven - No. 14","description":"Collects the complete run of the newspaper adventure strip which made its debut in November 1934 and continued for twelve years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tCdLAQAAIAAJ&dq=Terry+and+the+Pirates:+Raven+-+No.+14&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trucks Board Book","description":"The tow trucks, cement trucks, and newspaper delivery trucks pictured here all help people and will fascinate small children.

However, infancy, the pregnant body and motherhood continue to be marginalised. This book will focus on the mother-infant relationship and the variable constructions of this dyad across cultures, including conceptualisations of the pregnant body, the beginnings of life, and implications for health. This is particularly topical because there is a burgeoning awareness within anthropology regarding the centrality of mother-infant interactions for understanding the evolution of our species, infant and maternal health and care strategies, epigenetic change, and biological and social development. This book will bring together cultural and biological anthropologists and archaeologists to examine the infant-maternal interface in past societies. It will showcase innovative theoretical and methodological approaches towards understanding societal constructions of foetal, infant and maternal bodies. It will emphasise their interconnectivity and will explore the broader significance of the mother/infant nexus for overall population well-being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TDy5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The flagship: The M.I.T.

[that] reads like a novel  (best-selling author Margaret Atwood via Twitter). When her elderly mother is hospitalized unexpectedly, Vicki Laveau-Harvie and her sister travel to their parents' ranch home in Alberta, Canada, to help their father. Estranged from their parents for many years, they are horrified by what they discover on their arrival. For years their mother has camouflaged her manic delusions and savage unpredictability, and over the decades she has managed to shut herself and her husband away from the outside world, systematically starving him and making him a virtual prisoner in his own home. Rearranging their lives to be the daughters they were never allowed to be, the sisters focus their efforts on helping their father cope with the unending manipulations of their mother and encounter all the pressures that come with caring for elderly parents. And at every step they have to contend with their mother, whose favorite phrase during their childhood was: \\"I'll get you and you won't even know I'm doing it.\\" Set against the natural world of the Canadian foothills (\\"in winter the cold will kill you, nothing personal\\"), this memoir at once dark and hopeful shatters precedents about grief, anger, and family trauma with surprising tenderness and humor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Nw6xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Algebra and Trigonometry","description":"This classic in the series of highly respected Swokowski/Cole mathematics texts retains the elements that have made it so popular with instructors and students alike: it is clearly written, the time-tested exercise sets feature a variety of applications, its exposition is clear, its uncluttered layout is appealing, and the difficulty level of problems is appropriate and consistent.

If I Ever Get Back to Georgia, I'm Gonna Nail My Feet to the Ground is all about that anger, that great humor and that even greater passion for something that affects every single one of us: the daily newspaper. Grizzard begins with his first writing job (covering a Boy's Church League team in Newman, Georgia), and continues through his college years in Athens, Georgia where he learned how to do such things as prepare a font-page headline and layout in case Jesus Christ ever returned to earth. (Headline: HE'S BACK ) He examines the great Atlanta years and the cold Chicago winters--as sports editor of the Sun-Times, during which Grizzard lost his second wife, his cool, and very nearly his sanity, but also learned an awful lot about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It is also a symbol of Old World craftsmanship combined with American capitalism, of technological innovation, and of remarkable family management. This authoritative and entertaining book tells the story of the Steinway piano company and the people behind it. The first book based on the rich archive of Steinway business and family papers at LaGuardia Community College in New York, as well as on interviews with family members and company employees in the United States, Germany, and England, Steinway & Sons describes the making and marketing of an American cultural icon. Founded in New York in 1853 by a German immigrant, the Steinway company quickly rose to prominence on the strength of the distinctive \\"Steinway sound.\\" For five generations Steinways steered their company in the face of vigorous domestic and foreign competition, bitter labor disputes, temperamental musicians, a fluctuating economy, and wars. Members of the Gilded Age elite, the family also contended with adultery, alcoholism, emotional depression, and long court battles over money. Lieberman discusses the company town the Steinways built in Queens in the 1870s to \\"escape the machinations of the anarchists and socialists\\" in the city; the decision to manufacture in both New York and Hamburg, which led to Steinway factories supplying both sides in World War II; the improvements in piano technology that made the Steinway the envy of other piano makers; the company's creative marketing techniques, such as booking celebrated European pianists into American concert halls; the competition from the Japanese-owned Yamaha company; and the sale of the financially troubled company to CBS in 1972. Weaving together themes from social, music, business, labor, and immigrant history, and lavishly illustrated with pictures from the Steinway archive, Steinway & Sons is a rich narrative that casts new light on American cultural history and on a unique family enterprise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vJqCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Sixth Edition, Vol. 2/Wuthering Heights","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cymberline (The Arden Edition Of The Works Of William Shakespeare)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qiy0tAEACAAJ&dq=Cymberline+(The+Arden+Edition+Of+The+Works+Of+William+Shakespeare)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Learn to Meditate: A Practical Guide to Self-Discovery and Fulfillment","description":"Meditation paves the road to a calmer, more focused mind; improved concentration; greater creativity; and a more energized mental and physical state of being.

In fact, it encompassed a much broader range of competition between the Soviet Union and the United States that affected everything from military technology to successfully launching satellites that could land on Mars or orbit other planets in the Solar System. Moreover, the notion that America \\"won\\" the Space Race at the end of the 1960s overlooks just how competitive the Space Race actually was in launching people into orbit, as well as the major contributions the Space Race influenced in leading to today's International Space Station and continued space exploration. The Apollo space program is the most famous and celebrated in American history, but the first successful landing of men on the Moon during Apollo 11 had complicated roots dating back over a decade, and it also involved one of NASA's most infamous tragedies. Landing on the Moon presented an ideal goal all on its own, but the government's urgency in designing the Apollo program was actually brought about by the Soviet Union, which spent much of the 1950s leaving the United States in its dust (and rocket fuel). In 1957, at a time when people were concerned about communism and nuclear war, many Americans were dismayed by news that the Soviet Union was successfully launching satellites into orbit. At the same time, America would begin missions to the Moon as early as 1958. On March 27, 1958, Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy announced a lunar project for the International Geophysical Year, consisting of three Air Force launches followed by two Army launches of a JPL-designed lunar probe. ARPA directed the Air Force to launch its probes \\"as soon as possible consistent with the requirement that a minimal amount of useful data concerning the Moon be obtained.\\" Throughout the 1960s, NASA would spend tens of billions on missions to the Moon, the most expensive peacetime program in American history to that point, and Apollo was only made possible by the tests conducted through earlier missions, including the historic Ranger Program. Conceived as an early part of the attempt to land a man on the Moon, Ranger was designed to photograph the lunar surface in preparation for future landings. Until Ranger, images of the Moon were only available through Earth-based telescopes, which lacked the detail necessary to determine safe sites for landing a spacecraft. Ranger aimed to fill in that gap of knowledge, and like many of NASA's missions during the 1960s, the program exemplified both the successes and the failures of the agency's early years. Nonetheless, the Ranger Program would set important precedents by taking the first close-up photos of the Moon and landing the first American spacecraft on the lunar surface.Subsequently, between May 1966 and January 1968, the Surveyor Program launched seven unmanned spacecraft to the lunar surface to gather data and test the feasibility of landing a manned vehicle on the Moon. Although largely forgotten now, without these missions the later series of manned Moon landings would not have been possible. The Moon Missions Before Apollo: The History of NASA's Pioneer, Ranger, and Surveyor Programs examines the origins behind the missions, the space probes involved, and the historic results. Along with pictures of important people, places, and events, you will learn about the programs like never before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kSDAzQEACAAJ&dq=America%27s+First+Moon+Landings+:+Surveyor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The action approach","description":"This book describes the reasoned action approach, an integrative framework for the prediction and change of human social behavior.

For the next nine months he and his companion, Gustave de Beaumont, traveled and observed not only prisons but also the political, economic, and social systems of the early republic. Along the way, they frequently reported back to friends and family members in France. This book presents the first translation of the complete letters Tocqueville wrote during that seminal journey, accompanied by excerpts from Beaumont s correspondence that provide details or different perspectives on the places, people, and American life and attitudes the travelers encountered. These delightful letters provide an intimate portrait of the complicated, talented Tocqueville, who opened himself without prejudice to the world of Jacksonian America. Moreover, they contain many of the impressions and ideas that served as preliminary sketches for Democracy in America, his classic account of the American democratic system that remains an important reference work to this day. Accessible, witty, and charming, the letters Tocqueville penned while in America are of major interest to general readers, scholars, and students alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uoGZegKdijgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Europe: a second time around;: An informal guide to selected places you may have missed on your first trip","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4-0GAAACAAJ&dq=Europe:+a+second+time+around%3B:+An+informal+guide+to+selected+places+you+may+have+missed+on+your+first+trip&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computer Organization and the MC68000","description":"Uses the MC68000 microprocessor as a model to introduce the principles of computer organization and assembly language programming","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0pEkAQAAIAAJ&dq=Computer+Organization+and+the+MC68000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flirting With Danger (Arabesque)","description":"Gorgeous fashion model Monique Savard is determined to discover the truth behind her mother's unsolved murder and unwillingly joins forces with powerful attorney Khamil Jordan, a man who she is convinced is a shallow playboy, and as they plunge into the dangerous secrets of the past, an undeniable passion rages between them.

The years following his passing have seen the publication of numerous books, both sacred and profane, which examine his life and work, but the best, and only, up-close-and-personal account of the man and his music remains the original: Nigey Lennon s Being Frank: My Time with Frank Zappa. Musician/author Lennon maintained a personal and professional relationship with Zappa during the period which is generally agreed to have been the composer s most creative, and she invests her recollections with considerable musical and emotional insight. The fact that Lennon is an accomplished musician and composer in her own right enables her to perceptively analyze Zappa's complex music, and her previous experience as a biographer of Mark Twain and Alfred Jarry is evident as she examines the complex conditions of Zappa's turbulent life. But above all, Being Frank is simply a great read: filled with wry humor, poignancy, and, of course, a plethora of the juicy road stories that Zappa himself didn't dare to include in his own autobiography. The e-book edition of Being Frank is certain to find a new audience for this classic title, which has been in great demand since its third print run sold out several years ago.  Irreplaceable...is the word to describe Being Frank...[Lennon's] memoir is both spiky and musically literate...Lennon s previous books were on Mark Twain and Alfred Jarry, which indicates the kind of cultural perspective required to get a grip on Zappa: something brighter than rock-journo pedantry.

Ninety days to come to terms with a diagnosis that is unfair, unexpected, and completely unpronounceable. Focusing on the positives (she won't have to go on in a world without Bowie or Maya Angelou; she won't get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's like her parents, or have teeth that flop out at the mere mention of the word apple), Jennifer realizes she only has one real regret: the relationships she's lost. Rather than running off to complete a frantic bucket list, Jennifer chooses to stay put and write a letter to the three most significant people in her life, to say the things she wished she'd said before but never dared: her overbearing, selfish sister, her jelly-spined, cheating ex-husband, and her charming, unreliable ex-boyfriend--and finally tell them the truth. At first, Jennifer feels cleansed by her catharsis. Liberated, even. Her ex-boyfriend rushes to her side and she even starts to build bridges with her sister Isabelle (that is, once Isabelle's confirmed that Jennifer's condition isn't genetic). But once you start telling the truth, it's hard to stop. And as Jennifer soon discovers, the truth isn't always as straightforward as it seems, and death has a way of surprising you....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c4juDwAAQBAJ&dq=Endings,+a+book+about+death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sol Lewitt: Bands Of Color","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sDABPwAACAAJ&dq=Sol+Lewitt:+Bands+Of+Color&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rags (The New American Musical) (Broadway Selections)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-EIAQAAMAAJ&dq=Rags+(The+New+American+Musical)+(Broadway+Selections)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tirant Lo Blanc","description":"First published in the Catalan language in Valencia in 1490, Tirant lo Blanc (\\"The White Tyrant\\") is a sweeping epic of chivalry and high adventure.

How has the psychology of investing changed and not changed over the last five hundred years? In Devil Take the Hindmost, Edward Chancellor traces the origins of the speculative spirit back to ancient Rome and chronicles its revival in the modern world: from the tulip scandal of 1630s Holland, to  stockjobbing  in London's Exchange Alley, to the infamous South Sea Bubble of 1720, which prompted Sir Isaac Newton to comment,  I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.

She discusses how the work she is doing in the Senate is helping children and looks at where America has been successful, improvements in the foster care system and support for adoption, and where there is still work to be done, providing pre-school programmes and universal health care to all our children.

All too often, subordinates spin the truth for those above while bosses fail to establish the conditions required for subordinates to tell it to them straight. The end result is warped communication, corrupt internal politics, illusionary teamwork, pass-the-buck accountability, and personal dispiriting-and the company is always the big loser. Don't Kill the Bosses! reveals the \\"trap\\" created when people fail to differentiate between the positives of hierarchical structure and the negatives of hierarchical relationships. Far from being opposed to hierarchy, the authors believe strongly that an accurate and cleanly defined organization chart is vital. But they show how to implement an alternative model of hierarchy: two-sided accountability. Drawing on case studies from their consulting practice, Culbert and Ullmen show how this new model leads to a freer flow of information, more creative problem-solving, and quicker response to changing conditions. Unlike other books that acknowledge boss/subordinate relationships as a systematic, continuing problem and offer skill development suggestions for dealing with it, Don't Kill the Bosses! tells how to think about the problem in a way that will enable readers to understand the steps they need to take to change things. It diagnoses what's missing in boss/subordinate relationships, connects what's wrong with them to personal and organizational outcomes, and defines the whole new mentality required to make them work successfully.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2_ahNgXPLfoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Waves","description":"She always wanted to belong...just not to a dysfunctional pirate crew Juli has trouble fitting in, though she'd prefer to keep the reasons to herself.

Major events of the past year include the PRC leadership transition, the Wukan protests over land expropriation, the negotiations that allowed legal advocate Chen Guangcheng to leave China, and the Tibetan selfimmolations. Ongoing human rights problems include excessive use of force by public security forces, unlawful detention, torture of detainees, arbitrary use of state security laws against political dissidents and ethnic groups, coercive family planning practices, persecution of unsanctioned religious activity, state control of information, and mistreatment of North Korean refugees. Tibetans, Uighur Muslims, and Falun Gong adherents continue to receive especially harsh treatment.

China's leadership transition has so far provided few indications of a fundamental policy shift on human rights.

Alexander's Feast, like the earlier Song for St. Cecilia's Day (Works, III), was commissioned by the Musical Society for performance at its annual tribute to sacred music. The Fables included selections from Homer, Ovid, Boccaccio, and Chaucer. Extensive and detailed notes to these translations show readers how well Dryden succeeded in transmitting the styles and the very sounds of his originals. Volume VII ends with a section of miscellaneous pieces published at other times, including Dryden's only known Latin work. The presentation of the writings in this volume, like that of the entire twenty-volume series, is a tribute not only to Dryden but also to the editors who have guided it through five decades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-xwe8ck-_XMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bars Across Heaven","description":"African American underclass street players hustle to survive on the streets of Oakland, California.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LKoRmQyty70C&dq=The+Bars+Across+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guidelines for Pressure Relief and Effluent Handling Systems","description":"Current industry, government and public emphasis on containment of hazardous materials makes it essential for each plant to reduce and control accidental releases to the atmosphere.

Subsequently the Luftwaffe was stripped of its newest fighters for the defense of the Reich and lost air superiority to the Red Air Force. Unusual scenes include bombed-out Russian aircraft abandoned during the initial German advance and the use of horses and oxen to haul supplies and even aircraft, as fuel became scarce toward the end of the war.

A Penguin Classic Just after the Iron Curtain fell on Eastern Europe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Steinbeck and acclaimed war photographer Robert Capa ventured into the Soviet Union to report for the New York Herald Tribune. This rare opportunity took the famous travelers not only to Moscow and Stalingrad  now Volgograd  but through the countryside of the Ukraine and the Caucasus. Hailed by the New York Times as \\"superb\\" when it first appeared in 1948, A Russian Journal is the distillation of their journey and remains a remarkable memoir and unique historical document. What they saw and movingly recorded in words and on film was what Steinbeck called \\"the great other side there   the private life of the Russian people.\\" Unlike other Western reporting about Russia at the time, A Russian Journal is free of ideological obsessions. Rather, Steinbeck and Capa recorded the grim realities of factory workers, government clerks, and peasants, as they emerged from the rubble of World War II represented here in Capa s stirring photographs alongside Steinbeck s masterful prose. Through it all, we are given intimate glimpses of two artists at the height of their powers, answering their need to document human struggle. This edition features an introduction by Steinbeck scholar Susan Shillinglaw. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

The answer, according to Richard J. Bird, is that science, especially biology, has embraced a view of life that renders meaningless the coincidences, serendipities, and other seemingly significant occurrences that fill people's everyday existence. Evolutionary biology rests on the assumption that although events are fundamentally random, some are selected because they are better adapted than others to the surrounding world. This book proposes an alternative view of evolving complexity. Bird argues that randomness means not disorder but infinite order. Complexity arises not from many random events of natural selection (although these are not unimportant) but from the \\"playing out\\" of chaotic systems which are best described mathematically. When we properly understand the complex interplay of chaos and life, Bird contends, we will see that many events that appear random are actually the outcome of order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_SejCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violence Against Children in the Family and the Community","description":"Children in the United States experience violence in many forms. They are the victims of physical and sexual abuse within their families, they witness battering of and by their parents, and they experience or witness violence in their schools and communities. Poor children are especially at risk for experiencing these forms of violence. Recently, considerable research has accumulated documenting the psychological impact of such violence on children's development. This book brings together in one volume the latest findings from researchers on violence, with the aim of integrating findings and pointing out gaps in our knowledge that future research will need to address. The book also describes promising interventions that have helped children already damaged by violence and suggests strategies for preventing violence before it occurs. The book is divided into five sections that cover developmental consequences, causes, interventions, prevention, and future research and public policy issues. This volume will be a resource for developmental psychologists, violence researchers, social workers, and policy makers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1DZoQgAACAAJ&dq=Violence+Against+Children+in+the+Family+and+the+Community&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Seasons : A New Journey","description":"When life-altering changes occur, our lives go in new, unfamiliar directions.

Neatly penned in my baby book were the words, 'Debbie was a fat, unattractive baby.' Fat and ugly aside, my life was fairly normal for a couple of years. It would be a while before the abuse began. Before the smoking and pills, the rage and rebellion, the alcoholism and cancer, the broken marriages. In those first uncomplicated years I could have set out on any of a dozen different paths toward an orderly life . . . it was not to be. . . . But this is not a story of defeat.\\" This is a book about surviving. It's about hope. It's about how each of us-ordinary, imperfect, damaged-can dream and heal. This book weaves the humorous, often outrageous, always courageous tapestry of Debrah Constance's life. Voted Woman of the Year by the State of California Legislature for founding A Place Called Home, (APCH) an organization providing services to at-risk inner-city kids in South Los Angeles, she proves that anyone can rise above life's obstacles and make a better life for themselves-and others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KBsIMQAACAAJ&dq=Fat,+Stupid,+Ugly:+One+Woman%27s+Courage+to+Survive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day the Rabbi Resigned","description":"Rabbi Small has left the synagogue, but he s not done with sleuthing, in this  engaging  mystery from the New York Timesbestselling author (New York Newsday).

In the years following the Civil War, first-generation Irish-American Zachary O'Hara, son of a legendary Marine and a force of a man in his own right, finds himself playing a critical role in the very future of the Marines. If he can persuade the Secretary of the Navy that the Marines are more crucial than ever to America's safety and security -- all the while hefting a heavier secret weight in his heart -- he'll save the corps and make his career. But there's an obstacle in his path that this warrior had not planned on. Amanda Blanton Kerr, the daughter of a ruthless industrialist, is a woman on a mission of her own; passionate, obstinate, and whip-smart, she's an heiress poised to blaze a trail for her sex. O'Hara's Choice is the story of the inevitable collision of these two handsome, fighting spirits. Getting their souls' desire could jeopardize everything they -- and their parents before them -- scraped and struggled to achieve. Duty to country, love of family, and a tormented passion intertwine in this latest epic by Leon Uris, international bestselling author of such classics as Exodus, Trinity, and Battle Cry. A riveting, sweeping tale in inimitable Uris style, O'Hara's Choice is this master of the historical novel at his most brilliant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JJN9iBzj2EoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Far Side Leather-Bound Set [Signed Limited Edition]","description":"Since \\"The Far Side's debut in January 1980, fans have bought more than 40 million \\"Far Side books and more than 60 million calendars.

While the modern quarter of Tripoli, built by the Italians, was small and affluent, the rest of the city--like the rest of the nation--was left to fend for itself amid the arid, sandy stretches of North Africa. As tensions mounted between eastern and western ideals, terror began to supplant justice, and acts of religiously motivated violence began to fill some of Tripoli's darkest corners. Against this backdrop, the teenaged Michele Balistreri--a smart young man plagued by thuggish tendencies and a youthful attraction to Fascism--suffered a succession of personal blows that would scar him for life: the death of his mother; a terrible tragedy that befell his best friend's family; and the consequences of his father's role in Gaddafi's rise to power. Worst of all, an innocent blood pact he made as a teenager would come to haunt him as an adult. Four decades later, journalist Linda Nardi is hard at work investigating the shadowy history of the Vatican Bank's involvement in Libya when she suddenly finds her attention diverted to an irresistible story assignment: covering the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's forty-two year dictatorship. It is only a matter of time before Nardi's research and Balistreri's investigative work as a police commissario bring them into contact. Together they unearth a deadly conspiracy that goes to the top of Rome's power structure that neither of them will ever be able to forget.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=43hEBAAAQBAJ&dq=Root+of+All+Evil,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Remembering the Present: Painting and Popular History in Zaire","description":"This book combines ethnography with the study of art to present a fascinating new vision of African history. It contains the paintings of a single artist depicting Zaire's history, along with a series of ethnographic essays discussing local history, its complex relationship to forms of self-expression and self-understanding, and the aesthetics of contemporary urban African and Third World societies. As a collaboration between ethnographer and painter, this innovative study challenges text-oriented approaches to understanding history and argues instead for an event- and experience-oriented model, ultimately adding a fresh perspective to the discourse on the relationship between modernity and tradition. During the 1970s, Johannes Fabian encouraged Tshibumba Kanda Matulu to paint the history of Zaire. The artist delivered the work in batches, together with an oral narrative. Fabian recorded these statements along with his own question-and-answer sessions with the painter. The first part of the book is the complete series of 100 paintings, with excerpts from the artist's narrative and the artist-anthropologist dialogues. Part Two consists of Fabian's essays about this and other popular painting in Zaire. The essays discuss such topics as performance, orality, history, colonization, and popular art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DDtcPGvlRlIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Everyday Sacred - A Woman's Journey Home","description":"WITH SIMPLE SHIFTS OF PERCEPTION, EACH OF US CAN FIND THE SACRED IN EVERY DAY.

Indeed, according to Pickstone, sex has usurped religion's position on the spiritual pedestal. In this time of increasing secularization, our traditional views of sex have fallen by the wayside. The religious right bemoans our so-called hedonism as a retreat from religion and values. Yet Pickstone challenges the belief that we have lost our spirituality and have become a world of lost souls damned for eternity. His book provides a sober and lucid response to our concerns about where our society is headed. Pickstone clearly demonstrates how we often describe sex in metaphors of natural, and even supernatural phenomena: The earth moves, oceans swell, and storms rage. Moreover, Pickstone argues, we find in both sexual and religious passion the same transcendence of self that constitutes a spiritual experience. Barriers break down as we are transported to another reality of ecstasy and heightened experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PRfVCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Landscape development for Texas coastal areas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IH4tGQAACAAJ&dq=Landscape+development+for+Texas+coastal+areas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Captive Notions: Concise Commentaries on the Commonplace","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qlf-AAAACAAJ&dq=Captive+Notions:+Concise+Commentaries+on+the+Commonplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Beginning (Arabesque)","description":"The company New Year's Eve party marks the beginning of a special romance between two successful corporate executives--Virginia Summers and John Robinson, Senior Vice President of International Affairs--but a John's proposed move to Europe and a secret from his past could separate them forever.

VINTAGE DOG BOOKS have republished it, using the original text and illustrations as part of their CLASSIC BREED BOOKS series. Freeman Lloyd was an expert on dogs and wrote several books on various breeds. This book on the whippet was his best, and is much sought after by true \\"whippeters.\\" As a respected member of the National Whippet-Racing Club, he wrote from his wealth of experience of this wonderful little racing/hunting dog. The book consists of over a hundred pages divided into sixteen detailed chapters and is illustrated with vintage photos of typical dogs and diagrams of tracks, including an additional gallery of photos at the rear. Contents Include: Make, Shape and Characteristics. Breeding. The Whippet as a Snap-Dog. As a Race-Dog. As a Sporting Dog. As a Show Dog. As a Companion. Training. Tracks and Racecourses. Racing Rules. Management of Meetings. Tables of Times, Distances and Weights. The Rules of Handicapping. Kennels. Food and Clothing. Diseases. This is a fascinating read for any whippet enthusiast or historian of the breed, but also contains much information that is still useful and practical today.

Yoder's approach to ecumenical dialogue correlates with his conception of the faithfulness of the church. His vision of the church poses challenges for Christians of all communions because he calls both for disciplined dialogue and for faithful servanthood that renders the confession of Jesus Christ's lordship meaningful. This collection of 17 essays on themes ecclesiological and ecumenical is intended to demonstrate the substantial unity of Yoder's work over the past four decades. Many of these essays are often cited by researchers but have been till now unobtainable. Three of these texts have never been published before. Editor Michael Cartwright has contributed a substantial introduction on the \\"Yoderian\\" project, and a select bibliography prepared by Mark Nation catalogs Yoder's writings--published and unpublished--on ecclesiology and ecumenism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OpCRQAAACAAJ&dq=The+Royal+Priesthood:+Essays+Ecclesiological+and+Ecumenical&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eleanor of Aquitaine and the four kings","description":"An account of Queen Eleanor which describes her dramatic life as a queen, her marriages, and her contributions to that period","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qts7Heh3_sMC&dq=Eleanor+of+Aquitaine+and+the+four+kings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pontiac Firebird Restoration Guide 1967-1969","description":"Complete restoration guide for all 1967-1969 Fire models.

In this episode, Brenner-forced out of the police force-tries to get away from detective work by taking a job as the personal chauffeur for two-year-old Helena, the daughter of a Munich construction giant and a Viennese abortion doctor. One day, while Brenner's attention is turned to picking out a chocolate bar for Helena at a gas station, Helena gets snatched from the car. Abruptly out of a job, Brenner decides to investigate her disappearance on his own. With both parents in the public eye, there's no scarcity of leads-the father's latest development project has spurred public protest, and the mother's clinic has been targeted by the zealous leader of an anti-abortion group. Brenner and God is told with a dark humor that leaves no character, including Brenner, unscathed. Haas tells the story of a fallible hero who can be indecisive and world-weary, baffled and disillusioned by what he finds, but who presses forward nonetheless out of a stubborn sense of decency-a two-year-old is kidnapped, so you find her, because that's just what you do.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nY1PnwEACAAJ&dq=Death+Gate+Cycle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Blizzard of '88","description":"Recounts the massive blizzard of 1888, which immobilized the entire Northeast, and describes how people coped with the disaster","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oM7aAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Blizzard+of+%2788&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete \\"No Geek-Speak\\" Guide to the Internet: Easy-to-Follow Directions to Thousands of Websites","description":"This easy-to-follow guide to the Internet, the World Wide Web, America Online, and other electronic communicatins services will help you \\"wire up\\" for personal growth using today's exciting new communications technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Zzf_DR_r_-AC&dq=The+Complete+%22No+Geek-Speak%22+Guide+to+the+Internet:+Easy-to-Follow+Directions+to+Thousands+of+Websites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christian Theology","description":"A revised edition of Erickson's successful systematic theology with updated text and new pedagogical aids, such as chapter outlines, chapter objectives, and study questions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ&dq=Christian+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows XP Simplified","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Easy-to-Cut Silhouette Designs (Other Paper Crafts)","description":"Twnety-nine charming, traditional silhouette designs that are so easy to use even children can join the fun!

Even after 15 long years he never left my mind and soul though I formally belonged to someone else now. Avyansh- \\"Meeting you was one of the best accidents of my life. I wish I could go back to that moment, just to experience it all over again.\\"What skipped my heartbeat on our first meeting was a mole on the upper side of her right lip. She didn't need any makeup to entice a man, her mole was more than enough to be someone's death. I broke her heart over a phone call but today when we met after 15 long years, I wanted to turn back the clock and fix what I'd broken. It was my weakness that I could not treasure her. I am tired of hiding the truth and carrying this guilt for so many years. I know I tore her world apart with just my words but over the years not even a single day has passed, when I haven't thought about the hurt & pain I caused her.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fl6azgEACAAJ&dq=You%27re+My+Favorite+Reader.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crime Victims","description":"A first in the field when initially published and now a true classic, CRIME VICTIMS: AN INTRODUCTION TO VICTIMOLOGY, Tenth Edition offers the most comprehensive and balanced exploration of victimology available today.

These boxes and folders contain 1,500 documents from the Central Intelligence Agency--which reveal that, through its inaction and subversion, the U.S. government let Wallenberg languish in the camps of silence, known as the Gulag Archipelago. These documents, released in 1994, show that America, which sent Wallenberg on one of World War II s most hazardous missions, betrayed this man who achieved the unachievable to rescue 100,000 Jews. A joint Swedish-Russian group--after more than nine years of study--released two reports on January 12, 2001. The Russian version said Wallenberg was killed in 1947, but the Swedish version raised many theories and came to no conclusions. A lot of this material was covered in the CIA files. During his years of imprisonment, many have tried and all have failed to free Wallenberg. His family made impassioned pleas to the highest levels of American government, only to be ignored five times. All attempts to free Wallenberg, perpetually bungled, included proposed spy swaps and a legal effort that initially won, but ultimately lost an unusual lawsuit against the Soviet Union. Through the prism of contemporary interviews along with the CIA documents as well as examination of 500 State Department documents in Washington and another 500 at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New York, as well as the Swedish and Russian reports, one sees new details and insights into a basic conflict. All the new information provides the backbone of a book, the first to specify American culpability in deserting Raoul Wallenberg.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K6AuWXrW4AoC&dq=A+Conspiracy+of+Indifference:+The+Raoul+Wallenberg+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talk, Talk : A Children's Book Author Speaks to Grown-Ups","description":"In TalkTalk E. L. Konigsburg presents a selection of speeches she has given over a period of 25 years. In her introduction to the first speech, and to the book as a whole, she explains: \\"While each of my books has been written because I had a story I wanted to tell, these speeches were written because I had something I wanted to say. The audience for the former is children; for the latter, adults.... I recognize -- with a measure of amused detachment -- that some were written as a reaction to trends; others, to fads. I have given these talks in cafetoriums, auditoriums, and the public rooms of Holiday Inns. Even though I have not always been on a stage when addressing an audience, I have tried to set the stage. Between talk and talk, I have written passages connecting the speeches to the time in which they were written and to one another. And that is TalkTalk.\\" Always a thought-provoking speaker, she has chosen nine speeches that capture the essence of her years as a writer for children. When brought together, they enrich one another and provide a chance to look back at what children's books have been, to observe where they are now and to offer an insightful look at what books may continue to mean to children in the years to come. Written by an outstanding author, these speeches, individually and together, represent a vision of the need for books and the role books have played and should continue to play in the lives of children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y-tf9RSYblUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Woman's Book of Creativity","description":"By inviting women to accept and nurture their own inherent ability to express their talents, the author offers guidance that can help to transform any woman's life from one of self-imposed limits to one of infinite freedom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6Wo9QQAACAAJ&dq=The+Woman%27s+Book+of+Creativity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen in the Art of Golf","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TFbBkpGR--EC&dq=Zen+in+the+Art+of+Golf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metrics for Project Management: Formalized Approaches","description":"Your Complete Guide to Project Management Metrics is Here!

Contents include detailed biographies of the Apollo 1 crew, overview histories of the Apollo 1 tragedy and recovery, the complete final report of the Apollo 204 review board, and excerpts from the technical appendices covering the review board minutes, a detailed narrative description of the sequence of events in the accident, witness statements and releases, and the report of the medical analysis panel. On January 27, 1967, tragedy struck the Apollo program when a flash fire occurred in command module 012 during a launch pad test of the Apollo/Saturn space vehicle being prepared for the first piloted flight, the AS-204 mission. Three astronauts, Lt. Col. Virgil I. Grissom, a veteran of Mercury and Gemini missions; Lt. Col. Edward H. White, the astronaut who had performed the first United States extravehicular activity during the Gemini program; and Roger B. Chaffee, an astronaut preparing for his first space flight, died in this tragic accident. A seven-member board, under the direction of the NASA Langley Research Center Director, Dr. Floyd L. Thompson, conducted a comprehensive investigation to pinpoint the cause of the fire. The final report, completed in April 1967 was subsequently submitted to the NASA Administrator. The report presented the results of the investigation and made specific recommendations that led to major design and engineering modifications, and revisions to test planning, test discipline, manufacturing processes and procedures, and quality control. With these changes, the overall safety of the command and service module and the lunar module was increased substantially. The AS-204 mission was redesignated Apollo I in honor of the crew. The fire which claimed the lives of Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee stunned the nation and rocked the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The disaster had the potential to bring a permanent halt to American efforts in space exploration. Rather than bury its head in the sand, NASA launched a full-scale investigation of the fire, and voluntarily put the entire Apollo program, including its administration, policies and procedures under the scrutiny of a review board. Based on the board's findings, NASA rolled up its sleeves and went to work to resolve the problems that had been identified. A successful failure is a mission which fails to reach its objectives and yet still achieves an element of success. Apollo I never left the launch pad. However, the information gained from this fatal mission paved the way for a totally redesigned Apollo spacecraft, eleven Apollo space flights and six lunar landings. Although Grissom, White and Chaffee never walked on the moon, their sacrifice helped to make it possible for us collectively to take \\"one giant leap for mankind\\". It is crucial to remember the hard lessons learned from Apollo I and eulogies are part of that remembering. Yet, Grissom, White and Chaffee may be honored best by continuing the work they began. Each of them believed that reaching the moon was not meant to be an end but a beginning. Thirty years ago, Grissom considered manned missions to Mars and crews assembling, living and working on space stations as realistic follow-ups to a lunar landing. While he recognized the place of ever-improving technology, White was emphatic about the need for manned missions: \\"You'll never satisfy man's curiosity unless a man goes himself.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cgY0swEACAAJ&dq=Apollo+and+America%27s+Moon+Landing+Program+:+Major+NASA+Documents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Annotated Unemployment Insurance Act, 1993","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pFdwwgEACAAJ&dq=The+Annotated+Unemployment+Insurance+Act,+1993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Communicating in Groups","description":"Communicating in Groups offers a concise, step-by-step introduction to the theory and practice of small group communication and teaches students to develop and apply critical thinking skills in group problem-solving situations.

Now, in a new edition of Sun Tzu and the Art of Business, Mark McNeilly shows how Sun Tzu's strategic principles can be applied to twenty-first century business. Here are two books in one: McNeilly's synthesis of Sun Tzu's ideas into six strategic principles for the business executive, plus the text of Samuel B. Griffith's popular translation of The Art of War. McNeilly explains how to gain market share without inciting competitive retaliation, how to attack competitors' weak points, and how to maximize market information for competitive advantage. He demonstrates the value of speed and preparation in throwing the competition off-balance, employing strategy to beat the competition, and the need for character in leaders. Lastly, McNeilly presents a practical method to put Sun Tzu's principles into practice. By using modern examples throughout the book from Google, Zappos, Amazon, Dyson, Aflac, Singapore Airlines, Best Buy, the NFL, Tata Motors, Starbucks, and many others, he illustrates how, by following the wisdom of history's most respected strategist, executives can avoid the pitfalls of management fads and achieve lasting competitive advantage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fYRKZ9I4ZGkC&dq=Sun+Tzu+and+the+Art+of+Business:+Six+Strategic+Principles+for+Managers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PATTY'S LAST DANCE (Sweet Valley Twins)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sZUbMwEACAAJ&dq=PATTY%27S+LAST+DANCE+(Sweet+Valley+Twins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"16th Century Mosque Pb (Inside Story)","description":"The Imam and the Indian is an extensive compilation of Amitav Ghosh s non-fiction writings.

On his journey the scholar and poet who is now the elder Housman confronts his younger self, and the memories of the man he loved his entire life, Moses Jackson the handsome athlete who could not return his feelings. As if a dream, The Invention of Love inhabits Housman's imagination, illuminating both the pain of hopeless love and passion displaced into poetry and the study of classical texts. The author of A Shropshire Lad lived almost invisibly in the shadow of the flamboyant Oscar Wilde, and died old and venerated but whose passion was truly the fatal one?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IlHTBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computer Graphics: Mathematical First Steps","description":"Computer Graphics - First Mathematical Steps will help students to master basic Computer Graphics and the mathematical concepts which underlie this subject.

An authentic church father of the Post-Reformation era, the Basel professor's contributions to theology, the life of the church, and the world of culture and politics have been frequently noted. This work, however, presents extraordinary new information and insight based on his own correspondence and notes. What one finds in this work is Barth's own running commentary on events and people - from 1886 to 1968. Everything is depicted from his perspective and chiefly in his own words, and this is precisely what makes the volume so fascinating and valuable. The brilliance, wit, and humanity of Barth shine through everywhere as he is seen as son, brother, student, editor, friend, pastor, husband, father, soldier, teacher, theologian, church leader, political critic, polemicist, ecumenist, author, preacher, music lover, senior citizen. The gigantic theologian is here, but - even more - the man shines through. An abundance of pictures accompanies the text - most of them to be seen for the first time. The contents of this book are new and of utmost interest and importance. Readers not familiar with the accomplishment of Karl Barth will learn to know both the man and his thought. Specialists will for the first time discern the figure behind the intellect.

Their greatest problem was not separation from other Jews so much as the openness and tolerance of Chinese society. Intermarriages occurred frequently, and Jews were fully accepted as merchants, government officials, and neighbors. Over time, they were so completely assimilated that few of their descendants carry any memory of Jewish ancestry and physically look much like other Chinese.

In its place is a new type of organized violence, which she calls \\"new wars\\", a mixture of war, organized crime, and massive violations of human rights. The actors are both global and local, public and private. These wars are fought for particular political goals using tactics of terror and destabilization that are theoretically outlawed by the rules of modern warfare; an informal criminalized economy is built into the functioning of these new wars. The author asserts that political leaders and international institutions have been unable to deal with the spread of these wars mainly because they have not come to terms with their logic; wars are treated either as old wars or as anarchy. Her analysis offers a basis for a cosmopolitan political response to these wars in which the monopoly of legitimate organized violence is reconstructed on a transnational basis, and international peacekeeping is reconceptualized as cosmopolitan law enforcement. The author shows how this approach has profound implications for the reconstruction of civil society, political institutions, and economic and social relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WkScMQEACAAJ&dq=New+and+Old+Wars:+Organized+Violence+in+a+Global+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Schwarzbein Principle, The Program: Losing Weight the Healthy Way","description":"In The Schwarzbein Principle, which has sold more than 250,000 copies, Dr. Diana Schwarzbein laid out her revolutionary secret to long-term health and weight control: balance your metabolism to re-energize your immune system.

Commonly found in architectural literature and journalism, in critical design debate and especially in student project reviews, Archispeak can seem insular and perplexing to others and -- particularly to the new architectural student -- often incomprehensible. There is a need to translate architectural design concepts into spoken and written commentary -- each word in use embodying a precise and universally accepted architectural meaning. If we explore the vocabulary of this language we gain insight into good design practice and into collective understanding of what constitutes a refined architecture. This unique illustrated guide will help students understand the nuances of this specialized language and help them in communicating their own design ideas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=33GCAgAAQBAJ&dq=Archispeak:+An+Illustrated+Guide+to+Architectural+Terms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scattered Thoughts","description":"David Mills lives within the aboriginal populace of St. Augustine, Florida in a small rented room on Anastasia Island.

With them came their precious jewels: diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls... But then the Fair People vanished, taking with them their twelve fabulous treasures. And they remained hidden until now... Across North America, these twelve treasures, over ten-thousand dollars in precious jewels in 1982 dollars, are buried. The key to finding each can be found within the twelve full-color paintings and verses of THE SECRET. Are you smart enough? THE SECRET: A TREASURE HUNT was published in 1982. The year before publication, the author and publisher Byron Preiss had traveled to 12 locations in the continental U.S. (and possibly Canada) to secretly bury a dozen ceramic casques. Each casque contained a small key that could be redeemed for one of 12 jewels Preiss kept in a safe deposit box in New York. The key to finding the casques was to match one of 12 paintings to one of 12 poetic verses, solve the resulting riddle, and start digging. Since 1982, only two of the 12 casques have been recovered. The first was located in Grant Park, Chicago, in 1984 by a group of students. The second was unearthed in 2004 in Cleveland by two members of the Quest4Treasure forum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t9OCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The X-Files, Vol. 1 (X-Files) (X-Files (Checker Book))","description":"Pour en savoir plus sur la s rie culte des ann es 90, pour avoir acc s   des informations confidentielles diffus es nulle part ailleurs, plongez-vous dans le seul guide officiel de la s rie.

One day in the early 1950s, Walt Disney stood looking over 240 acres of farmland in Anaheim, California, and imagined building a park where people  could live among Mickey Mouse and Snow White in a world still powered by steam and fire for a day or a week or (if the visitor is slightly mad) forever.  Despite his wealth and fame, exactly no one wanted Disney to build such a park. Not his brother Roy, who ran the company s finances; not the bankers; and not his wife, Lillian. Amusement parks at that time, such as Coney Island, were a generally despised business, sagging and sordid remnants of bygone days. Disney was told that he would only be heading toward financial ruin. But Walt persevered, initially financing the park against his own life insurance policy and later with sponsorship from ABC and the sale of thousands and thousands of Davy Crockett coonskin caps. Disney assembled a talented team of engineers, architects, artists, animators, landscapers, and even a retired admiral to transform his ideas into a soaring yet soothing wonderland of a park. The catch was that they had only a year and a day in which to build it. On July 17, 1955, Disneyland opened its gates and the first day was a disaster. Disney was nearly suicidal with grief that he had failed on a grand scale. But the curious masses kept coming, and the rest is entertainment history. Eight hundred million visitors have flocked to the park since then. In Disney s Land,  Snow brings a historian s eye and a child s delight, not to mention superb writing, to the telling of this fascinating narrative  (Ken Burns) that  will entertain Disneyphiles and readers of popular American history  (Publishers Weekly).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KugGEAAAQBAJ&dq=Walt+Disney%27s+Story+Land&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wager: A Play in Three Acts","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NApNmgEACAAJ&dq=The+Wager:+A+Play+in+Three+Acts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pragmatism, Feminism, and Democracy: Rethinking the Politics of American History","description":"Pragmatism, Feminism, and Democracy is James Livingston's virtuoso reflection on the period between 1890 and 1930, a primal scene of American history during which a wave of intellectual currents came together--and fell apart--to reorient society.

While that has given shareholders fits for nearly a century, it has also motivated the Pentastar company to create some of the most outrageous, and collectible, cars ever built in the United States. From the moment Chrysler unleashed the Firepower hemi V-8 engine on the world for the 1951 model year, they had been cranking out the most powerful engines on the market. Because the company pioneered the use of lightweight unibody technology, it had the stiffest, lightest bodies in which to put those most powerful engines, and that is the basic muscle-car formula: add one powerful engine to one light car. When the muscle car era exploded onto the scene, Chrysler unleashed the mighty Mopar muscle cars, the Dodges and Plymouths that defined the era. Fabled nameplates like Charger, Road Runner, Super Bee, 'Cuda, and Challenger defined the era and rank among the most valuable collector cars ever produced by an American automaker. Featuring cars from the incomparable Brothers' Collection, The Art of Mopar: Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth Muscle Cars celebrates these cars in studio portraits using the light-painting process perfected by Tom Loeser. It is the ultimate portrayal of the ultimate muscle cars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wu8oDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dodge,+Plymouth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays from Contemporary Culture","description":"In the second half of the twentieth century the theme of culture has dominated the human sciences. The forms of contemporary culture demand a radical reappraisal of the terms of description of the modern world. We therefore need to consider our options when culture does not just provide the meaning of experience but is also the terms of that experience. This book reviews these ideas in ways that will be accessible to those new to the field and also stimulating to experts. The three parts of the book: * Review the character and lessons of this \\"turn to culture\\" in a number of academic fields. The author demonstrates the socio-intellectual context within which these themes have been generated and documents the main strengths of the paradigm shift. * Explore key themes in contemporary culture. By showing how questions of citizenship and the meaning of places have been colonized under the remit of the culturalist paradigm, a cluster of associated ideas and themes implicit in the paradigm are explicitly tackled. * Examine some of the ways in whcih cultural forms are increasingly seen to dominate social reality. The final chapter explores triumphant culturalism - the postmodern world as the apogee of the turn to culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ThWIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asi somos los espanoles: Spanish Skills for Advanced Students","description":"As?omos los espa?s provides advanced students with a genuine insight into Spanish culture via a range of practical activities and exercises.

S?ren Kierkegaard is one of the most passionate and challenging of all modern philosophers, and is often regarded as the founder of existentialism. Over about a decade in the 1840s and 1850s, writings poured from his pen pursuing the question of existence how to be a human being in the world? while exploring the possibilities of Christianity and confronting the failures of its institutional manifestation around him. Much of his creativity sprang from his relationship with the young woman whom he promised to marry, then left to devote himself to writing, a relationship which remained decisive for the rest of his life. He deliberately lived in the swim of human life in Copenhagen, but alone, and died exhausted in 1855 at the age of 42, bequeathing his remarkable writings to his erstwhile fianc e.

They also seek the craft of good farming and the faith that comes of thankful farming. Small Farmer's Journal wants to be defenders and agents of and for good farming and they realize that they are a small endeavor with small consequences. This book combines two books into one. It covers the subjects of training horses to work in harness on the farm, in the woods, and on the road, and correcting behavior problems with work horses.

The strong evangelistic urge that dominated Charles E. Fuller's ministry permeates every page of Give the Winds a Mighty Voice.

Fuller is the story of a religious movement. As you read Give the Winds a Mighty Voice, you will relive both the disappointments and the victories of which so many people were a part.

Her name was Morag Murray Abdullah, and sadly, though her story has been forgotten, the resonating echoes of her life still ring as true now as they did back in the 1920s when she wrote her amazing autobiography. In 1916 Morag was leading what can only be termed as a conventional life. The First World War was raging in nearby Europe. But the city of Edinburgh, Scotland, where she lived, was quiet and safe. In fact everything about her life, up till this point, had been predictable. Then she met Syed Abdullah. The handsome student was attending university there in Scotland, but his roots were far away. Abdullah s father was a chief of the Pathan tribe, those legendary tribesmen who ruled the lands around the fabled Khyber Pass in distant India. Regardless of these vast cultural and religious, (she was Protestant - he a Muslim), the two young people fell in love and were married. Nothing in Morag s life was ever the same. She followed her new husband out to the war-filled, North West Frontier Province of India. There she took up residence among one of the most martial races on Earth. For the next two decades the former Scottish lass became a witness to blood feuds, ruthless tribal politics, and the seclusion of her fellow women in one of the most remote and dangerous portion of the world. Yet this is in no way a tale of exploitation, rather it is the true story of two people from vastly different countries, religions, and families, who learned to live and love each other despite all the odds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eIsNAAAACAAJ&dq=My+Khyber+Marriage+(Adventure+Travel+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wien / Vienna (City Flash Maps)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zaAYAQAAMAAJ&dq=Wien+/+Vienna+(City+Flash+Maps)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patio Daddy-O: '50S Recipes With a Modern Twist","description":"Step aside Iron John--and pass the coleslaw.

Suspensions of Perception is a major historical study of human attention and its volatile role in modern Western culture. It argues that the ways in which we intently look at or listen to anything result from crucial changes in the nature of perception that can be traced back to the second half of the nineteenth century. Focusing on the period from about 1880 to 1905, Jonathan Crary examines the connections between the modernization of subjectivity and the dramatic expansion and industrialization of visual/auditory culture. At the core of his project is the paradoxical nature of modern attention, which was both a fundamental condition of individual freedom, creativity, and experience and a central element in the efficient functioning of economic and disciplinary institutions as well as the emerging spaces of mass consumption and spectacle. Crary approaches these issues through multiple analyses of single works by three key modernist painters Manet, Seurat, and Cezanne who each engaged in a singular confrontation with the disruptions, vacancies, and rifts within a perceptual field. Each in his own way discovered that sustained attentiveness, rather than fixing or securing the world, led to perceptual disintegration and loss of presence, and each used this discovery as the basis for a reinvention of representational practices. Suspensions of Perception decisively relocates the problem of aesthetic contemplation within a broader collective encounter with the unstable nature of perception in psychology, philosophy, neurology, early cinema, and photography. In doing so, it provides a historical framework for understanding the current social crisis of attention amid the accelerating metamorphoses of our contemporary technological culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U0SUP5b1jUMC&dq=Suspensions+of+Perception:+Attention,+Spectacle,+and+Modern+Culture+(October+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God and Man in Contemporary Islamic Thought","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YMmamwEACAAJ&dq=God+and+Man+in+Contemporary+Islamic+Thought&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Being a Therapist (Jossey Bass Social and Behavioral Science Series)","description":"A candid account of the profound ways in which therapists are influenced by their clients.

Taking a historical and cross-national perspective, it explores how such groups and spaces are defined and bounded as well as the processes by which they come to be seen as  risky . It discusses how issues of perceived danger highlight questions of control and the management of behaviours, people and environments, and it pays attention to the way in which sanctions and regulations have been implemented in a variety of often inconsistent ways that frequently impact differently on different sections of the population. Bringing together a range of case studies drawn from different countries and across different periods of time, the chapters collected here illustrate issues of marginalisation, stigmatisation, human rights and social expectations. It is of interest to a diverse audience of historians, philosophers, human geographers, anthropologists, sociologists and criminologists interested in substance use and misuse, deviance, risk and power among other topics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pe7QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reading Issues of Wealth and Poverty in Luke-Acts (Studies in Bible and Early Christianity, V. 48)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Culture Shock!: Shanghai At Your Door","description":"Culture Shock! adds two new \\"At Your Door\\" city lifestyle guides and one new country guide.

Walker's book proposes a view of morality and an approach to ethical theory which uses the critical insights of feminism and race theory to rethink the epistemological and moral position of the ethical theorist, and how moral theory is inescapably shaped by culture and history. The main gist of her book is that morality is embodied in \\"practices of responsibility\\" that express our identities, values, and connections to others in socially patterned ways. Thus ethical theory needs to be empirically informed and politically critical to avoid reiterating forms of socially entrenched bias. Responsible ethical theory should reveal and question the moral significance of social differences. The book engages with, and challenges, the work of contemporary analytic philosophers in ethics. Moral Understandings has been influential in reaching a global audience in ethics and feminist philosophy, as well as in tangential fields like nursing ethics; research ethics; disability ethics; environmental ethics, and social and political theory. This revised edition contains a new preface, a substantive postscript to Chapter 1 about \\"the subject of moral philosophy\\"; the addition of a new chapter on the importance of emotion in practices of responsibility; and the addition of an afterword, which responds to critics of the book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a_hgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bad Girl's Guide to Getting Personal","description":"A guide for women with confidence and attitude provides tips on climbing the corporate ladder, dressing for success in careers and relationships, meeting men, and finding happiness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OITWp2vXW9wC&dq=The+Bad+Girl%27s+Guide+to+Getting+Personal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JavaServer Pages Pocket Reference","description":"JavaServer Pages (JSP) is harmonizing how web designers and programmers create dynamic web pages.

While its focus is on the theoretical premises and the methodology, not specific applications, the aim is pragmatic--to present complexity thinking as an important and appropriate attitude for educators and educational researchers. Part I is concerned with global issues around complexity thinking, as read through an educational lens. Part II cites a diversity of practices and studies that are either explicitly informed by or that might be aligned with complexity research, and offers focused and practiced advice for structuring projects in ways that are consistent with complexity thinking. Complexity thinking offers a powerful alternative to the linear, reductionist approaches to inquiry that have dominated the sciences for hundreds of years and educational research for more than a century. It has captured the attention of many researchers whose studies reach across traditional disciplinary boundaries to investigate phenomena such as: How does the brain work? What is consciousness? What is intelligence? What is the role of emergent technologies in shaping personalities and possibilities? How do social collectives work? What is knowledge? Complexity research posits that a deep similarity among these phenomena is that each points toward some sort of system that learns. The authors  intent is not to offer a complete account of the relevance of complexity thinking to education, not to prescribe and delimit, but to challenge readers to examine their own assumptions and theoretical commitments--whether anchored by commonsense, classical thought or any of the posts (such as postmodernism, poststructuralism, postcolonialism, postpositivism, postformalism, postepistemology) that mark the edges of current discursive possibility. Complexity and Education is THE introduction to the emerging field of complexity thinking for the education community. It is specifically relevant for educational researchers, graduate students, and inquiry-oriented teacher practitioners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nHW3AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas of the Year 1000","description":"Shows empires, trade routes, military activity, etc. on all continents ca. 900-1100.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j-CgtWP38nsC&dq=Atlas+of+the+Year+1000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leonard Nimoy's Primortals: Target Earth","description":"Aliens Reclaim the Earth!

SS: Hitler's Foreign Divisions is an in-depth examination of the approximately 350,000 foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries who opted to fight for the Third Reich as members of the Waffen-SS. The book explores the background to their recruitment and describes-on a unit-by-unit basis-their history, structure, and combat record in the war. Despite their non-Germanic background, the Norwegians, Dutch, Danes, Belgians, Latvians, Estonians, Cossacks, Ukrainians, and other nationalities-often motivated by an extreme anti-Communist zeal- fought hard on the Eastern Front for the Nazi cause, even when their position was hopeless. Often treated badly by their German commanders, the foreign SS units were not all excellent combat formations, however. some, like the British and Indian volunteers, were used for propaganda purposes only, while others, like the notorious Dirlewanger Brigade, who helped brutally suppress the Warsaw Rising, were nothing more than murderous criminals in uniform. Other divisions-such as the Russian-recruited 30th Waffen- Grenadier Division der SS, formed in the final months of the war-never reached a functional strength, and were disbanded before they saw action. Illustrated with rare photographs and written by an acknowledged expert, SS: Hitler's Foreign Divisions is a definitive history of the foreign SS units who fought for Hitler and Germany in World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l6glAQAAMAAJ&dq=SS:+Hitler%27s+Foreign+Divisions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The world of Sherlock Holmes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yP2MzQEACAAJ&dq=The+world+of+Sherlock+Holmes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scotty: James B.

In The Accident of Color, Daniel Brook journeys to nineteenth-century New Orleans and Charleston and introduces us to cosmopolitan residents who elude the racial categories the rest of America takes for granted. Before the Civil War, these free, openly mixed-race urbanites enjoyed some rights of citizenship and the privileges of wealth and social status. But after Emancipation, as former slaves move to assert their rights, the black-white binary that rules the rest of the nation begins to intrude. During Reconstruction, a movement arises as mixed-race elites make common cause with the formerly enslaved and allies at the fringes of whiteness in a bid to achieve political and social equality for all. In some areas, this coalition proved remarkably successful. Activists peacefully integrated the streetcars of Charleston and New Orleans for decades and, for a time, even the New Orleans public schools and the University of South Carolina were educating students of all backgrounds side by side. Tragically, the achievements of this movement were ultimately swept away by a violent political backlash and expunged from the history books, culminating in the Jim Crow laws that would legalize segregation for a half century and usher in the binary racial regime that rules us to this day. The Accident of Color revisits a crucial inflection point in American history. By returning to the birth of our nation s singularly narrow racial system, which was forged in the crucible of opposition to civil rights, Brook illuminates the origins of the racial lies we live by.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cAJ1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kiot","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F1ERAAAAMAAJ&dq=Kiot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barris TV and Movie Cars","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bw7ZEepsaLkC&dq=Barris+TV+and+Movie+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homemade Money: How to Select, Start, Manage, Market and Multiply the Profits of a Business at Home","description":"A practical handbook on the organization and management of a home business includes advice on marketing, pricing, advertising, and publicity","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rGyQ9dbazhAC&dq=Homemade+Money:+How+to+Select,+Start,+Manage,+Market+and+Multiply+the+Profits+of+a+Business+at+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fragments of Darkness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBcNGwAACAAJ&dq=Fragments+of+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ottoman Cage: A Novel of Istanbul","description":"Barbara Nadel's The Ottoman Cage is a spicy thriller set in Istanbul's back alleys.

The largest study of its kind, the Platinum Study delves into the domains of the elite with stories that illustrate both the use and misuse of power across the landscape of prominent American institutions such as AT&T, Harvard University, UnderArmour, JP Morgan Chase, Bain & Company, and the White House. The book explores not only how leaders wield power, but it also provides readers with insight into applying the strategies of the successful in their own lives. In the United States, only a few thousand individuals make the decisions that influence the lives of over 300 million people.

View from the Top explores the real lives of the elite and the social worlds they inhabit, revealing lessons about influence at the top, and the seven principles that shape those in power. The results of the Platinum Study include unexpected truths such as: Being born into wealth is a poor predictor of leadership success One program can set you on the path to leadership It doesn't matter what college you attend A leader's best work never sees the light of day Time-crushed executives are better situated than most to manage their family lives Crisis is the quickest way for a leader to shape an institution Working longer does not mean working better The book examines the different paths to power and describes the essence of leadership and the fundamental traits that distinguish a leader from the pack.

Using that premise, historian Richard Lawrence Miller analyzes America's drug war with passion seldom encountered in scholarly writing. Miller presents numerous examples of drug law enforcement gone amok, as police and courts threaten the happiness, property, and even lives of victims--some of whom are never charged with a drug crime, let alone convicted of one. Miller not only argues that criminal justice zealots are harming the democracy they are sworn to protect, but that authoritarians unfriendly to democracy are stoking public fear in order to convince citizens to relinquish traditional legal rights. Those are the very rights that thwart implementation of an agenda of social control through government power. Miller contends that an imaginary drug crisis has been manufactured by authoritarians in order to mask their war on democracy. He not only examines numerous civil rights sacrificed in the name of drugs, but demonstrates how their loss harms ordinary Americans in their everyday lives. Showing how the war on drug users fits into a destruction process that can lead to mass murder, Miller calls for an end to the war before it proceeds deeper into the destruction process. This is a book for anyone who wonders about the value of civil liberties, and for anyone who wonders why people seek to destroy their neighbors. Using voluminous examples of drug law enforcement victimizing blameless people, this book demonstrates how the loss of civil liberties in the name of drugs threatens law-abiding Americans at work and at home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_L6luWXsZ1gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"France Under Napoleon","description":"Presented here is an English translation of a study that was part of a distinguished French series on the country's post-Revolution history. Unlike much Napoleonic literature that features the personality and foreign policy of the Emperor, it describes the condition of France and the French people during the fifteen years immediately following their great revolution. The translator, R. R. Palmer, is a distinguished historian who has written and translated many books in French history, including The Coming of the French Revolution by Georges Lefebvre (Princeton). Applying the methods of the new social history (Annales school), the author covers the political, administrative, social, economic, and cultural facets of the First Empire. Part I deals with the domestic program and institutions under Napoleon and the fervor of the new chief of state as he sought to establish a coherent, efficient, and thoroughly controlled regime. Part II examines the opposition to his system and the reasons behind the imperfect realization of his ideal. It discusses population and demographic trends, social structure, and economic activity--all of which eluded Napoleon's grasp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G-A9DwAAQBAJ&dq=France+Under+Napoleon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Viking : Settlers, Ships, Swords and Sagas of the Nordic Age","description":"The Sagas of Icelanders are enduring stories from Viking-Age Iceland filled with love and romance, battles and feuds, tragedy and comedy.

Radiohead doesn't play by the rules of rock stardom. When conventional wisdom urges a turn to the right, Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, Colin Greenwood, and Phil Selway unfailingly turn left. Despite or perhaps because of this, Radiohead has become one of the world's most famous bands, and more important, unique in its style, themes, and ability to connect to a loyal fan base. But Radiohead's journey to fame over more than a decade has been fraught with tension. As the quintet continues to search for sounds that haven't been heard before, each new album and tour is a potential crisis point, threatening to split the band apart.

This new book shows how until 1944 U-boats operated as submersible torpedo craft which relied heavily on the surface for movement and charging their batteries. This pattern was repeated in WWII until Allied anti-submarine countermeasures had forced the Germans to modify their existing U-boats with the schnorkel. Countermeasures along also pushed the development of high-speed U-boats capable of continuously submerged operations. This study shows how these improved submarines became benchmark of the post-war Russian submarine challenge. Royal Navy doctrine was developed by professional anti-submarine officers, and based on the well-tried combination of defensive and offensive anti-submarine measures that had stood the press of time since 1917, notwithstanding considerable technological change. This consistent and holistic view of anti-submarine warfare has not been understood by most of the subsequent historians of these anti-submarine campaigns, and this book provides an essential and new insight into how Cold War, and indeed modern, anti-submarine warfare is conducted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hHV9AgAAQBAJ&dq=Anti-submarine+warfare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pirate Queen: A Timewalker Journey","description":"Thirteen year-old Jessica Ross is haunted by strange dreams of Grace O?Malley, a real-life, sixteenth-century pirate queen.

Several future effective leadership behaviors were identified: creating an atmosphere which fosters a following, articulating the organizational value and mission statements, sharing the leader's vision, cultivating a positive organizational image, and empowering others to do their jobs. Law enforcement leaders will become more effective as a result of the increased efficiency of their empowered police personnel. To establish a positive organizational image, it is the responsibility of law enforcement leaders to convey a positive internal image, to develop a successful community relations program, and to maintain a good relationship with the media. Law enforcement leaders can communicate the organizational image by means of frequent reinforcement at staff meetings, training sessions, team-building workshops, roll calls, and state-of-the-department addresses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NqnRHAAACAAJ&dq=A+view+of+law+enforcement+leadership+for+the+year+2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick or Dead","description":"A Pulitzer Prize Finalist from one of our most heralded writers the  poetic, disturbing, yet very funny  (The Washington Post Book World) life-and-death adventures of three misfit teenagers in the American desert Alice, Corvus, and Annabel, each a motherless child, are an unlikely circle of friends. One filled with convictions, another with loss, the third with a worldly pragmatism, they traverse an air-conditioned landscape eccentric with signs and portents from the preservation of the living dead in a nursing home to the presentation of the dead as living in a wildlife museum accompanied by restless, confounded adults. A father lusts after his handsome gardener even as he's haunted (literally) by his dead wife; a heartbroken dog runs afoul of an angry neighbor; a young stroke victim drifts westward, his luck running from worse to awful; a sickly musician for whom Alice develops an attraction is drawn instead toward darker imaginings and solutions; and an aging big-game hunter finds spiritual renewal through his infatuation with an eight-year-old the formidable Emily Bliss Pickless. With nature thoroughly routed and the ambiguities of existence on full display, life and death continue in directions both invisible and apparent. Gloriously funny and wonderfully serious, The Quick and the Dead limns the vagaries of love, the thirst for meaning, and the peculiar paths by which all creatures are led to their destiny. A panorama of contemporary life and an endlessly surprising tour de force: penetrating and magical, ominous and comic, this is the most astonishing book yet in Joy Williams's illustrious career.

As a successful screenwriter and teacher, Ryan has distilled the content of his popular workshops into this indispensable guide to developing dramatic and passionate screenplays based on compelling characters. Maintaining that writing by formula results in contrived and untrue screenplays, Ryan's technique is based on the premise that our best work comes from the heart--from the inside out. This book shows screenwriters how to free up the unconscious imagination in order to use what they excavate from deep within themselves to craft a screenplay.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WaqA09Dxwi8C&dq=Screenwriting+From+The+Heart&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speed Dating: The Smarter, Faster Way to Lasting Love","description":"Engendering Emotions examines the production and promotion of the idea of sex/gender difference in emotional experience and expression in the contemporary West.

Beloved by audiences the world over, performed from rural high schools to grand state theaters, Fiddler is a supremely potent cultural landmark. In a history as captivating as its subject, award-winning drama critic Alisa Solomon traces how and why the story of Tevye the milkman, the creation of the great Yiddish writer Sholem-Aleichem, was reborn as blockbuster entertainment and a cultural touchstone, not only for Jews and not only in America. It is a story of the theater, following Tevye from his humble appearance on the New York Yiddish stage, through his adoption by leftist dramatists as a symbol of oppression, to his Broadway debut in one of the last big book musicals, and his ultimate destination a major Hollywood picture. Solomon reveals how the show spoke to the deepest conflicts and desires of its time: the fraying of tradition, generational tension, the loss of roots. Audiences everywhere found in Fiddler immediate resonance and a usable past, whether in Warsaw, where it unlocked the taboo subject of Jewish history, or in Tokyo, where the producer asked how Americans could understand a story that is \\"so Japanese.\\" Rich, entertaining, and original, Wonder of Wonders reveals the surprising and enduring legacy of a show about tradition that itself became a tradition.

The stories in this collection, narrated by the airmen themselves, recount the harrowing adventures the airmen endured in their most trying missions over Europe. These are stories of encounters with enemy fighters, struggles to control flak-damaged planes, grueling crash landings, and desperate bail-outs from burning planes. Many airmen, fortunate enough to survive these experiences, were captured by the Germans once on the ground. Their treatment at the hands of their captors is painfully re-told here. Miraculously some airmen managed to evade captivity and escape the Germans, sometimes as an entire crew. In the course of the war, more than 30,000 young Americans lost their lives over Europe. As one airman said:  The real heroes...were the many...who died in combat.  These are the stories of other heroes who survived what seemed certain death. These are the stories of The Lucky Ones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vlqhkZWvbkoC&dq=The+Lucky+Ones:+Airmen+of+the+Mighty+Eighth&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],I={key:0},P={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,a){const g=f("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),n("div",M,[(e(!0),o(m,null,b(a.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",I,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const J=d(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-531822d7"]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/36.md","filePath":"glossary/36.md"}'),D={name:"glossary/36.md"},_=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(J)]))}});export{x as __pageData,_ as default};
