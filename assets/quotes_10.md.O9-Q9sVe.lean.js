The movie Ever After was such an attempt, but in trying to make a stronger female character, she just sounds annoying somehow. AT any rate, to my mind they failed. This book excels, marvelously. This is the Cinderella story we all wish we knew. Ella is strong-willed, but not aggressive. It's also a fun and emotional story. Give it to your daughter, or read it with her, I assure you, you'll both enjoy it. The Newberry Award is definetly justly given to this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was one of the most exciting books I've read in a long time. The author has an amazing style of drawing you into the characters. You get to know them and you actually FEEL their pain. The main character Ella has a \\"gift\\" of obedience (i.e. a CURSE) from a \\"well-meaning\\" fairy... she MUST obey any order given to her. Throughout the book you hurt right along with Ella as she struggles to overcome the curse.. but can't--therefore making her liable to playing the pawn to anyone's orders--the poor girl would even walk into a fire and kill herself if someone ordered it. You'll be ready to rip the book apart during times when her enemies use her.. and you'll cry with distress and anger at the torment the poor girl is put through. Its a wonderful twist on the classic Cinderella story! Its a definate MUST read for everyone who loves classic fairy tales!

I fell in love with this book the first time I read it, then again, maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic. Ella is enchanted with a curse of a well-meaning fairy - she must obey every command given her, even if it meant chopping off her own head. Sadly, her mother dies, but this is when she meets the Prince and becomes great friends with him. Or maybe something more... but how can she stay with him with greedy stepsisters and a curse that could destroy him? Find out. I first read this book in third grade, and I am now in eighth.

This fantasy is about a teenage girl, but not just your average, ordinary girl in the town of Fren (keep in mind that this is a fantasy), This is Ella! The girl who is cursed by obediance. When Ella was born, Lucinda (the fairy) cast a horrible spell on Ella, which Lucinda mistook it as a gift. Lucinda made Ella obey any and all orders you gave her. So if you told her to clean your room, do your chores, are even chop off her head, she'd have to do it.Ella must go on a fun-filled, sad, ecxiting and interesting, and even dangerous quest involving hungry ogres ready to cook you and gobble you up, or if they are in a hurry, eat you raw. Ella must fight for her life and rights to leave her obediance behind and save herself from being doomed to do anything you say, and from her evil money-hungry stepsisters and step mother mother.

It gives a very cute twist to the extremely popular story of Cinderalla by giving the leading lady more characteristics and spunk.

I always tend to flip through them and...ahem...&quot;help&quot; her select books that &quot;she&quot; would enjoy reading. As soon as I saw this book, my interest was piqued. I had always been a fan of alternative fairy tales, and the albeit short description on this one did not deter me.We bought the book.I happened to be the first one to read it, and as soon as I was done I ran to my sister's room and proceeded in telling her that she must begin reading the book RIGHT AT THAT INSTANT because it was just THAT wonderful. Even as a jaded old 19-year old, I had no qualms about raving in that manner because honestly, this is one of the sweetest, brightest books I have ever had the pleasure to encounter. And believe me, voracious reader that I am, I've read my share of books.I recommend this book wholeheartedly...because its heroine is a spunky, likeable girl that you cannot help but cheer for from the very beginning, because it's Prince Char(mont) is as down-to-earth and friendly as a prince could (and should) be, and because Levine is a fantastic author who made this twist on the Cinderella tale a true classic.Read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book first came to me when I was in sixth grade, at a time when I would only read if forced to - and sometimes not even then. My mother bought this book for me and insisted that I used it for a book report I was expected to write. In my youthful sillyness, I began to read this book with contempt, hoping to hate it, as loving it would provide my mother too much happiness. Fortunatly for me, Gail Carson Levine won me over with her fascinating retelling of the classic Cinderella story. Despite the fact that I had never sat down and read a book for more then a few minutes at a time - this book immediatly grabbed my attention, and kept me hanging on for hours on end. This became the first book that I began and finished in a day - at a time where I was incrediably reluctant to read or please my mother. After experiencing this book, I went on to become a real reader, who would pick up a book for fun and read for hours on end.

It is about a girl named Ella who is cursed to do what anyone commands of her. This leads to some serious issues.

The handsome prince finds her amusing and fun to be around. And the cook, her only friend, turns out to be her fairygod mother. Yet, because of her curse she will not have the happily ever after she dreams of. That is unless she can find soem way to reverse the curse.This book is filled with romance and a lesson in finding one's self. Yes, it was very predictable, but her thoughts, humor, whit, and the romance of the story made up for it all. I've read many retellings of almost all the fairy tales. This is by far one of the greatest. Levine keeps the main points of Cinderella while adding her own twist to the story.Ok, don't be confused, the book is absolutally nothing like the movie. While the movie was kind of good, the book was ten times better! I highly reccommend it!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an intriguing, captivating, powerful, inspirational, funny, endearing, romantic, adventurous, lovable, original, suspenseful, creative, eventful, FABULOUS book! I read it again and again, usually at least once within three months. I adore Ella and the characters have such personality. Their actions are believable and realistic despite the setting of fantasy and magic. The languages are creative, the romance is beautiful and sweet and not overdone, and every detail was perfect. Now whenever I hear the story of Cinderella in any form, I think of Ella Enchanted. I used to love Ever After, but Ella Enchanted leaves it in the dust! The ending is so powerful it always leaves me trembling and surging with adrenaline, and I read it aloud to my little sister because it hit me so hard I had to share it with someone. Then I stopped reading one night and she took it and finished it ravenously. She is now as smitten as I am, and we LOVE Gail Carson Levine!

She has to obey any order, even if it is to kill herself. She is determined to break the curse in which she can't be with her love Char.It takes a lot for a book to grab my attention, and this book did it.

This book tells the story of a girl named Ella. When Ella was born she wouldn't stop crying, so a fairy gave her the gift of obedience. The so called gift ultimately turns out to be a curse. Ella ends up getting so frustrated with the curse that she goes looking for the fairy to ask her to take it back. One reason I really liked this story is because it was very funny. It wasn't funny by what they said, but by how much the story is related to the fairy tale Cinderella. In relation to Cinderella, Ella has a fairy godmother, an evil stepmother and stepsister, and she falls in love with a handsome prince named Char. Another reason I really liked this book is because it had a genuine plot. Ella looks everywhere to find the fairy and asks her to take the curse back. However, the fairy refuses. Thus she starts to think that she may have to live with this curse forever, or will she? I also enjoyed this book because it was very descriptive. When I read it, in my mind I could picture what each person looked like. If any person should read one book in their life it should be Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. With its mixture of comedy, details, and an amazing plot, I think everyone will enjoy this book tremendously!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine is a fairy tale about Ella of Frell who has been given a \\"gift\\" of obedience by a fairy. Ella constantly was made to do things against her will. She tried breaking the curse many times, but her efforts were fruitless. Ella ran into many obstacles in her life, such as her mother passing away and her father remarrying, being in the finishing school with her stepsisters, and meeting magical characters like gnomes, ogres and giants. It was not until her adventures brought her to numerous encounters with Prince Charmont, Ella's curse was broken by the magical powers of love.Ella Enchanted is a modern fantasy novel and is very easy to read. The language that Gail Carson Levine uses is very descriptive and paints a precise picture. The reader is constantly wondering where the next adventure will bring Ella.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fairy tales. When I started to read this novel, I could not put it down until I was finished. The story completely submerges you into the world of magic and supernatural characters. Ella Enchanted is for all ages to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I scanned the reviews, and I didn't see any that were clearly posted by men. Most of the reviews seem to be by teenage girls--and let's face it, there's a teenage girl on the cover. This led me to post because I'm afraid a reader like me (a 27-year old MALE! gasp!) would be turned off to reading Ella Enchanted because (a) it's a &quot;chick book&quot; and/or (b) it's a &quot;kid book.&quot;Let me fix your understandable misconception--it's neither of these things, it's simply a &quot;GREAT book!&quot; I've long believed that so-called &quot;young adult&quot; books have the potential to be as good as or better than Harry Potter, but this and Louis Sachar's &quot;Holes&quot; are the only two I've found yet that deliver the goods. I could not wipe the smile off my face while reading.I realize that you may not believe me, you might just be embarrassed, or in this day and age, perhaps you're legitimately afraid of being thought a pervert! So, buy it for you girlfriend (note: acquire girlfriend if necessary--this has other benefits), give it to her, and then read it when she's not looking! OK?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"By retelling the famous fairytale Cinderella, Gail Carson Levine sends out the message in Ella Enchanted that in you believe in yourself, you can conquer the toughest things.Ella, who plays Cinderella, is given the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience by a foolish fairy, Lucinda. Now Ella must obey every direct order given to her, which is partly why she is such a klutz.To make matters worse, Ella's mom passes away. During her funeral, she meets Prince Charmont, or &quot;Char.&quot; He's very modest and understanding, and he cheers Ella up a bit. Unfortunately, Ella also meets Hattie and Olive, two self-centered and spoiled brats.Then, as if Ella's life couldn't be more miserable, her father sends her to finishing school in the town of Jenn with the disgusting slobs, Hattie and Olive. Soon, Hattie cleverly finds out that Ella is very obedient. So, being greedy, she turns Ella into her little slave. Strong-willed Ella doesn't take such torment. She runs away from school to try and break the curse but she's unsuccessful.With nowhere to go, Ella returns home. Meanwhile, Char writes her to her, expressing his deep affection towards her. Although she loves him too, she realizes the danger that her curse would bring him. She pretends to run away. How will Ella ever be able to live happily ever after?A descriptive, well thought out story. We couldn't stand to put it down. I was disappointed when the story was over. We wanted to keep reading.

Ella was a model child, as you can imagine, but once her peers figured out Ella must obey them, Ella becomes tormented.Of course there's lots more to the story...but that's for you to find out...I can't wait to read it to my daughter when she gets a little older...and the theme (It's worth all the effort it takes to be who you really are) is priceless."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought Ella Enchanted was the best book!

The characters are wonderfully realistic, especially Ella herself and Prince Char. The book takes several Fantasy/Fairy Tale cliches and turns them on thier ears. No one acts quite the way they should, the plot never goes the way you expect it to, and nothing is quite conventional. Great book! Fast-paced and full of wonderful ideas!

I guarentee that you'll love it. If you have never read this book, a quick summary: This book is another version of Cinderella, but the best version. Ella's much loved mother dies and her father is an unloving greedy merchant. Ella, her mother, and her cook Mandy (Ella's fairy god-mother) are the only ones who know about the spell of obedience put on Ella at her birth by Lucinda, a crazy fairy. Ella is sent of to finishing school with her evil soon to be step-sisters, but really wants to get rid of her evil spell. Her friendship with the prince, Char, grows throughout the book. There are a couple of parts that were really sad, but it ended up happy! I recommend this book to who ever I can, but mostly to 10-16 year old girls! This was the first (and favorite book) my sister read over 200 pages. If you are thinking of buying this for someone, please, buy it, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was so cool! The first time I read it the beginning was a little confusing because of all of the introduced languages and stuff, so I thought that was kind of strange. But Ella is so well described by Gail Carson Levine that you can feel the emotions as she struggles to overcome her wicked stepsisters' commands. I was so mad when her stepsister took Ella's necklace after she found out about her curse. It was all very suspenseful in the middle when she was with the ogres and I rejoiced at the end when...well, you'll have to read it to find out. I loved to book so much! I'm reading it right now for the fourth time and all of my friends are interested in reading it and asked if they can borrow it. This book is so beautifully written and the characters in it come alive just like Agulen's masterpieces! I loved the elves and d the ogres and I soon found myself worrying over the ending - whether Ella would break the curse and if she would get her wish of being with Char. This book is so awesome and I'd recomend it to everyone - in fact, I already have!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Rarely does one find a children's book that is as potentially appealing to adults as it is to children. 'Ella Enchanted' kept me up at night till the wee hours of the morning--I wanted to see what would happen!The first-person narrative is immediately endearing, capturing the personality of the main character in just a few lines. All the major characters are drawn and handled with care. My personal favorite was Ella's father--so heartless, yet so likable at the same time. Such a complex character rarely makes an appearance even in adult fiction.The romance between Ella and Char made me laugh and sigh by turns. While a deep romance featuring a fifteen-year-old girl is not exactly believable, if one succeeds in suspending disbelief there is a beautiful depiction of the relationship, yet without ever becoming overdone or sappy.I also liked the way Levine draws on elements from the original fairy tale while giving them a new twist--such as the obedience spell.The only problem I had with this book were the occasional logical gaps that detracted somewhat from the plot's believability. Yet this is a minor detail, and one that I would probably not have noticed at age nine--which is, after all, the ideal age to read this book. But a teenager or an adult who is interested in fairy tale re-tellings should enjoy this hilarious new spin on 'Cinderella'."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Imagine the story of Cinderella and her awful step sisters. Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella who is extremely close with her mother. When her mother becomes ill and dies, Ella's father must come home to take care of her. The father is an evil man and gives any young child the chills to think how unfair he can be. The rest of the book is for you to find out. I recommend Ella Enchanted for girls in the age range of 10 and 12. It is a page- turning novel that you can sit down and read for hours. This book has mystery, love, and magic. I loved this novel because it always made me look forward to reading it. Also, I was amazed in how the author, Gail Carson Levine, turned a simple childish story into a enchanting novel."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"At first I was not sure if I wanted to read Ella Enchanted. My friend told me so many time to read it but I thought it looked stupid. Then, my teacher started to read it to my class. I loved it SO much I went out, bought my own copy and finished it before my class. Ella Enchanted is about a girl who lives in the country of Frell, Ella. Ella is very close to her mother and her cook, Mandy. But also, Ella is cursed. When she was born, the horrid fairy Lucinda put this curse on her, and she is always obediant. I mean, if someone told her to never take her hand off her head, he hand would always be on her head. Likewise, if someone told her to slash herself through the heart, that she would have to do. So, this book is about Ella and her adventures to break the curse."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When i read this book, I couldn't put it down, litterally. I'm a school student, and i was spending my recess reading this book. I was also so moved by the ending, that I wanted to turn the page and keep on reading about their marrage and their children. I really think the author should write a second part to this book. It was the best book I've ever read in my entire life."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think that this book is fantastic! I could read it 1,000 times and still want to read it again. Every time I finish reading it, I feel good. It's a wonderful version of the Cinderella story, yet it's got more adventure to it, more things happening than just being a slave, having evil stepsisters and going to balls."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When I first borrowed this book, it was purely to kill time. Little did I know that this book was to be one of the most interestiing, humorous and enchanting book I have ever read. Ella or Eleanor is the daughter of a shrewd but rich merchant. When she was a baby, a fairy, Lucinda, cast a silly obedience spell on her. Ever since, Ella had to obey every single command given, regardless whether or not it was appropriate, and most of the time, against Ella's wishes. Luckily, Ella grew up in a household which loved her dearly, espeacially her Mother and her cook cum fairy godmother, Mandy. However, after her Mother dies, her father, a man which had never cared much for Ella, decides to send her to finishing school. Much as Ella hated it, she had to obey. Worst of all, she could tell no one of the spell cast on her, a promise to her dying mother to prevent Ella from being exploited. From there on, she meets wicked and greedy step-sisters, a downright horrid step mother, some orgres and of course, her good friend turned loved one, Prince Charmont, as Ella ventures to find Lucinda to remove the silly obedient spell from her. This stories spans a few years as Ella struggles to maintain her dignity and wits while searching for a solution and sacrificing her own love and feelings for her Prince and her country, with hilaious results and touching scenes. This book is a definite must-read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In a world filled with superfluous novels, ancient tomes, and convoluted texts aren't we all grateful for an amazing book that can be finished in one or two sittings? And when a marvelous book crosses your way that's less than 250 pages and captures your attention on every page, it is truly something out of the ordinary. In Gail Carson Levine's charming tale Ella Enchanted, the use of a confidante, the appeal of a rebel, and an atmosphere of the surreal coexisting with the real are effectively used to create a character and a story that are both appealing and engaging.Ella is introduced immediately in the book who, as a baby, was cursed by a fairy with the \\"gift\\" of obedience. This curse forces her to do whatever somebody tells her. From a simple order of \\"hold this for me\\" to \\"jump up and down\\", Ella has absolutely no control once told to do a task. Throughout her constant dilemma though, Ella has a friend and confidante--Mandy. Mandy is Ella's cook and subsequently her fairy god mother. When Ella goes off to finishing school Mandy gives Ella a magic book that comforts Ella and keeps them connected. The character of Mandy offers Ella someone with whom she can confide in, a person whom Ella can truly convey all her heartfelt emotions and deepest thoughts. When Ella relates her fears of attending a finishing school, her feelings toward her step family, and her love for the prince, Ella's thoughts are revealed to be smart, funny, and charismatic- a character with whom the audience can connect. Through having a confidante, Ella is able to have an ally against all the evil that is going on around her. Mandy doesn't completely shield Ella from harm, but lets her deal with life independently coming to her aid when necessary, transforming Ella into an independent character yet also one who knows when she needs the assistance of others. Through having Mandy, the cook, be Ella's confidante, Ella's sensibility and good character are revealed as someone who transcends the normal societal bounds between a wealthy girl and the hired help. This attests to her unassuming and non-judgmental nature. The character and role that Mandy plays gives Ella an avenue to display her best qualities which truly captivates the reader, and makes the reader want to absorb further into the novel.The book and consequently Ella are also engaging as it has the appeal of a rebel to obedience. The target audience, usually young to preteen girls are the chief individuals who have so many figures that they are forced to obey. Whether it is parents, teachers, older siblings or the popular crowd, there's a level of obedience that rules a girl's childhood and teenage years. Even adults have to answer to some line of command. Thus, the idea of rebelling and becoming one's own master has universal appeal. Ella's rebellion to her forced obedience also portrays a consistency of will. She becomes endearing to our eyes as the girl who never simply succumbs to her fate--rather works tirelessly to try and change it. Her rebellion to her obedience also attests to the excellence of this book as it creates a situational irony where the reader knows that she will have to obey and succumb, but they never stop wishing that maybe this time or maybe after this next order she will finally have the strength to break the curse. Her strength is present throughout the entirety of the novel and it is that drive that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat- constantly wishing that Ella will finally be able to, through force of will, be able to break the curse that has been laid upon her. Her resistance to her obedience also makes her an entertaining character, one who constantly surprises the reader by how willful she can be even after being put into the worst of circumstances. Ella is simply a fun character to read about and her rebellious nature helps to further establish the relationship the reader has with her and the entirety of the book.The book is also appealing and Ella engaging as it portrays the atmosphere of the surreal or magical in coexistence with that of the real or every day. There is a general appeal to this by large audiences. One needs to look no further than the box office earnings of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter to see that the general public is attracted to this sort of environment. The world enjoys a level of magic that can be seen as acceptable and usable along with the ordinary and mundane. Most people wish in some way to have a little bit of magic incorporated into their own lives, and wouldn't mind having magical powers or knowing someone who had the ability to control some form of magic. The use of the surreal in the real also adds a mystical aura that enchants the audience. By now, young girls and adults alike are used to living in a real world, accustomed to everyday disenchantments such as being told that Santa Claus and the tooth fairy do no not exist. In Ella's life, magical situations are still prevalent, and one is appealed to this prevalence as one wants to be able to hold on to some form of the impossible. It's the idea of enchantment- and the wish that it could be held onto forever. Through having the surreal represented equally with the real, the book is transformed into one of transcendence, one that is raised from the mundane and ordinary to a world where acceptance and understanding is given to all creatures- elves and giants, centaurs and gnomes. They are all joined into what is commonly accepted by society. It is a testament to the book that this acceptance of such a strange and marvelous world alongside a \\"normal one\\" is involuntary and automatically falls into and engages the mind of the reader.Ella Enchanted is truly a \\"spellbinding\\" tale that is not only engaging but a fun and enjoyable quick read. Through Gail Carson Levine's masterful employment of the role of a confidante, one can truly understand Ella's inner thoughts and feelings. These feelings lead the reader to realize the depth of Ella's character. Ella's rebellious nature is also a quality that entertains and creates a bond between the reader and Ella. Through having a surreal and magical world displayed as coexisting with a normal society, the book is made even more entertaining and Ella is even more charming as both portray a level of acceptance and type of atmosphere that the audience wishes on some level could happen in their own lives. Ella Enchanted truly is enchanting tale, and though it is a short novel and takes little time to finish, you will want to read it again and again."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In this retelling of the Cinderella story, a girl named Ella works to remove a curse of obedience placed on her since birth. The story contains remarkable characters of every shape and kind. Speaking as one who's a fan of any book with a strong female at the story's helm, I couldn't help but be impressed that Levine made certain that her heroine, Ella, never become defined solely by her curse. All in all this novella is well written, if a bit too reliant on stereotypes. One such example involves the girls that eventually become Ella's step-sisters. You know that they are evil because they are fat and stupid. I had little difficulty disliking them when they were cruel, but at the same time it was hard not to object to the constant references to their eating. Apparently such gluttony is a sign of pure wickedness. Sorry, but aren't there ways to display evil in slightly more malicious ways? All in all I liked the story's moral and Ella's unique method of breaking the curse. Now with a potentially popular movie on the way, expect to be hearing a lot more about this little story as girls everywhere discover it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I liked this book because it had many parts when there was some suspense like when Ella was captured by ogres. I wasn't even sure if she would come out alive after they were done with her. This book also had some romance in it like when Ella and Prince Charmont,Char, meet each other for the first time.This book is about a little girl named Ella. When she was born a fairy named Lucinda bestowed a gift for her. Ella was given the gift of obedience. Whenever someone gave her a command she had to follow it. She meets a nice prince named Charmont. They fall in love with each other and they get married.I would recommend this book to a reader who enjoys reading books about a magical world. The reader needs to like books about a world of magic, a world of unimaginable creatures, and a world like ours, filled with chaos. The reader needs to have a good amount of time on their hands because there's a twist around every every corner and when they start reading they won't want to put the book down."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am a sixth grader. I really liked the book, Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. In the begining of the story, Ella Frell was born with a \\"gift\\" by a fairy named Lucinda. She always has to obey someone else's orders. When Ella got a little bit older, her mother died.After her mother's funeral, Ella decided to go see where her mom got burried. Then she meets Prince Char. He told her how her mom had alway s made him laugh. They were talking for a very long time. Until her father noticed them. When they get home, her father orders her to go upstairs and change. When she got down stairs, alot of people came up to her and said sorry about her mom. Then her dad came up to her with a lady. He told Ella that she was her new step mom. Her name was Dame Olga. She had two girls with her. Those were here new step sisters. One was named Hattie, and the other one was Olive.After everyone left, Ella's father forced he to finished school. He didin't want his daughter to grow up being a clumsy cook's helper. Before Ella went to school, her fairy god mother, Mandy,gives her a magical fairy book that can show her children's stories, journal entries, maps and, most precious to Ella, letters from friends and family. Mandy also gives Ella her mother's necklace.The day that Ella was sent to finish school, she goes no a field trip with Prince Char to see her favorite places. Through out the rest of the book, Ella comes across many strange creatures. Will Ella ever break her spell? Well, you have to read the book! :}By: Nikki L."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought \\"Ella Enchanted\\" was very good book. I didn't like the middle of the book because barely anything was happening right then. Ella was born in Frell. Lucinda (a fairy) cursed Ella while she was little and crying a lot. The curse was to be obedient. She didn't have a father at home; he was a trader. She was a friend of her cook, Mandy, who is also Ella's fairy godmother. When her mother died she first met Prince Char at her mother's funeral. Later, her father married a rich person named Dame Olga. She had two daughters, Hattie and Olive. Dame Olga made poor Ella a cook, another servant, not a family member. They realized that they were in love when Prince Char wrote a letter. I can't believe Ella wrote a letter to the prince while he was away in Ayorthia, to make him upset and not love her. Next, she went to a welcome ball with a mask on and Prince Char noticed her as Lela. Then, Prince Char and Hattie found out she was Ella. After that, she was ordered to go to her room. But, she refused to do that. The part I couldn't believe was when Ella broke the spell by not going to her room. So later on, she got married to the prince and lived happily ever after. Like other stories do, too."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella enchantedElla enchanted is a good book because if you read it to a small children they will first be happy then cry it's a fabulous book .

So you want to find more about this book then read it ."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Hahah, I wasn't aware that this is a retelling of Cinderella until halfway through the book. I enjoyed it even more after that because this makes Cinderella more human than ever (why she would be that obedient, why she would marry a prince she'd met for only what, three times? etc. etc. I especially love the explanation about her father's going away and leaving her with her stepmother). In this book, Cinderella is intelligent, sarcastic, and spunky without being too obnoxiously so.The only problematic thing I find is the way Char seems willing to marry Ella even when he thinks she's \\"Lela.\\" Oh, this girl reminds me of the girl I was in love with, so let's marry her. There are also some untied businesses. For example, I feel that Edmund deserves one more mention before the conclusion.But overall, a very nice and funny book. :D"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I found Ella Enchanted to be a delightful spin on a classic tale.

The fantasy setting gives a Because of Ella's \\"gift\\", she must obey everything commanded her. That is one of the key features in the book; something that gives some humor and adds to the plot.

Do you think of obedience as a blessing or a curse? Ella Enchanted is about a girl, Ella, who was about 15 when her mother dies. She and her mother were really close to each other and to all the maids and butlers in their little castle. Right after her mother dies, her father gets married to a horrible, nasty bug that ruins every moment of her life. Her stepsisters are always bossing her around, and she has to do whatever one of them will say. The reason for this is because when Ella was five, the horrid fairy, Lucinda, came to her, and cursed her. The curse was that she always had to be obedient. She had to give up a lot just because of this curse. He was told not to tell anyone, but if someone was around her for a long time, they could tell that there was something different about her."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Gail Carson Levine is a wondereful writer.

This book is based on a Cinderella story. It's about a young girl named Ella who lived with only her dad and her cook, Mandy, after her mother had died when Ella was almost fifteen.

Later, she was sent to a finishing school with her two selifish step-sisters. She stuggled with her curse for a very long time, but in the end, she finally got peace and happiness just like Cinderella.What I like about this book is that it's adventorous and it tells you about a girl who believed in herself and achieved her goal. When the story ended, I pictured in my head, what would happen next and i tried making my own story. I wished that this was a never ending story so that i could read about what happened to her next after she married the prince. Did the evil fairy, Lucinda come back and give Ella's daughter a curse too? There were so many questions and wished i knew the answers.

Then there are attention-grabbing languages, new and unusual customs, and quite different schooling as well as the fairy tale balls and many other fascinating things. This book isn't just a fairy tale. It's an in depth account of the life of Ella. Granted, we all know the ending, but by reading this, you\`ll understand even more how she got there.

The main character, Ella, is adventurous, vivacious, strong-willed, and funny. Ella never stops running into conflicts; something exciting or scary is always taking place wherever she goes. While reading this book I was always being introduced to new characters, settings or important secrets, so I never got bored. I felt that I was apart of everything that was happening from the very beginning.I feel that Ella Enchanted could interest any reader because it has so many different events. Some parts of the story are sad, some are adventurous, and others are fun or wild. Since this story takes place in a make-believe fairy land the things that could happen are not limited to specific events, you honestly never know what is in store for Ella next.

The spell makes her do whatever someone tells her to do. If you say could you help me out she has a choice but i demand like help me out now is something she has to do. She meets Char the prince and he is fasanated by her. Her father comes home and makes her go to finishing scholl with horrible girls that starve her because they figured out that she alway does something some1 demands and she only survives because the potion her fairy godmother gave her. She also goes off to find the fairy that put the spell on her when she was yound and alot of other things happen that i won't tell or it will ruin it for you, but this book is a book that you need to get. It is a book that is well worth the price and will be a treasure to have in your library."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is really exceptional. I loved it, am still in love with it, and will probably love it forever. I read it in around 6th grade, and loved it from the first page to the last one. I am now in 9th grade, and it is still my all-time favorite book. I highly suggest this book for any reader who likes fantasy, romance, adventure, comedy, and action. It is about a unique girl, Ella, who must go through many difficult times. She has a horrible curse put on her when she was born by a fairy, and must always obey a command given to her. If someone said to her, &quot;Jump off a cliff.&quot; she must go and jump off a cliff. It is a Cinderella story, with lots of twists and turns along the way. There are evil step-sisters who figure out Ella's curse, and order her to do- and NOT do- lots of horrible things. She also befriends a handsome prince along the way. If you ever read a book in your life, then definitely read Ella Enchanted and you'll love it too!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a really good book! It is a fanasty story about a girl who's mother died. Ella is under a spell and it really plays a hudge part in the story. I recomend it for 10-13 year olds."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is absolutely wonderful. Ella,is a daughter of a wealthy merchant and his wife. She was was given a &quot;gift or curse&quot; whichever you would like to call it,when she was born. The gift of obedience,looked wonderful to the fairy Lucinda,but was not that lovely to Ella. She has to obey a command no matter what, otherwise she would die.

I read it in one sitting and enjoyed every minute of it. What a wonderful book for young people."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought Ella Enchanted, written by Gail Carson Levine ,was a wonderful novel and very well written! I loved it so much; there were times when I could not put the book down. Intended to be a good gift, Lucinda gave the gift of obedience to Ella at birth. It turned into a very nasty spell though! There were times when I felt very bad for Ella, such as when she had to give her necklace, which had great significance, to Hattie because she was told to, or when she had to stay upstairs when Char came to visit because Hattie told her to, and he thought Ella just didn't want to see him. I basically thought the whole spell, in general, was quite sad! Although I thought that the spell and some of the things Ella had to do were upsetting, there were some terrific parts in the book. I loved how she got to go back and live with Mandy, Ella's fairy godmother, and I also loved the part when Ella and Char, the prince she wanted to marry, were sliding down the stair rails. I found that part of the book very entertaining! I also loved how Ella and Char re-met. Ella wore a mask to the ball, just wanting to see Char once more, and then, her mask got pulled off, and she was revealed! I thought it was a very creative way to have them meet again. I was excited it all turned out the way I had hoped, and it had a \\"Happily Ever After\\" ending. Ella Enchanted was the classic Cinderella story. I would recommend it to anyone because it is a very good and entertaining book! It may be a little difficult for some people to get into it, but once you hit a certain point, it's a wonderful story that is good for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is very well witten.

It was just what I love, adventure, mystery, suspense, and romance. Most of my favorite books have those characteristics. I read lots and lots of books. Ella Enchanted was my 2nd favorite book in the world, which says a lot judging by the hundreds of books I read and love. Ella Enchanted was fascinating and mystical. I loved it. I give some credit to my friend who lent it to me (I'll have to buy it myself though, it was so good} and most of the credit to the brilliant author, but some credit must to the idea itself. The book was fantasy really but had such a realistic attitude with the romance etc it seemed very real indeed. I didn't put it down till the end. It was great. It was amazing. What more can I say? It's just that when I love a book so much I'm not satisfied until I let the whole world know about it. I certainly hope everyone with a good imagination and a love of adventure and romance will get to read.

The first time I read it was 5 years ago and when i read it i got immediately hooked onto it. I've never really been able to put it down since. Everytime I would feel sad or lonely I'd read it, the book is so cute and romantic and its a real tear jerker at times too.It has so many characters and creatures that make the story really interesting but the writing is very good at the same time as to not confuse you with everything. The story is about a girl Ella who was cursed at birth to obey whatever anyone tell her to do. Her mother died at an early age so she grew up with her father and was mainly looked after by her cook, who was also a fairy. As she grows older, she begins to seek Lucinda, her fairy godmother who put her under the curse, to take it away. Along the way she meets many unusual characters such as giants, ogers, etc. and also the handsome prince, Char.This book is most definitely a book for all ages.

This story is somewhat like Cinderella, only with a little twist.I liked this book a lot. It showed me that I can overcome anything I want, even if it seems impossible. One of the things I loved about this book is that the author built up the main characters very well, and I felt I really knew them. But she didn't bore me with just the facts about the character. I thought the plot was superb too and very original. It was a fast-paced book (although I thought it started a little slow,) and I liked how the author, Gail Carlson Levine, used first person to capture Ella's thoughts well.

Alas, Ella was also given the \\"gift\\"--by another name a curse--that makes her obey any order given her. (Boy, there's a plot detail ripe for abuse in other hands, eh?) How this all untangles to its conclusion makes for a magical story that I loved more than the original or any other novel of its kind I have ever read. Pure enchantment for pre-teen girls or anyone who seeks a delightful happy story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book has been one of my favorites ever since my teacher lent it to me in the 6th grade. Ella's integrity and intelligence really shines against the dumbness that is her step-sisters. She takes on her problems without waiting for the prince to rescue her.

Its just an amazing story overall, and don't judge it by the movie, they changed everything."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedBy Gail Carson LevineElla only wanted to be a regular girl. But instead the day she was born, a curse was bestowed upon her. The gift of obedience. The fairy Lucinda does not think before she gives these silly curses and so when Ella is told to do something, she has to do it. If someone told Ella to kill herself she would have to obey. When Ella's mother gets very sick and dies, Ella is left with Mandy her cook that is her fairy godmother and her father. Ella's father traveled all the time and he doesn't know about her curse. Just like her mother said \\"Don't tell anyone about your curse.\\" Ella had to obey.But when Ella's dad introduces her to Dame Olga and her dreadfully bossy daughters, Ella realizes that the elder one, Hattie knows that Ella will do anything she says. Hattie commands Ella to give her the necklace that Ella's mom gave to her. But there is a silver lining on the story. Ella becomes dear friends with Prince Charmont, or as his friends call him, Char. Just when Ella thinks that Char and her are becoming great friends, Ella's father ships her off to finishing school so she can become a true lady with Hattie and the spoiled Olive (Hattie's sister).Finishing school is the worst place for Ella. She must obey every command no matter how awful or difficult. When Ella cannot stand it anymore she runs away, and decides to quest for her fairy godmother and reverse the spell. But Hattie had forbidden Ella to see Char. So how will she be able to tell him how she really feels when he thinks she never wants to see him again?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I picked this up on a whim.

One of the stepsisters discovers the curse Ella suffers, and uses it against her. In an attempt to get rid of the curse,Ella runs away and goes in search of the fairy Lucinda, who gave her the \\"gift\\" of obedience.

Filled with ogres, elves, a stepmother and stepsisters who just might be of the evil variety, or at least the self-indulging kind, and a prince who might just be charming, this book puts a new spin on the old Cinderella tale.This is a classic book in the retelling of fairytales genre, humorous and containing a strong heroine. Ella is kind-hearted and independent, fighting against her curse in every way she can think of. Ella will delight readers of all ages and surprise them as they discover everything that leads up to the famous ball and glass slippers.Now in its third edition, Ella Enchanted has just been re-released again as a hardcover. The new cover (above) features a real girl and shining gold trim, which matches the other re-releases of Levine's books. All the books have been re-done in honor of her newest book, Fairest. Personally, I like my beat-up copy that comes from the movie release, with Anne Hathaway on the cover. She makes an excellent Ella, and her picture tends to attract an older reader. Even though Ella is fifteen for the majority of the book, the two non-movie covers feature girls who look about twelve. Personally I find this misleading, and I originally avoided the book because it seemed to young for me."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The prequel to Cinderella, Ella Enchanted, is a mind-boggling telling of the story of Cinderella; telling you what happened before the \\"Once upon a time\\", how she ended up with her step-sisters and mother, and how she met the prince before the big ball! You also learn about her father, her real mother, and her other fairy god mother, who's enchantments more trouble than you think. A modernized Cinderella story, all the details missing from the fairy tale, are filled in, Gail Carson Levine has showed my dad and I how much was missing from the real version of the Cinderella story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book for a class I took on fairy tales and really really loved it. This is a fantastic read for children and young teens and a great way to give young people a different, more empowering fairy tale heroine story.The book follows the daughter of a travelling salesman, Ella, who is under a curse from an unpredictable, showy, fairy that 'blesses' people with her poorly thought out birth or marriage greetings. Ella is blessed with the task of obedience, meaning whenever someone gives her a direct command, she must respond to it - although she can find loopholes to get out of doing what people ask her to.The plot of the story mirrors Cinderella, but also gives explanations for all those things you were ever wondering about the original Cinderella story. After her mother's death, Ella's father realizes he is quite poor and needs to either marry Ella off, or get married himself before other people figure it out as well. He charms a widowed woman with two daughters and they make plans to get married - meanwhile, Ella is sent off to charm school with her stepsisters, one of which figures out Ella's condition. Ella realizes she needs to find a way to not only break the spell, but find a way to save her father from his marriage by entering into a relationship with someone she already has romantic feelings for - the local prince, Char.Plenty of excitement and drama unfolds as Ella escapes charm school and is united with all sorts of magical beings, Char himself, and the workings of her family. Again, a great telling that adds a bit of logical (if you can suspend your disbelief in the magical setting) sense to this classic fairy tale!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I won't sit here and type a mile long review but will tell you this is my FAVORITE book and i can read it over and over again and love it more everytime!!! It's the perfect fairy tale with a happily ever after ending!LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book about three or four years ago, and it still hasn't gotten old to me.It is also MUCH better than the movie, which completely sucked. If they made the movie exactly like the book, it would have been a hit.Anyways, I say that anyone should read this! It is and will always be for sure my most favorite book.I also reccomend books by Meg Cabot, she rocks!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Up until recently, I had only seen the movie staring Anne Hathaway. I was pleasantly surprised to read a story that was so far from the movie. I am a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien and enjoyed the fact that Gail Carson Levine created her own language for her characters in this novel. I also enjoyed all of the extras that came in the book. Most helpful was the dictionaries of Abdegi, Gnomic, Ogrese, Elfian, and Ayorthaian.I never get tired of hearing old fairy tales brought to life in new ways with clever retellings. This is a new and exciting way to read the story of Cinderella."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I bought this because my students were reading the book. They usually like to read it themselves, but we only had one week to read it. They absolutely loved listening to the cds. The reader did a fantastic job of distinguishing the voices. The only disappointment my students had was that she was not Ella in the movie. They also hated the movie because the reader made the story so real to them, they actually asked me to turn off the movie because it ruined their memories! My highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The best thing about this novel is that you can read it through in about three-four hours if you have the time to do so. I first heard the book's story in audio form (I'd seen the movie), and wanted to go through it with my own eyes and mind. I liked reading it on my own mostly because there were details that I missed on my first escape into Kyrria (missed that in the movie, eh?) that I was finally able to fully appreciate.(Cinder-)Ella's story in this book is a bit different from the movie version with Anne Hathaway. It really is more evident that this is a Cinderella re-telling when you read the novel. So, here are a few things to whet your appetite if you like.--mini!SPOILERS--1. Ella goes to boarding school with her stepsisters. This is where she meets Areida (they're roomies).2. Ella is Char's penpal for a great while--this is how they get to know each other because she doesn't spend a lot of time travelling.3. Ella is made into a servant in her own home.4. There are three (count 'em, THREE) balls for Char, and Ella goes in masked disguise to each one.5. Char's parents are alive.So, if that doesn't set you in the mood to read it, I'm not sure what else I can tell you to convince you... unless you are under a curse of obedience like lovely Ella. If so, you simply must purchase this book if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book of\\"Ella Enchanted\\", by Gail Carson Levine, is an excellent book. If I had a choice to rate this book for the stars I'd give it 5 stars.In this book there is a girl named Eleanor of Frell, who is also called Ella. I gave this book 5 stars because of the magic and fantasy, as in the fairy named Lucinda giving the gift of obedience, but I didn't expect the fairy's gift could be a curse? The story also gave examples of what she would have to do if she was ordered to do something. As in, if Ella was given a command hop in the rain for one hour, then she would have to. If she was told to kill someone, she would have to. Every second of her life was in danger. I also like this story because it shows tragety and sorrow. Ella had to go through some difficulties with her family. Her mother had died due to sickness and her father had remarried to an evil stepmother, Dame Olga, with two other daughters, Hattie and Olive.I rated this story as I did because it also involves unexpected turns and disbelief. Like Mandy, her cook, and Prince Char to talk to when she feels sad. Later, Ella had found out that Mandy was her fairy godmother all along! This story also involves andventure and mayhem. After Ella had found out that Lucinda was the fairy who gave her the gift of obedience, she had started her journey to find her and try to remove the spell forever, except Lucinda didn't remove it, Ella had to find a way herself. This story includes romance and the decission of Prince Char's saftey. He had ordered her to marry him but Hattie ordered her to her room. This was when Ella was able to break the curse! She didn't have to take anymore commands and was free at last.A title that I'd recommend if you like stories along the lines of fantasy, magic, tragety, sorrow, unexpected turns, and romance, it would be \\"The Two Princesses of Barremere\\". I personally loved both books and have more to come."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella was a fun, cute normal baby...that was until she was given the gift of obedience by the fairy Lucinda. Now, Ella has to obey whatever anyone commands her to do, or she will undergo the nausea, head-pounding, sick feeling that follows if she doesn't.After her mother dies, Ella's uncaring father decides to indulge in a relationship with rich Dame Olga. Dame Olga is a fat, snotty, and insolent woman who has two daughters, Hattie and Olive, who are going to attend finishing school. Ella's father opts to send her to finishing school with them. When Hattie makes Ella do something unimaginable, she decides to run away and find Lucinda. Her plan is to make Lucinda remove the curse.The author takes Ella to strange places, including an ogre camp, a giant's wedding, and a ball for her beloved friend Char.Sadly, the movie Ella Enchanted had nothing to do with the whole Cinderella-like plot of the book. The book is much better than the movie, and plenty more satisfying.Ella Enchanted is a fun, enjoyable, lovable read over and over book. It is the kind of fantasy that readers of all ages will enjoy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is one of the great fairy tales alternative stories available out there, and this ones is based on the famous Cinderella tale with a twist. This is written in a post modern style of writing, making it easier to actually connect to the characters and much more enjoyable for the young adults to above ages to actually enjoy for what used to be just a children's fairy tale. The first time I'd picked this book up, I can't seem to put it down. It's humorous and a page turner.The main character is Ella of Frell, who had been given the 'gift' of obedience (more of a curse) by a fairy named Lucinda, giving her no choice but to obey anybody who orders her around ever since she was a baby. The only ones other than her mother who knows about it is Mandy, their cook who is also Ella's fairy godmother, who has this thing againt doing any Big magic, which irked Ella most of the time due to her 'gift'.When her mother died, her father remarried to Dame Olga who has two selfish idiotic daughters, Hattie and Olive, who sort of figure out they could take advantage of Ella's little flaw, though very clueless why she's easily to be made as their own personal slave. Then there's Prince Char, the heir of the kingdom. Both Ella and Char enjoyed each other's company many times they are together and apart. But of course the 'gift' had come to its worse moments in this book for Ella in the sense of relationship with others. She tried whatever it takes to track Lucinda to take 'gift' back.Oh, if you're expecting it to be just like the movie, forget it. You be surprised of how different they are from each other in plot wise. But nevertheless, I've enjoyed both version."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is really well written! This is one of my favorite book now! Gail is a great author I tell you! I admit it, the book is much, MUCH more fun than the movie. The book is more fun and exciting. Even though the movie and the book have the same title, the story is very different. The only same part is that Ella is cursed and that Prince Charmont and Ella fall in love. Well there are other several parts that are alike though. This is like the story of Cinderella but abit different at some parts.The story is that Ella has a curse of obedience from a fairy named Lucinda. When Ella is in her teens (like about 15 or 16), her mother dies. After the funeral, Ella meets Prince Charmont/ Char and they both become good friends. After the funeral the people who came to the funeral, come to Ella's house and they all talk there...Ella's father, Sir Peter meets a lady named Dame Olga who has two daughters named Hattie and Olive. Hattie, Olive, and Ella do not really like each other...Since Sir Peter thinks that Ella isn't an elegant lady, she sends Ella to finishing school along with Hattie and Olive. Finishing school is a place where you learn to become a nice lady. Before Ella goes to finishing school, Mandy, the old cook, give Ella some presents. One present was a fairytale book. Another present was a necklace that Ella's mother had. At finishing school, Ella makes only one friend. Her name is Areida. They both are really nice to each other and never fought. They always help each other. After staying at the finishing school for a few months, Ella couldn't stand staying at the place any longer so she runs away. In the book that Mandy gave to Ella, Ella could also read journals and letters that people wrote. Ella once read Sir Peter's letter and that said that he was going to a wedding at the giants place and there are going to be fairies there. When Ella read that, she decides to go to the wedding. Then lots of things happen from there....Read the book...I recommend that you read it. I can assure you that you will like it..Maybe guys won't but I'm sure that the girls will enjoy reading the book. It is a fantasy, comedy, romance story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Anyone who's familiar with my book reviews on Amazon will know how utterly critical I can be. I'm a nit-picker. I can't help but write long reviews that point out all the books' faults in great detail. But I really can't fault this. It's brilliant. Gail Carson Levine is a master storyteller, and no one does fairytales like her..although many have tried to emulate her, none really succeed.This is the best retelling of the Cinderella tale that I've ever read, and I've read a LOT of them! In fact, this is actually much better than the original. The characters in it really come alive; they're three dimensional and believable, and best of all, the prince really is charming, not just handsome. I fell in love with every character, good or bad. But I especially loved Ella. In spite of her curse, which might have left most people feeling bereft and used and angry and afraid to leave the house, she still loved and lived her life, and cared deeply for those around her. She was truly inspiring, a brave heroine and ideal role model.Even though this is a kids/teens book, I assure you, adults will still love it, and absolutely should read it. Remember, you're never too old for a good story, and this is REALLY good. If you're trying to find the magic in your life, if you're still looking for your own happy ending (or even if you've already found it) then this will definitely appeal to you.This book actually bears very little resemblance to the movie 'Ella Enchanted' so even if you've seen the movie, you should still read the book. And if you haven't seen the movie yet, you should, because like this book, it's brilliant."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In this book a young girl named Ella is born. When she was born a fairygodmother named Lucinda gave her a gift of obedience. She did everything she was told. She couldn't help it. Then her mother died and she was told not tell anyone of the curse. Her father was a trader and was gone most of the time. One time when he came back he was married to a woman named Dame Olga because of her money. He had just lost almost all of their money on that trip. When he left again she had to go to a finishing school with her stepsisters Hattie and Olive. They were very rude and obnoxious girls. Hattie quickly found out that Ella did everything she was told. At the school she met and ayorthian and became great friends with her. Then many other things happen, but they would give away the ending.Gail Carson Levine did a good job on writing this book. It was always keeping my interest. Everything about her writing was great. I think one of the best parts is when she runs into Ogre's in the forest. I chose to read this because I loved the movie and I had read the book before so I read it again. This book keeps you entertained the whole time. I think the book is better then the movie. It has 240 pages. I would definitely reccomend this book to my friends. I think it is a great book and everybody would love it. The intended audience was people from sixth grade on up.

It is the tale of a young girl named Ella who is under the spell of obedience and must obey every order given to her. As you read, you will follow her adventures through the forest of the ogres and the land of the giants. Ella Enchanted is just as exciting as it is well written. Levine does a great job capturing the imagination of audiences of every age. Though it is grouped as young adult literature, it never fails to strike the awe in the older audiences as well. This is a book that will make you look forward to every page and make you never want to put it down. With every chapter comes new adventures of Ella and her wonderful unicorn, apple.

I loved it! It was soo good! Anyone who loves fantasy stories or who just wants to find a good book to read, this is for you!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Feminists often denounce traditional fairy tales because they perpetuate the ideals of a patriarchal society by encouraging girls to behave like proper princesses and wait for charming princes to take charge and save the day. In response to these traditional fairy tales, many authors have tried to reclaim the realm of fairy tales for girls. These retellings feature active protagonists who are not scared of taking charge and do not need princes to save them. One example of this new fairy tale genre is the 1998 children's novel \\"Ella Enchanted\\" by Gail Carson Levine, which takes an untraditional approach to retelling the story of Cinderella. The novel addresses several specific feminist issues, specifically negotiating and fighting the burden of obedience, the importance of female friendships and, of course, learning to save yourself.The story is set in an imaginary, medieval-esque kingdom called Frell. A roaming fairy named Lucinda gives Ella the gift/curse of obedience at Ella's birth. As a result, Ella has to do everything she is told, no matter what harm it might cause to herself or others. (In the novel, the severity of Ella's curse in constantly underscored with passages explaining how little control Ella has over her own life: \\"If someone told me to hop on one foot for a day and a half, I'd have to do it. And hopping on one foot wasn't the worst order I could be given. If you commanded me to cut off my own head, I'd have to do it.\\") As the plot moves forward Ella is compelled to leave home to try and find Lucinda and ask her to lift the curse. Along the way she also falls in love with Prince Char. For varying reasons, depending on the version, Lucinda refuses to lift the curse. Further difficulties arise as Ella continues her quest.That's the main body of the story. The Cinderella element is relevant mainly to the last quarter of the novel where actual elements from that story (the slipper, the ball) appear in the story, although the evil step-sisters and fairy godmother are present throughout the narrative.There are several reasons that I love this novel and recommend it to everyone. The first is that it's an imaginative retelling of Cinderella which makes the story exciting for readers familiar with the original version without making it too abtruse for readers who have never heard of Cinderella. Also, the book is full of great role models for girls. All of the female characters are strong, self-aware women--things seen far too rarely in the fairy tale genre. The novel is narrated in Ella's voice. This makes it easy to see how strong Ella is as a character (especially at the end of the novel).The other great thing about this book is that it all seems authentic, never over the top or under-written. In addition to creating immensely likable main characters, Levine creates a compelling world within the pages of \\"Ella Enchanted\\" vivid with details ranging from Elvish and Gnomish languages to customs at a Giant's wedding. The story is an immensely entertaining page-turner that will (even better) leave readers feeling satisfied when they reach the final scene where Levine ties everything together, artfully blending empowerment with a happy-ever-after ending fit for a traditional fairy tale."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It was as if I was living the story myself. That's how wonderfully amazing the words got to me. If you think that this is another lame version of Cinderella, think again! This story is filled with more adventure, more romance and much, much more passion."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a great twist on Cinderella, and is, in my eyes, better than the original. If you are my age (13) or at least 9 and you like to read, this is one book that I would highly recommend. It's a book that you would want to reread. It is about a 15 year old girl named Ella who was given the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience when she was born. To break it, she has to find the fairy Lucinda, who cast the spell on her. You will enjoy the characters, such as Prince Char, and the elves, gnomes, giants, and fairies, but others you might not like, like Hattie or the ogres."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is about a girl who was given the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience when she was young. She is determined to break it. Can she do it? My favorite character in this book was Ella because no matter how hard it was to do stuff, she never gave up. She had to fight ogars, be a housemaid to her step- mother, an dgiven all of her money to a girl named Olive. Over all I would give this book the best rating of any of the books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a great book for everyone who likes fun, fantasy and humor and has a good imagination. I even dare to compare it with Harry Potter! It sweeps you away from this world and into a fantastical land inhabited by ogres, elves, giants and fairy godmothers. The heroine, Ella,is cursed at her birth, and must always do what people tell her. Even if it means killing herself. This curse prevents all her wishes from coming true, and she sets off on a quest through her magical world to break it. People of all ages should read this book. It will give you a good laugh, a good cry, and a route to escape into a wonderful land while you're reading it. And believe me, you'll want to read it over and over again."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an extremly funny, unpredictable and well-written story.

Ella is such a funny and delighful character, I wished for days that she was my sister.

I will be sure to read this tale time and time again."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have read Ella Enchanted tons of times and I am eager for more!

This book has it all! If you haven't read it, read it, NOW! I LOVE IT!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is definatly the Best book I have ever read. True, it is based on Cinderella but,that's the good thing. It is intresting to see how Gail Levine compares the two stories. When Ella was born she was blessed with a good(really bad) gift, obediance. If someone told her to chop off her head, she wouldhave to. Hattie figures out Ella's obediance. Ella is made her slave. Ella falls in love with a prince. Does he love her? Do they marry? If you want to find out, read this great book. You won't be able to put it down. I recommend this book to anyone from 1-100! Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was truly one of the best books I've ever read (which are not too few). First of all the setting, I instantly connected with it, just the thought of there really being such a place filled with princes, ogres, elves, dwarves, fairies, I love it all. Now, coming from a child of the KoRn, those are pretty strong words. Gail Carson Levine has a devine way of conveying the emotions of her characters. I pride myself in my emotional strength and, well, coldness, but I felt every moment of happiness, every tear, every hint of pleasure or nervousness. If you are alive, read this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is great. I cried for the last chapter. The story about Ella being cursed for obedient is really exciting. The story is also very humorous and touching. A great book, that's all I can say!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When you think of 'Cinderella' you think of a polite young lady. But, Ella is the exact opposite. Although all the MAJOR points are the same as the Disney version, most of the details are quite different. For example, Ella's curse. That was in none of the original tellings.Ella gives you a real sense of what a real cinderella would be like. Char is a charming character, and I love the obviousness about the two of them ending up together.All great cinderella stories have a time where Cinderella and Prince Charming are seperated (Like the movie EVER AFTER). And this book has it.Although some times in the book it gets slow (rarely), it always picks itself up again.This is one of the best Cinderella retellings I have EVER read!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I decided to read the book after I saw the trailer of the upcoming movie featuring Anne Hathaway. I loved the book, it keeps you captivated since the very first pages. It was so long ago since I last read a book like that.

This story is very touching and even far better than Cinderella. I definitely loved the book and strongly recommend it for all children... and grown-ups, why not?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have loved Ella Enchanted for years. I have read it about 8 times (literally)and I hope that anyone who reads it will love it. It is smart, witty, and full of great characters. I have seen that there is a movie being made of the book, and I fear I will be very disappointed. Miramax seems to have ignored most of Levine's excellent storyline and characters and have kept only the idea of a cursed girl named Ella falling in love with a Prince Charmont, struggling to be able to live a normal life and marry her love. Most of the other characters have been altered in some way (example: Mandy is quite old, with frizzy hair and two chins. She is not Minnie Driver), King Jerrold and Queen have been killed off and an evil uncle has been introduced to add extra, unneeded menace to Ella's curse. It looks frighteningly like cotton-candy fluff entertainment. Let us hope for the best.

Lucinda the senseless, dim-witted fairy blessed (or rather cursed) Ella with the gift of obedience. Ella must follow all orders given to her. If someone told her to cut off her head, she would! Disaster strikes when Ella's mom dies. Ella and her mother had a really close relationship, so Ella is devastated when her mother dies. At her funeral Ella meets a really kind young man who just happens to be Prince Char.Then Ella's father (she doesn't know him very well) decides to send her off to boarding school. There she meets two mean girls: Hattie and Olive. Hattie has realized Ella's obedience and has secret \\"meetings\\" where she orders Ella to do things like give her belongings, steal cookies from the school pantries, and order not to be friends with the few nice girls Ella is friends with.Ella finally runs away from the boarding school and puts matters into her own hands when she goes in the dangerous forest surrounding Frell (where Ella lives), which is full of ogres to find Lucinda. Ella is soon captured by an ogre, but manages to escape easily. Ella decides to go to a wedding for two giants who want to get married. Mandy, the cook at Ella's house is also a fairy. She has told Ella about Lucinda though they are not on speaking terms. Mandy was the won that told her not only did Lucinda bestow blessings/curses on newborn babies, but also gave blessings/curses to newly wed couples.Ella finally made it to the place where the wedding would take place. She searched around for Lucinda, looking for the fairy through the descriptions Mandy had given her. She finally found who she thought was Lucinda with a man and women who she guessed were also fairies.

He sees Ella and asks her to marry him and then orders her to marry him, not knowing about Ella's curse.

Ella falls in love with Prince Charmont, the prince of Kyrria. The spell did not make her fall in love with the prince. Ella is sent to finishing school by her father, Sir Peter, to learn the proper manners of a young lady and how to dance, sing, and sew.

If you crave a good book, you should definitely read Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"ELLA ENCHANTEDBy: Gail Carson LevineReviewed By: Nancy ElbassirPeriod 3The book Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine is one of the most exciting books I have ever read. It is about a teenage girl named Eleanor (aka Ella) who was put under a spell at birth by a fairy named Lucinda. Her spell was that she would always be obedient. If any body told her to do something, she would have to do it right away. Also, she would have to do exactly what they said. If someone told her to jump in a lake or hold her tongue, she would do literally what he or she said. If she didn't she would feel heavy pain, such as headaches and soreness. Her life has just taken a turn for the worse. Her father is sending her off to finishing school, (medieval college). She also meets and falls in love with Prince Charmont, whom her stepsister wants to marry.I really love this book. I have read it about 5 times, and I'm still not sick of it. The book is a fascinating twist to and old fairy tale, with interesting, funny characters. My two favorite quotes from the book were: \\"I took a sprig of bogweed and placed it in a rose.\\" This quote got my attention because it shows the one way Ella makes use of her curse. When her evil stepsister Hattie orders Ella to pick a bouquet of roses for her, and Ella picked an herb that made Hattie completely blank for a few moments and answer any question Ella asked her.The other quote that caught my eye was \\"So I took it with me, a trophy.\\" This quote interested me because it was funny. It was funny because it happened when Ella stole Hattie's wig. She had absolutely no idea what to do with it, so she took it, deciding that she may be able to sell it.My favorite part in the book was when Ella met Hattie and Olive at a mourning party for her mother's death. I loved it because Ella was so openly rude to them and they were too stupid to notice a single thing.

I have read it so many times that I lost count. Ella Enchanted is a story of a girl who is given the curse of obedience and struggles to overcome the spell that dictates everything she does. She must do every thing that anyone asks. It is a lot like Cinderella but at the same time so different and so much better. This book is so wonderful and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good adventure story with a dash of romance."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I picked this book up because I saw the movie that is based on this book a while back. First, I need to say that the movie was only very loosely based on this book - I recognized bits and pieces, but I was surprised at how much was changed. Even many character personalities were changed. It was a bit odd, at times, but I found that I enjoyed the book a great deal more than the movie. Ella was cursed at birth to always do what anyone tells her to do. In response, Ella tries to either delay her reaction to an order or to carry out the order in a way that the person who gave it never intended. This allows Ella to live a fairly tolerable life. However, after a girl at finishing school discovers Ella's curse, her life becomes much more miserable. Ella tries to find a way to break her curse, but her life gets even worse when her father marries a horrible woman with two equally horrible daughters. One of these daughters is, unfortunately, the girl from finishing school.The book is a bit darker than the movie ever was, and I was constantly wondering what new and horrible order others would give Ella. The Char of this book seemed a much more likely future king than the Char of the movie, and I grew to like this one more than the other. The author handled the emotion of the story perfectly, and I even cried a little about some of the things that Ella had to do. This is the kind of book that I was always combing the shelves of the library for when I was younger: it's an interesting young adult book that doesn't insult the intelligence of its readers."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is a young girl who was given a gift by a fairy named Lucinda . The gift was oedience . Ella had to obey every given command . But it had to be a direct command, such as \\"put on your shawl\\" or \\"go to bed now\\". A wish or request had no effect on her. if any one found out about the spell she would be in danger . So ever since Ella was born she's been in danger . SO Ella gose out to find Lucinda to take the spell back . Dose Ella ever find Lucinda or is she stuck with the spell forever. READ THE BOOK."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"She just turned 13, and read this book in a day! Then she told me the entire story..very creative idea, twisting a well known fairy tale. Now she wants to read all of Gail Carson Levine's books. It's also on the Accelerated Reader list at school, so she can test on it as well. I'm glad I trusted the reviews and bought it for her. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book, almost everyone I've heard of who has read it has loved it along with me. But you know how sometimes, you feel like a book is yours, not really anyone elses? That's how I feel about Ella Enchanted.I don't like telling the plot of a book in reviews, I think it is kinda beside the point. But I do write them to tell people what are good books and what aren't, and I'm here to tell you This book is EXTRORDINARY!!!!!!The thing is, why are people so harsh on the beginning? From the first page I was hooked, I don't understand how some people think that a fairies curse to &quot;Be always Obidient&quot; could not capture their interest immediately. I, myself couldn't wait to hear Ellas fate, her complex character and bubbly spirit making her a first class-friend.Hello to the people who think that it is too similer to Cinderella, DUH, that's deliberate. It IS Cinderella (Ella-The main character, the prince's name is Char-you know &quot;Prince Charming!?) Whoever didn't figure this out is, I think Brain-washed. An amazing peice of Fiction, I am very happy to give it five stars. :-)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. The way the author paints a picture in your mind you would almost wish it to be real. The story is almost like Cinderella. Its a whole diferent world- in one book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought this book was absolutely wonderful. They way that Elle was trying to overcome what she saw as a fault in her self was exactly like what teenagers go through everyday. I had my child read this and now, a year later she is still reading it and rereading it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"As a parent who listens to children's audiobooks non-stop I have to say that this is one of my absolute favorites!!The story is suspenseful and imaginative with delightful and convincing details, while the reading done by Eden Riegel is superb. The tape kept me engaged and delighted, the diction is clear, the expression convincing, and the production the most professional.I laughed, cried and sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see how Ella would resolve her painful dilemma.Not only will your children appreciate the wonderful story and excellent reading, but parents will be engaged and delighted as well."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When I first heard of this book, i thought it would be another boring book about the midevil times. However when my friend recomended it, she is said that it was an awsome book. So after reading I felt the same way. This book is hilarious, surprising, action-filled, and has romance. The ending surprised me and i was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; This book has taught me to never judge a book by its cover. So i would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys fairy tales."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book the 1st time and loved it! Then I reread it again and again! I read it over 7 times! I recommended it to my friend and she loved it too! If you like fairy tales you'll love this one. It has humor, romance, and truth. It relates to girls now and then. The main character, Ella, is strong-willed and hilarious! Any girl can relate to this book and love it! The love story is one that any girl would die for and only imagine in dreams! It's my favorite book and it'll stay that way for a long time! So, if you have a thing for romance fairy tales this is your book! Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book! It is just wonderful. I know I'm supposed to write what it's about but that would give it away. It is funny, and romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time. I laughed out loud, cried out loud, sighed, and just melted into this world of Ella's. The begining is perfect the middle is perfect, the end is perfect!!!!!!! If you havn't read this book, you must get it now! Good for any age any gender any person who loves fantasy! And for those who like to keep a foot on the ground too! You can feel her pain and joy as if you were Ella. It's just beautiful. I also recomend all of Gail Carson Levine's other books. She is just amazing..."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is an excellent, imaginative, well written, can-put-it-down book. The fantastic storyline will draw your attention from the first few lines, to the very last words. I couldn't put it down, it was so great! This fantasy book is about a girl who was cursed by a fairy at her birth. All throughout the book she tries and tries to undo the fairy's curse. She has a magical fair god-mother who helps her along the way. Ella's mother dies and her dad finds a new, evil wife. Like Cinderella, she has an evil stepmother and stepsisters who make her work all day and night. Of course, they stepmom and sisters go off to a ball to dance with the prince, but Ella was not able to go. She goes anyway with a mask on so they won't recognize her. The prince falls and love with her (she falls in love with him too) but he can't find her again because he only saw her in the mask. Eventually, they get married and live happily ever after.So...you're probably thinking this book is like Cinderella. Well...it isn't..but it is. It's more of a twisted..more fantasy, and more imaginative than the original Cinderella.Maybe it's called ELLA Enchanted from CinderELLA....Anyway, I definitly recommend this book for anyone (even adults) who like pure fantasy!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Before I read this book I read The two Princesses of Bamarre, and that one convinced me to read Ella Enchanted, and I don't regret it(what I should regret is not reading it), when I begun reading this book I could not force me to put is down is incrtedible, This the third time I read and I don't get tired of it. Besides, the curse explains her slavery and it also makes funnier the story. Mrs.Levine explains it all so well it makes you hate Hattie and love prince Charmont! I really recomend this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I recommend this book for everyone! It's really good. This is my favorite book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I totally loved this book. I got it at the library and then after I read it, I wanted to buy it. So I did. This was such a fascinating, detailed book. I loved how Ella could speak so many languages so well. She reminds me of, well, me. She isn't just a girl who is like in the Disney movie, Cinderella, or in other books. Ella actually has a mind of her own, despite her awful curse. If you want a book that's well written with romance, drama, fantasy, you really should get this book! I lvoed it, along with so many others!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is the most wonderful book I've ever read. It takes you back to places of your childhood fantasies, where you now have told yourself you are to grown up to go. My best friend and I talk about this book all the time ( it's her favorite too.) This is an uplifting, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book first in seventh grade for a book report (we had to choose from a list). Right away I went and bought my own copy and have read it dozens of times since. I think this is such a great twist on the old Cinderella story with a special &quot;Anything's Possible&quot; message. I am hoping to get a hardcover edition because my paperback is wasted. :)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"We probably all grew up with the story of Cinderelle stuck in our heads, right? Maybe I'm wrong, but Gail Carson Levine really has the best version of this story of a girl who's mother dies and her father remarries a nasty stepmother who has to terrible daughters, know to Ella as stepsisters. If you seek fairies, trolls, enchantments, or just a thrilling adventure, this is the book for you. I've read it four times in just one week, it was really hard to get enough of it, I can't wait to read it again, and again, and again. I really recomend that you purchase this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a great book about Ella who had a curse put on her thatshe must obey anything anyone tells her to do.It is afairytale/romance. i won't spoil the end because you should read it to find out!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a great book! It will keep the action flowing in every page. Sometimes you'll think this book isn't worth reading but it is! Ella has to go through hundreds of spells and problems. It is a great feeling to hear about other people's problems and not just yours. The author gives great detail of everything and paints a picture in your head of what is happening in the book. READ THIS BOOK! It is worth it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought this book was wonderful! I couldn't put it down for one second, because it had my attention. I recommend this book to any kind of reader.Gail Carson Levine did an excellent job! Ella Enchanted is now one of my favorite books!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It's a great book for people that do not think that theCinderella story is very convincing. I think that it makes a greatbook to read to classes and one that is good to read by yourself."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an enticing book about a young girl who has been cursed. She's forced to obey all commands.She meets the prince and they fall in love. When he asks her to marry him she's forced to decide whether to marry the prince,or save the kingdom. I thought that it was a very good book, filled with excitement, romance, and suspense."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"If you like fantasy books, you will like Ella Enchanted. Lucinda, a fairy, has put a curse on Ella, the main character. Now, Ella must obey every command given to her, no matter what it is. I liked this book because the author, Gail Carson Levine, kept me reading to find out if Ella looses her curse or not. I did not like this book, because I do not like fantasy books. If you like fantasies, and you like suspense, Ella Enchanted is the perfect book for you. Readers will also like the audio book, because the reader is very good. She can do many different voices, and she reads very smoothly."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a great fantasy book by Gail Carson Levine. This great book has won a Newbery award and it definitely gets my vote. This story has many great and magical adventures. That is exactly why I would personally rate it four stars.When young Ella was just a small baby, she was cast under a curse by a fairy named Lucinda. This curse was that if she was told to do anything, she would have to do it, so when Ella grew up she just hated that curse so she went and started on an adventure to try to find Lucinda. In the book there are great times when Ella meets new friends and sometimes new enemies. I could not even put the book down when I started to read the first chapter.Ella Enchanted would be a great book for people who love stories about fairies and magic of all kinds. Kids 8-14 would definitely love this book, it even became a movie. This book has a lot of great word choice's which made the book come alive as I read it and the book had perfect voice so that it felt like the person, Who was speaking, was right next to me talking. While I read it I noticed that it has great fluency that combined the sentences and made it be a lot easier to read.Over all this book was a definite thumbs up!!! I hope that other people will like it as much as I did because this book is on my top ten list for life!!

Gail Carson Levine's heroine is so fully real, it's such a great find to come across a young adult's novel (and a fairy tale, no less) with a strong female character to whom it is so easy to relate.

Anyone who knows a young girl, should recommend this story to them."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a story a girl named Ella. She has a spell that was caste on her.

I didn't think that her books would be good until my mom read Ella Enchanted to me. I was so entranced by this book every free minute I got I would beg my mom to read it to me. After we had finished I wanted to get it. For my eight birthday I got it and soon after I had it signed by Levine herself! I love this book so much that it is in the top 5 on my \\"favorites\\" list. In it there is romance, spells, wit, humor, and touching moments. Cinderella is a children's story, but Ella Enchanted, though based on Cinderella, is nothing like that. My enitire famliy loves this book, including my dad!This book is a MUST to read, and is a very special, priceless, valuable part of my colection of books."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is the best book ever written. I love languages- like saying the elvish in Lord of the Rings. I loved trying to read gnomich and elvish and giantish even more. I would practice every word until I got it perfect.Ella is pert and hostile to the world. Like me. She hates having people decide for her.Hattie is wretched. I have never met [as far as books go, and fortunatly not in the real world either] a more sadistic, pernicious character. I loathed her and Olive as much as anyone could possibly hate anyone else. She is not a fearsome idol [as is Mr. Doom in Dave at Night.] She is stupid and souly jarring.Mrs. Levine has done an admirable job, and I commend her for her efforts."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The first time I ever came across the book Ella Enchanted was in 5th grade. Now, in 7th grade, the book is still my favorite as much as ever. This is how I got hold of it: my teacher had just ordered some new books, this book among them. I offered to read Ella Enchanted first. For the first few pages, I didn't think it would be very good. But that didn't last long as Ella was forced to endure finishing school with the odious Hattie and Olive. By the time Ella had escaped and been caught by ogres, I knew I was forever hooked. The story is very similar to the fairy-tale Cinderella. This is just a longer version, talking about life before the evil stepmother and stepsisters and before Ella's mother died. This is very creative, and each time I read it I like it more. It's been, ever since that fortunate day in 5th grade, my absolute favorite book. In fact, I've read it so many times, that it's falling apart and a few pages are missing. But it doesn't matter since I have those pages memorized! My heart is fluttering every time I get to the part at the very end, my favorite part, of the three balls where Char (prince Charming) and Ella (Cinderella) reunit and get married. Of course, in the balls Ella fasions herself as Lela of Bast, instead of Ella of Frell because of her curse. She knows that if she marries Char while cursed she and her whole country would be in peril. I always shiver in delight when Ella finally breaks the cures- out of pure love for Char and determindation to save him and the country she loves. I highly reccommend this book and am proud to rate it a five star book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Wow!... I am a big reader, and I have read this book about 30times! I'm not kidding! It's a great book. The only thing is, itcould be written better. I mean, it's a great, wonderful absolutely fantastically imaginative book with a great plot and all that, but it could be kinda, oh, phrased better. If you want like better written books, go read something like Harry Potter (by the way those are good too). Other than that, I thought it was the best book of the... millenium!

Once you get to the last four or so chapters, almost everything is the same, so for people who dislike the story of Cinderella, they might want to consider skipping this book.2)At the start of the story, (after all the history of how Ella received her curse), Ella seemed like an intelligent girl with human emotion/human thoughts that readers could relate to. Once she realized she was in love, she started to lose some of those thoughts and act lovesick and (possibly) even ditzy.3)Some situations in this book were hard to follow and had almost no point in being in the story.My final recommendations for this book is to do \\"research\\" on the plot and characters before buying."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I did not like Gail Carson's Ella Enchanted. I thought that Gail Carson focused too much on the beginning, and then rushed the end. It was way too predictable and the plot was kind of shallow. Ella made a big deal in the beginning about not going to finishing school, and she's only at finishing school for a couple of chapters. It seems that all the characters exaggerated and make a big deal out of something, and in the rest of the book, the problem just seems to go away. Some of this story, like with the prince, was too coincidental that it was unbelievable. Its fun to get lost in spells and a mystic land, but the magic parts of the story was not the part of the book that was out of this world!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted, is about the beautiful princess Ella who is daughter of the king,and had a curse put on her by her fairy godmother, Fairy Lucinda that she would attain and become obediant, this curse was extremely dangerous as Ella had to listen and do everything that anyone told her, no matter what it was.Ella grew up in a magical state with constant visits from princes, especially her childhood friend Prince Char from other kingdoms who wished to marry her, but when her darling mother died, Ella was in tragedy, her mother had been the real queen and had abducted her place to her husband who was really meant to be a duke, therefore Ella and her father lost all their money making them broke.Her father then married a rather wicked lady who had two ugly and uninteresting children, Olga and Hatty, he did this because he needed money to survive and this family was an incredibly rich one.When everyone found out about their lack of money Ella's stepmother grew very angry and plotted on Ella, she soon found out all about her weakness and asked Ella to give all her precious jewells to her.Hatty and Olga were also extremely cruel and asked her all kinds of questions and asked for all her neckalces and her mother's beautiful necklace.Ella grew sader each day, especially when her father neglected her and let her leave with her two step sisters into the cruel life of boarding school.He also let her stepmother leave at her home during the special ball Prince, Char was giving to choose his bride.As you can see Ella had a rather neglected childhood.But just like Cinderella, Ella's fairy godmother came and helped her arrive punctually at the ball.When Char saw Ella he fell in love at once and danced seven times with her.Ella made up that she was Princess Llea from a distant kingdom, in a faraway town.Char was smitten and at once fell in love with this free-spirited and unique princess.The very next day, Char came to Ella's house and asked for her hand, Olga and Hatty seeing this as a powerful advantage try to force Ella to marry him and Ella struggles to overcome her weakness and in the end......................The end of this fiery classic was so good you have to read it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Any sane human will not be able to help falling in love with this charming, excellently crafted novel.

Before she is Cinderella and meets the prince, and they like eachother from the start. This tale has a truly awesome twist to it, making more adventure etc. with it. You will enjoy it, I promise you that."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Boy, I really liked this book it rocked! ... I loved it:>!! There were a lot of questions I had though. ... I really liked the part about how Ella could talk to the birds and the ogers. I'd probubly recomend Ella Enchanted to8-12 year olds.!!!!!!!!ENJOY!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I fell in love with this book the first time I read it. I'm 13 now and I've already reread it 4 times in the last 2.5 years. I love fantasy, but I don't like the regular old fairy tales. Something has to be dramatically different for me to continue reading the book. This is why I also love ROBIN McKINLEY's work. It's a light romance, nothing to heavy and I would recommend it to ages 8 and up. The ogres and dragons really made the story exciting. It seems that this girl's life is all horroble turmoil but in the end she ended up saving herself. READ IT! READ IT!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"My gift will exceed all others, I give Ella the gift of obedience.\\" POOF and that was that, Ella would be cursed forever.Ella, a spunky 14-year-old, who loves adventure and a good laugh, was left motherless and cursed. She must strive to break the spell if she wants to marry her only true love. Mrs. Levine tells this enchanting story with a Cinderella twist. She knows just how the centaur feels and precisely how the orger lures you in to their awaiting jaws. I loved it! Will Ella break the spell? Read this mythical book to find out the answer. I would definitely recommend Ella Enchanted to any 10-13 year old girl who loves a good page-turner."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"( This review is written from the main character&#65533;s voice )Hey guys! This is Ella. I am going to tell you about the great book called Ella Enchanted, which I am featured in. I think that this book is the best book I have ever read. It is about me falling in love with this guy named Prince Char. I also run into a lot of trouble because of this stupid obedience spell that was casted on me. I end up having to live with my dreaded step-family and going to finishing school. Unfortunately, my mom ends up dying. I think that is the worst thing that happens in the whole story. In the book, I find that every bad thing that happens to me brings me even closer to Char. When I meet Char, I crack a lot of jokes. Whether they are corny or not, he still laughs at them like they are the funniest things, he has ever heard. At first I thought that he is a stuck up prince guy like his father, the king, but when I look deep into his charming eyes, I immediatley fall in love with him. I met Char while I was mourning about my mother&#65533;s death, under a tree in the woods, all alone. After a while I heard a soft voice say, &#65533; I am sorry you mother died. I liked her, she was very funny.&#65533; I turned around and it was him. It&#65533;s not very romantic, but hey, it&#65533;s true. Thanks to my helpful maid/ friend Mandy, I have been able to pull through my troubles and live happily ever after. If you want to find out what happens with me and Char, READ THE BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"this book was wonderful.

Gail Carson Levine couldn't have done better. Ella is cursed tthough it is supposed to be a gift from a fairy. However the fairy is to stubborn to remove it the ending is the best. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In ELLA ENCHANTED by Gail Carson Levine, the main character (Ella) was cursed as a baby. The fairy that &quot;blessed&quot; her as a newborn gave her thr gift of obedience. In short, if she doesn't do what she is told, when she is told, she would get very dizzy, and very sick to her stomach. By the second chapter, I felt the way she did, when she did; which made the rest of the book extra interesting.At times in the book, it was very wierd. But mind you, it was also very poetic and moving. So poetic and moving at times, that I had to stop reading for a day or two just to break down the meaning of a phrase or sentence. The book was mainly about Ella fighting with the curse, or with some of the characters. Most of the characters helped (or tried to)Ella reach her goal of over coming the curse.Also, some of the characters made it amazingly hard for her. Like when Hattie, and her younger sister Ollie demanded that Ella give them her Mother's only surviving possession, a priceless necklace.Eventually, she saves her prince charming,a real prince, from an ogre. They live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love how Gail Carson Levine rewrote the story of Cinderella. I could feel all the emotions of the characters.

Levine enterweaves the classic story of Cinderella, an adventure that leaves the reader hanging for more, and words that slip easily into teh reader's mind and are as tasty as Ella's fairy tonic. A good read, and a classic in the frazzled-fairytales genre."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book! Ella is so funny.

It keeps you reading and wondering, so take my advice, read this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was packed with action and romance, it was so interesting how Ella just fell into these &quot;spells&quot; and couldn't love the prince but wanted to. I very much recommended this book, especially if your an adolescent female.

THE FORESTWIFE- high tale of Maid Marian &amp; her Robin Hood. CROWN DUEL- countess in war becomes captured by a mysterious, quiet, and handsome Marquis, who's also her most hated enemy.

I think that it was a lot Cinderella at the end, but Levine put a twist on it the story that made it truly splendid! I know they say this book is for 9-12 year olds, but I disagree! I am 13 and although this book wasn't very sophistocated in the writing, the story was one that can be appreciated by all ages. If you liked this book, I suggest reading Beauty by Robin McKinley. It was a lot like Ella Enchanted in that it's sort of an old fairy tale rewritten."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a story of a girl named Ella who is given the gift of obedience by a foolish fairy named Lucinda.

When Ella makes a new friend and is ordered not to have a friendship with her she hates the curse. When ogers catch her and order her not to go anywhere they almost eat her. The curse could have killed her! The curse is especially horrid when Ella is ordered to give Hattie the necklace she got when her mother passed away.

Levine puts a spin on the classic Cinderella story, and makes her \\"Cinderella\\" so much more than a good girl longing for a life of love. Ella, unlike most girls, longs for freedom and independence. She is given the \\"gift\\" of obedience at birth by the renegade fairy Lucinda, and while she has a fairy godmother, only Lucinda can undo the spell. This \\"gift\\" instead of causing Ella to become docile and meek, instead brings out her spunk and spirit causing her to become more of a rebel than anything. While she must obey direct commands, she tries to hold out against them as long as she possibly can and more often than not finds ways to evade the instructions so that another, more direct order will have to be issued.Like the classic Cinderella story, there is a Prince, step-sisters, and a horrid step-mother. However, by having Ella and Char, the Prince, get to know and befriend each other before any aspect of \\"love\\" come into play and by not focusing on Ella's physical attributes, but her personality, the eventual romance between the two is much easier to believe. While the stepsisters are horrid and do awful things, Levine gives them each a distinct personality. Her characters seem to dance with life and none so more than Ella herself."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A Story To Be ReadBy:Johnny Lee SanfordI highly recommend the book Ella Enchanted to other six grade students. Ella Enchanted is about a girl that gets cursed at birth and gets mistreated by her family and fairy god mother. I also feel that Ella presents a strong plot because of its exciting introduction and compelling resolution.This book Ella Enchanted presents a strong plot simply because it contains an exciting introduction. The setting begins in a fairytale land with Kings and Queens and even unicorns. Its extreme detail made me feel like I was right in that time period. Ella Enchanted is so interesting anyone would enjoy this book from reading just one page of the introduction; you probably would not be able to stop. At the beginning of the book you are given a good description of each character.My second reason why I would recommend the book Ella Enchanted to six grade students is because of its compelling resolution. Ella Enchanted finally had her curse lifted because she never gave up her hope. Ella also meets a Prince named Char who she later gets a crush on. After the spell was broken, Ella confesses love for the prince and they get married.Do you want a book that will keep you awake at night, if so, pick up this exciting book Ella Enchanted at your local library or at a local book store."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A Review of Ella EnchantedImagine a story based on Cinderella, a story where a young girl is trying to break her curse bestowed on her as a baby. In Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted, Ella learns that good as well as bad, can come out of a tragedy, helping her to later break her curse. Ella meets her father for the first time and is sent off to finishing school with her father's friends daughters, and soon flees in the night. Ella's escape leads to many adventures, including finding the love of her life; Prince Char. I recommend this book to anyone who needs to realize that sometimes something good can come out of a bad thing.Some of the main characters are Ella, Char, Mandy, Hattie, Olive, and Mum Olga. Ella is a teenage girl trying to break her curse of obedience. Char is a prince who befriends Ella on her journey. Mandy is a cook who reveals her true identity to Ella shortly after her mom dies. Hattie, Ella's vulgar stepsister, loves controlling Ella. Olive on the other hand isn't the sharpest and will do anything for an extra shilling.Some of the main themes in this book are adventure, love and honesty. Ella is reluctant to go to finishing school and when she is sent runs away, only to discover she has made a big mistake. Soon Char comes to her aid, and escorts her back to Frell. In the end, Ella has to sacrifice her happiness for the safety of someone she loves.This book takes place in a medieval time period, in the hillside country of Frell. A fraction of Ella's time is spent in finishing school, but in desperation runs away. She returns to fathers manor only to discover she's moving to the Olga's. Soon Char has to leave for some princely duty, but little does she know that soon Char again will rescue her."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"ELLA ENCHANTEDThe book Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella who had acurse since she was a baby.

This tale of Ella's journey to break her curse of obedience which was given to her as a \`gift' from Lucinda, a fairy, at birth will have everyone who picks up this book absorbed in its tale of love, ogres, evil step sisters, forbidden friendship, and of course a prince. I love how the author has taken the classic fairytale story of Cinderella with all the elements from the story including a fairy godmother and glass slipper, but has put a more realistic spin on it. For example all fairies have to follow certain rules or there will be severe consequences. Ella Enchanted will keep you on the edge of your seat, and as the story unfolds it will show you that ultimately you are the only one who can determine your destiny."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Great book.

It's intelligent, witty, and fun, but it has enough depth not to be forgotten. I think Ella herself is possibly the best part of this book. She has such a strong personality and voice, and her sense of humor makes her especially likeable from the very beginning, as though she has a perpetual smile quivering on her lips and an eyebrow always good-naturedly raised at the fantastical world around her. She also has the ability to feel deep emotions like love, in which she can be self-sacrificing but always remains human (with a bit of a feisty edge).The only part I thought could be a little longer, or a little more fleshed out, was the ending. A few things after the ball happened a bit too fast for my taste. I considered giving the book only four stars because of this, but I reconsidered.

I'd recommend this book to a friend.(...)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Over winter break, I read the book, Ella Enchanted, which was written by Gail Carson Levine. The genre of this book was fairy tale. Gail Carson Levine has also writtenThe Two Princesses of Bamarre, Dave at Night, and, The Wish. Ella Enchanted has 229 pages, but it looks a lot longer than it is. Ella Enchanted is the best book that I have ever read!The plot of Ella Enchanted is mainly how Ella defeats a curse that was given to her at birth, by a not so smart fairy named Lucidia. Ella's curse is obedience. Ella has to obey every direct order given to her. She goes on a quest to find Lucidia, to convince her to take back the curse. When Ella's plan to meet Lucidia backfires, she is convinced that she will be cursed forever. Ella and a prince fall in love with each other, but the prince eventually has to leave to fight off ogres for 1 year. When the prince returns, his father hosts 3 balls, so that his son will find a maiden to marry. Ella attends all three of the balls, and the prince falls in love with her. But in the end...read Ella Enchanted to find out!The characters were written with such great personalities that if they hadn't been fairies and ogres that they could almost be believable. One character was a fairy and a cook at the same time, but she always had time to be nice to Ella. She supported everything that Ella decided to do. Ella was kindhearted and she loved everything. She also went through some of the things that real girls go through, a crush on royalty, and arguing with parents, etc.From the sound of how the author wrote about the setting, Kyrria. The author tells about the gardens and the beautiful flowers that fill it up, and how they are from all over the planet. The author also tells about the great weather that they have in Kyrria. Kyrria is also home to the most gorgeous castles in the world. \\"The walls glow yellow-gold, suggesting cheerful fires within.\\"The main thing that I liked about this book was that it was romantic, but not too romantic.

I also have this book at home. When I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down! You could be any age to read this book. If you like fairytales, then this is the book for you. I think that Ella was a very couragous character, and she shows us that we can do anything if we put our mind to it. Ella is given a horrible gift as a baby. She must obay people's orders, even if that puts her in danger of dying. Now Ella goes on a journey to find the fairy who did this. Will the fairy help her? Or will Ella help herself? Get this book, and start the adventure now!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. I've always had a problem with the whole Cinderella tale. Even when I was a little girl she made me so angry. Why didn't she stand up for herself? Why didn't she run away? Why didn't she just crack her evil stepsisters in the mouth, they were evil, right? The whole message of wait around and take abuse until some man comes along to rescue you is so weak and I sure never wanted to pass that along to my little girl.The twist of this story with the curse was brilliant. It gives a reason for the obedience so you can understand and feel for her. Also, independence and rebellion are celebrated in this story, which is a nice change from the old format. The romance (it wouldn't be a fairy tale without one, would it?) is so sweet and believable. I highly recommend this book. If you've seen the movie, don't let that put you off, they are two very different stories. Frankly, I don't see why the film kept the name of the novel instead of just saying \\"inspired by\\".I really didn't want this book to end. Finally a Cinderella without a martyr complex."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted. The title says it all.

She's ridiculed by her stepfamily as they force her to become a scullery made in her own home. All of this, the curse of obeying was the result of one persons stupid mistake, the fairy Lucinda.This is her story, it's all about the girl who breaks the curse, falls in love with the prince and even has Hatti and Olive, her horrid stepsisters to make it all harder. It's better than Cinderella. In my opinion, this book is not one to pass up. I recommend it to anyone and everyone who love tales of magic and enchantment."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This has been one of my favorite books since as long as I can remember. It's full of mystery, adventure, and romance. It all starts when Ella is a baby and is cursed by a fairy to always be obedient. When she is older, she goes on a mission to find the fairy who cursed her and convince her to take back the curse. On the way, she meets ogres, elves, giants, and even royalty. In the end everything goes back to way it should have been and she is no longer cursed."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I absolutely loved Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. Ella was always a curious character throughout the book and continuously looked for the good in everything. She was kind of a fiesty girl who had her head on straight. When Ella as born a foolish fairy named Lucinda put a spell on her. The spell was the gift of obedience. Well actually it was not really a \\"gift\\" but more a punishment. A lot of people took Ella's condition to their advantage. She had to obey every single command that she was given. The order could be as simple as \\"wash the dishes\\" to the more frightful thought of \\"suicide.\\" The story mostly takes place in Ella's little village and various towns as she seeks freedom from her spell. The time period is in the medieval times. The themes in this book deal with sorcery, spells, and enchantment. Once again, I adored Ella Enchanted from the beginning and would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In Gail Carson Levine's book Ella Enchanted, the main character Ell is very different from most girls her own age. She has been given the gift of obedience from the fairy Lucinda. Not only was this a gift but it was a curse as well. Each time she was told to do something she had to do it. Because of this Ella is forced to live at the mercy of those who had evil within them. It is Ella's rebellious spirit that allows her to overcome her curse.This book is a modern day Cinderella tale, that has many twists and turns that make is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"[...]\\"I'll race you to the gate.\\" I said\\"All right but I command you to lose the race.\\" said Pamela\\"Then I don't want to race.\\" I said\\"I command you to race, and I command you to lose.\\" said PamelaWe raced, I lost.If something like this has ever happened to you, then you're a lot like Ella Enchanted. When Ella of Frell was just a baby, Lucinda (a fairy who gives bad gifts) gave Ella the gift of obedience. But it wasn't a very good gift.Once, her fairy godmother (Mandy) had a birthday cake for Ella's birthday. Mandy told her to \\"dig in\\" so the spell made her put her hand in the cake and stuff it in her face.Before Ella's mom dies, she tells Ella to never tell anyone to about her spell because she was afraid someone might use it against her. So of course the spell made her tell no one.After her mother dies, Ella's father remarries a wealthy widow who has to ugly daughters who aren't very nice to Ella. There so horrible they make her do horrible things.Ella has to go on a journey to find Lucinda and make her break the spell. On her way she meets the handsome Prince Charmont who helps her find Lucinda. Along there way they meet ogres, elves, giants and fairies/pixies. Will Ella ever find Lucinda? If so, will she take the spell away from Ella? Will she fall in love with Prince Charmont? Read Ella Enchanted to find out.I would recommend this fabulous, magical book for ages 9-14."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This was a wonderful book!!! I couldn't put it down!! It's kinda like Cinderella except it's way more original!! It's about this girl who has a gift(it's more like a curse really) given to her by a stupid fairy. The curse is:obediance!!! Whenever anyone ever tells her to do something she has to do it!! This curse prevents her from being herself. People order her around and she is prevented from marrying her love, the prince Char! It is a great story with wonderfully wonderful, smart, and witty. THIS is the book to read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I enjoyed this book for several reasons. One was the creative use of Cinderella as the base. However, the author changed the plot and characters enough that it was exciting. The challenges that Ella face can easily be related to by readers. It is one of my personal favorites. Don't be mislead by the appearance of a mushy or boring fairy tale. Iits pages contain adventure, suspense, trickery, magic, and inspiration."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Gail Carson Levine creates a whimsical atmosphere by changing the character of the typical Cinderella to the personality of any normal human being burdened with obedience and an evil step-family.

Very humorous and inspiring, this book is one of the best fantasy novels ever written. The heroine of the story, Ella, faces many difficulties as a teenager. After dealing with the death of her mother, an evil stepmother with two evil daughters, and a very unique curse, Ella is able to stop and get what she really wants: Freedom. Gail Carson Levine did a marvolous job on writing this story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a SUPER book.It was my favourite book since I read it and still is, and I would like to recommend it to anyone who would like to read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"We travel to New England every summer and always listen to books-on-tape in the car.

Everything was described enough for you to picture it perfectly. Some parts are very exciting, you can hardly put the book down for a minute! It's one of my favorites,you should deffinetly give it a try!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a really good book, and the twist on the Cinderella story was great!It tells about a girl named Ella who has been cursed since birth to do whatever she's told - even cutting off her head! However, she's managed to keep the curse secret from most people, except for her kind nurse, Mandy. This book gets very exciting with her father marrying an evil stepmother (evil stepsisters included!), going to finishing school, encounters with ogres, fairy magic, and a handsome prince. Will Ella ever be free of her curse, and ready for happiness?This was a great book, and I'd recommend it for all 9 - 13 year olds. My only complaint is that Ella seemed younger than 15, but other than that I loved it! Other books I'd recommend are Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone; Just Ella; and the movie Ever After."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a wonderful book- it's romantic, humorous, and adventurous. It is written very well, and the story flows. I read this book straight through in about 3 or 4 hours- I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love the book Ella Enchanted becaue the book was so superbly written. it's a very different way of looking at the story of cinderella. I couldn't wait to find out if she got rid of &quot;the spell&quot; at Uakees wedding, and i was heart broken when she didn't! does she marry prince charmont, or char as his close friends (including Ella) call him, even if she put's the entire kingdom in danger or will she finally break the spell or will she... Well I'll let you ask yourself some of these questions if you read the book, witch i highly recamend that you do!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book before giving it to my 11-year-old daughter. She read it; then she read it again; and she continues to read it on a regular basis! It is one of her most favorite stories. You absolutely must read this (adult or child) and share it with others. Truly an enchanting tale you will remember always (and that's not a command, in case you are under an enchantment similar to Ella's)."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I totally loved this book. I got it at the library and then after I read it, I wanted to buy it. So I did. This was such a fascinating, detailed book. I loved how Ella could speak so many languages so well. She reminds me of, well, me. She isn't just a girl who is like in the Disney movie, Cinderella, or in other books. Ella actually has a mind of her own, despite her awful curse. If you want a book that's well written with romance, drama, fantasy, you really should get this book! I loved it, along with so many others!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Embellishing on the original tale of Cinderella, Gail Levine has written an imaginative and touching story - a classic in its own right. While the traditional fairytale focuses on the magical rags-to-riches transformation of a scullery maid into a princess, Levine's heroine is very real in both her defeats and her triumphs. Ella is a wonderful character whose unwavering sense of humor and refusal to succumb make her an endearing heroine whom the reader eagerly follows through her journeys. The friendship that she shares with Prince Char, her struggles to break the curse placed on her at birth, the pain and the joy that she feels at each turn of events are drawn with a clarity and poignant charm that make this a unique story all its own. There is, of course, glass slippers, a ball, the pumpkin coach - but this story goes far beyond the original to become something more. It is not just about one magical night that makes a servant into a princess; it is about the life of a girl who is more than what she seems and has only to realize it for herself to make her wishes come true.Ella Enchanted is a wonderful story for readers of all ages, and there is an amazing depth to this tale that cannot help but make you think. Despite the omnipresent existence of magic and the whimsical creatures that include everything from gnomes and elves to giants and ogres, the focus of the story is very real. We are, each of us, a little bit like Ella - struggling to be who we are while everything around us tries to make us otherwise. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves fairytales and children's books - especially to anyone who loves the story of Cinderella."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is a great version of the &quot;CinderELLA story&quot;. Ella was one of those people you really feel for. Gail Carson Levine did an outstanding job on Ella Enchanted, and you actually feel like you're in the book battling trolls and so foreth. For all of you who haven't read Ella Enchanted yet, you don't know what your missing! That is why I give Ella Enchanted 5 stars."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In the happy land of Frell a young girl is born... and enchanted with a spell at birth! She must be obedient.

Find out in gail Carson Levine's devine story of love and courage."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Alright, I am a fifteen year old girl who has read this book atleast twelve times. It is the very best book. It starts out with a girl, but no ordinary girl. Ella is cursed by air-headed Lucinda who believes the gift of obedience is a welcomed one. But having to do what everyone says doesn't keep Ella from being feisty, it only edges her on. Once her mother dies by the first chapter, your hooked on this book. Ella battles evil step sisters, orges, and an evil step-mother. All she wishes is to be with her love, Prince Charmont. This retelling is the best. There is no room to improve. Ella is a clumsy girl with brains and the guts to use them. She solves her own problems and delightfully enchants everyone she meets, even the reader. No person, whatever age, should go with out reading this book. I mean no one!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Encanted is a GREAT book about a girl named Ella who lives wth her mom, Lady Elanor, and the cook, Mandy. Her father, Sir Peter the trader, was away most of the time. When Ella was born, a fairy put a spell on her that made her always obedient. It was horrible, because when someone ordered her to do something, she had to do it. When her mother dies and her father marries Dame Olga, she meets Olga's fat, power-loving daughters.

The characters are jocose and intresting. Ella is a 15-year-old girl who is cursed under a fairy's &quot;gift&quot; of oedience. Thus, Ella must obey any command directed towards her. Even though it may sound like an unusual curse, it's amusing how Ella copes with anything she endeavors. When I first came upon this book, I thought it wouldn't be any different to the original tale. Yet, as I started to read it, I was enthralled with the plot and characters. From the cruel stepsisters to Ella's relationship with the prince, this book is astonishing. I highly recommend this book to anyone, young or old. Furthermore, this book also poses a problem: you can't read it just once!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This was one of the very best books I have ever read.

It's a classic tale of a girl who has a hard life and ends up marrying a prince. Well that's what Ella Enchanted is with a twist to it. The author is Gail Carson Levine. The publisher is Harper Collins and the publishing date is 1997. Readers of all ages could enjoy this book. When Ella was born this fairy Lucinda granted her the gift of obedience. It was a horriable gift because when anybody told her to do something she had to do it no matter what. If someone said she had to chop off her head, she had to do it. When she was eight, she told her friend pamela about the 'curse'. After Pamela knew, she ordered Ella to do 'stuff'. In the end,Ella punched Pamela and their friendship was over that day. When Ella was about fifteen she and her mother Eleanor got sick. Mandy the cook and special friend made them some medicane soup. Vegtables and Unicorn hairs. Eleanor didn't drink the hairs, but Ella did. Then Eleanor died. At the funeral, Prince Charmont came; Madame Olga; her two daughter's, Hattie and Olive; and Ella's father Sir Peter. At the funeral, Sir Peter said that Ella was going to finishing school with Hattie and Olive. While she was there she was yelled at by teachers and Hattie and Olive. She also found a friend Areida. Then one night she ran away. Along the way she met some elfs. They gave her a pony, Some food, and a place to rest for the night. When she left the elfs, she ran into orges. They said I will eat you we've already eaten your pony. But Ella was quick and was able to talk the orges to sleep and then slipped away.

I read some parts of it over and over every night. Even though it is a little young for my age, Gail Carson Levine captures Ella's personality so that I feel as if I am on her adventure with her. I also like how Gail Carson Levine makes Ella her own heroine, not like all the other Cinderella stories where she must wait for a &quot;handsome young prince to sweep her off her feet and come to her rescue.&quot; Ella takes matters into her own hands, and with this we go through a fun, adventurous and humorous tale of a girl struggling to do away with a curse that a fairy put on her when she was born."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"&quot;Ella Enchanted,&quot; is a book by Gail Carson Levine.

Now you read this book and you'll find out what happens."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read Ella Enchanted, not realizing until the balls what I was reading. Then it occurred to me that this was a retelling of Cinderella--a very good one at that. The characters had much more depth than in other versions. Ella is a heroine and an extermely powerful role model in these times that teach girls to be so self-centered. She is rewarded and relies on no one's help to break her 'curse'. This version also makes clear a lot of doubts I had about the original story--like why did the prince fall in love with her? Why didn't the slippers disappear? Why did her fairy godmother just show up then? Ella has a personality of her own instead of being a 'sweet, kind, daughter'--as she's always portrayed."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is probaly the best book (or at least one of them) that I have ever read.

As she did to me, Ella will leave you enchanted forever."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This was an enchanting, original, clever book. Instead of the basic There was a girl, she was a slace for evil stepsisters, she goes to the ball, becomes a princess, the author complicates it by giving the main charecter the \\"gift\\" of obedience. There is also more detail, and this uniqe book has the fairy godmother living in the house, and she already knows the prince (who's name is not Charming). There are also cretures that stand out with specail features, like small feet of fairies. Ella also has specail gifts, like a magic book and an elven wolf figure. I couldn't help noticing that one of the ideas was a little stolen: When Ella sleeps she is with a family of human- eating ogers, talking about how to cook her. When you start it's like a retelling of Roast Mutton for The Hobbit, but then it goes off on a hole different foot. It was also a little too mushy and romantic at the end, but I could see why the author had to do that. Otherwise, this is a great book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a beautiful story similar to that of Cinderella.

Somehow, she finds strength she needs inside and finds her true love at the same time."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I found Ella Enchanted to be a wonderful children's novel. It is a fairytale about a girl, Ella who from birth is given the curse of obedience to every command. This novel takes the reader through her adventures of trying to break this awful curse of obedience that a fairy cast upon her. This novel is a great spin off the famous fairytale, Cinderella. All throughout the book it gives little hints about how Ella and Cinderella are similar.This novel is well written and can be enjoyed by all ages. The author paints a great picture for the reader causing a great suspension of disbelief. I think that there is a great plot and the storytelling is appropriate.

We've now listened to the tapes twice through! The reading is lively and spirited, the young reader's voice could indeed be Ella - which is important as the story is in first person. I'm so glad they had a young performer read this! It was fun to hear her interpretations of the different languages of the various races and countries in the story, also. You can't go wrong with this purchase."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is simply the best book I've ever read. My sister first read it and then had me read it. We both loved it.

I dont love it because i relate to it, and i dont know really anyone who would because not many people i know of have a curse of obedience, or any curse at all. Anyways, i have read this book about 5 times, and im still not sick of it. This book has everything, love, a strong leading female character, a prince with freckles and blonde hair, ogres, elves, and faries. Ahhh.. i love this book. I would recommend this book for any age, even my mom likes it. And this is NOTHING like the movie, which is stupid and has barely anything to do with the plot of the book it is based on. I dont see why they had to ruin this book in order to make money in the box office. So, everyone should read this book, and if you like this you will also like Two Princesses of Bamarre and the His Dark Materials series."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think Ella did such a wonderful job of narrating her own story and the way she bravely faced Lucinda after she grew up.Char meets Ella for the first time at her mother's death and falls in love with her at three balls at a time.My most favorite part of this story is when Ella and Char marry each other at the end. Ella Enchanted is now a brand new motion picture in theatres."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I really loved this book because it is about Ella's life with the curse of obedient.

Ella is the type of girl that just doesnt have the \\"damsel in distress\\" type of thing going for her.Sure like any girl she has her fair share of trouble, step sisters, step mom, callous fahter, loss of her mother, and an obdience curse upon her. This obdience curse was placed upon her as a child by the ditzy fairy lucinda. With the help of her charming best friend who is also her fairy/chef she tries to overcome this curse, and win the heart of the prince who already has hers. This book is the type of book where you can open up to any page and be captivated by the storyline,text,or trouble going on there. If you read this book you'll be as enchanted as I am every time i read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I first picked up Ella Enchanted when I was in the fourth grade. It was my favorite book and I read it until half of the pages fell out. I'm sixteen years old now and just recently my boyfriend bought me a new copy for my birthday. I didn't expect it to have the same ability to capture me in the story but before I knew it I spent an entire Saturday reading. I guess what I'm trying to say is that no matter how old you are, this is a great story and no matter who you're thinking of getting it for, they will love it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The Enchanted World of EllaElla Enchanted Gail Carlson LevineThis story is about a girl named Ella who has a spell on her and her mother who is dead has a spell on her too. She has a maid who is a fairy godmother to Ella and she helps Ella through her problems.There is a evil fairy named, Lucinda. She is the one who put the spell on Ella and her mother.An exciting thing that happened in the book is that when Ella has to go to a place sort of like a prison. She meets a girl there that ends up her friend and her friend helps her get to know the place and teaches her a different language. Then on the 3rd night she is there she runs away. She goes into a dark forest and in the morning she sees a little goblin and takes it to her mother. The mother thanked Ella by making her stay with the rest of the goblins. Thennext day Ella trys to find her father again.Who I think who would enjoy this book is a person who enjoys Cinderella stories. Ella Enchanted is a very good book and is sort of another version of Cinderella. Its similar to Cinderella because there is an evil fairy, stepmother and stepsisters, a good fairy that helps Ella and that Ella was a maid like Cinderella was.I would rate this book a 10. It was very good. Anyone would like this book. Anyone who reads this book I hope you like it, its very good.

Even after five years of reading, re-reading and re-re-reading this book (I am, after all, only fifteen) this is still one of the best I've seen. If anyone is ever going to take a trip into another world, reserve a place on your ticket for Kyrria (the country this takes place in) and you won't be disappointed. If you want more about the book, here it is: A \\"misguided\\" (not evil, Lucinda just doesn't see things the way they should be) puts a curse on Ella (the heroine) and Ella must find a way to break it, or else...(which is what you'll find out).

Ever since she was little girl she got cursed by this fairy tale that was once told to her when she was just a baby. And now she believes that she has to do anything that someone says to her .What ever they say she has to obey them. Ever since her mother died when she was very young she had a hard time adjusting to it. Even though she don't quite remember her that well she does her best to remember. But her new step mother Hattie is a very mean lady. She is very picky about everything that goes on. Like when ever they eat supper, or breakfast if its not the way that she likes it or wants it then she has her maid take it back. Also, she will never let Ella eat the food either unless she approves also. But she is trying to find a way to brake the spell so that she could be free of it. She talks to a girl named mandy and she gives Ella advise on what to do. Mandy is her very best friend she is helping Ella to brake the curse also. But she is trying to find a fairy named Lucinda she believes that she is the one who put the curse on her. But she is having a hard time finding her she looks through books, and goes out side and trys to find her but she is no where in sight. That's basically what the book is about a girl who is trying to brake a curse in order to set herself free.What I liked about this book is that it seemed so real. Like it talks about hattie her step mother and how she is so picky about everything that involves Ella or herself. I think that is really funny because I could relate to that some of my family is like the same way. And the fairy that she is trying to find Lucinda that's cool because I think that fairy's are really neat and magical. But she also has a good friend to talk to and that's Mandy and that's my name but I could also relate to that because I have friends that I could relate to like that for advise when I need it or just give it out. So this book is about the girl who tries to break a curse and people could relate to her because like sometimes I sure feel the same way as her trying to break the curse of my family. This book was fun reading because even though it's a fairy tale book its also real because she living her life as a teen and trying to get away with life.I think that people could relate to this book because it deals with teens getting through life even though the girl has a curse on her so does every other person in there family. Kids these days are trying to get away with things that they know that they can't. I recommend this book to all ages but probably to most teens though like 10-18 that's the average of the reading level for me. But this book has mystery in it that's keeps you in suspicion all through the book. Even though some parts of the book is boring it really good through out the book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book last year after i got my library card renewed. It was like the third one i checked out. I LOVED it!!!!! It was funny and it made me laugh sometimes. A lot of the time it made me frustrated too though. Because everyone took advantage of her gift. It pulled me in and i felt like i was Ella. Really a good read"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My 3rd grade teacher read this story as a read aloud after me and a friend decided not to partner read. I f was supposed to be doing make-up work during read aloud I would listen instead. I then made my mother go buy it. Since I have read it 5 more times. It is an awesome book!!

She has been \\"blessed\\" by a fairy's gift. She is unable to disobey, even against her best interest or heart's desires.

Connections are easy to make to some blended families. [...]"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book! It's enchanting and charming.

I look forword to reading more books by Levine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is one of my favorite stories of all time. I am 25 years old and still enjoy a good fairy tale. I have probably read this book about 7 times and it never gets old for me. I know there is a movie out there and honestly I was a little disappointed with the movie. It really didn't do this story justice. So, even if you have seen the movie, I would encourage you to pick up this book and give it a shot. It's an easy read...probably about middle school reading level. It would also be a great book if you have a girl in that age range. It is a spin-off from the classic Cinderella story, but has it's own fresh ideas in that it contains ogres, giants, fairies, centaurs, and an array of fabulous characters. All in all a wonderful adventure!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a very excellent book!!

It will always hold a special place in my heart! :)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love fairy tales and fantasy books. So I can understand why I loved this book. My friend, on the other hand, is real down-to-earth and doesn't daydream much. Nonetheless, she loved Ella Enchanted, too, when I told her she had to read it. So this proves that it's a book everybody can identify with an enjoy whether they are realists or idealists."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book while I was on vacation, and I couldn't put it down! I read it four times in five days and refused to read anything else. Trust me, it's great!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This quick read gives a new take on the Cinderella story by casting Ella, a spunk girl who was given the \\"gift\\" of obedience at birth, into the role of the abused stepsister. There have been TONS of retellings of fairy tales in recent years, so this story definitely felt less fresh for me than it probably would have when it first came out in 1997. Nonetheless, it was funny at times, and Ella is a realistically rebellious teenage girl. I would definitely recommend this book to girls who enjoy tales of princesses and fairy tales, especially those who are just transitioning into longer chapter books from beginning readers or Magic Treehouse type books. If they like this, I would be sure to check out Princess Academy by Shannon Hale for a similar princess story with an equally spunky heroine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I can relate to Ella and so many of the other characters! A delightful book for all ages! (I'm 21 now!)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My 8 year old granddaughter was very happy to receive this book on her birthday. It was recommended to me by her mother."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The only thing I knew about Ella enchanted was from the movie (of which I am only slightly ashamed to admit that I actually like in all its cheesiness and campiness). I had no idea the book would be so different, or I should say, that the movie was so different from its original source.Cursed with the gift of obedience at birth by a quite stubborn and clueless fairy, Ella had always coped with her curse, until the day she found herself with two mean step-sisters and ordered to do something she could not bring herself to do. Fleeing, Ella embarks on a quest to find the fairy that bestowed her the \\"gift\\" of obedience to ask her to take it away. In the process she finds friends and a strength she didn't know she had.Ella was a great heroine. Blessed with a knack for languages, she untangles herself from perilous situations with grace, wit and strength. I thought Ella Enchanted was a nice story, a great retelling of, probably, the most retold fairy tale of all time. I read it in one evening and was delighted and amused."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"From the very first page, Ella Enchanted had be hooked. Just after her birth, Ella receives a \\"gift\\" from a well-intentioned fairy. The gift is the gift of obedience; if someone gives Ella a command, she HAS to comply, or she begins to feel ill.Ella Enchanted is easily one of my favorite young adult novels, and one I quickly recommend."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ever wonder how Cinderella came to be in the deplorable condition she starts her story? If so you should read this book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Highly recommend to anyone who love imaginative tales."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I don't think that any author can write as beatifully as Gail Carson Levine.No wonder Ella Enchanted is a Newberry Honor Book!Ella of Frell was given the \\"gift of obedience by a crazy fairy name Lucinda. She must obey all commands given to her whether it's going to finishing school, or putting herself into a boiling pot to be cooked!!! The friendship between Prince Charmont and Ella grows along the road of ogres, giants, elves, and fairies as they try to find Lucinda so she can take back the curse.I doubt Ella Enchanted could being written any better and I definitely recommend this to all people who enjoy a good book, especially if you are a girl of age 9+. Ella Enchanted is a book that I am sure I will never forget."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I must say that overall I was quaintly pleased with this bittersweet fairy tale.A fairy put a spell on Ella at birth, making her obey any command given to her. The book follows Ella through the ups and downs of her life after the death of her mother and her quest to break her awful curse. The story starts out original and unpredictable, however it gradually comes to resemble another well-known fairy tale until at the very end it is entirely revealed to be that certain traditional fairy tale (not to give anything away for those who haven't read it yet - I will say that you can figure it out by looking at the names of the characters and take into account the involvment of fairies or fairy godmothers - or just read the publisher's description of it here on Amazon).While I liked the character-driven story (in fact, some of my favorite parts were its dialogue and especially the interactions between Ella and Prince Char), I was a little disappointed that by the end it was that particular traditional storyline. Even though Ella is much more fleshed out with such a realistic personality as compared to the classic story heroine, part of me wishes this book could have been completely original and never tied into the traditional story at all. I feel that it could have had so much more potential and originality if the last 20 or so pages hadn't, essentially, been a cop-out. Its strengths definitely lie within its characters and its weakness lies in the ending. Overall a very good book and I can personally accept the ending in order to enjoy the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It's a classic. I've read Ella Enchanted numerous times and it never gets old. The author seems to have come from another time. She truly has talent with fairytales. The characters completely admiral, but none so as Ella herself. What's the worst curse one can be bestowed with? It might possibly be the one Ella has. No matter what, if she is told to do something she has to do it. She can dodge if you ask her, but hardly anyone does. When she is told never to tell of her curse, things could get bad. Finally after her father marries an awful woman with awful daughters, Ella makes a stand. She's going to find the fairy that put the curse on her if it's the last thing she does. This book truly is one of my very favorites. I recommend this to all ages and all genders."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I just got this book a few days ago, and I can't put it down! I did see the movie before I read the book so I thought I knew what would happen, but, no! the movie has it all wrong, I hate that it is a modern version of the story, plus they left all the good parts out. I think they sould make a movie that is all from the story no modern parts to it! But I enjoy the book so far, I love the cinderella catch to the story, and everything, can't wait to see how it ends!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought Ella Enchanted was an okay book. I reminded me of Cinderella. This book is mainly about a girl who can't brake a curse her fairy put on her. I don't recommend this book to people who want an origanal story, and not a remake."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I really did not enjoy the book Ella Enchanted. It was about a girl, Ella, growing up in a magical world filled with fairies and ogres and elves. It seemed a bit too feathery, if you ask me. There was way too much romance for this to actually be a good book. Read it if you want to, but I would only give it 2 stars."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have to say that this book wasn't that good. I struggled to get through it. It just wasn't interesting. It gave you details of things that didn't matter. The only good part in the book was when you are about 3/4 of the way finished with it. I think that is too long of a wait for a book to get good. If you are looking for a book that will hold your attention as you read, you probably don't want to read Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book started out excellent: It was the author's own idea; a good one at that. I was very interested in it. However, near the end of the book, it started to sound exactly like Cinderella. And I mean 'exactly'. It got boring. This is a good book for young readers, like, I'd say 8 and under."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book, which has somehow achieved successful status with readers and booksellers alike. Not only is it both a precious and boring retelling of a story already told clearly and simply, it is an unfulfilled promise of an adventure story for much of the first half of the book, and an insipid, somewhat chauvinistic romance for much of the second. After two children turned their noses up at it saying that it was &quot;boring and stupid&quot;, I thought that surely they must be wrong. After a quick read (more time than it deserved), I fully agree. A two-fisted &quot;thumbs down&quot;."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carson Levine, is a novel based on the Cinderella story, that depicts the life of a young girl, Ella. When Ella was born, she was placed under the spell of obedience, by a fairy, Lucinda. Ella soon falls in love with a charming prince and has to break the spell to save their love. Will Ella be able to break the spell, or will she have to leave her true love? I gave this book one star. Although it started off very strong it lost its power very quickly. Bouncing back and forth between proper english and hip phrases did not have a magical effect on this reviewer. I began to wish for my own fairy to save me from the tedious task of finishing this disjointed book. I didn't think that this book was a refreshing new twist on Cinderella, but rather, it made me long for the pages of Charles Perrault. I would not recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think that this book was terribly unoriginal. It started out ok with Ella being forced to obey everyone but got lame with the stupid pumpkin carriage and so forth. It's ok for little second graders who like fairy tales like cinderella and other little kids, but not for anyone who knows how to appreciate REAL fantasy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This Book was asighned to me for a book report. As soon as I got past 5 chapters I knew that this is a girls book. I had a hole month to read it but I barely finished it. I dont recomend this book for boys. My partners in this book report were two girls, they loved it. So boys take my advise Dont waist your money!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Although this book has numerous awards, the almost \\"Mona Lisa\\" cover is an affront that has caused much hardship within our own family realm. Keep classical art out of this fictional realm so that as parents we may properly teach the differences between classic art and modern (or the evil invoked by this cover), between words and realism, worlds and reality, between the past, present and future; between \\"fiction and fancy\\" vs. \\"historical\\"; ANY art, literature, etc. You have crossed a border which should not be crossed... Fairies.......Only an imbecile without children can so casually cross these lines. Stop it! I sincerely wish I could abscond with my child and save her from the effrontery of this ****. Is not childhood in this day and age enough of a trial? \\"Far Ram Yu\\" as a blessed sheep was wont to say; and he evokes much more loyalty than your damnable novel. Be gone with you! ...as I wash my hands of this tripe and tell my daughter to do the same.Go away ye bad serfs - ye are working for the devil.........P.S. Before you dismiss this as trivial.... As someone once said \\"A picture is worth one thousand words.\\" In the position of publishing childrens' books, please exercise more restraint than this cover exhibits. Even though old English has caused my daughter what she feels are cerebral hemorrhages, the reading has expanded her mind. To have it brought back to a crap-ass painting which some few idiots regard as special is absurd."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was one of the worst books ever!I an 10 and have read too many books to count.

Halfway through it, I realized that this was a wonderfully woven tale. Everything about it was perfect. I found myself despising Lucinda, and admiring Ella's personality. I loved her attitude. All of my friends have a kind of &quot;reading circle&quot;. We pass on books which we like. Well, you can be assured this book was included. Recently we had to do a writing assignment, to pretend you are some character from a book or movie. Well, all four of us thought immediately of ELLA ENCHANTED. I must say, this book was one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is my absolute favorite book. I read some parts of it over and over every night. Even though it is a little young for my age, Gail Carson Levine captures Ella's personality so that I feel as if I am on her adventure with her. I also like how Gail Carson Levine makes Ella her own heroine, not like all the other Cinderella stories where she must wait for a &quot;handsome young prince to sweep her off her feet and come to her rescue.&quot; Ella takes matters into her own hands, and with this we go through a fun, adventurous and humorous tale of a girl struggling to do away with a curse that a fairy put on her when she was born."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is one of those few times when the spinoff is actually better than the original. Much better. Everything's topsy-turvy: Ella's dad is alive and as crooked and greedy as ever; the fairy godmother, Mandy, is an old, peppery, plain woman who cooks for Ella's family; Ella, with her stepsisters, are sent to a lady's prep school; and the stepfamily, though mean and wicked, is hilariously funny and stupid. The book is set in a different kingdom, where ogres, dwarves, giants, and vain, unwittingly mischievous fairies roam free. In fact, it's due to one of these fairies, Lucinda, that Ella is in trouble. Ella was cursed (not blessed) by a spell of Lucinda's that makes her obey any command given to her. It's a weakness that her mean stepfamily use to their advantage, but sadder still, it's a curse that keeps Ella from the person she loves, Prince Charmont (a.k.a. Char. Because of these conflicts, Ella sets on a journey to track down the troublesome Lucinda, right old wrongs, and maybe try to live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is delightful!All my old questions about Cinderella were answered. Why would Cinderella put up with her bossy stepsisters? Because she was under a curse, of course. Why couldn't anyone recognize her? It was a masked ball, of course. Why wouldn't her shoes fit anyone else? You'll have to read the book for that one.Today's women don't really respect a Prince who falls for a girl because of her looks. And now we learn that that isn't the way it was at all. Ella and the Prince had known and corresponded with each other for years. Ella's personality is what enchanted the Prince, as well as the reader. This means giving up the desperate search for the owner of the shoe, as he knows where to go. But it's worth it.Adventures with ogres only add to the fun. This book leaves you with a satisfied feeling. I hope that this author writes more books soon!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I will always love this book. I just realized that I lost my copy, so this was a replacement. I was sad that the original cover art was on the more expensive copy, but this will do just fine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is a childhood favorite i still re-read it often and every time it makes makes me cry. Despite the movie they made based on the book the book is a hundred times better. The first time i read it i was incapable of putting it down. The best book Gale Carson Levine ever wrote."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is what young adults should be reading! Not that trashy, empty stuff with main characters too pathetic to call heroines. This was an adorable book and a unique take on Cinderella.Ella was cursed at birth--she has to follow any orders given her. When people find out about the curse, they quickly learn to use it to their advantage. She's either rebellious by nature or because she needed to rebel against the curse to prevent feeling like a puppet, but her refreshing sass shines throughout the book.It had many of the elements that other YA fiction has these days: magic, adventure, and young love. But it contained so much that those other books don't: a coherent story, a creative world, actual character development, and a strong, willful heroine. Ella thinks for herself, she looks out for herself, and she cares about doing the right thing.This is a high caliber book written for high caliber young people."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"At Ella's birth, a fairy begifts her with the ability to always obey. It turns out to be more of a curse than a gift, however, when Ella's friends learn of her compliance and use it to make Ella their servant.Some interesting questions after reading this story: Is compliance always good? When is it better to be able to make decisions for one's self? How important is the ability to choose to obey or refuse to obey?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think this book qualifies as a true fairy tale. It's definately up there with Little Red Riding Hood an The 3 Little Pigs. There is the traditional \\"handsome prince\\" but the twist is that instead of the princess being some ditsy, graceful, perfectly flawless girl ( no effence to the princesses out there ), she is an average girl who is beautiful on the inside. Isn't that how all princesses should be? I loved this book so much I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. Really. Ella Enchanted is a romantic comedy, fantasy, filled with magic, a curse, colourful characters- Just pick up the book. It was amazing from page 1."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedBy: Gail Carson LevineReviewed by: G. ParkPeriod: 6In this book called \\"Ella Enchanted\\", there is a girl named Eleanor or Frell, who was called Ella, was given a fairy's gift at her birth. The Fairy name was Lucinda It was a gift of obedience, but who knew a fairy's gift could be a curse? If Ella was given a command hop in the rain for one hour, then she would have to. If she was told to kill someone, she would have to. Ever second of her life was in danger. After years had passed, Ella had to go through some difficulties with her family. Her mother had died because she got sick and her father had remarried an evil stepmother with two other daughters. Luckily she had Mandy, her cook by her side and Prince Char to talk to when she feels sad. Later, Ella had found out that Mandy was her fairy godmother all along! At first Ella didn't believe her because then Mandy could have saved her mother from dieing, but Mandy did try to save her. It was just because Ella's mother didn't eat the horsehair which could have saved her. After Ella had found out that Lucinda was the fairy who gave her the gift of obedience, she had started her journey to find her and try to remove the spell forever, except Lucinda didn't remove it. Ella had to find a way herself to remove it because Lucinda doesn't take back her own gifts. When Ella returned back home, Ella was told by Prince Char's uncle to kill Prince Char so then his uncle could be king, but luckily things didn't go the way it was planned. Ella had held herself, strongly from killing her true love and at that moment. Ella was able to break the curse! She didn't have to take anymore commands and was free at last. At the end, Prince Char had asked Ella to marry her and obviously, she did become Queen Eleanor of Frell.I like this book because it can teach people to believe in yourself and if you keep on trying, you can achieve your goal. Also, one of the quotes in this book that I like was when Mandy told Ella, \\"All the Eleanor line are friends of the Fairies. You have fairy blood in you.\\" The reason why I like this quote is, because I was amazed that Ella actually had some fairy blood within herself. Besides, Ella could live forever because fairies have immortal lives and can stay beautiful forever too. Also the fact that the Eleanor was friends with the fairies, but the one thing that ponders me is why the fairies didn't help Ella's mother to survive from dieing. It is a fairy world, so why didn't all the fairies try to save her?The second quote that I like from this book was when at the end Ella said to herself \\"I had been able to break the curse myself.\\" This means that Ella was able to break a fairies curse herself. If I were Ella, I might have been really excided and proud for what I had just done because, usually when a person has curses or gifts from a fairy, the same fairy or another fairy would have to remove it. If you don't want to accept it, but this time, Ella was able to break it herself. I think it is because she had a drop of fairy blood within herself. Luckily she had that blood with her or else, she would have to kill Prince Char. This would be an opening, for Prince Char's evil uncle, to be the next ruler or Frell. Which wouldn't be good news, but fortunately, that didn't happen.My favorite part of the book was when Ells was able to stop herself from killing Prince Char and she was able to break that cruse of obedience because if none of these events happened in the book. The whole story would turn upside down. This means that, instead of the story ending happily ever after. It would have ended as Prince Char dieing and Ella killing herself because of what she had done and never breaking the cruse. Also, Frell would suffer too because of Prince Char's evil uncle. So the two favorite parts that I picked was the most important part from the whole book. Anyways, it didn't end as everyone dieing, it did actually ending as happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The only part that's hard to get used to at first is the reader's voice is quite high in tone.

If you havent seen the move dont till after you read the book Its so much better and if you have seen the movie already its ok youll like the book better and if you didnt like the movie you need to read this book because the movie just doesnt do this book justice. But then again what movie does ?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Well, I think other reviewers here have made it clear how aweswome this book is, so I'll just be wasting your time telling you about it. I'll just throw in my two cents for it. I hardly find Ella \\"too perfect\\", like Cinderella is. I like Ella's unselfishness, and she is very realistic. If you loved this book (and what right-minded person wouldn't?), stay away as much as you can from the movie. It does not stick to the book's plot, uses over-used cliches, and throws in a whole hunk of junk. It was an insult to Gail Carsine Levine! Read the book. Don't bother with the movie."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!! one of the most wonderful book/ fariy tales i've ever read!!! A defenite read... i couldn't put it down, that is why i give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a wonderful, magical book. The incredible author Gail Carson Levine wrote this book, which was awarded the Newberry Honor, along with many others. Two other fantasy books of hers are Wish and Two Princesses of Bamarre. Ella Enchanted is a book based on a story we all know and love, the Cinderella story! But, it has its occasional twists and turns.Ella Enchanted is about a young girl who is cursed with the gift of obedience. When her mother dies she meets Prince Charmont and falls in love. After she can no longer see him because of the curse, she pretends to be getting married. But with a little help from her fairy god mother she goes to his three balls, but is disguised as a different person. When Hattie pulled off her mask and revealed Ella she fled back to her home. Prince Charmont runs after her and tells her to marry him, but can't because Hattie's telling her not to. Will Ella ever get rid of the curse?I was intrigued by the amazing characters in Ella Enchanted. The feud between Hattie and Ella was very interesting. With Hattie bossing Ella around and the tricks Ella played on Hattie, I couldn't help it, but to laugh. Even the creatures in the story were fascinating. They each had their own unique languages. I always enjoyed saying and reading the languages!I also enjoyed the story line. It's similar to the Cinderella story, but more pazaz was put into it. Ella, who is supposed to be Cinderella, is cursed. Three balls take place where Ella is masked as a different person. But even happy stories have their sad parts. A lot of different emotions run through you. At the end of the story though, where the authors usually leave you hanging, the author actually tells you what happens in the Epilogue.Ella Enchanted is a funny, light-hearted fantasy. This book is for everybody that enjoys the Fantasy genre. I would deeply recommend this book for all ages. Even if you didn't like Cinderella, Ella Enchanted will change your mind. I guarantee you will enjoy it. It will be a magical experience for everyone!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved the book Ella Enchanted! It is my favorite book!Your Revewer,#1 FAN!P.S.

There are many twists, and some exciting chapters you never have thought would be so thrilling and captivating!Note: This book is almost totally different from the movie, so if you want to read the ORIGANAL version read this, if you want to read something just like the movie, i bet you can find a movie copy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"One time two years ago, I was in my school library. The library was really lame and I never find a good book. But I was scanning each shelf and I come across Ella Enchanted and I decide to give it a chance. Well, that book turned into my favorite.I've owned this book for about a year and I loved it!! I always thought the original Cinderella was good, just a little too simple, but this book added a fun twist!I think if you read all the reviews on this book, I don't have to give you an explanation. Ella Enchanted is probably the best Newbery Honor book I have ever read. The best book I have ever read for that matter. I don't reccomend this book for boys because it might be too girly for them. But I totally reccomend it for for pre-teen and teen girls.This book has adventure, humor, romance,courage, and great characters. I love Ella and Levine made the evil step sisters evil! Prince Char had a great role in the plot also! If you are bored this summer and need an engaging read, Ella Enchanted is the answer!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book because of the magic and romance, but most of all for the corageous, smart, not-so-perfect heroine. This is a modern/old timey book that combines the characteristics of modern people (you won't find any thous or thys in this book) with fairy tales from the past. Ella is a cinderella of her time, but she isn't one to sit around and wait for her fairy godmother to solve all of her problems for her, she takes care of things herself.

My copy of it is falling apart. Parts of it are memorized. Whenever someone asks me what a good book is to read, my automatic response is \\"Ella Enchanted\\" (not when my brother asked, though...) As I move on from high school to college, I do try to be dignified in my book selection, but I will never feel shame for this book. It's sublime. It's the quintessential fairy tale: funny, touching, magical and adventurous, with real, lovable characters. (except for the ones you're not supposed to love...)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When Ella was born, a foolish fairy, named Lucinda, gave her what she thought was the precious gift of obedience. From that moment on, Ella would have to do whatever some one commanded her to do. If she tried to disobey, she would physically become ill and resort to following her orders whether she liked them or not. After her mother dies, her father becomes a poor merchant who marries into money. Ella then inherits two mean stepsisters and an unfeeling stepmother. Her only two friends are her cook/fairy godmother, Mandy, and the Prince Charmont, to whom she actually rescues in the end. This book is a twist on the familiar Cinderella story. It contains all of the essentials of glass shoes, a pumpkin carriage, a fairy godmother, and a poor maiden falling in love with the prince of her nation. The main question that remains is how will Ella be rid of her precious spell before it takes over her life?Levine sets this story up to sound like a traditional fairytale. It begins by telling about the character's past, her birth, childhood, and then to the present to start the chain of events. It is told from the main character, Ella's, point of view. If any other character had told it, the most logical one would be that of Prince Charmont. He is Ella's friend and love interest, but if it had been told by him, the Cinderella-like story would have been damaged and possibly lost. The language is relatively simple and is at about a reading level of a fifth grader. The main idea of the story is taken from the old tale of Cinderella. But like most fairytales, it is given a new twist for this generation.This book is more suited for children ages eight and on due to the language and possibly also the underlying threat of ogres. This book mainly falls into the fairytale/fantasy category because of its dealings with magic pumpkins and fairy godmothers. Fairytale enthusiasts, Cinderella fanatics, and the young at heart should read this book. It is truly an amazing story of a young woman who is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in. For that reason, Ella Enchanted is a definite must read for every young woman."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I just wanted to add that the picture on the front cover is wrong!! At the top of page 4 of this book, Ella is described to have black hair. Thought you just might be interested in knowing that!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Here, let me clear up a few things. This book is SUPPOSED to resemble Cinderella. That's the point. If you've ever read Just Ella, it's kind of the same idea. Except this is a lot better. Another thing, it isn't supposed to be believable. That's why this is called FICTION. It isn't real, nor was it written to be realistic.Ever since I got this book at the age of 8 (I'm 16 now) I've read it more times than I can count. In fact, my first copy was literally read to pieces, and I had to buy a second copy. Instead of comfort food, this has become my \\"comfort book\\". And I absolutely adore it. It has a plot that isn't original (see above) but it has original ideas in it. The characters are fairly well developed (what young girl couldn't fall for someone like Char? How could anyone love Hattie? Who couldn't root for Ella?).Warning- it has a sappy happy-ever-after ending, but it is appropriate here. It fits the story (It's a fairy tale, people!), and it fits the targeted age group. I would have been really upset at 8 if things didn't end the way they did."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ok, let me just say WOW! this was an amazing, gripping book.

We've all wondered what happened to our heroine after the slipper fit on her foot, and Levine finally explains it to us. I was delighted with the way Ella's background was revealed to us through her escapades and near shaves. In Ella, Levine has given us a spirited and spunky heroine whom children can admire. I work in a library and read this in my free time.

It enchanted me it made me laugh And shead a tear or 2. I give it two thumbs"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Our (Cinder)-Ella is a dedicated young lady who has been &quot;cursed&quot; at birth by an inconsiderate fairy with the Gift (as she insists it is) of Obedience! She becomes physically ill when she tries to delay, resist or ignore a command; after enduring horrible suffering for disobedience, she ultimately surrenders to the speaker's will. Thus she can be manipulated by selfish, spiteful people into doing things against her heart's desire and best interests--even if they do not realize the details of her instant cooperation. Is there no way for her to get free of this curse, so she may live a normal life?The only daughter of Sir Peter of Frell--an often absent merchant of questionable methods--and Lady, her free-spirited mother, Ella suspects that their kindly, gray-haired cook, Mandy, might actually be a Fairy in disguise. Beware the consequences of Big Magic; her godmother balks at performing even Small magic.But Ella is determined to to seek out the elusive, whimsical Lucinda the Beautiful, to beg her or make her (as if Ella could be giving orders!) remove the curse. Just how much does a girl have to sacrifice because of a heedless fairy: her mother's best necklace, peace of mind, the right to make her own behavioral decisions, the safety of her country, the happiness of her Prince--even her very life she were commanded to do so? The enchanted status quo simply can not be allowed to continue indefinitely.This cleverly-expanded retelling of the famous fairy tale fleshes out a paper maiden/princess into a real human being, with all the dimensions of a young lady coming into (medieval) marriageable age. Her snobby step mum and two horrid step- sisters treat her with delicious and predictable cruelty--psychological as well as physical. And Prince Charmant is a dear, from sliding down the bannisters to finding the glass slippers.Three Balls, two fairies and a magic Fairy Tale book ultimately conspire to help Ella help herself. But the greatest magic of all is found in t! he depths of a maiden's tender heart. The literary style immediately reminded me of Catherine, called Birdy; in fact Karen Cushman is one of three women authors who praised the book. A quick read with tons of dialogue, witty mental retorts, and surprising denouement, which will satisfy most Happy-Ever-After ending seekers!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is a wonderfull character whoes clumsiness and personality add comedy to the book. she can get herself out of anything.

His writing was able to capture your thoughts and made you keep turning the pages. The magical world of Ella's was perfectly described and detailed out. It was sort of wobbly on the fact that it still had you wondering about commands she could do. On a scale from 1-10 I would give it an 11!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought this was a terrific version of the Cinderella story. Ella is cursed at birth to a life of complete obedience to anyone who gives her a direct order. The ways she finds to assert herself in spite of this odious curse are delightfully clever, truly imaginative. I think if you were reading it with an 8-12 year old girl, it could lead to some interesting discussions about trying to please others, and when it is OK to do as someone asks vs. when you are betraying yourself. (Or you could just read it for fun, because it is fun!) My only complaint came from almost the very last page--after a whole novel of watching the pain Ella feels because of her always-absent father, we learn that when Ella has children, she deserts them, too. She and Char leave them behind and spend all their time travelling, checking up on them occasionally through a magic book. Well enough for Ella and Char, I suppose, but I wonder if the children feel any differently than Ella did during her father's long absences. Small gripe, though, about an otherwise wonderful book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am currenty taking young adult literature in college and this book was one that I chose to read.

I did not like this book, because I do not like fantasy books. If you like fantasies, and you like suspense, Ella Enchanted is the perfect book for you.

I've always been interested in Cinderella stories, so when I saw \\"Ella Enchated\\" in the store, I knew I had to buy it. And buy it I did. I read through it in a matter of hours.\\"Ella Enchanted\\" is a re-telling of the Cinderalla story set in a fantasy world of trolls and ogres and fairies that can do magic (but usually they don't). It follows the basic plot line of Cinderella: a girl is forced to do what her stepmother and stepsisters say until she can marry her prince. But from there out, Levine takes the story into her own world and puts her own spin on things.If you've seen the move but haven't read this book, be warned: the scriptwriters for the movie drastically changed things. They kept the same basic principle, but changed the story almost entirely, and made the movie much more frivolous than the book. I encourage you to read this book, but don't start it expecting it to mirror the movie, or vice-versa."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Have you ever read Ella Enchanted? If not you should.

Ella got a gift when she was a baby from a fairy named Lucinda. The gift was obedience. That gift caused tons of problems and then after her mother died, her father married a woman named Dame Olga. Dame Olga makes Ella to be a servant. So does her evil step sisters. Then, Ella discovers her true love, the prince of Frell, Prince Charmont.

The prince barely has a line!That's why I was so happy when I found this book, I love fairy tales and this book it's one of the best I've read. Ella has a personality on her own, so does Char, the prince. The obstacules they face are believable - yeah, in the middle of a fairy tale you find yourself believing even when you're sorrounded by ogres and fairies and centaurs -Ella has never have a voice on herself. As a baby, a fairy by the name of Lucinda gave her a \\"Gift\\": Obedience. Order Ella to do something and she will do it, no matter what. It's a secret her mother, Mandy - cook and fairy good mother extraordinaire! - and Ella herself work hard to keep.Then Ella faces the loss of her mother and things start to go not so well. But she does meet Prince Char, who it's fond of her. And well, you know the story. Though in this retealing you will find more than one surprise.And the Ending leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside.Go with Ella as she try to find her own voice and the power to make her own choices."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedBy AmonymousElla Enchanted is an \\"enchanting\\" movie that has you on the tip of your seat. This exciting film is about a teenage girl whose curse it is to follow orders. But along the way it sets her on a breathtaking journey.No matter what she is told to do, Ella must do it, even if it is to kill. So she sets off to find an air-headed fairy named Lucinda who gave her this so-called \\"gift.\\" But along the way she (literally) runs into many problems and her true love.Actress Anne Hathaway (Ella) and Actor Hugh Dancy (Prince Char) light up the screen with their amazing acting ability. Only after the movie you realize that they are just actor doing their jobs.This movie is actually based on the book and follows it well. It is not like other movies that are an embarrassment to the original story. If you have read the book you will love this movie.Some movies you see once and then the second time you see it it is boring. But in Ella Enchanted, every time you watch it you see something that you didn't see before.Ella Enchanted is a wonderful Cinderella story that will delight children and adults for years to come.

Where did she really get the glass slippers? Why did she really go to the ball? The story takes place in a fairy tale land called Frell. When Ella was just born, her family received a visit from the beautiful fairy Lucinda. Lucinda saw Ella crying and decided to give her the wonderful gift of obedience. What Lucinda had thought to be a magnificent gift was really a horrible curse that would put Ella in life long danger. She would be forced to obey every command she was given, no matter how horrible.

This school hardly fits Ella's disposition. she always slid down the banister and tripped over things. One day Ella escapes from the reform school and decides to head out on a journey in search of Lucinda and a way for her curse to be broken. Her journey is packed with convincing ogres, friendly elves, giants, and much more. She is helped along the way by her fairy god mother, Prince Charles, and her faithful magic book.

So a long came a fairy named Lucinda. She touched her nose and said \\"My gift to you is obedience, Ella will always be obedient. Now stop crying child.\\" Ella stopped crying. But now she always has to be obedient. She has to do anything that anyone says to her.As Ella got older she noticed the spell more and more while it kept getting her in more trouble. For example, someone asked her to eat a whole birthday cake, without it even being touched yet, and she did, she shoved every bit of it in her mouth, but her mother yelled at her. She wanted to get the spell off; she asked the fairy but she wouldn't take it off.The Thing is Ella doesn't have to listen to wishes. Like if someone says \\"May you please hang up my coat?\\" Ella doesn't have to do it. If they say \\"Ella go hang up my coat,\\" She has to do it because it's a command. Most of Ella's friends take advantage of this. They all think that Ella will do anything for them, but what they don't realize is that Ella doesn't like it and is getting angered.This is a book you have to read. It's filled with fears that Ella has to overcome everyday. She worries that her life could be over at anytime.

I am 14 years old and it is just the right reading level, although kids and adults of all ages would really enjoy this story. The plot is that a young girl named Ella has been put under a spell by a fairy named Lucinda. She must obey when someone gives her a command-this proves to be a disadvantage to Ella.

Thread into the well-known story are make-believe languages, creatures from fantasy fiction, and explanations for magic from a fairy's perspective. The most endearing concept woven into this tale is the idea that Ella and Prince Char get to know one another as friends long before their romance takes root.Rather than take a radically feminist approach to Cinderella, Levine considers human foibles and magical interventions to explain why the story must progress as it does. We learn where the glass slippers come from, why Char must choose a wife at the ball, and reasons for Ella's everlasting obedience. On a more fantastic level, we learn what elves eat, how ogres lure their victims, and the dreamland offerings &quot;fairy books&quot; provide their readers.This is a first-rate read for anyone who wishes to believe in fairytales, but hates the sexist, exploitive nature of more traditional Grimm stories."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"i have read and reread this book a countless amount of times. every time i reads it, i find a new surprise in the plot. maybe i enjoy this book so much because ella reminds me of myself. in the book, ella is a clumsy, humourous girl with a curse. the curse was bestowed upon ella as a baby as a gift from lucinda, a careless fairy. now ella has to obey every order, as simple as put your coat on to chop off your head! it doesn't help that ella falls in love with the charming prince and her evil stepsister forces her to be a servant and not love the prince! this cinderella twist is fascinating and page turning. if you love fantasy this book is something that shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"What can I say except this book is a real thriller!

But what really makes this book a must buy is Ella's determination to break the spell that is upon her.

Ella is a young maiden who, at her birth, was given a &quot;gift&quot; by fairy Lucinda. But what a horrible gift it is! Ella must do whatever anyone commands her! Now she has come to think of it as a curse.

When she runs away she is escorted home after dealing with ogres by the prince.

She loves her mother, has a trusted elder who watches after her, she has a talent for languages, and she has befriended the prince.My one problem is that the first part of the story is heavily populated with elves, fairies, giants and even a pet centaur, but these elements are unceremoniously dropped, not to be mentioned again.

It is by Gail Carson Livine. Ella Enchanted also won a Newberry honor. At birth Ella of Frell was given the \\"gift\\" of obedience (though I think that it was more like a curse), from a fairy. Ella could be controlled by anyone at any time with an order. If someone told her to hop on one foot for a month she would have to do it and if they told her to cut off her own head she would also have to do it. If I were to be in her position I would not be happy. So Ella decides to go on a quest to break the curse forever.I think that this fantasy and adventure story is probably for seven to thirteen year olds. Ella Enchanted is so good that I just finished this book for the second time! This Cinderella story includes evil stepsisters, an evil stepmother, mean teachers, fairy godmothers and an amazing ending that is perfect for a princess."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love Ella Enchanted. I happened to pick it up for the first time when I was in the fifth grade, and then after reading it proclaimed it one of my favorites and later bought it.The story is a very detailed, imaginative version of Cinderella--but if I hadn't found out it was supposed to be Cinderella, I wouldn't have known! This book is so different. Everything seems to make sense.I've read it over and over, I read it mostly when I feel that I need courage. It gives me courage. It is a very powerful book.Ella has to deal with everything, from loss to love, bravery to fear... But this 'Cinderella' story is surprising, because it comes with a twist: Ella is cursed. She must do whatever anyone tells her to, no matter what. The curse was a 'gift' from the odd fairy Lucinda.The big question is, how will Ella survive with a curse like that? Can she really?I love this book to pieces. It's a beautiful, exciting story. Ten thousand stars!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book Ella Enchanted is based on the classic story of Cinderella as told by Ella, spunky daughter to a loving mother and a greedy merchant, and recipient of a &quot;gift&quot; at birth from a foolish fairy, forcing her to do whatever she is commanded, &quot;whether it was hopping on one foot for a day and a half, or chopping off my own head!&quot;. Her mother soon dies, leaving her father free to marry a revolting rich society woman and leave Ella with two equally horrible stepsisters. Along the way, Ella develops a close friendship with the prince. But what would her stepfamily say about such a relationship? I liked this book because of the creative way the author spins the fairy-tale story of Cinderella into a young adult novel and adds funny, moving, and occasionally serious or even sad details to the story, and also makes it easier for readers of this age group to relate to the heroine's feelings. Another thing i liked was that gnomes, fairies, and ogres can enter the story without anything really jumping out at you as out of the ordinary; they blend into the storylines. This would be a good book for anyone who enjoys fantasy, and anyone who liked the highly acclaimed Harry Potter series will definetly like this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My 10-year-old son brought this book home from the school library, and we enjoyed reading it together (so it's not just for girls). I thought it was a great retelling of Cinderella and included the one thing no other storyteller has covered: &quot;Why was Cinderella such a WIMP?&quot; Levine's possible explanation (a fairy's &quot;gift&quot; of obedience) is imaginative and well thought out. She also surrounded her characters with a wonderful world to inhabit. Although it was definitely written for younger readers, I enjoyed it, too. This is a book that needs to be in every fairy-tale-loving little girl's library. It's a wonderful counterpoint to wimpy &quot;someday my prince will come&quot; fare. Ella is a strong female character. I wish there were more of them."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Many young girls dream of having a fairy tale life just like the ones that appear in Disney movies such as Cinderella, but what happens when these girls grow into young ladies and expect a little more than your usual fairy tale? In her novel Ella Enchanted, Gail Carson Levine adds a whole new twist to the familiar story of Cinderella. With the use of point of view, characterizations and themes, she achieves to appeal to a budding, young female audience that already has a love for the classic Disney tale.Point of ViewCarson presents a first person point of view that allows Ella to narrate her own story. Her thoughts, her commentary and each of her actions are plain for the reader to enjoy and experience a first hand look into Ella's world. The reader is allowed to relate her character, as she seems more realistic (as far as a fairy tale goes) than ever before, as she goes through every day teenage trials with boys (a prince, to be exact), friendship, fitting in, envy and such problems that still happen today.CharacterizationsEllaWhile Disney's Cinderella is an upbeat, optimistic girl that seems to have the whole world set out for her, Levine's Ella is given a whole new dimension as a character. Ella, as a child, receives the \\"gift\\" of obedience by the wayward fairy, Lucinda. Forced to do everything she is told, Ella develops a strong, rebellious character determined to become her own person, despite what others command her to do. She may subdue physically, but mentally and spiritually, she is a character that is intelligent beyond her years that refuses to conformity, aesthetics and propriety for the wrong reasons. Carson develops Ella in such a way that her flaws and struggles with herself and others are present. Ella is not a glorified storybook character that has everything going perfectly for her; she fights for what she believes in, she makes mistakes to learn from them and goes through the motions just like her young female audience.Prince CharmontWhen the thoughts of a charming prince come to mind, what is available is only the idea of a charming prince who is just there to both save the day and marry the girl. While in most fairy tales, the female lead character usually overshadows the male equivalent; Prince Charmont is far from hidden. Carson develops Char (as he is cleverly nicknamed) in such a way that he breaks away from the usual princely stereotypes by adding a little more to his personality but still maintaining the characteristics that would most likely still make any female weak in the knees. When Ella first meets Char, she keeps her distance in a demonstration of respect of his nobility, but he refuses to be regarded of higher ranking and asks to be addressed as any other person. He is kind hearted and humble but still he holds strong and true to the convictions that he is instructed as a young ruler. One example of this is when he pauses the beginning of a military journey to get on his hands and knees to help a merchant whose cart is overturned, instead of leaving off and ignoring the lower class. Another defining characteristic is that he, like Ella, struggles to create his own identity under the overpowering shadow of his future as the ruler of the kingdom of Frell. Char's authentic infatuation for Ella and his deep respect for her are what make the reader believe him as the true charming prince.The Fairy GodmotherOne may expect a flick of the wand and a bibidi boppidi boo to describe a fairy; Carson declines to this generic view. Mandy, Ella's fairy godmother is described as aging, overweight, speckled with freckles and frizzy hair. She hides her true identity from Ella and for the first 16 years of Ella's life, she is known as the kitchen maid and nanny. Her real self is only discovered after Ella's mother died and Ella is left to the care of no one but her father. The way that Carson portrays Mandy is in a stern, parental way so the reader can see her as a mother figure for Ella, more than just a fairy godmother that provides every single wish. Carson makes Mandy out to be a lovable character towards the reader because she nurtures and takes care of Ella while still remaining firm to what she thinks is best for her goddaughter.ThemesIn this novel, Carson explores themes that are of interest to a young female audience. One of these is the search for an identity and a place in the world. Carson develops her main theme as Ella is trying to establish herself as a person with her beliefs and convictions, and not just become a pawn to anybody's game that has knowledge of her curse. She demonstrates to the audience that they do not have to conform to a popular idea and encourages the reader to form opinions by gaining knowledge by Ella's example of maintaining her integrity and refusal to ignorance.Another theme that goes hand-in-hand with the one mentioned before is integrity, being true to who you are. Carson encourages this by making Ella such a strong character that even though she is forced to be someone else, in her mind, she is determined to be who she truly is. Char is also another example of integrity. He is a prince, a trait that may give way to arrogance and to discrimination by status, but he denies any association of himself as a person to his nobility.With these different literary aspects, Gail Carson Levine creates a fairy tale all her own that only alludes to the commonly known storyline. She creates a story for young girls to be immersed with such believable characters in a fictional world that teach very valuable lessons while also having those key elements that happen to draw the audience in."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When Ella was born, a fairy gives her the &quot;gift&quot; of being obedient.She must do anything anyone commands her to.

This book has the excellent characterization typical of such high quality youth novels. The underlying themes about friendship, loyalty, and self sacrifice are lovely.As the mother of a young daughter, it thrills me to find a book with such a clear depiction of a young woman believing in herself and using her brain to get her ahead. I've loved this book for years before I even had a daughter and it makes me very happy to know that it is one I will be able to gladly share with her. Truly a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I'm 15 years old. O.K. so maybe I'm a little too old to be reading kids books. Well, most of the time I don't, but this book is just too great to not read. I have read this book at least 3 times.Ella Enchanted is indeed... ENCHANTING. I can still not put it down. Ella is a spunky, stubborn young girl who was \\"blessed\\" or should we say cursed with the gift of obedience. Throughout her life she must do whatever anyone tells her to do. From her fairy god-mother, to her terrible step-sisters, to Ogres. The book goes through her many adventures of trying to break her spell. The author vividly describes each character, it's as if you are watching the book instead of reading it.I would definately say this is one of the best books I have ever read. It never gets boring. Although the book is somewhat predictable, the author makes up for it by throwing in thrilling twists and turns. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants a exciting read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Unlike many Cinderella stories, Ella is a spunky and brave heroine. Nothing gets in her way, not even the curse put upon her my the ditzy Lucinda, of obedience. I read this book for the first time in the 5th grade and have reread it too many to count times. Ella Enchanted is a very detailed read, but not so much so as to bore its reader. If you don't already own this book, buy it now. I guarantee you will not only be satisfied, but thrilled every time you read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedGail Carson LevineTellie RallossieElla Enchanted is a fantasy story that takes place on the mystical land of Frell. Ella, the main character has been under a curse since she was born. This curse is known as the gift of obedience. She must follow any order given to her. If she doesn't, she will get dizzy, headaches, stomachaches and other complaints as well. Ella's fairy godmother once told her mother, before her mother died, that there is one way to break the curse, but Ella would have to find it out for herself. Ella doesn't like to make many friends because they see how obedient she is and they will use her, but one person she finds she can confide is Prince Charmont, or Char. Another person is their cook, Mandy. She has taken good care of Ella since she was a baby.After Ella's mother died, Ella's father came into play. He was a trader that traded with different cultures and had never been home for long. When he saw how clumsy Ella was, he decided to send her to finishing school where she would have to deal with many orders and people she does not like. Ella did not want to go away since she had many friends in her surroundings. She liked to talk to the parrots that the king had outside in a pen that was taken care of by a friend named Simon. Ella's father was a greedy man who always got his way no matter what. So she went off to finishing school and was given many orders about how to walk, talk, eat, sit, and dance like a lady. This was a big deciding factor in the book. It makes many conflicts that affect the rest of the story. If you want to find out what happens next, you must read Ella Enchanted.I liked this book because it is full of adventurous times. No matter what Ella is doing, she always finds herself in a situation. The good part about that is whether it's almost being eaten by ogres, or escaping the twisted mind of her father, she can get out of it with flying colors. A person that would like this book would be somebody who likes fantasy because it has lands that are not real, ogres, elves, gnomes and other mythological creatures as well. Although it is fantasy it has a sense of Middle Ages in it. I would recommend a reader to read this book because it is very entertaining."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted. That has to be THE best book I have ever read!

Even if she was ordered to cook herself, Ella must do it, she had no choice. After her mother's death Ella's father sends her off to finishing school so that she won't embarass him in front of other people, but not before she makes friends with Prince Charmont, the heir to the throne. As this retold story of Cinderella unflods, it turns out to be an astonishing book. It happens to be my favorite book, maybe it'll turn out to be your's too!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an excellent novel about a 13 year old girl named, Ella. Her determination to beat a curse that was put on her as a little girl is strong and makes the story interesting and a page turner.Ella&#65533;s so called &#65533;gift&#65533; is that of obedience. Anything she is told to do she must obey! She looses her mother and must learn to love a father to whom she is not close. At her mother&#65533;s funeral she meets Prince Charmont and becomes good friends with him. They do many things together such as go to the royal zoo. There, they keep exotic birds that can talk!! Ella is excellent at memorizing languages. She can talk to allsorts of fairy tale creatures! Ella is determined to find the evil fairy that put such a curse on her, Lucinda, so she may undo it.

Since her father is away on his demanding business of trade she is stuck with her bossy step sisters and wretched step mother. She is made a slave in her own house!This fantasy novel is fabulous and exciting to read. I award it 4 stars out of 5 because it could be a little slow at times, but very rarely. Gail Carson Levine&#65533;s re-telling of the classic fairy tale Cinderella is magnificent! The imagery you will get will be astonishing and the detail is well thought out and invoking. Gail Carson Levine has an imagination of a 5 year old child! I recommend this book for the ages 8-13, but if you like Cinderella this book is a MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a remarkable book in which a brave young girl is tormented by a spell cast on her, binding her to obediance. It grows unbearable as when she grows older she can not risk falling in love with the prince she meets for she may bring him to his death through the dreadful curse. The only way to save him would break her heart and she is caught in a decision that she doesn't know how to bear....And at any time creatures from ogres to evil stepsisters can command her death... and she will be forced to obey.This book is so amazing and as you place yourself in the mind of Ella you are able to gasp, groan, cry and laugh with her. This book will leave you feeling so wonderful. It's an unexplainable experience...one that you will never forget."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is probably the best \\"Cinderella\\" story I've ever read. It starts the morning when Ella (no, her real name is not Cinderella, it's actually Elanor) is given a \\"gift\\" from a fairy. The gift, which it really a curse, makes her obiedient. If she's given a direct command she has to do it.The beginning for the book lacks emotion--it's just Ella telling us a story. Towards the middle of the book, when the Conderella theme becomes more noticable, some emotion starts coming out. The end of the book makes up for the beginning--it's fireworks of emotion and feeling!Though the end is slightly perdictable, this is a very good book. Anyone who likes books like \\"A Walk To Remember\\" will love this.My only real complaint is that I would have liked the book to be longer. When I finally turned the last page I was dying for more."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is definetly a winner! I fell in love with it imedietly, and wasn't satisfied even after I'd read it a few times in a row! Well worth it's award. The ending is completely satisfactory--not to mention suprising, heart wretching, and perfect. Even after all these years, if I want to feel cheered up, I turn to Ella Enchanted. Gail Carson Levine has a definite gift. She is creative and original--if not in the whole Cinderella air, in her method of presenting it. I will NOT tell you the ending or even the middle, because the suprise is a definite SUPRISE. But I will give you this: Ella is a young maiden who was bestowed a curse in her first hour of life by a well-meaning fairy named Lucinda. The curse was obedience. Ella has to do whatever another person commands of her. The book tells the story of the dificulties she went through, until the ulitimate test..... This book puts all other Cinderella -- if not every other fairy tale -- stories on the shelf with it's wit and humor. I hope that you will read this and I know that you won't regret it! Recommend it to everyone to share the wonderful experience! But please don't let that person know the ending! Because the ending is my favorite part...and it will be your's too! ... I recommend it for 10-14, maybe even younger."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This was the first book I bought by Gail Carson Levine. I had no idea how good it would be. It is based on a familar fairy tale(I won't spoil the plot), but it is cleverly hidden until the last third or fourth of the book. She has also changed the fairy tale so it is a lot more interesting than the original. It is a story about a young girl who was cursed by a fairy on her naming day. The fairy always gives gifts that are disgused as blessings, but are really curses. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy with a twist of reality . I would even recommend this book to adults."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A Review by AnastasiaA girl named Ella is living her cursed fairy tale life. She was given the gift of obedience when she was a child. Her life was turned around with the death of her mother. After this she has to deal with a step mother and sisters, a prince, ogres, her father, finishing school, trying to find a fairy, and the fact that she has to do whatever she's told doesn't help. Ella goes through a lot trying to overcome her \\"gift\\".I thought this book was very good. It was like a mix of a million different fairy tales; ogres, fairy godmothers, princes, etc. The author makes you feel like your going through the characters pain so you just have to keep reading to see if you get the happy ending you've been seeking. You want to see this story in an older looking setting in your head, but every now and then you see it as a modern day scene. This book kept me hanging on every word. And the unexpectedness of everything makes you want to dye sometimes.If you're a person who can't deal with the hardships that this character goes through and likes to have closure all throughout the book, you probably wouldn't like this book that much. But if you like that fairy tale fantasy type of story that leaves you hanging, you'll love it a much as I did."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It is destined to become a classic! The characters come to life on the pages, and the plot sticks in your mind for weeks after you have read the last page. When it was given to me as a birthday present, I was told it was a lot like Cinderella. I thought &quot;Cinderella? Yuck!&quot;. But it isn't the same kind of shallow, predictable story. In fact, I only started to understand why this book was being compared to 'Cinderella' near the end of the story when Ella falls in love with prince charming. 'Ella Enchanted' is one of my favorites, and can easily be compared to the Harry Potter books. All lovers of fantasy should own a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a wonderful Cinderella like fairytale! Hilariously funny and very adventursome!

Ella Enchanted is much better than the classic Cinderella, because Ella Enchanted has more challenges and adventures.Ella is cursed to be obedient, having to obey all commands.

The step-family tortures her and her father is no hope because he cares more about money.Ella tries to break her spell with the help of her fairy Godmother, who is a superb cook. As she tries to break the spell, she meets ogres, elves, giants and exotic creatures. With each creature there is an adventure that follows.

They order her around and she has to obey. I also dislike how Hattie made Ella give her her mother's necklace. I think that when she ran away she should have taken more things with her, including the necklace.

I volunteer at the local library and was shelving the William Allen White books last year when I found this book. I was immediately interested. I took it home, read it, and fell in love with it! I was thrilled to get the chance to buy it this spring at a school book sale. In this story, you can really feel for Ella. It is almost as though you BECOME her.

It is a great twist to a classic fairy tale. Ella is a normal girl who has been cursed by a terrible fairy named Lucinda. Every time Lucinda goes to see a new baby she gives them \\"gifts\\". The gifts that she gives are always awful though. Ella somehow ends up with the worst gift of all, she has the gift of obedience. Ella goes through many obstacles to get rid of her gift and even meets her prince charming. Her father ends up meeting a woman with two dreadful daughters. This makes Ella's life even more difficult, but it makes her reward so much sweeter.Along Ella's journey she meets many other interesting characters.One of these great characters is Prince Charmont, the prince of Frell who becomes one of Ella's greatest friends. Other characters include Olive and Hattie, Ella's stepsisters who always try to make her miserable. Her father is a secondary character, who turns out to be not such a great dad forcing her to do many tasks. Her step mother who is another secondary character that treats her like a slave when Ella's father is gone.I thought this book was fabulous because it has such a great moral, that no matter who you are you can overcome even the toughest obstacles and no matter what you can do anything if you set your mind to it. I also really adored all of the detail that the author put into this book. Gail Carson Levine created an entire fairy tail land.

She is told to do terrible things that she does not wish to do such as giving away one of her most prized possessions or not talking to or even seeing her best friend. This is because her evil stepsisters tell her to do it. Ella also finds her prince charming, in fact, his name is Char. Later on, she is made into a servant for her step-sisters and -mother.I was completely taken away to a fantasy land of trolls, and perfect prince charmings, and other wonderful creatures while reading this book.

I first read it when I was younger, and then read it twice while on vacation a few years later. After the movie (that does not do it justice AT ALL) came out recently I remembered how much I loved it, so I bought it and have just finished reading it for the 4th time. It's definitely one of my favorite books. It's just perfect...there's humor, romance, action, a happy ending...and a heroine that's so real everyone can relate to her. Levine does such a good job with descriptions I feel like Ella's world really exists and I desperately want to enter that world.

But apart from the maigc and the fairies in the book, for me the sense in the book is the \\"fight\\" of a girl against obedience. A \\"virtue\\" installed in many girls still today, stopping them from doing or saying what they trully think and believe in. I recommend this book as good discussion material for a girl's book club to make reader's (girls) aware of this \\"virtue\\", which is not one anymore. Today, there is obedience in a negative way and obedience in being polite and well behaved and especially girls need to learn about that fine line between those two."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an action-packed fantasy that I highly recommend to girls age 10 and up.

Ella Enchantd is by far the best book that Gale Carson Levine has ever written!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A couple of years ago, my daughter watched the movie \\"Ella Enchanted\\". She liked this spin of the Cinderella tale and I liked the fact that the while the young lady lived happily ever after in the end, she had to work a bit for that happiness. It seemed a bit more real life to me. I didn't know the movie was based on a Newberry Honor book.A few weeks ago, my son saw the book on DVD at the local library and we checked it out. Right away I knew there was a lot more to the book than had been in the movie. I believe the movie runs about 1 1/2 hours. The book was listed as being 5 hours and 42 minutes long.It was fantastic! We were enchanted from the beginning when we meet Ella and her mother and learn of the fairy curse which makes Ella be obedient to all who order her. We went through the sadness of Ella's mother dying and then we were taken on a magical journey complete with ogres, fairies, elves, handsome princes, centaurs and more. Ella tried time and time again to break her curse. She tracked down Lucinda who had given her this 'gift' but Lucinda only told her to be happy to be obedient. Ella made a huge sacrifice, but in the end it was her love and sacrifice that overcame the curse.I was a little disappointed when Ella ended up with glass slippers, was attending three royal balls and had to be home before midnight when the coach would turn back into a pumpkin, but the ending overcame this well worn section and we were immensely satisfied with how things turned out. I recommend this book either to read yourself or to listen to. If you haven't seen the movie already, it is very, very different from the book and of the two stories, I like the book best."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book combines humor, wit, and love to make an amazing novel.

I would recommend this book to ANYONE, it will leave you laughing, smiling, and feeling like anything is possible. =)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"You would think having a gift from a fairy would be astounding, right? WRONG! That's what happened to Ella. At her birth the idiot fairy Lucinda blessed Ella with the gift of obedience, (more like a curse actually). Ella will always be obedient, any command she will obey, even if it is to chop off her own head! Ella's curse makes her a puppet, allowing other people to command her as they feel like it. After her mother dies, you would think nothing else bad could happen, right? WRONG! Ella's father (who she doesn't know very well) is going to marry some cruel woman, not even caring that her mother just passed away. She is then sent off to a boarding school with her two, new, little bits of evil in her life, her step-sisters, Hattie and Olive. At school her sisters tease her and command her to do all sorts of horrible, nasty things, like making her sneak into the pantry to steal cookies. After only a couple weeks, Ella has had enough. She has been fighting the curse all her life and is now ready for some change. She will go on a journey and break free of the curse, once and for all.Despite all that, Ella is really just a lovely young girl, although she can be a bit of a rebel sometimes. I recommend this novel to anyone who can appreciate a dazzlingly good fairytale. I personally love this book because it shows the determination of a young heroine trying to free herself and not resting until it's done. With humor, true love, royal balls, fairies, and a curse, this book should be read by all!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is my all time favorite book. I'm not kidding I just finished reading it for the third time. It's a magical story about a girl with a curse. Ella was given a gift at birth by a fairy named Lucinda. Her gift was obedience. She had to always obey and do what others told her to do. Ella's mother died and she was left with her fairy godmother Mandy and her father. She didn't like her father because he was never home. He was always off selling stuff for his job. He didn't even know about her curse. Ella's father forces her to go to finishing school with Olive and Hattie who she really hates. Ella falls in love with the prince Char and Char loves her too. She is scared that if she marries Char someone will use her curse against him.

Though Lucinda means it toward good, as Ella grows up her \\"gift\\" constantly gets in her way and controls her life in a manner of speaking. But even through the difficulties, Ella finds her talents and has many adventures along the way. From ogres and elves to giants and friends Ella learns to be out going and even leaves a little time to hang out with Prince Charmont (Char).I took pleasure in reading this book tremendously because it is unpredictable, fun loving, and a touching story. I think girls of ages eight through thirteen would also love Ella Enchanted because since the moral is more directed to a Walt Disney fairy tale, it would be more enjoyable for them. Walt Disney usually goes after the living \\"happily ever after\\" and I think that is pretty close to what we should remember from Ella Enchanted: No matter what happens, keep on going through life and eventually you will overcome the displeasures and obstacles along the way."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"What would happen if I couldn't obey?\\"This sentence is used by Ella of Frell.

But thats not all, I dont want to give it all away, so you'll have to read the book to find out the rest!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"That fool of a fairy did not intend to lay a curse on me.\\" Ella Enchanted written by Gail Carson Levine is a book filled with magical edventure, this fantasy book its what you've been looking for! The main characters are Ella, Char, Hattie, Olive, and Mandy. Ella is cursed with the gift of obedience. She must do every thing people command her to do. Ella has tried many times to break the curse but only the person who did the cures can take it. Her father is a merchant. He is almost never home which leaves her alone with her stepmother and her stepsisters who are always ordering her around. It reminds me of Cinderella because their stepmothers are always making them do stuff for them. If you liked Cinderella you'll love Ella Enchanted!Char was gone for a year so Ella wrote to him for half a year. \\" You like me if you didn't you wouldn't write to me but I think I've liked you ever sinse I met you at your mothers funeral.\\" \\"What a beautiful bride you will be with whomever you marry at what ever age.' \\"What a beautiful queen you would be if you married me!\\" Char said that he loved her in his letter but Ella wrote back and said \\" I wouldn't marry you.\\" It made me sad that she wouldn't marry him.I think this book was a great book. I think it was a little easy. I think I would remember this book in a few years. I dont think it will easily be forgotton. If I had a bookshelf of my favorite books this book would be in it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella and at birth she got put under a spell that for her whole life she would be obedient.

There are gnomes, giants, and ogres. I have stayed up until all hours of the night because I just couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Being a very avid reader at a young age presented pproblems for me. I could never find a book that was at the right level! When I got Ella Enchanted, however, I forgot that fact and was quickly drawn into the author's tale of magic and romance. Ella is a young maiden who, at her birth, was given a &quot;gift&quot; by fairy Lucinda. But what a horrible gift it is! Ella must do whatever anyone commands her! Now she has come to think of it as a curse. In this hilarious yet serious story, Ella goes through a mother's death, a fairy as a godmother, and boarding school with a selfish girl who has discovered the curse. When she runs away she is escorted home after dealing with ogres by the prince. When he proposes, she realizes that she will be putting the kingdom in danger because of the curse...what will happen next? Read and find out! Phew! Just talking about a book this good makes me want to read it again!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I really loved the ending of this book when Char proposed to Ella. I ABSOULOUTLY hated Hattie, Olive,Olga, and Ella's father. I thought it was cool how Ella escaped from finishing school though. I also liked the part when Ella and Char slid down the banister at Ella's father's wedding where he married Mum Olga. One of my favorite parts was also at the last ball when Hattie untied Ella's mask and Char saw that it was actually Ella that he had been dancing with the whole time. I guess Hattie actually did a good thing for Ella. I TOTAllY RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is absouloutly the best book that I had ever read.!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I couldent put this book down it was so good. a wonderful fantsey whith goblens and faries.It was MUCH better then enything I ever read. if you liked Ever After the movie you'll this cinderala story!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"At birth, Ella was put under a curse by Lucinda. She became annoyed with Ella's crying. Lucinda touched Ella's and said &quot;My gift is obedience.&quot; The curse made her have to do any command said to her. For instance, if someone ordered her to cut her head off she would have to obey the command. Before anything horrible like that would happen, she searched for Lucinda to try to convince her to remove the spell. All Ella wanted was be free of Lucinda's gift.Ella's cook, Mandy, was preparing soup for the family. It was carrot soup with a special ingredient, a bit of unicorn's tail. Ella's mother removed it from her soup. She became very ill and died, because she removed the unicorn hair from the soup.When Ella was attending her mother's funeral, she met a very understanding boy who felt just as badly as Ella did about her mother's death. His name was Prince Charles or Char.After Ella's mother's death, her father lost all the land, money and their manor. Ella was to marry a wealthy man so she and her father would be wealthy again. Ella's father, Sir Peter, married Dame Olga. Ella was now a step-sister to both her retched daughters."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book I couldn't even put it down. I read it in one day. The whole time I was on the edge of my chair cheering for Ella and Char and despising Hattie and Olga (sometimes her father to) the great Cinderella like ending was terrific I hardly saw it coming. One of the best &quot;new&quot; Cinderella stories since the movie Ever After. One for everybodies bookshelf!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This retell of Cinderella is funny, imaginative, and romantic. Fairies, gnomes, giants, and others make this book even better. If you love creative and really sweet romantic comedies, you'll love Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This story, I believe, is one of the greatest children's stories ever written.

I have read it at least 25 times. It is so wonderful, and is a GREAT story of triumph!Ella is a great girl because she believes in herself.

DON'T DO THAT!!!* That's how real the book seemed to me.Every time I read it, I'm crying at the end when Ella ****** the *****. (sorry, I can't tell the reader of this review what happens at the end!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a very unique story. This novel is a spin-off of the classic fairytale Cinderella with a twist. The theme throughout this novel is good versus evil. Ella is in constant battle with a gift or curse of obedience that was given to her at birth by a fairy named Lucinda. The setting and the characters are both outside the realm of the possible. Ella has a fairy godmother that can perform magic and cast spells. The setting is in an imaginary city called Frell, of Kyrria. There are elves, gnomes, and ogres in this story who along with the prince, wicked step sisters and fairies manage to keep on her toes at all times. She is in conflict with every one of these characters in the story. Ella, who gives a descriptive and detailed account of her journey to find Lucinda, and road to freedom, tells this story in first person. Will Lucinda be able to take away her gift that she bestowed upon Ella or can Ella free herself of this so called \\"gift?\\""},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is a different way of telling the story of Cinderella. This is fun to read. The rest of the reviews I read about the book seem to agree with me. It's such a good book, that I actually bought another one after the girls in my entire freshman batch read it to pieces (literally). =)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"Ella Enchanted\\" is one of my all time favorite books. I read it in 5th grade, and now (at age 15) read it over and decided this book needs to be shared as much as possible.Ella, is a \\"real world\\" Cinderella, who is put upon the seemingly harmless and useful spell of obedience. Ella soon learns this is more like a curse, literally having to do what others command. The book gives the example that if she were commanded to chop off her own head, she would have to. Soon Ella comes across many other problems, and, well, the book is just splendid.Ms. Levine, I commend you for such a wonderful book you have written. I hope that if I ever have a daughter, I will be able to read this book to her, and enjoy it time after time."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Oh My Goddess!!!Once I read the first sentence of the book, I couldn't pause for a moment to stop reading it.I'm totaly in for this book. It's a retold story of Cinderella which Ella of Frell(the main character) has a gift of obedience which a foolish Fairy gave to her that turns out to be a curse for if anyone orders her to hop on one foot for a day and a half, or chopping off her hown head she would surely follow and do it. Now, she struggles on a quest with princes, ogres, giants, wicked stepsisters, and fairy grandmothers to break her curse and live a life free. I recommend this book to everyone. Even adults would surely enjoy reading this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ok, first of all...the people who make bad comments of about this book, and the people who are being sexist, better back off. Also, the people who are making rude comments about the author better check themselves b/c if this was such as bad book why is there over 600 good reviews for this book huh? And why did this book recieve over ten awards? Answer me that!Basically, this is a book about a girl named Ella. Since birth she was cursed to obey all her commands ( sure it gets annoyinghow she cant say NO, but thats just the way it is..) She falls in love with the handsome Prince Char, but before she can marry him, she must find Lucinda and end the curse...I HIGHLY recoment this book to anybody, any age...Lemme just say ages 7-100..haha. This has got to be one of the best books I have personally read. I recomended this to a friend, and after she spent the whole night reading it, she came to me and thanked me so much for recomending it. See for yourself!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"this book goes beyond the limts in my mind."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved it, adored it, just read it for the second time and loved it even more!What a brilliant way to make a strong and passionate Cinderella -- and thus get the prince to fall in love with her.Unable to disobey any order, Ella of Frell must use her wits and talent to get out of a lot of sticky situations -- from the tyranny of her stepsister Hattie to the horror of man-eating ogres. But Ella finds a way past them all -- with occasional help from the kind and generous Prince Charmont.An absolutely charming tale of strength and love."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is definitely one of my favorites. It's a delightful twist on the Cinderella story. Levine cleverly put a new spin on the old story, and that definitely made me more intereseted in the book. It's also very creative and imaginative, and it's hard to put down once you've started. I've already read this book countless times, and I still enjoy it every time I read it: it never grows old."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Wow. This book really captures! I've read it 11 times over 3 years. I'd definetly reccomend it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Under a curse, Ella goes through many hardships in life. Then something awful happens, and she is sent to finishing school, it is horrible, especially with the curse! She has fun times, too. Example: She makes friends with a prince."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This story is another smarter version of Cinderella. Ella, the main character, is a young girl who was cursed by Lucinda, the fairy, to always be obedient. Her fairy godmother, Mandy, assured her that she would be able to break the spell one day. However, in the meantime, Ella had a hard childhood. She was bossed around by Mandy, who did it without knowing it, and it grew steadily worse when her mother died and her father sent her off to finishing school. At finishing school, a mean girl named Hattie learned her secret and bullied her immensely. She escapes, and goes back with the help of her friend, Prince Charmont. At home, more disaster awaits her. After a long trial, she finally breaks through the curse with much pains, and gets to marry.I like this story because the Cinderella of this story is so much more intelligent. Ella is not a weepy, easily defeated girl; on the other hand, she is strong and ornery. She doesn't listen to just anybody as sweet Cinderella would, and do everything she is told to do. Ella believes that there is no point in being a lady if all a lady has to do is to listen to others give her commands, and then doing them whether she likes them or not. I fully agree with her on that account. I despise girls that meekly obey to everything and get led around by their noses- as if they could not think for themselves- which they are capable of doing if they just would.My favorite part of the story is when Ella goes to the giant's, Uxanne's farm to attend the wedding taking place and to find her father there. People always think that we are bigger than most animals, which gives us the right to dominion over them, because other creatures cannot resist. For example, if I blow an ant from one side of a bathtub to the other, it would have to obey because it cannot steel against the man-made mind. Well, giants could dominion over humans if they wanted to here, since they were so much bigger. It's interesting to hear about the food- a walnut being bigger than a baby, a cream puff the size of a balloon. Ella has to eat with her fingers because the silverware is too large, and to drape her napkin over her arm because it is so roomy. I wish I could experience a meal like hers."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This retelling of Cinderella is absolutely perfect. It has love, humor, spunk, great characters, and an unforgettable version of the Grimm's Cinderella story. I am 17 and have gotten all of my friends to read it. It's great. Everyone, from a 6 year old to a 66 year old will like it. Truly enchanting."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this retelling of Cinderella. It expands the fairy and magic theme and this works really well. I also enjoyed the development of the relationship and characters of Ella and the prince. Wonderful and entertaining."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"By retelling the famous fairytale Cinderella, Gail Carson Levine sends out the message in Ella Enchanted that in you believe in yourself, you can conquer the toughest things.Ella, who plays Cinderella, is given the \\"gift\\" of obedience by a foolish fairy, Lucinda. Now Ella must obey every direct order given to her, which is partly why she is such a klutz.To make matters worse, Ella's mom passes away. During her funeral, she meets Prince Charmont, or \\"Char.\\" He's very modest and understanding, and he cheers Ella up a bit. Unfortunately, Ella also meets Hattie and Olive, two self-centered and spoiled brats.Then, as if Ella's life couldn't be more miserable, her father sends her to finishing school in the town of Jenn with the disgusting slobs, Hattie and Olive. Soon, Hattie cleverly finds out that Ella is very obedient. So, being greedy, she turns Ella into her little slave. Strong-willed Ella doesn't take such torment. She runs away from school to try and break the curse but she's unsuccessful.With nowhere to go, Ella returns home. Meanwhile, Char writes her to her, expressing his deep affection towards her. Although she loves him too, she realizes the danger that her curse would bring him. She pretends to run away. How will Ella ever be able to live happily ever after?A descriptive, well thought out story. We couldn't stand to put it down. I was disappointed when the story was over. We wanted to keep reading. I felt myself laughing and crying with the characters. We recommend this book to anyone who once enjoyed the tale of Cinderella and wants to hear it told through a different point of view."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think this is one of the best and most creative books I've ever read. Gail Carson Levine is an awesome author who really puts some cute and funny ideas into writing this book.

There is also an evil stepmother and two annoying stepsisters and a prince and I LUV THE BOOK!!! It is really good and the ending is so cute! Ok, well, get the book, buy it, borrow it, whatever, but READ IT!!! :):):)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Thsi is the best book I have ever read! I read it 3 times in row, and I mean in a row. Right when I finished it I began reading it again! It's a bit like Cinderella. With a wicked stepmother, balls, and a prince. But this is even better. Ella has a curse on her- obedience! Any time some one says she must do some thing she must! That's why she's trying to find the fary that put the curse on her so she can marry Prince Char."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"People out there if you haven't read this, read Ella Enchanted now, it's a great book!! Gail brings lots of fairytale creatures such as ogres, fairies, and giants into her book. The book takes you to places you have only dreamed to go. You will find that the end is the most interesting. If you like books with adventure then this is the book for you, Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved reading Ella Enchanted. I have read it 5 times and learned something new everytime. It is a great fairy tale one that is very interesting and fun! I loved the way Ella was not so perfect like Snow White or Cinderella. When she got mad, disliked or disapproved of something she showed it and was not afraid too. That is part of what made this such an interesting book. But there wee also things I disliked such as the ogres eating people only because when I read it to my younger sibling he/she got scared and no longer wanted to read it and that disappointed me because it is such a great book. Still I hope many other readers enjoy this book as much as I did and still do to this day!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It's not your usual fairy tale and it reminds me a little of Cinderella.

It is just like Cinderella (only her name is Ella) but she is cursed to follow anyone's orders. In the story, there is a foolish fairy, a cute prince, a fairy godmother that cooks very well and a fat, ugly step-family. Gail Levine writes the book just right and perfect for people to understand it. I hope she writes a sequel or someone turns it into a film that gets an Academy Award. I love this book so much I've read it five times since September and I will probably read it more."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was very entertaining and imaginative. For people like me who love stories with elves, gnomes and fairies it is more than just a story, you start to live inside the book. Although it was a funny book, it was sometimes annoying and depressing to see Ella give up everything she had to her step sisters because of the curse. It makes you hate the fairy in the book who gave her the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. Altogether the book was pleasantly nonsensical and fun to read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was very entertaining and imaginative.

It tells the story of an infant who had a curse placed on here by Lucinda, a fairy. The curse is to always be obedianant. The curse seemed helpful at first, then Ella realized the awful truth; she had to do whatever someone said. If someone said, don't be her friend anymore, she had to break a friendship. If someone said, give me that necklace, that's what she had to do. Everything seems to go wrong after he mother dies, and her father remarries. This tale is involved with gnomes, ogres, elves, fairies, and centaurs. Magically, this book will captivate you into a mystical journey into fantasy and wonder."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is funny,romantic, and sad.

The protagonist Ella is blessed (!) by a misguided fairy who gives her the gift of obedience. In the course of the book she meets elves, ogres, giants and of course develops a relationship with her prince which is not quite the way it happened in the Cinderella tales you might have been told. We are both looking forward to Ms Levine's next novel.

If not, you are truly making a large mistake."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is both real and unreal. You get so into reading this story that you can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy anymore. Each character, setting, and feeling, is so well described you feel like you're in the story. The main character is very believalbe, she is a regular teenager; she is clumsy, funny, smart, and improper. This book is witty, and beautifully written, it's without a doubt one of the best books you will ever read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A long time ago (about the year this book came out, maybe a bit after) I read this book. I loved it so much that i had to buy it! I have since read it approximately 10 times. Here's some background on the book:On the day Ella was born, there happened to be a fairy present. Her name was Lucinda who, while meaning well, bestows a gift that eventually turns into a curse. For our poor Ella, whom was crying at the time, it was the gift of obedience. Everyone tried to talk her out of it, but, alas, it was no good. For Lucinda believed firmly that she had done a world of good for the child.And so Ella grew into a rebellious young lady of a strong heart. At the time of her mother's death, she is left to the precarious hands of her absent-minded merchant of a father. He remarries, giving Ella two wretched and greedy step-sisters and a greedy step-mother. Thus, the story begins.This book is great material for bedtime reading to your children, or for your own reading library. I hope this helped!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is my favorite book. The story is about a young princess named Ella. When Ella was born, Lucinda, a powerful fairy gave Ella the gift of obedience. Ella tries not to obey, but she must.

The journey is very long, but Carr and some knights help Ella along the way. Ella and Carr slay monsters and meet many animals along the way. Soon they get to the wedding, but Lucinda tells Ella she can not take back her gift of obedience. Ella and Carr travel home. Ella soon breaks the gift Lucinda gave her. She no longer has to obey. Soon after, Carr asks Ella if she will marry him. Ella says yes. Ella and Carr get married and live happily after after.

Also this is a good book for girls because of the role Ella plays. She is a powerful girl becoming a woman. Ella is also a very intelligent person who can speak many different languages and knows how to act politely.'' You are polite enough, they taught you much at that school. \\" So if you like books filed with fantasy and adventure check out Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella was given a gift at birth.

It makes me cry sometimes. It's about a girl name Ella which has a gift of obedience. I love the it when she spend her times with the prince, Prince Char. I really didn't like the way her stepmother treated her nor Hattie or Olive. She had to obey every single demand. Till she found Lucinda, the fairy that gave her the gift. And Lucinda remove the gift from her. At the end she marries the prince, and wished not be called princess. And Mandy is her children's fairy godmother. It's a wonderful book.

My brother and I are homeschooled and we have Summer-school, too. And every Summer we pick out some fun book that we've never read (normally it's one of the classics, but not always). So two years ago (when I was 10) I ended up reading Ella enchanted. I don't remember how I noticed it, maybe my mom set it in front of me to see if I might want to read it...I don't know. Anyway, the back of the book made it sound interesting, but it's not until you open the book to one of the first pages which is titled \\"The curse of obedience...\\" That's the part that got me into it, and that's the part that will get you. I must be the biggest fan of Ella enchanted and I can't see how the movie (coming out April 23rd, 2004) can beat it. YOU'VE GOT TO READ IT --- you'll thank me later..."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The defenite best part: sliding down the stair rails.

It is much better (in my opinion) and, overall, a well written book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted has got to be my favorite book of all time. It contains all of the basic needs of a fairy tale, and more. Ella is a more down-to-earth girl than Cinderella in the Disney movie. She has feelings, dreams, fantasies, and characteristics that can help any normal girl relate. Although I am older than the reading level is said to be, I believe that any girl, young or old, would absolutely love this book. Every time I reread it, I discover new surprises that I hadn't noticed before. I have, however, not read the other books by Gail Carson Levine, but if they are not as good as Ella Enchanted, I'll beg her to write another book as magnificent as my favorite book of all time, Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book it was awsome.I liked every minute of it.It has everything I loved in it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I, like many parents was thrilled when my son fell in love with &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, and reading at the same time and I wanted to keep the magic (an unavoidable pun) going. We have discovered a number of charming fantasy books that keep the joy of reading alive and the concept of &quot;fantasy&quot; in perspective. &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; is a delightful, refreshing version of Cinderella. There are subtle connections to the familiar fairy tale that I find ingenious.Ella is not Harry. I confess that I am one of the many adults who love Harry Potter. However, for parents who are bothered by the some of the darker sides of Harry Potter, especially where their younger children are concerned, Ella Enchanted is much gentler. It is an excellent example of pure, enjoyable fantasy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love fairy tales, and have since I was a little girl. My favorite has always been Cinderella. When I read this book, I was &quot;enchanted.&quot; Haven't you always wondered why Cinderella kept being so nice to her stepmother and stepsisters? This story explains it all. I loved the character of Ella. She's not your typical princess, who waits to be rescued. She's independant and brave. My daughter got this for me for Christmas because she knew how much I loved it.

A classic story is spun on the basics of once upon a time. The twists of an curse and a happy ending. The curse, bestowed as a gift on Ella is obedience. Ella must do everything she is told, even if it is to chop off her head. The classic fairy tale charactoers- evil stepsisters, orges, fairys, fairy godmothers, a prince and of course, the heroine, all support an adventure beyond classic. Ella's quest throughout the book is to break her curse. Along this trail she encounters giants, tames orges, gradually falls in love and changes from a clumsy elephant to a finished young women."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is my favorite book!

This book allows an imaginative fairy-tale plot to be coupled with a headstrong and independent heroine. Girls will enjoy reading this with their parents or alone. This book is also a rainy day read for adults who need a little magic in their lives. &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; is a simple fairy-tale story that offers up modern-day issues and a different kind of heroine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"An enchanting and...different...rendition of the classic tale, this Cinderella story definitely has spunk!

I recommend it to any one who has a vivid imagination!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is truly like the Cinderella in all most every Cinderella fantasy novel she meets prince Charming and falls deeply in love except there is a catch that will make it hard for the two to live hapilly ever after. Ella is cursed by a fairy. Her curse is she must be obediant. So when someone gives the command to wash up, eat, or even kill can cause many problems as Ella deals with her father away and her new evil stepmother controlling her with commands making her a slave in her own house. Ella is not sure how she and her Prince can live happily eveer after!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This a wonderfully creative retelling of Cinderella. I found it engaging and funny, with just enough drama to keep things moving. My 8 year old son thought it was a great read, too, although the connection to Cinderella was a little lost on him. He did say that it ended &quot;just like that other story&quot;, though."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought 'Ella Enchanted,' is a fun, warm, well writen book, about a young girl who, as a baby, had a horrible &quot;gift&quot; bestowed on her by a foolish fairy. This &quot;gift&quot; is that she must be obedient. Even if someone told her to cut off her head, she'd have to do it! This is a wonderful story, a mix between the 'Harry Potter' book seriese, and 'Cinderella' with a cool twist!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"ELLA ENCHANTED is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. Ella is a teenager who, at birth was cursed with the gift of doing what she is commanded to do. For example if you told her to chop her own head off, she would have to do it. When she is older she gets pushed around by her evil stepmother and stepsisters who treat her as a servant. Her stepmother and stepsisters are obsessed with money. I won't say any more because it will give away the ending! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is woven with magical words and a very unique plot filled with magic, mystery, love, laughter, and suspense. It's about Ella, a headstrong girl who has been &quot;blessed&quot; with the gift of obedience. That means she has to do anything and everything she is told to, no matter what that might be. I loved this book and it ranks high on my list of favorites, along with the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Im a book lover and I know when I read a good book this is kind of like ever after thats my favorite i watch it about 2 times a day. I like that kind of adventure, when you read the book your in love with it.If you want to get it but you dont have enough money go to your local libarey and check it out like I did before you by it and think that&quot;oh I dont like this book&quot;that way if you do like it save up your money and buy ella enchanted. buy have a good day!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is so typical and funny, although the book is more sad than funny itself. I really loved this book, going along with it's journeys and laghing and crying along with Ella. This is a great book and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read! If I could, I would give this book a &quot;10&quot; and not just 5 stars! This book is packed with adventure, romance, and defenetly fantasy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was one of the greatest books I've ever read. I've read it over numerous times and never grown tired of it. Everytime the romance and suspense storys seem better and better. There was no reason for this book not to recieve the Newberry award! I definetly agree with Charlotte that whoever enjoyed Ever After will enjoy this book too. All I can say is that this is a great book, I read it over and over again and that you should get yourself a copy of it so you can experience it too!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"As an avid and enthusiastic devotee of fairy tales, whether in their most traditional and earthy garb or dolled up in modern drag, or even Disney-fied, this writer has encountered innumerable takes on the Cinderella story. This one is particularly precious, because it answers a lot of formerly grand leap assumptions. For example, why did an otherwise spirited young lass tolerate subservience at the hands of her stepfamily for so very long? Perhaps she was under a curse. All of those tales about a fairy or other magical sort bestowing gifts upon children at birth, eventually leading to trouble are echoed here. And what was Cindy's father's problem? Talk about absentee daddies! Turns out, there a reason for that too. Levine is a charming writer with a whimsical sense of humor. Her characters are well and fully drawn and particularly her heroine, her prince, and the fairies (there are two major ones here and a sprinkling of others) do not soon leave the reader after the book is closed. This will not fail to tantalize and delight fans of Donna Jo Napoli, Robin McKinley, and even the Harry Potter crowd. CONFESSIONS OF AN UGLY STEPSISTER by Gregory McGuire is a similar, but directed at a slightly more sophisticated audience, but is also tons of fun."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"So this is pretty much one of my favorite books and I will honestly say that it has changed my life for the good. In fact, it inspired me to my current way of writing. The weird thing is that the first time I saw this book, I really did not want to read it.But a book that originally began as Ms. Levine's writing class project has proved to be something truly wonderful in a world of far too many Cinderella retalings.The idea here is that the reason Ella (our Cinderella) obeyed her evil stepfamily is because, well, she had to, due to a curse that made her literally obedient to everything command given her.Despite this, she is a spunky heroine that you cannot help but love and does her best to make the best of her world, with the help of a fussy fairy godmother and the friendship of a handsome prince.I like the movie allright, but it is so different from the book that is cannot properly do this justice. It seems all sweet and fluffy, but each time I read it I am blown away by its emotional power.Cute and girly, but still worth its Newberry Honor."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was the Cinderella story with a twist. It was basically the same story but Levine adds her own originality to it to make it come alive. Ella has a storng, stubborn, wonderful personality. She is everything I wish I could be yet she had the &quot;blessing&quot; of obedience. She had to overcome it if she ever wanted to lead a normal life and not be bullied by evil step-mothers/sisters. This story is truely inspiring. I recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Wow!! I didn't think that so many people had reviewed this book!! Anyway, i read this book about 3 weeks after it came out. I got it as a present. I read it, and i thought it was fantastic, and i told all of my friends, and they thought it was great too, so this is speaking for all of us!! I loved this book because, number one, i love fairy tales, and fantasy is my favorite! number two, i thought it was great how Ms. Levine sort of &quot;explained&quot; all of the left out details of the real fairy tale. Like, who was her fairy godmother, anyway? and, why did Ella's stepmother and stepsisters hate her so much? and, i also love how Ms. Levine added her own little, well, huge twist on the story with the curse! I also loved how Ms. Levine added many more adventures and made Ella a couragous person. In the real fairy tale, Ella is beautiful, nothing happens, she dances with a prince, talks to mice, blah blah blah. Kind of boring. But, anyway, overall, i thought this was an amazing book, that should be read by all fantasy lovers!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"If you have children, nieces, nephews or know someone of small stature than you must purchase this book for them. It is one of the best re-writes of a classic fairytale that I've ever read. I was amused by the cover at first (although several of my classmates were not) and the blurb on the back cover which promised an enticing story of a girl cursed to obey commands, even to cut off her own head! I couldn't believe it, I was actually intrigued by a children's storybook blurb. I spent the rest of the evening reading the story, but I didn't notice the hours going by, because I was so in to the story. A young girl, bull-headed and independent who must nonetheless obey any order she's given. My favorite part of the book dealt with the romance of the Prince and Ella. Instead of seeing one another and falling instantly in love they are first acquaintances and then friends. After awhile they realize they have feelings for one another. It's a combination of fairytale and reality that I think works spectacularly. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Out of all of the fantasy books I've read so far, this one tops them all! Levine has definately graced this book with her magic! Any reader will be &quot;enchanted&quot; by this magical book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I bought the book after endless recommendations it is a Cinderella tale with a spunkier and wittier herione Ella, she's smart and blunt and very endearing... this story climaxes very well with the ball and a handsome prince awaiting her but of course the course of love never runs smoothly she was bestowed a gift or curse of obedience and she had to listen to every command something taken note by her horrid wig-wearing stepsister Hattie... it was hysterical and heartwarming and i would recommend it to teens who love fantasy or a touch of fairytale romance not too corny or mushy just right...=p"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is about a girl named Ella. Ella is put under a curse when she is a baby and only her,her mother and their cook mandy ( who is a fairy) know about it. Her Mother dies when Ella is thirteen and her father is always gone.Then one day her father decides to send her to a school far away.This book is well written and has lots of exciting parts.If you don't have this book you should get it NOW!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is the most creative books I have ever read. At birth, Ella was given the gift of obedience by and ... fairy named Lucinda. Now Ella has to obey every command that comes her way. Someone could command her to cut off her own hand, and unless someone else told her not to, she'd have to do it.The only comfort Ella would ever get was from her best friend and cook, Mandy, and her mother. But when Ella's mother dies, everything goes crazy. She finds out that Mandy is actually her fairy godmother, her father is going to send her to finishing school AND he's getting re-married to Cruella Deville (well, not REALLY Cruella, but someone just as bad...). Oh, but there's always the happy ending for our favorite heroine: Through all her hardships, Prince Charmont is secretly filling his head with thoughts of Ella, and of course, you can all guess the ending, though at times it will seem very hopeless.This story is full of wit, charm, and humor. Full of suprises, this book will make you want to cry at times and then it will make you laugh. Excellent for all ages."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"That's all I can say.... I'm a big reader and I know many languages to satisfy my needs. I know that this was a children's book.... Or so I thought.... I got it to read to my students. And... Wow! At the start, you learn why the curse she is on is bad, but through the story, she get's into pretty dangerous situations. And when the other characters find out.... I felt to mad when Hattie took advantage of Ella, that I really did, for the first time ever reading a book, playing a Video game, watching a movie, wanted to go into the book and slap her across the face. I wanted to do it so many times to characters who did that too her. And wanted to scream at Ella for the stupid things she did. when her heart broke, my heart borke and I wanted to scream at her for doing it to herself and me! This book really got me and I couldn't do anything about it! You should get this book. Even if you have the smallest spark of interest in it. I got it only because one of my students saw it at a the library and said if I could read it to her, since I deal with little kids. Wow! I mean, I like fantasy and mythical things, but this... Wow! You won't regret getting this. I read at least once a month, each time, wishing that she would do things differently! I even had some of my older students write parodies of this book! Really fun! and the little ones illustrate for the older kids. And sometimes I switch! Every year, for about 2 or 3 years, all of my students have loved this book and ordered it through book fairs and so on! This is one that could very well be the best book ever!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is definately a 5 star book. It keeps you interested and in awe from the beginning of the book. It, like the Harry Potter books, kept me bewitched, and it was impossible to put down. I've reccommended it to everyone I know, and now? Now I'm reccommending it to you!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"There's a terribly interesting subgenre that's dedicated to retelling the classic Fairy Tales, led by such notables as Robin McKinley and Mary Jo Napoli, but as marvellous as those &quot;adult&quot; retellings are, &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; - a supposedly children's-only book - manages to capture all the romance, all the danger, and all the wit in a lighter field and do so excellently.Cursed at birth with the geas to &quot;always obey,&quot; young Ella is at the tender mercy of every command from, &quot;Eat your dinner,&quot; to &quot;Jump off a bridge.&quot; Levine plays on this point excellently, building nerve-wracking scenes off of this seemingly harmless curse. Amazingly, the whole Cinderella story works far better for this single addition (consider: why didn't Cinderella in the Perrault and other versions just LEAVE?), but Levine adds more. Two fairy godmothers are in attendance; Prince Charmont (aptly named) dances attendance from the first; ogres, goblins, fairies and giants abound (each with their own language! Admirable indeed!); and, surprisingly, a goodly part of the novel is done in epistolary form! Add to *this* witty, intelligent language, and beautiful worldbuilding and one has but a small idea of the joy of this book.The combination of so many new elements might trip a lesser author up, but Levine's &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; moves along at a clip pace, and most assuredly deserves the term, &quot;page-turner.&quot; Lovers of high and traditional fantasy, dabblers in Fairy Tales old and retold, children's literature enthusiasts, romantics and adventurers would all do well to seek out and read this book. Appropriate for all ages - a sheer delight to read!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It's hard to describe how much I love this book! It's fluidity and originality makes ELLA ENCHANTED a classic in my eyes. The author immediately creates a connection between the characters and the reader. After reading the first chapter, the reader feels a bond with the cursed Ella, her mischievous mother, and her loving cook, Mandy. As Ella faces the effects of a fairy gift gone amiss, the reader also faces them. Whether hurt by an uncaring father, mistreated by envious stepsisters, or simply hastled by terrible ogres, Ella's pain is the reader's pain. Equually, her successes, triumphs, and love for Char are shared with reader. Join in with Ella, Char, Mandy, the giants, the ogres, and other memorable characters on countless adventures. You're sure to love it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 years old (when it first came out!). I'm 24, and this is still one of my favorite books. Obviously, it is an easy read, but it has such beautiful imagination and is so great to escape into. I try to read this book at least once a year. I'm not going to delve into a synopsis, there are many other reviews that can tell you what it is about. It is a spin on Cinderella, but to me, it is different enough to be considered it's own fairy tale. Other reviewers have mentioned the ending as being predictable and boring. If you know the end of Cinderella, you know the end of this book. To me, what made the book was the struggle Ella had at the end. This was a beautifully written book and if I have kids, I would want to introduce them to the magic that is Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. The movie is nothing like this book, and thats a good thing. The book is special all on its own. Personally, I love this story over the story of Cinderella. It has adventure, spunk, love, comedy, and a world that makes you want to keep reading just so you can stay a while longer."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is one of the best books I ever read. On a scale to one to five I'd give it a four! Ella enchanted is based on the story Cinderella. It's about a girl named Ella. She has a fairy godmother and her fairy godmother's name is Mandy. Mandy is a cook and she is with Ella all the time. Another fairy named Lucinda gave Ella a curse that made her obedient. She had to do everything anyone told her to. Ella's mother dies when she is fifteen. She can talk different languages. This is a really good book you should read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A great update and twist on a Grimm classic tale. I definitely recommend this to those of any age who have a love for the fairy tales of old and are open to those that are new. Very well done."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is my favorite re-telling of the tale of Cinderella. I have read this book more times than I can count!!! Whoever thought Ella would be cursed with obedience? This amazing story is for anyone who loves fairy tales. Gail Carson Levine has made the old story into a classic again. There is romance, adventure, jealousy, and magic. In fact, this book is a work of magic. Entirely captivating!!! I recommend this book so highly. But don't watch the movie \\"based\\" on it. It was a terrible disappoitment. However, the book does anything BUT disappoint!!!!! :)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"One of my absolute favorites. I could read this book over and over again! This book is a fun twist on the Cinderella story that keeps me up all night reading, even the second time around. Every young girl should read this!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The spell that Ella was put under gave the book a nice twist, and this was a novel that I immensely enjoyed. Reading about Ella dealing with her gift/curse and the ways she found around was a delight. I stumbled across it in highschool, and reread it in college. The reading level is a bit under highschool level, but it was a enjoyable read nonetheless, and would be a great gift for a girl, and still a enjoyable however quick read for an adult."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Oh, wow. So, picture if you will, a girl bored in Reading class, beacsuse she's already read all the books we're reading. So I wander over to the book shelf, and I find Ella Enchanted. 2 years later, I think I've read this book about 16 times. It is great. If Ella hadn't married Char, I WOULD!!!I love the step sisters. They're so stupid and hilarious.Buy the book. Watch the movie. Obsesses if you want. I do.Oh yeah, this is Karen's daughter.So yeah.See ya!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have read Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted three times now, and every time I do it gets even better. Ella Enchanted takes the classic tale of Cinderella and enlivens it with spunk, humor, and personality.At Ella's birth, a rather overzealous fairy named Lucinda blesses her with the gift obedience. From then on, she must do what she is commanded, whether she must do her chores, eat her entire birthday cake, or even kill, Ella is powerless against the will of her \\"gift.\\" When her mother suddenly dies, Ella is left to be cared for by many non-caring persons: her often-absent and greedy father, her voluptuous step-mother, and horse-faced and devious step-sisters. But Ella's tenacity keeps her fighting for her own free will as she searches for a way to relinquish Lucinda's gift.Ella's adventurous and charming nature keeps you smiling for the entirety of the book as she challenges hungry ogres, tricks her evil-stepsisters, tracks fairies, slides down castle banisters, and falls for the dashing Prince Charmont.Levine incorporates the iconic elements of the Cinderella tale, such as glass slippers, a pumpkin coach, and the infamous ball, while breathing life into the surrounding plot and characters. It is a novel that I could read again and again, and has instantly become one of my favorites.The novel is an ideal young adult princess/fantasy book for girls around middle school age, and is completely appropriate and innocent. It is typically around 230 pages and is a fast and uncomplicated read that can be enjoyed by youth and adults.Levine has written many other books as well. I have read Fairest. (Ella Enchanted is still my favorite and always will be.) Both books follow a similar theme and give a similar message: the quest of a female protagonist who must accept/discover her true identity and self-worth, and is rewarded for her high character and tenacity.Ella Enchanted is a must-have for every girl/woman."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I fell in love with Ella Enchanted years ago and it still never disappoints each time I go back and reread it. It is the classic Cinderella story but given infinitely more depth and finesse. It is a book filled with magic, romance, intrigue, twists, turns, and a spunky heroine who never stops fighting for what she believes is right. I know I will never grow tired or too old for this book and will someday read it to my own children."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am a 15 year old girl who likes fairy tales and other assorted fantasy, and I LOVED _Ella Enchanted_. My friend and I quote this book daily, and it is just one of those books that sticks in your head forever and never leaves.

This book is recommended to anyone who enjoys fary tales, good fantasies, or even just a rollicking good adventure with a spunky, wonderful heroine!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I suprised my friends by reading a fairy tale in class. I did a report on it in my English Honours class, and now the teacher is having us read it because it is a fairy tale, and even at this age, it is enchanting..."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was the best! I have always loved to read fairy tales, but this is by far out-ruling the others. The combination of three different fairy tales makes this story as complete as any needed to be. I always had questions about the classic Cinderella, and almost all of them were answered as I read this book. For example, How did Cinderella's mother die? She had the flu and did not keep the unicorn hair in the curing soup that was made by a fairy. Why did the shoes not fit anyone else? She had fairy's tiny feet. Did the stepsisters ever get married? Well, read the book to find that out. I recommend this book to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I'm a little old for this book, but my teacher reccomended it and so I read it. It was a quick read (only took me 2 nights), but the characters had me spellbound. Gail Carson Levine did an extraordinary job of making a humorous, lovable character with problems of her own and mixed it with the classic fairy tale of cinderella. I thought this book was great and I loved how ella was finally able to defeat her curse for the sake of her country."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"We are not expert book critics and were not the New York Times, but we do know when a book is good. Were are four fifth grade girls from Bedford Middle School in Westport CT. in the USA. We thought that Ella Enchanted was a very inspiring book. We had fun envisioning the place of Frell, Kyrria, and Bast. We loved how it was in a Fairy Tale manor. It was sad enough to make you cry and happy enough to make you smile. It was also a page turner and was very exciting. We liked this book very much and we thought it was one of the best books we have ever read. We recommend this book to people of all ages, young or old, boys or girls. We think that every one will love this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"OK, so I'm not Siskel or Ebert, but I am a 14-year-old who loved Ella Enchanted. It was extremely funny, and I could really relate to Ella (who seemed extremely believable compared to the original Cinderella). The story was very creative, and I am positive that the author has a great imagination - first, to get Ella into all kinds of scrapes, and then to get her out of them, all the time keeping true to the fairy tale! Ella Enchanted really inspired me to write more stories of my own, and I hope that someday I'll be able to win a Newbery Honor medal for a book as good as this one. Anyone, young or young-at-heart, will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My name is Ryan and I live in Macon, GA.

It truly is the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The premise of \\"Ella Enchanted\\", as you can read from the jacket or any of the other reviews here, goes like this: a young girl named Ella gets an unfortunate gift from a nice but incompetent fairy named Lucinda. Ella is magically forced to follow any command that anyone gives her. We then follow poor Ella as her mother dies, she gets sent off to finishing school, runs away, has a series of misadventures, returns home, gets sent off again, and finally marries the Prince and lives happily ever after.Now in my mind, this book is a missed opportunity. Thinking about the idea behind this book, you could probably come up with plenty of good jokes that could be made with it. \\"Ella Enchanted\\" does have a few funny moments, such as when a parrot keeps interrupting Ella's attempts to bake a cake, but on the whole it's not enough. Much of the book is spent watching Ella get tormented by evil stepsister Hattie. And while it's all done competently and Ella's revenge at the end is perfectly satisfactory, I found the book as a whole to be less uplifting than it might be. So in short, \\"Ella Enchanted\\" is readable, but not destined to become a children's classic by any measure."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Well, this book was on my summer reading list a few years ago. I thought it might not be anything special, because school summer reading lists never are, but I bought it because I thought maybe it was something different, and boy, was I right! There was only one other blow-your-mind-away good book on my reading list that year. Ella Enchanted is the retelling of Cinderella; only it's not just the same fairy tale bedtime story anymore. Ella has thoughts, feelings, and a life. It's not just a ditzy girl dreaming about her prince. It's about a girl who stumbles upon a prince, but doesn't really need him to save her...kind of. There are so many lovable characters and even more hated ones in this unique world that is where Ella lives. I recommend this book for anyone! Heck, I'm still reading it over 3 years later!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I picked up 'Ella Enchanted' shortly after reading another Cinderella retelling, which was good but nothing spectacular. I'm so glad 'Ella Enchanted' was second; it's a phenomenal book! Levine combines the fairy tale setting with relatable characters and a unique plot.When I was young I always wondered, \\"Why didn't Cinderella just run away? Things couldn't have gotten much worse for her. And why didn't she just stand up to her stepfamily?\\" Levine provides a clever answer to that question. Ella has been cursed since birth with obedience. For her, there is danger at every moment--especially with a business-minded, heartless father, a selfish stepmother, and two greedy stepsisters who use Ella to their every advantage. Still, Ella isn't a meek servant resigned to her fate. She's a courageous, intelligent, kind-hearted heroine that readers will cheer for and fall in love with.And Ella isn't the only great character! Levine fills her novel with wonderful characters, from the spirited Mandy to the serious but kind Prince Charmount to the oblivious Lucinda--everyone here will spark your imagination.If you love fairy tales, if you ever wondered why Cinderella didn't have more backbone, if you love clever young adult literature, get this book. I'm sure it'll be a favorite in no time."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was at the book store a couple times and I wanted to get it. When I went for the 3rd time, I got it.

I finally got around to reading it and i finished it in 3 days i could not stop. I didn't remember any of the events that had happened so it was like reading it for the first time. It may seem like a classic love story but it is far beyond that. Ella is a clumsey girl that was given the gift/curse of obedience when she was born by a careless fairy named Lucinda. As Ella grew older her and her family began to realize how dangerous the curse could be. Ella having to follow every command given to her starts to fight it off but the more she ignores it then the more the curse retaliates with a stomache or dizziness. When she meets Prince Char and falls for him she realizes that to keep him out of possible danger she needs this curse to be lifted. Ella sets out on an exciting adventure to find the ignorent fairy that gave it to her. This is a great page-turner that will leave you happy for days. I recommend reading it before viewing the movie."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is born with a curse given to her by a fairy that was meant to be a gift..... that she has to be completely obedient no matter what. If someone tells her to cut off her head, she must. she goes through many adventures where her curse just becomes so unbearable. one part that got me was where she was wearing her mother's necklace, a treasured item since her mother died, and her evil stepsisters find out her gift. then hattie told her to give her the necklace, and ella douldnt do anything about it. i wanted to KILL hattie!!!! ARRGH! anyways, it is basically cinderella with a bunch of cool twists. it immediately became my favorite book after reading it, except for my beloved harry potters. in the end she ends up going to the ball where she cant show her face.....long story. she cant marry her true love, the prince, because of her curse. if someone told her to kill her own husband, she would have to, even though they are in love. and the prince has lots of enemy's. i cant tell you the ending, you will have to read it yourself. you hafta read it its the best book ever. it has many other parts that i cannot possibly cover all in this online review....but all i know is that it is a FAB-U-LUS book! you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In this children's classic, Ella has the gift,or curse, to be obedient. Always. If she were told to cut her head off with an axe she would have to obey. Though very much based on Cinderella (hint: Wicked Stepmother and Stepsisters, Prince Char, Kinda like Charming, and obviosly Ella, though her name is Eleanor)This book is hilarious and sometimes suspensful. It is very much beyond me why Out Of The Dust beat this for the Newbery. :~("},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"What a story teller!

Being a lover of the Walt Disney Cinderella story this was a bit of a change. The language at the start of the book was a little difficult to follow, but once I caught on I knew I was going to have a new favorite book. Levine makes you really feel sorry for the character Ella, who was born with this curse to obey orders. When her wicked stepsisters' catch onto this they go wild asking Ella to do this and that. They even take away possessions of Ella's like her money and mother's necklace. As Levine makes you like one character she makes you hate others. And of course in all fairy tales that have a happy ending there is a happy love story too. I also think that the age level of this book, 8 and up, is appropriate. Levine also does a wonderful job at making the reader get involved in the characters. At the end of the book when Char was dancing with other girls at the ball, it kind of made me mad. You want him to pick Ella so badly that you hurt for her too. It was a great example of making you feel for the characters you are reading about. I was so wrapped up in this book, and can't wait to read it over and over again!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella was blessed with the gift of obedience. One thing that causes all the rucas in this story is that gift. Ella Enchanted was a really really good book, but when it came to the action is wasn't very good. At the end Ella is with Lucinda and it tells about all the evil ogres and stuff, that was cool. I like the step sisters they were awesome. I would recommend this book to people, but it wasn't the kind of little kid book. Alaround, it was really boring in the very beginning. There was a lot of good reading in this book. Therefore, I gave this book 4 stars. Ella Enchanted was a good book but i wouldn't read it if you like a book that starts out fast."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It is a very nice, charming story.

I grew up on those wonderful stories of love that continues happily ever after. This story is so touching to me. It has the classic story book features- triumph over evil, villans, friends, and love happily ever after. But, it has a much more realistic touch. This happiness was not handed to Ella, she earned it. This book describes her inner most feelings and makes you express yours. I cried when I read this book, because I felt for poor Ella at times when her step-family was so wicked. And I do not cry much! This book is so delightful that even a four year old would find it enchanting. And as you well know, small children are not held to things that have no pictures. This book is wonderful.

Even if she is told to cut off her own head! The book's plot line goes through many of Ella's adventures with ogers, rotten girls, a finishing school, and even love. As you read, you experience the pain and suffering, laughter, and fun that this enchanting Ella goes through. This book is the best I've ever read, and I suggest it to anyone.

Probably the only one in the movie theater above the age of thirteen, but I didn't care. It was my twenty-second birthday, and I was going to watch the movie I wanted to see - even if I was alone. It was my birthday gift to myself, watching Ella Enchanted. I was interested in this movie, even though it was directed toward the average age of ten, because I had read the book at sixteen. At that time I was working in a library and had discovered that I had missed out on all sorts of literature when a younger child because I rarely read. Before working in the library, the only thing I would read would be the Sunday comics and only the books required in school. So when I found reading pleasurable, I wanted to make up for lost time.I was introduced to Gail Carson Levine's books by the library's young adult book club. Ella Enchanted was a modern Cinderella story. I had always loved the story of Cinderella, and when I read Ella Enchanted, I loved it. But at the same time I took wonder in loving this book. There was a part of me at sixteen that wondered why I loved this story.The story was about Ella, a girl cursed by her fairy godmother with obedience. Any time Ella was ordered to do something, she had to do it. Ella kept this curse a secret. Eventually Ella's mother dies, and since her traveling salesman father is rarely home, Ella only has her maid to raise her. One day Ella's father gets the idea to marry into money, but, unfortunately, he picks out a wicked lady with two equally wicked daughters. When her fairy godmother shows up at the wedding, she gives the happy couple the gift of love forever, which only serves to mess up Ella's life even further. Ella's father feels that the only way for him to live a happy life is to stay away from home thereby leaving Ella utterly alone in a full house. Ella's curse eventually becomes a particularly complicated problem for her when she is ordered by her stepsisters to give up her money and other possessions. Ella decides her only way out is to find her fairy godmother.Ella sets out to find this fairy, so she can take back the curse. Ella, in the meantime, meets up with Prince Char on her adventure, falling in love with him. But when the prince's evil uncle figures out Ella's curse, he orders Ella to kill the Prince. Ella tries to stay away, but the curse is too strong. Eventually Ella finds a way out of her spell, while at the same time saving the life of the prince and redeeming herself from being thought a murderer. The story ends happily ever after.Why did I love the story of Ella Enchanted when I read it? My first instinct is to say that the magic in this story was exciting, and it gave me a chance to fantasize about magical places and creatures. I imagined that somehow I could have power like Ella's and was intrigued by the relationship between Prince Char and Ella.At the time I read Ella Enchanted, I wondered, what was the connection between this modern Cinderella to the original? The first story of Cinderella I was introduced to was the Disney movie. As a young child I loved the music where the mice make Cinderella's dress, and I thought the little mice were funny, especially Gus. It was a story with the only bad characters being the stepmother, stepsisters, and one fat cat. While Cinderella's life revolved around pleasing her stepfamily, the mice struggled with the evil cat.My young mind loved this story because of the great struggle that Cinderella has and how she triumphs at the end. I did not take into consideration all the messages that were in the story at the time. Disney's Cinderella, which came out in 1957, has many moral lessons, which correspond to the thoughts of that time.Everyone must reach a stage where they leave the nest. In our society, it is expected that eventually children will leave home for a life of their own. When I watched Disney's Cinderella, the idea of being taken away from a bad place that was home to a fancy, rich, good place was particularly attractive to me. Home for me could not be compared to Cinderella's home. I did not have evil parents or stepsisters. I think that what I really wanted to escape from was my boring, everyday life. Everyday seemed the same with school and chores. The thought of going to a palace where I would not have to be in school, or to be told what to do, was attractive. That was what moving to a palace was to me in my very young years.Why must the princess move away in order to get her happily ever after? It's the formula of all fairytales, but why? I believe there is something in us that innately knows that we must first break away from our maternal bonds in order to become our true selves. In both versions of Cinderella, the mother dies. Perhaps that is an easy way to separate the child from the home. If both parents are still alive, and the child is happy at home, the child may never have the desire to leave. If the child still wants to be home, how can moving away be a happily ever after? Cinderella must then have a crappy home life in order to give the audience satisfaction when she leaves the home.In the movie, Cinderella is the perfect example of humility, kindness (shown through her animal friends), and goodness. When I was a young, I thought Cinderella was the best child a person could ask for. She was always pleasant, even though her stepmother and stepsisters were mean. Cinderella endures all the ordering around that she is given. Even when her dreams are dashed, as in the scene where the two stepsisters rip up her dress for the ball, she still never talks back to her family. Instead she runs away crying. There is an obvious lesson in the story of Cinderella teaching children to be good, even if they have an evil parent (or parents). It teaches that things will get better, no matter how horrid the situation. However, this does not take into account the many children that are being physically, sexually, and mentally abused by their parents. How could Disney give the message \\"just be good,\\" as if it has something to do with how these children are treated later in life?Cinderella is the model of good behavior, and the stepsisters are a model for bad behavior. Both the stepsisters and Cinderella want to go to the ball and meet the prince, only the stepsisters are cruel, selfish, and untalented. In the Disney version both stepsisters receive music lessons. One sister sings off key while the other plays the flute terribly. At the same time, Cinderella is outside singing beautifully while washing the floor. This is telling children that if you are good inside, it will show outside. This is why Cinderella is talented and beautiful, and why the stepsisters are ugly and awkward. Unfortunately, this movie does not allow the people watching it to get over the exterior lesson, that is to say, that the inside equals the outside. It is a much better idea to teach society to look past people's exteriors and look for the goodness inside. As a child I only thought of Cinderella as a very pretty person. Instead of wanting to be like Cinderella by her goodness, I wanted to be pretty on the outside first, and that is not the same as being well-mannered and honest.In this Disney version of the Cinderella story, the obstacles that Cinderella has to overcome are small. The first obstacle Cinderella faces is getting to the ball. There is no action taken by Cinderella that has to do with overcoming any of the obstacles she faces. The fairy godmother whisks up a spell and, voila, a dress and carriage appear to take Cinderella to the ball. The next problem takes place when Cinderella is locked away in the attic. The prince's menservants attempt to ask all women in town to try on the glass slipper left behind from the ball. Cinderella's only chance is to try on the slipper. Two of Cinderella's pet mice sneak into the pocket of the wicked stepmother, while Cinderella cries to herself. It's not a heroic part of the movie for Cinderella. The mice rescue her. Although if Cinderella had not been nice to the mice, and let them out of the cages, then these two would not have gotten the key away. The message revealed, when Cinderella never takes action to change her situation, is that her power is in her kindness towards others.This movie has a love interest for Cinderella, Prince Charming. The prince has a minimal part because he is more of an idea than a person. The Prince is a symbol of the good life. He has everything that Cinderella needs and wants. He is there to take Cinderella away to a life different from her own. He is the reward for which Cinderella had so patiently worked for. In a way, to be able to work toward the goal of a life filled with comforts is very much the American dream. It's something that can be attractive to anyone anywhere, to have something a little better than the way your parents had it.When Cinderella meets the prince, they both fall in love right away and dance all night. The ball ends and he does not forget her. He searches for her with that fateful glass slipper. I always loved the particular scene in which the prince dances with Cinderella and they both sing in perfect harmony.So this is love, MmmmmmSo this is loveSo this is what makes life divineI'm all aglow, MmmmmmAnd now I knowThe key to all heaven is mineMy heart has wings, MmmmmmAnd I can flyI'll touch ev'ry star in the skySo this is the miracle that I've been dreaming ofMmmmmmMmmmmmSo this is love!Now that I have reevaluated this scene, I know that what the prince and Cinderella have is not love. It's too quick. What they have in this particular scene is infatuation. I think it is important to teach this to young girls, because too many people do not know the difference between love and the \\"in love\\" feeling that comes with infatuation.The updated version for Cinderella has better messages for today's young generation. Ella Enchanted still takes the original story line and twists it up. Like the first Cinderella, I still felt a yearning to get away from ordinary life when I read the book. This time I was older and knew more. Just because you are a queen, does not mean that life will be perfect. The idea of magical creatures in fancy places was much more intriguing, then just getting away from my boring life.The bonds between Ella and her mom are severed, and since her father is away from home all the time, Ella has a reason to leave home. When Ella runs away from her cruel stepfamily, she alone takes action to try to change her situation. She is trying to change her life for herself instead of waiting till her fairy godmother can change her life for her. Ella too has a bad home life, but she is also given a curse to go with her bad family ties. She must do more than just run away from home. In addition, Ella must break the spell in order to achieve maximum happiness. Then the audience can become happy for her when she has the chance at a better life.Ella is also an example of morality in this modern story. Ella wants the same things as her stepsisters. But this new story gives a reason for Ella's obedience. The author allows Ella to not want to do what she is told; she is stubborn, but is always good. She is never selfish, like her stepsisters. The movie has a quote that says, \\"Ella's curse made her obedient, but her heart made her kind.\\" This story makes a difference between obedience and goodness, which Disney does not. Just doing what you are told is one thing, but being kind to others and taking action in the face of moral dilemmas is a very different thing. Also, the movie makes a point of showing Ella's loving and respectful relationship with both parents and her maid. The curse is used to show that free will is good, not as an excuse to rebel.The movie does not used beauty as a source of inner goodness like the Disney version. Both Ella and the oldest stepsister, Hattie, are pretty. The reason that the Prince likes Ella more than Hattie is because of the two sisters' attitudes. Hattie makes it very obvious that she is a big fan of Prince Char, and even is the president of his fan club. Because of Hattie's overzealous nature, Prince Char is totally freaked out. Ella, on the other hand, is not a fan of Prince Char and is upset at the fact that he does not take more interest in the politics of the Realm. This is a much more appropriate start to the couple's relationship.In Ella Enchanted, it is a little more obvious that the youngest stepsister, Olive, is very dumb and almost bordering on the edge of retarded. In this way this modern story almost excuses the younger stepsister from her behavior toward Ella because she was not intelligent enough to understand everything. Throughout Ella Enchanted, Olive follows her sister's lead, and does what Hattie tells her to do blindly. It almost appears that Olive is a good Cinderella opposite; doing everything she is told, and not thinking for herself. It portrays a bad example of obedience. I wondered why at the end of the film, that revenge is not taken on Olive? Perhaps it is good that one of the two stepsisters is not evil, but is the representation of extremely stupid appropriate?When Ella has to overcome obstacles, things are slightly different. One particular example shows a similar scene to Disney's Cinderella when Cinderella is locked away in the attic. Ella is sitting in prison for attempting to kill the prince and is rescued by some friends. But this is not the pivotal part of the modern story, unlike the Disney version. The most exciting part is when Ella breaks the spell that holds her in submission. She has to do this by herself, and it is by pure willpower alone that she can do this. It's a lesson to little girls that they can do things that seem impossible. There is also the obstacle at the end of the modern tale in which Ella has to save the prince from his evil uncle. Its empowering girls with the idea that they can be the rescuer, and do not always have to be helpless, which I like.While Cinderella's prince is the reward for her goodness, the prince in the modern tale plays a different roll. He is a person, and we learn more about his character. He is good, smart, handsome, and humble. He is the dashing figure from girls' deepest fantasies, the perfect guy. The only thing close to a flaw that the prince has is a naive love for his uncle who killed his father to become King. The prince is no longer the symbol of a reward for Ella's hard life. After breaking the spell for herself, Ella's true struggle is overcome. Therefore, saving the prince's life, and marrying him is like a nice extra bonus. The power of Ella's love for the prince breaks the spell, so the love story needs to be there in order to have something powerful enough to force Ella into a tough situation. The real reward for Ella is love, and the prince is just a symbol of the perfect man.Ella Enchanted has developed the relationship between the prince and Ella much more, but does not seem much better at creating a long-lasting relationship. The Prince has only known Ella for two days when they fall in love. There is a song that Ella sings right before the couple's first kiss.Can anybody find somebody to love?Each morning I get up I die a littleCan't barely stand on my feet.Take a look in the mirrorAnd I, see what you're doing to me.I've spent all my years believing in you, but I just can't get no relief.Won't somebody, somebody, can anybody find me, somebody to love.This song shows that Ella is just looking for somebody to love. Ella is trying to fill the void of a dead mother, and a father who is always away on business. The prince and Ella only develop a surface relationship. I think that many young people start relationships like this one, even though they have the potential to develop into something more real. But in stories like Cinderella, the development of a relationship should be worked into the storyline.Regrettably both versions end with marriage, and I think that it is just a little too soon. Cinderella stories give reason for this quick relationship with true love. This idea is being inflicted upon young minds as a truth rather than fiction, which might ruin their relationships later in life. If Ella had just saved the life of the prince and then not married him, the story would still be very good. Sorry to say that in Ella Enchanted, she and the prince have already said \\"I love you,\\" and it is hard to separate from my mind the possibility of love without coupling it with marriage. I would not be happy to see Ella live with the prince before marriage. Maybe Prince Char should never have asked Ella to marry him. Then the story could end with a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship.After revisiting the Disney's version of this basic story, I feel let down. The way the story works in subtle ways to keep girls in check gives me the creeps. Why does the once elating conclusion seem empty and false after reevaluating the movie? Is it the quick way the couple gets together? Or perhaps it's the cynic inside me that says, \\"I give it a week.\\"Ella Enchanted is better at giving an uplifting, empowering message to girls. It gives more romance and a deeper meaning of self-accomplishment than the old Cinderella. Yet it still inflicts some of the old values of true love. Is the story of Cinderella too old-fashioned to be able to reflect today's values? With all its history, I think that it is a story that should be kept. Maybe someday girls will figure out why it is so fascinating and repair it suitably."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book! I get bored easily with books but this book kept my attention the whole time! This book is full of elves, ogres, fairy's, and more exciting characters.

Ella, determined to break the curse, sets off on a journey through the forest. There, she runs into ogres and her beloved Prince Char must save her. Once Ella finds Lucinda, Ella figures out that she's no help and that Ella herself must break the curse. With her fairy godmother, Mandy, for guidance, Ella must break the curse before she endangers her kingdom, and Prince Char himself.I loved this book because it tells you to do what your heart says.

I finally gave into my desire to own it again and purchased it from amazon. I'm so happy that I did. This book definitely holds up even after all these years. It's this kind of writing that helped me fall in love with the idea of being a writer. I've read some of Gail Carson Levine's other books and enjoyed them to varying degrees. I remember reading The Wish and thinking, even as a child, that it was incredibly bland. But Ella Enchanted is truly one of her gems.It is heartfelt and well-written with a truly wonderful heroine. Now that I'm older I do see more of the problems. The writing is a lot simpler than I remember but I suppose that it needs to be for the reading level of the target audience so I won't count that as a negative. As with most young adult novels, it is on the shorter side. This leads to some awkward pacing and a lack of development. There's not really enough of her friend Areida or her adventures. The romance with Char is underdeveloped though conveyed skillfully enough that by the end I was very invested in the outcome. The ending and epilogue after the dramatic conclusion also come across as a little rushed. Still, I think it's a wonderful story for young girls and a truly inspiring heroine for them to identify with. For older readers, it's a pleasant diversion. The strength of the story is Ella and the way Levine writes the scenes that are meant to have a big emotional impact. I understand when people say the story meanders a bit and how it could be boring for some people. Levine doesn't do a great job with descriptions despite the complexity of the world she's imagined. It's difficult to really picture anything in your head based on the descriptions she gives. She's not a world-builder like the big name fantasy writers. She's more interested in the characters and the main plot arc for the heroine.I would recommend this book for a reader or parent looking for a strong, believable female protagonist. It's not a great fantasy novel and it's a little underdeveloped but the individual scenes are well written and the emotion, lesson, and strong character arc are there. I'd also recommend getting the new version as there are great extras including information about the languages Levine developed for the various creatures in the world of Ella Enchanted. I don't remember these being included in the first edition."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The beginning of this marvelous adventure tells about the curse of the 'fool of a fairy Lucinda'. Around the end it turns like Cinderella, only 100 times better."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Arrived in great time and in the condition described. Reading this book when I was in middle school or so is what gave me a love for reading.

Let me just say that this book is WAY better than the movie so even if you hated the movie, don't let that stop you from reading this book! Ella is a spirited 15-year-old girl who finds that a foolish fairy has cursed her with the \\"gift\\" of obedience. As long as it's a direct command, Ella has to do whatever anyone tells her - whether it's hopping on one foot for a day and a half or chopping off her own head. In the book, you feel whatever Ella feels as the characters come alive and step out of the pages. The book is a clever twist on the classic Cinderella story. But don't let \\"yet another Cinderella story\\" discourage you. Unlike most (if not all) of the Cinderella characters you find, Ella isn't sickeningly perfect and obedient naturally - she's more relateable. She's strong willed and determined to break the spell of obedience and one of the most likeable characters I've ever come across. This is a must-read probably targeted for 9-16 year old girls, but no matter how old you are, you won't be able to stop flipping the pages and you'll fall in love with Ella and Char along the way!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book when I was in 4th grade, many many many years ago.

Beautifully told. I highly recomend this book to anyone who loves farie tales! It will be worth it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Though it resembles the story Cinderella, Ella Enchanted's characters and settings are unique. Ella goes from place to place starting at her home, moving to finishing school via her father's request, running away from school, and finally moving to the castle. On her journey she meets interesting characters: Prince CHar, ogres, giants, wiched step sisters, and fairy godmothers. The book has its own plots and themes that surpass the limits set by the original tale. The plot asks the major dramatic question of, \\"Will Ella ever be rid of her curse to be obedient?\\". This question keeps the reader's interest as Ella goes on her journey. Of course along her way she finds love, which is the theme that stands out most. The love between Ella and Char is described in the written dialouge. They write letters back and forth that allow the reader to fully understand the characters' feelings and thoughts, until Ella writes one particular letter. But you'll have to read it to see what I am talking about.I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys fairytales. It is a wonderfully enchanting version of Cinderella, with a twist. The book takes off right from teh beginning and goes from one adventure to another. The romance portrayed in the book is one that makes every girl long for her prince charming. I enjoyed every minute of it and could not put it down."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is really quite an enchanting book. I really liked how seriously the author took the story of Cinderella and then delved deeper and added a twist to create a delightful turn on the classic tale.The &quot;twist&quot; is that Ella is &quot;cursed&quot; with the spell of always having to obey direct commands. It's quite delightful to see the clever ways she gets around this curse, and sometimes when she cannot get around it the results are hilarious.The book gets a little cumbersome about halfway through, voyaging through a forest of fantasy creatures and removing its attention just a little bit from the character development of Ella. While it helps advance the story, I found myself losing interest at that part, and my 10-year-old son (who broke down and read this &quot;girl's&quot; book at my insistance) decided not to finish the book when he got to the same spot. But I trudged through and then found myself enjoying the book at the end. It's not that long.I'd recommend this book for girls in 4th grade and up, and it's not below the interest level of an imaginative adult. If you liked the movie &quot;Ever After&quot; then you'll probably like this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a very humerous book and very sad. The main character is Eleanor or for short Ella because her mom's name is Eleanor too. The story is about a little girl who is born and a foolish fairy grants a spell over the child it is suppose to br a gift but turns out to be curse so when the girl grows older she has to do anything anybody tells her to do. To find out the rest you need to read this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I absolutely loved this book. After I read it I was surprised to find that it was a children's book. It really is for any age with it's perfect use of romance, humor, fantasy, and suspense. I definitely recommend this book, one of the best I've read. I can't wait to read more of Gail Carson Levine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I wish I could have rated this book higher. Much much higher! It contains adventure, romance, and a struggle of a teenage girl. I reccomend this to any age. Especially to girls 10+. I had no clue that it was based on Cinderella till the end. The book went so much deeper than the original legend of Cinderella. I especially liked the friendship that goes on between Prince Charmon, Char, and Ella and then it blossoms into love. Many that are on this review came here for the same reason, to tell how much they loved this book. Well, I am to. If you read the book, you know what I am saying, if you haven't, I suggest that you read it. It really is awesome. At first I was relieved that I was not Ella, at the end, I was envious of her!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This Cinderella story is far more imaginative than the movie. Told in first person, and full of wit, this is enjoyable and funny, which was lost in the movie."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have been an avid reader since the 5th grade, and at first, I didn't want to give ELLA ENCHANTED a chance because of the tacky cover illustration (of the girl in the green dress), but as they say, \\"Never judge a book by its cover.\\" I finally gave in to reading this book - ordering it from one of those book orders that you get from school. I just want to say that I am now 23 years old and this is STILL my favorite book. It has everything that I love in a book - comedy and romance, and the feeling that once the book is over, you're sad because you know you will never find another adventure just like it. It's impossible to put the book down - there are parts that make you want to cry, laugh, and squeal with delight. The romance between Ella and Char is PERFECT and not cheesy at all. I advise anyone with a love of romance and fantasy to give this book a chance because I promise that it's SO WORTH IT - and not to mention, the movie does not do the book justice at all."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I will always love the book Ella Enchanted! It is the next classic in books. It captured nearly every good feeling I've ever had. I guess it is just closely related to my life, or any other individual's life. Ella Enchanted is based on the story of Cinderella. The author changes things to add humor and heartache. She did a beautiful job! Ella, The main character is very clumsy and it causes you to constantly laugh when she does really dumb things. Sometimes here clumsiness goes too far, gets in other peoples way, and gets her in big trouble. She of course falls in love, but many things are getting in her way. Everything is solved and put together for a happy ending. Just like all of our lives, this book shows the hard work we put into our happy endings. Life is hard but we can all live happily ever after.Review by Melissa PerryLehi, UT"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I order you to read the book Ella Enchanted! Ella Enchanted is written by Gail Carson Levine. This book has received many awards, like the ALA best book for young adults, ALA Book List, ALA notable book for children, Newbery Honor, and many more. Gail Carson Levine has written many awesome books like The Fairies Mistake, Princess Aurora and the Long Sleep, Cinderellis and the Glass Hill, and The Wish. Most of her books are Fairy Tale Fiction. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Ella Enchanted.Ella Enchanted is a novel based on the story \\"Cinderella\\" except this time Ella has a curse of obedience. When Ella was born her horrible fairy godmother Lucinda is thinking of a gift to give her while poor Ella is crying. Finally Lucinda gets sick of the crying and says Ella of Frell I give you the gift of obedience,\\". Ella's life is fine and ordinary except for her having to everything she is told. Then her mother dies and makes Ella promise not to tell anyone of the curse. Ella struggles as she gets older. Her father remarries, and of course her evil step mother and step sisters make her life miserable. Then her evil step sisters find out about the curse and use it against her. Ella runs into trouble with ogres and Char or shall I say Prince Char saves her. Char and Ella fall in madly in love, but Ella can't marry him because her curse will put him in danger. Ella goes through a struggle to break the curse but nothing seems to be going her way.What I loved about the book was the character Ella. She was a very nice ordinary girl that never got her way. She had a stubborn way of saying yes to her orders. Ella is very easy to relate to as a girl because she is so the kind of friend you would want to have. When Ella felt something in the book I was right there feeling it with her. When Ella is trying to break the curse she let's out so much emotion that you can feel her happiness, sadness, anger, and morn.Something that really pulled me into the book was the authors style of fairytale fiction. I found the book quite enjoyable because Ella and Char and many other characters were so real and like people you would read about in realistic fiction, but the setting was fairytale. Ella's godmother was a fairy named Lucinda. The cook was a fairy who helped Ella throughout the book.I had a great time reading Ella Enchanted. The book was phenomenalfrom the beginning to the end. I did not want to put the book down. The vivid description gives you a picture in your mind. It's almost like you're in your own world, or that you are in the book. Ella Enchanted is a funny, sad, loving, and strengthening book. I fully recommend this book for all ages. Ella Enchanted 5 stars!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Before I started reading books by Gail Carson Levine, I was into middle ages sort of books. Then a friend of mine recommended this book to me and I fell in love with it. Reading the first couple of chapters just made me want to read more and more. I end up finishing the book in half a day, but then reading it again. I would say that I read this book over...7... times. I even read my favorite parts of the book, over and over again. So many times that I even remembered them.One of my favorite parts in Ella Enchanted was the letters back and forth from Ella to her friend, Prince Char. My favorite letter that char wrote to Ella was the last one in which he confessed his love for her.I dont want to tell you the whole story because it is better off that you read it yourself and be spell bound to it as I was.I recommend this book for all girls of all ages. Especially if your into middle ages with princes, princesses, ogres, and fairies.Another book I would also recommend is \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\". For the same reasons as Ella Enchanted and more..."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book I loved if you like Harry Potter after you read that get this it may not be igzactley the same but they both halft to do with magic"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When I first checked out this book in the library I thought it was a joke. But, when I started reading I got hooked on it and couldn't put it down at all. I remember telling all my friends(I read this a long time ago)it was one of the greatest books I've ever read and I pursued them to read it. IT'S EXCELLENT! I thought this book was really detailed...just wish there was more! (^_^)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was inspired by the upcoming film to check out \\"Ella Enchanted.\\" I understand that the director is the same person who mutilated \\"The Princess Diaries\\" adaptation, so figured there might be some similarity between the two books. There is--sort of. Both are told in first person. Both have clever teenaged girls as main characters. But there the similarity pretty much ends.\\"Ella Enchanted\\" is an enjoyable read, but it falls flat in many ways. The characters are themselves rather flat; Ella is only interesting b/c she's the narrator. Other characters, like Char and Areida, are simply \\"there.\\" It's difficult to buy the romance b/w Ella and Char, simply b/c the author pretty much sprung it on us; there's no real build-up. The plot itself is a little flat; it also has several threads that are never picked up and finished. Things happen that seem to make little sense, narratively speaking.However, that said, I won't argue with the glowing reviews given by previous young readers. I admit I'm twenty-three years old and might not be \\"enchanted\\" by the same aspects of a young adult novel as a younger reader might be. But if you're like me--an older reader who enjoys reading children's and young adult literature--you might not want to expect too much from \\"Ella Enchanted.\\" It's a cute novel, and you'll probably want to read it before seeing the film, but it nowhere approaches other similar efforts like \\"The Princess Diaries,\\" \\"I Capture the Castle,\\" and \\"Beauty.\\" (The last is another retold fairytale by Robin McKinley--highly recommended, as are the other two)."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"While the book stated that the reading level was for ages 8 and up, my third grade girls book club (all kids who were 8) found the book way to difficult to read on their own. Most of us read it to our children. The plot was very good the second half of the book, but the first half was slow, with lots of difficult vocabulary and the story got confusing at points. So in the end I thought the book was okay but was really geared toward 11 year olds."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is about a teenage girl from the kingdom/town of Frell. I have both read the book and seen the movie, and am glad to report that both are WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedBy: Gail Carson LevineReviewed by: G. ParkPeriod: 6In this book called \\"Ella Enchanted\\", there is a girl named Eleanor or Frell, who was called Ella, was given a fairy's gift at her birth. The Fairy name was Lucinda It was a gift of obedience, but who knew a fairy's gift could be a curse? If Ella was given a command hop in the rain for one hour, then she would have to. If she was told to kill someone, she would have to. Ever second of her life was in danger. After years had passed, Ella had to go through some difficulties with her family. Her mother had died because she got sick and her father had remarried an evil stepmother with two other daughters. Luckily she had Mandy, her cook by her side and Prince Char to talk to when she feels sad. Later, Ella had found out that Mandy was her fairy godmother all along! At first Ella didn't believe her because then Mandy could have saved her mother from dieing, but Mandy did try to save her. It was just because Ella's mother didn't eat the horsehair which could have saved her. After Ella had found out that Lucinda was the fairy who gave her the gift of obedience, she had started her journey to find her and try to remove the spell forever, except Lucinda didn't remove it. Ella had to find a way herself to remove it because Lucinda doesn't take back her own gifts. When Ella returned back home, Ella was told by Prince Char's uncle to kill Prince Char so then his uncle could be king, but luckily things didn't go the way it was planned. Ella had held herself, strongly from killing her true love and at that moment. Ella was able to break the curse! She didn't have to take anymore commands and was free at last. At the end, Prince Char had asked Ella to marry her and obviously, she did become Queen Eleanor of Frell.I like this book because it can teach people to believe in yourself and if you keep on trying, you can achieve your goal. Also, one of the quotes in this book that I like was when Mandy told Ella, \\"All the Eleanor line are friends of the Fairies. You have fairy blood in you.\\" The reason why I like this quote is, because I was amazed that Ella actually had some fairy blood within herself. Besides, Ella could live forever because fairies have immortal lives and can stay beautiful forever too. Also the fact that the Eleanor was friends with the fairies, but the one thing that ponders me is why the fairies didn't help Ella's mother to survive from dieing. It is a fairy world, so why didn't all the fairies try to save her?The second quote that I like from this book was when at the end Ella said to herself \\"I had been able to break the curse myself.\\" This means that Ella was able to break a fairies curse herself. If I were Ella, I might have been really excided and proud for what I had just done because, usually when a person has curses or gifts from a fairy, the same fairy or another fairy would have to remove it. If you don't want to accept it, but this time, Ella was able to break it herself. I think it is because she had a drop of fairy blood within herself. Luckily she had that blood with her or else, she would have to kill Prince Char. This would be an opening, for Prince Char's evil uncle, to be the next ruler or Frell. Which wouldn't be good news, but fortunately, that didn't happen.My favorite part of the book was when Ells was able to stop herself from killing Prince Char and she was able to break that cruse of obedience because if none of these events happened in the book. The whole story would turn upside down. This means that, instead of the story ending happily ever after. It would have ended as Prince Char dieing and Ella killing herself because of what she had done and never breaking the cruse. Also, Frell would suffer too because of Prince Char's evil uncle. So the two favorite parts that I picked was the most important part from the whole book. Anyways, it didn't end as everyone dieing, it did actually ending as happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't the best. This book was a bit too much \\"Cinderella\\". And since the main character was Ella I thought it was kind of neat. The beginning though, was extremely boring I had to push myself to get past the few chapters. However, once you get past the few chapters its not bad at all.But Gail Carson Levine has written better. Try: \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\" if you liked this book. \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\" isn't as boring at the beginning and is also a \\"fairy tale type\\" of novel and has so much more to offer.Overall: Read. But try \\"The Two Princesses of Bamarre\\" as it is much better."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book when I was in elementary school, before the movie came out. I really, really didn't like it. It was confusing and the plot just wasn't that interesting. I think the movie might have clarified the book a bit for some readers. I remember trying to figure out what was going on because of the modern slang terms mixed with the Middle English. I didn't like the ending either. For a modern fairytale, the girl getting the prince is a tad bit boring."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella enchantedI am going to tell you about the book Ella Enchanted.The book Ella Enchanted is about a girl who is a chatty mouth as a baby. Once the foolish fairy comes to see Ella, she casts the spellof obedience on her. The minute after she casts the spell she tells Ella to shut up! In the middle of the book her dad gets married to the evil mother of two brats. The mother and two brats take advantage of the obedient spell that the fairy caste on Ella, but Ella gets back at them!

It is wrote by the enchanted \\"Gail Carson Levine\\". The story is about a young girl named Ella, that lives in a very magical place called \\"Frell\\". Where faries, gnomes,and elves run wild. If you like \\"Harry Potter\\" you'll realize that Ella is the female version of the master from \\"Hogwarts\\".Ella is faced with many hard times and difficulties throughout the story. She has many challenges, because she is cursed to be obedient no matter what! If somebody commanded her to disown the land of frell she would have to, and if somebody commanded her to kill the king, or herself she would have to do it. This is one of the biggest problems throughout the story. the curse has been in affect since she's been a baby and she tries many times to rid herself of the curse by finding the farie that did it to her(Lucinda). Will Ella have the strength to find this mean farie and will she betray her kingdom?? You'll have to read this book in order to find out."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"How would you like to HAVE to do somthing when someone tells you to? Well thats what happened to Ella, and it was all because of this stupid fairy that never did anything right. How would you like to never break it? She was stuck with it for much longer than she would have wished. It was a curse. How would you like to not be aloud to tell it to anybody? 'Cause she coulden't. If I tell you anymore I'll tell you the ending so Ibetter stop. That's all!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This was one of Gail's best books. It had the type of fairy tale content that you do not get anymore. The fairy tale authors now just write about things that sometimes just doesn't make sense. Those \\"new writers\\" just feed of the Brothers Grim, and other of the fairy tale pioneers. Gail, even though she is in the present day, has the quality of the fairy tale writers of yesterday.Gale beautifully writes a Cinderella for the modern readers. The book mixes romance and comedy. You usually can not get these two qualities in the same book because the heaviness of romance usually wieghs down the lightness of comedy. This book has the perfect balance of YING AND YANG. Overall, I think that schools should require this book as the ones that students should read because it is THAT GOOD. And, what school you know requires a fatansy for a required read?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This story is so awesome.

Though I thought it was a little confusing, I really go confused trying to figure out the names of the creatures. I really liked how Lucinda learned her lesson at the end and used small magic and how Ella took her curse away for the sake of Char.

Like I said, I\`ve read this book countless times and I always like it better each time I finish it. And that\`s a HIGH compliment to Gail Carson Levine,\`cuz I don\`t usually read books over and over again and still like it. I swear, it\`s an excellent book that is sure to become a famous children\`s story like Charles Dickens\` Oliver Twist. Makes me wonder why it only won a Newbery Honor instead of the Newbery medal itself. Your probably wondering why I think this is such a great book when I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Well, I gotta say that, like Char, Levine puts in a little too much. There are a few plot devices that don\`t contribute anything to the story, like the parrot, Chock (who disappears after his introduction for the rest of the story) the Agulen wolf, the necklace that belonged to Ella\`s mother, Apple the centaur, even the glass slipper. None of those things helped the plot roll along, they were merely there to sit around and look pretty. I suppose I can\`t blame Levine for the glass slipper, since that was part of the original fairy tale, but the readers could\`ve done very well without Chock the parrot. If he was just there for Ella to try and kiss him, Levine could\`ve easily written that part in while Ella is visiting the menagerie. And because of his disappearance for the last half of the story, we forgot about him completely. We\`d also have forgotten about the other plot devices I mentioned if Levine hadn\`t kept reminding us about them throuhout the story. Still, this is a terrific book filled with mythical creatures, action, family, individuality, and, of course, romance.:)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was expressed clearly &amp; I could feel strongly the way the main character,Ella, could feel.

It is a must for every adult who loves a good fairytale."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella is a girl who lives with her widowed father Sir Peter. In the book, you learn about her enchanted life and how she lives with a spell that was cast on her as a child."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a great book. I think it was written very well, and it was so easy to like the main characters. It was such a good idea of Gail Carson Levine to write a book about someone under the spell of obedience! It's such a unique and adorable book, all young girls should read it! (Boys probably wouldn't like it quite as much...)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Being a fan of the Harry Potter series, I picked this book up because it sounded interesting and a friend of mine had also recommended it. Here, you have a great story, reminiscent of Cinderella, in which Ella must find her way through life, even though she has a horrible curse (labeled a &quot;gift&quot;) of obedience. The fun starts when her evil stepsisters figure out that she MUST obey whatever they command her to do. Poor Ella! This book contains elves, ogres, evil stepsisters, and more. It really is a great book and I found that I read it quickly...not wanting to put it down for even a few minutes (I read it in one afternoon). If you want to read a great book and have some time on your hands, Ella Enchanted is for you!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book! Ella Enchanted is much better than the classic Cinderella, because Ella Enchanted has more challenges and adventures.Ella is cursed to be obedient, having to obey all commands. Even when Ella is cursed, she still tries to disobey, but when she does, she gets dizzy and sick. In Ella Enchanted, there is a stepmother with her ugly daughters. The step-family tortures her and her father is no hope because he cares more about money.Ella tries to break her spell with the help of her fairy Godmother, who is a superb cook. As she tries to break the spell, she meets ogres, elves, giants and exotic creatures. With each creature there is an adventure that follows. While all this is going on, she's falling in love with Prince Charmont.I think this is really a wonderful book and that all fairy-tale lovers should read this book because this is really creative and good!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book!

It starts out when Ella's mother is alive-which is different from other versions. She meets Prince Charmont (or Char) at her mother's funeral. Gail makes the book lively with her stepmother, awful stepsisters, the cook Mandy (a fairy), and the awful Lucinda, who granted Ella with a gift of obedience at birth- that's often her downfall. Gail Carson Levine really used her imagination in this book. Ella is multi-lingual- and can speak with ogres, elfs, etc. It's an enjoyable book, and it deserved every bit of that Newberry Honor it won!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is like the Cinderella story. But if Cinderella seems to be growing younger as you are growing older then read Ella Enchanted. It is a fabulous book for someone who is 9 or older. When Ella was a baby a foolish fairy gave her the gift of obedience but to Ella it was a curse. She had to do anything anyone asked even if it was dangerous and meant harm to her. She had many adventures in the book like running away from finishing school and going to a mask ball where she met a prince. I liked the book because it was a lot like Cinderella and when I was younger I loved the Cinderella story. But this book was more mature than Cinderella. So it was more exciting!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am 13 years old and I love this book! It truly shows girl power at its best and has just enough comedy and romance to keep me interested! This is a new classic.... I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is my favorite book, without a doubt the best book I have ever read. I picked it up at the library, not really wanting to read it, but thinking what the heck. Little did I know it would have me up all night trying to see what happens, crying at three o'clock in the morning because I felt so bad for Ella, calling in my mom for comfort at that time, reminding me it was just a book. Always and forever a huge Cinderella fan (you have no idea), I was so ignorant not to realize that this was a version of Cinderella until the last chapter. However, that made the book so much better, not knowing what would happen. I love this book so much, it got me so emotional because I felt the character's agony and frustration, but it's humorous too. Don't think its for little kids, this book might even be more appreciated by older teens."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Two words: great book! This is one of the best books I ever read. Now I am thinking About reading it again because I was in 7th grade when I read it. Now I am in 9th grade. Sorry that I can't give you a summery but I know I loved it so did evey one in my class who read it (about all the class). So buy It I know you will love it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was absolutley wonderful. It was intresting andwell thought, with a little twist at the end. It was entertaining and funny, i couldn't stop reading! I advise anyone who hasn't read the book to go out there and read it. Its amazing!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was looking for a book at my school's book fair last year, and I picked up this one, just because it seemed the most interesting one there. I didn't actually expect to like it as much as I did. I finished it the next day. The story had kept my mind firmly locked in the book. When I stopped all I wanted to do ws read more. Ella is a teen-aged girl living in imaginary Kyrria, a land where myth and fairy tale comes alive. She is the daughter of Sir Peter of Frell, who is never at home. Ella is torn when her mother dies of illness. But there is a stroke of luck when Ella befriends Prince Charmont (you might not notice it now, I didn't at first, but look at the name, what does it resemble?). Ella is soon sent to finishing school, which she runs away from when Hattie, her future stepsister (though she doesn't know this at the time) orders her to stopping being friends with Areida, her only solace at the place. Oh did I mention that Ella has a curse that says she must be obedient? I won't tell you anymore because it would give the story away. I will only say that this was a very interesting and much better story than the original fairy tale, which is almost unrecognizable it is so different. I loved how real the characters were, I could actually see myself in Ella. Any young teen girl would love this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book because it seems so real when you read it like you are sitting right there waching this majecal tappastry unwind. Even if you dont like fantasty you will love this book anyway."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Gail Carson Levine has written a more exciting version of Cinderella. Being cursed, this Ella has to be obedient or she get's a sickening feeling. She's pushed around by her crude stepsisters and has to do their bidding. She only has her godmother, Mandy, to care for her in that household, though there is also another person whom she writes to quite often. Can you guess who it is? Yes, it's the prince!I really enjoyed this book because of all the fantasy. There are orges, elves, faeries, centuars, giants, and a lot more of those creatures. How Ella frees herself from the curse is very exciting, like the rest of the book. This book was very well-written; I rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read Ella about a year ago, and couldn't put it down! She is spunky, has wit, and is brave. She is the perfect heroine. But of course, there IS a romantic part to this story!Its the perfect read-aloud book for younger kids, a perfect book report book for middle schoolers, and will charm adults. PLEASE READ IT!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book!! It's Cinderella with trolls, fairies, and those ugly step-sisters. Everyone should read this! At the beginning of the book Ella lives with her mom. She's happy, but there's one little thing always getting in her way. You want to find out what, read the book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I really enjoyed this book! The story is about Ella, a girl who was cursed from birth by the fairy, Lucinda, who meant to bestow a gift of obedience. No matter what anyone demands, or commands, Ella must obey, so her life is very much in danger. It talks about how Ella tries to fight the curse, and how she tries to end it. This story was very interesting, and highly amusing. Ella is such a humourous person, and so lively. I thought this book would be boring, but this turns out to be one of my favorite books. I would suggest people of all age."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was a wonderful book. It was kind of like Cinderella. In this book Ella is the main character. She is a nice girl who was given a gift of obedience. When Ella was just a child her mother passed away. Her father, who was a merchant, sent her away to school. He then remarried. This witch that he married had two daughters. The oldest one, Hattie, took advantage of Ella. Ella got a lot of gifts along the way that helped her to be very, very successful along her journey. These gifts were very special and showed her many wonderful things. Ella also met a prince named Char. They became very close. Char bought her things and Ella made him laugh. They did many things together. I would recommend this book to almost anyone who can read, especially those who like fairy tales, such as Cinderella!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When Ella was born she had a gift of obedience. But the gift was actually a curse. The curse was given to Ella by Lucinda. A fairy. She had to do anything people told her to do. Later her mother dies and then she meets prince Char. Then her dad remarried to somebody who Ella dosen't like very much. Ella also has two mean, cruel step sisters. Ella tries to find Lucinda again to undo the curse. Along the way Ella make contacts with different people,such as ogres,elves,giants,and gnomes.This story is based on the story of Cinderella. Ella Enchanted has a pumpkin coach,glass slippers,and little animals that turn into people. I think this book is great. The book has romance,magic,action and all the other stuff fairytales have. In the beginning the book is kind of boring,but when it's towards the end,it starts to get the readers attention."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think this book was really good. I think it is good because it is like Cinderella, and I like Cinderella a lot. That is a good story. The story was a lot like Cinderella except a little bit of things. One thing was they had diffrent names in Ella Enchanted.In Cinderella they didn't have any curses on anybody. They didn't have a lot of fairies up in the Cindrerlla story. Some of the ways the story is alike is by having a ball. Another way the story is alike is that the Prince is looking for someone to marry at the ball and he finds that person. Ella Enchanted is really good. I think it will be interesting to a lot of little kids because they like a lot of interesting stories and movies. I think a lot of kids will like Ella Enchanted because it is just like Ciderella and lots of kids like it. I recommend little kids to read Ella Enchanted and I recommend this book to anybody because the book is very good and exciting to me. That is why I recommend this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I honestly couldn't put this book down. If your into romance and girl power, this is the book for you. With a strong gruop of characters, and a wonderful storyline, I think this book should be on everyones summer reading list!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I LOVED THIS BOOK, THAT WAS AS SIMPLE AS FAIRYTALE I HAD HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ELLA ENCHANTED WAS ABOUT A YOUNG GIRL'S QUEST TO SET HERSELF FREE OF A CURSE BESTOWED ON HER LONG AGO. THROUGH HER QUEST SHE FINDS LOVE, DISAPPOINTMENT, AND TRIUMPH. TOGETHER THEY SET THE PLOT OF THE BOOK THAT CARRIES YOU THROUGH NOT ONLY THE CHAPTERS BUT THE LIVES OF THE CHARACTERS. THE BOOK, ELLA ENCHANTED, SHOULD BE A LITERALY GIFT TO EVERYONE."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Words can not describe how much I enjoyed this book! This story captured me from the beginning to the end. The auther created such a mood that I cried thorough most of it. This is a mix of different Fairy tales but it is mainly bassed on Cinderella with a curse of obedience placed on her as a child (much like sleeping beauty). She is all throughout the book trying to break the curse so she can make her own decisions. Finally at the end she finds the one thing that can make her want to say &quot;No way&quot; to everyone....... Were you expecting me to give away the ending? thats the best part! read it to find out and I know you will be touched just like I was. I have to say this is apsolutly the best book I have ever read (and I have read ALOT of books!). If I could give this a 10 star review I would!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This story captured my attention from the beginning. I love the characters and feel like I know them. This is the Cinderella story of Cinderella stories. Read it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"this is a fabulous cinderella story complete with fairy godmothers and glass slippers.

This book has ella who was cursed to be obedient trying to break the curse so she can make her own decisions."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book! I have it and I've read it many times. I think that it was slightly like Cinderella around the end. I think that you should read this book, all of you out there in that big world of your's."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is one of my favorite books. It is exciting, well written and suspensful. Some may find it a little difficult to understand, but it is still worth it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a charming love story based on the traditional fairy tale, Cinderella. The first time I read this book, I couldn't put it down. Ella has been given the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. She has to do exactly what anyone tells her to do if commanded. She fall in love with the prince, but they could never marry because of her obedience. If ordered to kill her husband, she would have to. See if Ella gets to marry her prince by reading this book. I recommend this book to anyone of any age."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted brought me to the point where I was crying because it was so good. It was magnificant. Everybody just hopes Ella gets her wish. And everybody, even adults will like this book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think this is a great book. It is about a girl who has a curse on her. She is over 10 years old, she has a stepmother and stepsisters, they are very mean to her when her father wasn't around. She fell in love and finally did something she always wanted to do."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was truly one of the best books I've ever read (which are not too few). First of all the setting, I instantly connected with it, just the thought of there really being such a place filled with princes, ogres, elves, dwarves, fairies, I love it all. Now, coming from a child of the KoRn, those are pretty strong words. Gail Carson Levine has a devine way of conveying the emotions of her characters. I pride myself in my emotional strength and, well, coldness, but I felt every moment of happiness, every tear, every hint of pleasure or nervousness. If you are alive, read this book. P.S. I read Ella Enchanted three times in four days in a row."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a really great book. It is similar to the original Cinderelle story, but quite original too. It had something for everybody, and is recommended for ages 9-109. You will love this book, whick has a surprise twist at the ending. I would be surprised if you could put it down!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"An original,imaginative, and funny retelling of the Cinderella story. Ella is a young girl who has been given the dubious gift of obediance by a flighty and sappy fairy. She has to obey, no matter what is asked of her. I found this to be a very profound book, interesting for adults as well as children. Ella's problem kind of reminded me of what people who suffer from compulsive obsessive disorder go through. The scene where she breaks the curse is deeply moving, I kept thinking about it all day, its probably one of the best scenes I've ever read in a book. I recommend this book to adults as well as children, it will be sure to enchant."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Oh my gosh! This is the best book I've ever read! Great thing to read after the Harry Potter series. I swear it's the best!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book of Ella Enchanted is a great new version of the classic fairy tale of Cinderella. I did enjoy the new twist of the story, but I do have a few questions or hinderences about the way that it ends so abruptly. The entire story ,all the way through, most of the chapters were full of fabulous detail that really amplified the story's feeling and depth. Then as the end of the story was coming closer and closer the story line moved so fast that it almost seemed that the deatils were slim to none in the book. The appeal of the book really began to lessen and then before I knew it the story was over. I wish that it had continued in the fashion of having such great detail and ended with a slightly bigger twist. I did like the new idea of the two lovers meeting and being friends for a long time before they actually fell in love and became husband and wife. That added a lot more reality to the fairy tale even though I know that there is to be little. Over all I did enjouy the story and I would recomentd it to others and I think that I will read it to my future children and students. I just wish that everyoe was not in such a hurry to be done with everything these days."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a great book. It is based on Cinderella withsome cool new twists. I thought it was so good, I read it twice!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"In the extraordinary book Ella Enchanted, it showed me what it is like to be blindly obedient. To start with, Ella was cast under a spell by a fairy who thought her spells were gifts. She had to obey any orders given to her. If she was ordered to cut off her own head she would have to do it. It was a spell that couldn1t be broken. One example would be when her step-sister told Ella to give her a necklace. Although it was very special she handed it over without question. Also when the orges kidnapped Ella she had a chance of escaping, but they told her not to run away. It seemed as though all was lost, but she had managed a plan. As soon as she got out she met with Char, the prince of Frell, and was safely escorted to the wedding where her father was. I don1t want to give away much more, but she finally met Lucinda who then and there cast yet another spell on her to be happy about her so called 3gift.2 When she was finally safe at her home she was treated with disrespect and was told not to marry the Prince when he proposed. Now I surely not going to tell you about the end, but it turned out really good, in my opinion, so I hope you get a chance to read this wonderful book Ella Enchanted. Enjoy your reading!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a great relief from the originalCinderella.While the Grimms Brothers' version might have been fittingfor the time, Ella Enchanted is tailored for the modern day child. Long gone are the days of the damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued. Ella, the main character, has been &quot;blessed&quot; with a gift from a foolish fairy. The &quot;gift&quot; is Obedience. Ella must obey whatever she is told or suffer grave consequences. She does not take this fate lying down, however. She does everything in her power to resist. The other characters, including the father, are much more believeable in Ella Enchanted than in any other Cinderella story available. Even the Prince is a &quot;real&quot; person, not just a man who prances around on a horse all day long. This book is a must read for any modern day school child."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a very humerous book and very sad. The main character is Eleanor or for short Ella because her mom's name is Eleanor too. The story is about a little girl who is born and a foolish fairy grants a spell over the child it is suppose to br a gift but turns out to be curse so when the girl grows older she has to do anything anybody tells her to do.

I would recommend this book to anyone, even people who, like myself, didn't think they would like fairy stories."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is definitely a great book, and it should be required reading for everyone! I picked it up at the library, and didn't put it down till it was done. Being the kind that will read the end first, I would have, but the book was too facinating. I started it, and read until the end. I didn't have time to look at the back! I highly recommend this book to anone who like to read, no matter the genre."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is so interesting it keeps you guessing and guessing never revealing what's going to happen next. In my opinion It's the one of the best books I ever read. I have never read a chapter book twice but this book was an exception. Run out to your nearest book store or buy it right now over the net.

I thought, &quot;Oh....another trashy young adult romance novel for girls...&quot; Boy, was I wrong! This was a great book for anyone (and I have always believed that people should get out of the mode of boys reading books only about boys and girls only reading books about girls....hey, look at me. I'm a fan of Pippi Longstocking and Mary Poppins!). It was so well written. I found myself washed in deliciously passionate anger towards Hattie and I found myself wanting to go careening down my bannister. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is funny and exciting.

That's because it's the most wonderful, funny, romantic, sweet, entertaining book ever. Despite the fact that the plot is a twist of the classic Cinderella story, it's very original. It's a great book for people who like fantasy, what with all the fairies, elves, giants, ogres and gnomes mentioned in the book. The so sweet love story with Ella and the prince make it perfect for romance lovers. I like the fact that it's not so sickeningly mushy, but very cutely romantic. This book deserves more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was very sad and it got happier in the end of the book. It was very exciting when she went to travel. It was also very adventurous when Ella was capture by fairy tale creatures. But it was very exciting, romantic, and very adventurous. It was a great book and i liked it very much. I like the made-up creatures in the stroy and the fairies."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was very sad and it is very magical. It was also very exciting when they kissed and played. It was wrong when her sisters locked her up in her room. It was sad when her mother died and there was nothing she could do about it. Ella's father had to marry Ma'am Olga and I don't like Ella's step sisters. I think that having a spell of obedience is hard to control when you have to do what they tell you. Also a spell of love is bad and to love someone you don't like is not right. Also i think that her fairy godmother is very nice and keeps her from getting sick and a cold. But I think it was a great book with many exciting parts to it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A very charming and clever Ella takes the birthday gift of a thoughtless fairy and struggles to make the best of a troublesome situation.

I am a teacher and I will definitely use this book in my classroom! It seems like every emotion is felt when reading this book. I used it for my booktalk and convinced several people to put this book on their &quot;to do&quot; lists. Ella is a lady with a sheer determination and she is admired for that characteristic.

I have read so many books (willingly and forcefully...thanks to school...) and it will always be my favorite. I was never really intersted in fairy tales-I prefered more realistic and believable stoies-but Ella Enchanted totally caught me off guard. It goes way beyond traditional fairy tales. It is so beautifully written so that ALL AGES can appreciate the story-it just grows on you more and more with time, gaining new appreciation for all the different aspects of it. The characters are developed perfectly. Ella is not a typical lead character: she is a strong, determined, intelligent, funny girl, but not overly-developed that it is hard to accept her existance. She has her faults as well, so she was not made into a fictional portrayal of perfection. The character is truly admirable. Everybody, no matter how old, can relate to Ella, and by seeing a part of you within her, you feel close to the character and find yourself sharing her frustrations, victories, heartaches, and struggles. The other characters are developed wonderfully as well, not the typpically flat characters you sometimes find in stories. Everything is portrayed realistically, and you forget that ogres, giants, elves, and fairies do not really exist. And although Ella, who is 15-16 throughout the book, may seem young to older readers, her character is not bound by her age at all. You could be 40 and still identify with Ella and enjoy the story just as much.I really can not say enough to encourage people to read this book. I read it multiple times every year and will never ever grow tired of it. Everyone that I have shared it with has equally loved it-not one person was disappointed. They were actually surprised at how much they loved it, and got their own copies for their own re-reading. :) We're all in college now...and we still can't stop talking about how much we love this book. Please please don't think the movie reflects the quality of the book...the movie did not follow the book AT ALL and it failed to create the correct atmosphere that the book has. Please read this book...even if you read it due to skepticism and want to prove me wrong. You're entitled to your own opinions...just as long as you read it :)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"So, call me sappy.This is an excellent re-telling of an age-old tale. Strong female characters and excellent writing. The prince has a brain (so many princes just don't - it's so sad.) and the fairy godmother has an unusual moral compass. Other characters are humorous and intriguing - orgres that eat humans and ponies, fairies that are a bit mad... all make this story interesting AND funny.The happy ending adds to my pleasure!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I got the book as a gift from my Aunt. The book is a romantic story that is like Cinderella because they both end up like a princess in the end. They both have a fairy godmother. They both have a step-parents. The book has sad parts and funny parts. One funny part is when Ella takes her step-sisters wig off her head. A sad part is when her mother dies. The differences are Ella has a gift she cannot get rid of and Cinderella did not have a gift. Cinderella had one ball and Ella had three balls to attend at the end of the book. I read the book in two days. It is a great book, that is why I think you should read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I knew nothing about this book except that it had been made into a movie (that I have yet to see). It took me a good way through it to figure out that it was actually a version of a much older fairy tale--which greatly impressed me. Ella is completely herself and both unable and unwilling to depend upon such things as magic, ulitmately, to rescue herself. This is a fantastic book for young girls (and young boys if they are willing) but it certainly illustrates the power of one determined young girl."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book I chose is Ella Enchanted. It is written by Gale Carson Levine. I rated this book three and a half stars because I thought Ella Enchanted was an O.K. book. In the beginning Ella gets a curse placed on her from a fairy. The curse makes Ella do anything she is told. Will Ella break the curse or will it stay with her for the rest of her life?I would recommend this book because it is exciting and interesting. Other books by this author are Dave At Night and The Wish.Emerson, NJ; Fifth Grade Student"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Let's see...I was seven years old when I first read this book, and I have read it at least twice a year since. It is my favorite book.Ella is an only child, living with her mother, father, and maid. However, her father is often away, which ends up being a good thing. Ella has the curse of obedience, and she has to do everything she is ordered to do. Ella's mother fears if her father knew about the curse, he would use it to his advantage.Ella's mother has forbidden Ella to tell anyone about the curse, which ends up causing many problems. Her mother dies in the beginning of the book, and after that, so much happens...Her father gets married to a greedy Dame (Dame Olga), who has two obnoxious daughters, Hattie and Olive.Throughout the story, Ella has to overcome obstacles to get rid of her curse. But how far can she go to break it? And when she gets there, will it work?Believe me, this book is worth every penny. Don't let the movie fool you. It's much different."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was enraptured by the book in the very opening. The very thought that Ella, cursed at birth by a fairy named Lucinda, must be obedient and obey every single command, trivial or not, seemed very alarming to me. If someone told her to go jump off a bridge, she must because she cannot resist the order. Throughout the book, Ella is showered with ugly commands by odious people, and I felt the pain with her as she searches for Lucinda to break the curse. In her journey, she is sustained by a friend she meets at finishing school and the cute Prince Charmont (Char) who grows fond of Ella.My favorite part of the book is the correspondence between Char and fifteen-year-old Ella. The moments they share together are very sweet, and she loves him so much that she wants to protect him from her horrible curse.I have one complaint, though. I like how Levine ends the book, but I felt the last twenty pages or so were very rushed. One minute, Lucinda is depicted as odious, and the next, almost everything is better. The resolution happened within two paragraphs, and I just wished that Levine elaborated a little more. Other than that, a very enchanting book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I first bought this book about 7 years ago at a book fair. Now I'm 16 years old and it is still my favorite story of all time. Ella is a hilarious heroine whose tale is spun with ogres, fairies, friendship and love. This book has all the makings of a classic fairytale and is a touching and easy read. For any skeptics who saw the film version and were dissapointed, I guarantee you that the book is far, far better. I have read this book several times a year since I've had it but I find that it never loses its touch. If you are looking for a book that will make you smile and brighten up your day, I highly recommend \\"Ella Enchanted\\"."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella of Frell was born with the gift of obedience. Throughout this magnificently well written novel, Ella must overcome a curse that handicaps her will and threatens not only her life but the lives of those she loves. Levin expertly renders this female heroine so that children and adults can appreciate her rich characterization that breaks through the stereotypes and traditional portrayals of female characters especially in fairy tales. This book is unquestionably the best Cinderella story ever written. I read it for the first time six years ago and to this day, after at least seven subsequent trips into the magical world of an enchanting medieval town, this is still my favorite book. If you are going to read anything this year I suggest you read \\"Ella Enchanted\\" by Gale Carson Levine."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted has been a treat to read! My 5th grade class has been reading it so we could go on a field trip to see the movie! This book has been awesome, and my students love it so much! This is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is about a story called a girl called Ella, when she was a little baby she had a spell called upon her. A fairy called Lucinda had put a spell on her, which had to do with Ella being obedience. So that means that Ella has to do whatever anybody tells her to do. Therefore Ella is in a lot of trouble. If a person commanded her to kill herself she would actually do it. Therefore, before Ella's mother died she told Ella not tell anybody about her special gift. Therefore Ella keeps her secret in a world full of mysteries, fantasy, and romance.Although will she be able to keep the promise to her mother.I liked this book a lot beacuse it is full of adventure and fantasy, two of my favorite quotes was, \\"If somebody were to tell me to hop on one foot for one day and a half, i'd have to do it. And hoping on one leg wasn't the worst command. If a person were to ask me to cut of my head, I'd have to do it.\\" Also there was another one of my favorite quotes,\\" I know you can imitate people just as Lady Eleanor could. Once you imitated your manservant to his face, and he wasn't sure wheter he was the servant or you were. You make up your own fairy tales and you drop things and trip over things. I know you once broke a whole set of dishes.\\" \\" I slipped on ice!\\"This is book is really funny and really adventure like. When i first read it, i felt like i was in a trance, a deep trance, and I read every word to myself. It was a truly amazing book! Even though i finished it pretty early, I kept reading it over and over again. I think this book is absolutely perfect for a kid with great imagination. This book also reminds me of Sleeping beauty, the princess with the curse.My favorite part of the book was when Ella wanted to marry the prince, but she disagreed and said that she couldn't marry him because of her curse. Just then Mandy sscreamed and hugged Ella, you broked the spell!! She screamed. Then she said to ELla i command you to jump, but Ella didn't have to do it. There was no more buzz in her head that made her do it. She was overjoyed and the prince said i command you to marry me, and she said yes! When Lucinda went to their wedding, and asked if they would like a wedding present, Ella and Prince Chad just smile at each other, and then looked at Lucinda and said no. This was the best moment Ella had ever had in her whole life."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is one of my favorite stories and it will most likely be yours if you buy it on Amazon right now.

Contained in this book is a story about a girl named Ella and her love for a prince, Char, who loves her in return, but as Ella makes a journey she soon realizes that she would put the prince in great danger if she married him. The reason for this is since her birth, Ella has been cursed with the \\"gift\\" of obedience, granted by a fairy named Lucinda. After many years of living at home she finds out that her cook, Mandy, is really her fairy godmother and Ella asks Mandy to remove the curse, but Mandy refuses to. After Ella's mother dies, Ella's father, Peter (who is a merchant), sends her to finishing school where she meets Hattie and Olive who discover her obedience and use it for themselves. Then when Ella is reminded that her father has gone to a giant's wedding, Ella plans to escape finishing school and go to the wedding where she hopes to find Lucinda and have her remove the \\"gift\\". On her way to the wedding Ella is captured by ogres and is almost their dinner.After a couple of days with the ogres, Ella's beloved Char comes to rescue her and takes her to the wedding. At the wedding Lucinda refuses to remove the curse. When Ella gets home, Peter tells her that he has to marry her off and sell everything they own because he owes a lot of money to some elves. Peter gets married to a woman named Dame Olga, who is Hattie and Olive's mother. Dame Olga makes Ella in to a servant when Peter leaves. One day there is an announcement that a ball is to be held so that the prince may find his wife. Ella heads off to the ball after Hattie, Olive, and Dame Olga have left. Char likes Ella the most out of all of the girls at the ball, but Ella will not remove the mask she is wearing to reveal herself to the prince. Hattie gets so jealous that she rips off the mask and Ella runs home, but when Char runs after Ella, she soon has to make a big decision.To find out what happens read Ella Enchanted. There are also so many exotic settings in this book such as; Elve's Forest, Dame Olga's Manor, a giant's wedding, and an old castle. This is an enchanting tale that should be read over and over by all. Ella Enchanted is so captivating and inspiring that it has become my favorite book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love this book, I just finished reading it for the 5th time.

Of course, the fairy thinks she is giving her a gift. If someone said cut off your head she would have to. Basically, Ella runs into Prince Charmont (or Char as he wishes for her to call him) Heir to the throne of Kyrria, she is sent to finishing school, and under the thum of Hattie her soon to be stepsister.This is a wonderful book, a must read for all of the girls in the world. 10-14 would probabally be the recommended age range. This Newberry Honor Book is The Best in the world."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book was completely awe-inspiring and awesome. This princess was given the gift of obedience, by a fairy, at birth. While growing up she can not let out her secret. However, her evil step sister and a couple others have found this out and began to take advantage of her. Ella's heart was being captured by a Prince. However if she married the Prince, the step-sister would force Ella to give his money over to her. Ella did not want to hurt him, so she told herself that she wouldn't marry him. Ella had told the Prince that she wasn't old enough, yet, to marry. At another time, she trick him saying that she never liked him, to try and protect him. A year later, he comes back from a journey. Ella is still condemned by her gift, but wants to go to the welcome party for the Prince. She disquises herself and has the Prince wondering why this lady seems to remind him of someone. Later, she is revealed. The Prince still being in love with Ella, say's &quot;Marry me!&quot; This was a command, but for the first time, Ella hesitated and forced herself to say &quot;NO!&quot; She had broken her curse, and grown older, now saying that she would love to marry the Prince. The talking book was incredibly read by the talented Eden Riegel. She managed to take on about 8 main characters, all with different accents. It was just amazing, and very clear to understand whom was speaking. I also enjoyed the the comical part added in and the way she took up the languages of people from other lands. She consistantly read with such intensity that I was excited to continue with the rest of the tapes. I think what I liked the most about this book was the adventures of a girl, whom was born with a unwanted &quot;gift.&quot; She had to fight for several years over all of the trouble it has caused, and one day succeeds. This was very inspirational and I hope it showed children that even if they were born with an unwanted gift themselves, that through their will and determination they can also overcome their situations. This book plays on the values of patience, commitment, will, honesty, fortitude and the strength and courage to achieve a dream. I would absolutely recomend this to any child."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved Ella Enchanted, the writing was excellent and the characters were good, too. It answered some questions about Cinderella. However, under closer eyes, Ella Enchanted revealed a real flaw. Ella made unrealistic decisions. I think that Levine made the book this way because she needed these decisions for the ending. Furthermore, this book is charming but not much else. However, it is good and you should read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella's not like normal girls, and it's not becasue she's a strong feisty girl. It's becasue she was cursed with the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. What ever she is asked to do, she must do it. And when she's sent to live with her evil stepmother and stepsisters they quite enjoy her gift. This book is filled with mystery, magic and handsom princess. And it's a good example of a well- written up-graded fairy tale. If yo llike fantasy I think you should read this book. Mother Goose would be proud."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a book by Gail Carson Levine. The book is about a young girl named Ella who at birth was the recipiant of a foolish fairys gift. The gift Ells recieved is the gift of obedience. If Ella is told to do something she must do it. Being the girl she is she refuses to just comply every time. She is determined to break the curse. In this book you will meet princes, orges, giants, wicked step sisters, and fairy godmothers. This book is sort of like Cinderella. It has the prince and the ball but it also has alot of things Cinderella didn't.Gail Carson Levine grew up in New York City and has been writing all of her life. She wrote poetry as a high school student and even got published. Her and her husband David worked together on a childrens musical that was produced in Brooklyn. As of now she lives in a two-hundred-year-old farmhouse in Brewster, New York, with her husband and thier Airedale, Jake.This book is a wonderful book for many reasons. Almost every chapter ends with a wonderfully worded cliff hanger. There is also a small portion of romance to the book. The action in it is very exciting and keeps the pages turning. This book makes you feel as if you were there. Gail Levine did an amazing job in writing this book she used great wording and that element of action and romance.There isn't really anything in this book I would change. Truthfully I think it is really good like it is.If I were to suggest an audience this book would be great for childeren from about 8 years old to 17 or so. thank you for reading and if you were thinking of buying this book I suggest you do. It is a great book that you will love."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Gail Carson Levine creatively writes a fantasy story that takes place in the mystical land of Frell. Ella, the main character of the story has been given the \\"gift\\" of obedience by a fairy named Lucinda. The characters and setting in the story are unique in their own right but are not believeable. The characters are not believeable because they are unrealistic life forms such as elves and gnomes. The theme is well developed throughout the story. The theme is a combination of bravery, selflessness, obedience, and perserverance. There is also a suprise observation that pops up in the story. That observation is that Ella gains her obedience back.I really enjoyed this book. Coming from a male's point of view, it was enjoyable for me. It reminded me of the famous fairy tale Cinderella. This book is best suited for readers at the middle elementary school level. The book gives the reader insight into what it is like to regain something valuable that they lost in the past."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is the best book ever. My friend told me about this book and I had to see what was so great about it. For the past two days, I lived like a hermit inside my room reading non-stop. The funny thing is I usually hate reading books, especially ones about princess and fairies.Ella Enchanted is about a girl named Ella who is trying to overcome this curse which is really a gift given to her by a fairy named, Lucinda. The gift or curse is Obedience. It sounds ok at first but then there are of course consequences. Some of consequences even make her become a maid in her own house and might even kill her. I was at the rim of my chair reading this book and I couldn't put it down.I especially recommend this book to those who like fairies and princesses but also to people who don't like reading. Even though I hate reading books, I only read, now, books by Gail Carson Levine. That's why I recommend this book as a 5 star must read"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Carson Levine has retold the tale of Cinderella in a wonderful young-adults novel named Ella Enchanted.Ella was cursed at birth to be always obedient,it was always fun to wonder what Ella would have to do next.(I wonder if you could order her NOT to be obedient therefore breaking the spell?Ok,maybe not)She is forced to live with a horrible stepmother and 2 wicked stepsisters,one who has figured out Ella's curse,and enjoys lording over her.For some time Ella even had to starve as this wicked and ugly girl would tell her,\\"Don't eat that,Ella.\\" every meal time!!What will finally break Ella's life-long curse,the thorn in her side???Be enchanted by this story and find out."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was very interesting. This book is based on a Cinderella story. It's about a young girl named Ella who lived with only her dad and her cook, Mandy, after her mother had died when Ella was almost fifteen.

Later, she was sent to a finishing school with her two selifish step-sisters. She stuggled with her curse for a very long time, but in the end, she finally got peace and happiness just like Cinderella.What I like about this book is that it's adventorous and it tells you about a girl who believed in herself and achieved her goal. When the story ended, I pictured in my head, what would happen next and i tried making my own story. I wished that this was a never ending story so that i could read about what happened to her next after she married the prince. Did the evil fairy, Lucinda come back and give Ella's daughter a curse too? There were so many questions and wished i knew the answers. That was how much I liked this book.This was one of my favorite books and i'm glad that my friend recommended it to me or else i wouldn't have known about believing in yourself.

I've read a lot of fairy tales, and this was by far the best I have ever read. Gail Carson Levine creates a heroine that is so believalbe and so unlike any other, that it's almost scary. This story is abot a girl named Ella who is pretty much cursed at birth with the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. At the age of 15 when her mother dies, there is only two people left that know about the curse: the cook, Mandy , and Ella's fairy godmother. Since her father is never around, he sends Ella to a boarding school. She runs away and decides to try and find the fairy who gave her the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. The book tells of Ella's adventures and misfourtunes along the way. I would recomend this book to any person who has ever read a fairy tale and thought it could be way better. The only downs of this book is that it ends so fast, but in a way that's a good thing because then you get to think of the ending!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Beatrix Cottonpants is, herself, a bit flummoxed that she did not read Gail Carson Levine's Ella Enchanted earlier. It has fairy gifts that go terribly wrong. It has evil step-persons. It has a prince who is around --and interested in Ella -- for much of the book, while she's awake, alive and speaking. Which is not something you can say about all fairy princes.Ella of Frell is cursed, given the \\"gift\\" of obedience by an overenthusiastic nitwit of a fairy before she was old enough to protest. Obedience means, of course, that Ella must do whatever she is told, as long as it is issued as a command - not doing so causes physical symptoms. To make things worse, a stint in finishing school has Ella under the thumb of a mean ambitious girl who figures out that she can order Ella around. A journey to find Lucinda, the fairy who cursed her, leads to adventures and daring escapes, and finally the remarriage of her father puts Ella into the Cinderella story, as Ella becomes the unwilling servant of her stepmother and stepsisters.Ella herself is strong and determined, but human enough that readers will be able to relate to her. Her relations are horrible in just the right way, and the exploration of what it really means to be obedient is spot on. There could, of course, be some deliberation on whether Ella's obedience is a metaphor for what is expected of women in society, or perhaps just an extrapolation of Cinderella's willingness to obey her family's every whim. The world is well drawn, too. Outside Frell, Ella engages ogres, gnomes, giants, and more, all distinct entities. Wonderful book for fairy tale fans, and readers who love strong funny girls.Cross-posted from [...]"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella of Frell has never really known her father. She and her mother are best friends living a happy life with their Cook, Mandy, for company. But Ella is not your typical girl. She was given the gift of obedience as a baby from a fairy who never gives good gifts, even when she has the best of intentions. This gift means Ella must obey any and all orders - whether it be to sweep the floor, hop like a rabbit, or cut off her own head!After Ella's mother dies, Ella must deal with her grief alone - for not only is her mother gone, but her father is sending her to finishing school with the two most horrid girls in the world - Hattie and Olive. She wishes she could stay in Frell, enjoying the menagerie and her new friend Prince Charmont, but her father, who knows nothing of her curse, has ordered her to go.But Ella is not one to shy from adventure, or to bend the rules of her obedience charm. Ogres, elves, stepsisters, and possible true love wait in her future. If only she could find the fairy who gave her the curse in the first place...___________________________________My thoughts -At first, it was hard not to compare this book to the movie, which I've seen about ten times. I still watch it every so often with my sisters to laugh and relive childhood memories, as silly as the movie is. I wanted the book to be different but...the same. Same characters, same order of events, same climax and turnout.I got something completely different, and was at first surprised by this. I wasn't sure how much I liked it - it lacked the action and intensity I was expecting.But I soon got over this and found myself in a fluffy, light, floating fairy-tale that involves more silly magic and character development than action. And then I was hit with the climax - and I went to my sister, who had already read the book, laughing and giggling and bursting about the story with her, while she tried to get me to stop hugging her with joy... ;)In any case, I was so happy, by the end, to find how different and how much better this was from the movie, which I don't know if I'll ever watch again. How could they have ruined such a beautiful story?!Character notes -I really loved all these characters. They were three-dimensional and full of life and so different from each other. I admired Ella (even though I thought she cried a lot), despised Hattie, and said, \\"Poar Olive\\" every once in a while to get a good laugh. Yes, I meant \\"poar\\".)Prince Char, where to begin? He started as a boy, and grew into a man, lovable, tender, and loving. He lived up to my standards and definitely deserved this story's heroine!Story notes -Like I said before, I wasn't too happy with the lack of action and suspense...but it was hard to stay disappointed. I found myself enjoying the story just as much as I'd been hoping, just in a different way. It focused on Ella and how she came to be a woman, so whether this involved taming ogres or sewing for finishing school, it became an adventure. A few of the scenes weren't as well written or executed as the others, but the turnout of those scenes always made up for it.My favorite scenes involved the love letters. Love letters always add the most touching and tender side to a story. I'm so glad this story had many!!Summing it up -Lively - like skipping by a lake in the cool spring breeze. I'm so glad to have gotten to know Ella, her friends, and even her enemies. I want to read more of Levine's novels now!Nothing for the parents - 11+"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is probably one of my all-time favorite books, and I've read it so often that the poor paperback is worn and torn.

This is a book that I will definitely read to my children someday, over and over again, until they can read it back to me.Actually, it's been a couple of years since I've read this... it's time to add it back to my reading pile again!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Overall Review: Ella Enchanted is one of my favorite fairy tale retellings of all time. It's a perfect fantasy: A \`damsel in distress', a prince, an indifferent parent, fairies (including a fairy godmother!), man-eating ogres, future-telling gnomes, fun-loving giants, talented elves, an evil step-mother (of course!!), evil and greedy stepsisters... Put all those characters together and add some spur of the moment travels, finishing school, a few balls, and, above all, a curse, and you have a recipe for something unforgettable!The writing for this novel is accessible to any age. From young children to adults, everyone can find something to love. The characters are individuals with such sparkle! Ella's gift with languages is uncanny and so much fun as she converses with the different species she meets along her way to find the fairy Lucinda and, hopefully, break her curse! The stepsisters are not just nasty--they have personality, even if those personalities are cunning and evil...and a bit daft. There are wonderful moments of humor--as Ella tries to find new ways to thwart the commands she is given, but especially when a wig is stolen! The relationship between Ella and Prince Char is so sweet--from her desire to make him laugh, to the exchanging of letters while he is away in Ayortha, to their final encounter, it's enough to make you sigh with pleasure. Ella Enchanted is a timeless Gem! Overall rating is 5 out of 5 stars!Content Review:PROFANITY: NONEVIOLENCE: A few mild instancesSEXUAL CONTENT: NONEMATURE THEMES: MildRECOMMENDED AGE GROUP: 9+There is no profanity or sexual content (there is a strain of romance throughout, and two characters kiss, but it is very sweet). The violence centers around the ogres, mostly. They eat living creatures. A horse is eaten. A character is caught by ogres and they talk about which parts they're going to eat (the character is not eaten). Ogres chase down a carriage so they can eat the people inside (again, they're not eaten). Ogres try to eat a human and a gnome. One character dies because of illness. A character always thinks of the worst things that could happen because of a curse (many of them involve death and sadness). Some characters are very cruel to another character (making them become a servant and forcing them to work extremely hard). A few of the themes are overcoming curses (obstacles/difficulties), loss of loved ones, and dealing with difficult people/life situations. I read this book aloud to my children and they loved every minute!

I really like this story and i think many other people of all ages could too! The story is about Ella, who was supposedly \\"gifted\\" with the curse to always obey direct orders."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A librarian friend gave me the original hardback Ella Enchanted as a gift when I turned 14 - a LONG time ago! It's been a constant presence on my bookshelf ever since, and it is the one I go back to and read regularly when I'm in need of an instant mood boost. Ella is one of the most endearing personalities I've ever read, and her relationship with Prince Charming develops so naturally it feels truly real. The magical fantasy world has so many human details and vivid characters that it's easy to believe in everything from trolls to centaurs - to tiny-footed fairies. This is definitely a must-read for ladies of any age who love romance, adventure, and a spunky heroine.On that note, I found the movie EXTREMELY dissapointing. Those who hadn't read and loved the book might think it's not bad, but frankly I could barely finish the thing, knowing it had changed so much about the beloved book. Anne Hathaway is gorgeous and part of the original Ella's charm is that she isn't a beauty, only smart, determined, loyal, and courageous. Not to mention many charming parts of the story are lost in Hollywood's version. I suggest you skip the movie entirely and do what I do - reach for Ella Enchanted time after time to lose yourself in a great story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is an interesting \\"twist\\" on the traditional tale of Cinderella. Comparing this story to the movie, I have to say that Disney did well in transferring this story to the silver screen, but the book is still better. I own a copy of the movie and now the book as well, and I recommend both of them."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"What a wonderful book. I loved the creativity Levine put into this classic tale of Cinderella.Ella is placed under a spell where she is forced to obey any direct command. But, with Ella's spunky personality, she may have to obey orders, but her defiant personality shines through in such a way that I was left laughing for joy. For example, her step sister orders her to give up her mother's necklace. By way of the spell, Ella must comply, but in the process, she stomps on the cruel girl's toe and twists her heel for additional effect. I particularly enjoyed the refinement school where Ella is sent to learn the proper behavior of a lady.By the way, I like the book waaaaaay more than the movie. To me, there was no comparison. The book was so much more fun."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine has been out for many years and even a movie has been made which I have watched as well. But, I haven't read this book until now. It was a delightful book, cute and funny. I haven't watched the movie in quite some time, but from memory, there are lots of differences. Ella Enchanted is a re-telling of Cinderella (Cinder ella get it? took me almost the end of the book to see that.) The story of Cinderella never tells why Cinderella does everything her step sisters and step mother tells her too, I mean why didn't she just run away from it all? But, Ella Enchanted gives a reason to why Ella stays and does all of their bidding. Ella Enchanted even has the glass slippers and pumpkin stagecoach which I don't think the movie had. I think the movie strayed more from the Cinderella aspect of it and went more toward Ella's obedience.When Ella was a baby, she was gifted obedience and must do whatever anyone has order of her. Ella didn't let this gift bring her down. She was defiant to her gift, if her cook told her to bring her almonds Ella would bring her two. She would find ways to defy the gift. When Ella's mother dies things go down hill for her but she meets Prince Char and starts a relationship with him. It is a cute story between her and Char. But, after a while, Ella's father must remarry and Ella moves in with her Stepmother and stepsisters who make things awful for her when her father leaves.I am glad that I finally read this book. It is a really cute retelling."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My granddaughter really loved getting this book as she is reading the Ella Enchanted series."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think I would recomend this book to any one because it shows children how they should treat their parents.I learned alot from this book because I learned to respect my mother more.The girl ella in the book has curse put on her when she was born.her mother dies and her father come back from where he was to take care of her.Her and her father don't get along so he ships her off to boarding school.I really liked this book so read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I'm not explaining any part of this book because if you buy it, you'll read it. But since everyone thinks this book is so great, I'm telling you that it's just a retelling of Cinderella. And clearly not one of Levine's best books. Some parts were interesting but I didn't like the retelling. It's totally opposite of the classic story and she just takes it apart and tries to add more adventure."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a very oringinal book. There's not much more to say after that...it can be confusing...slighty boring at rare times...long...the scene where she conquers her &quot;weakness&quot; is very good. And in conclusion, most every good reader, grades 3-8, will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I mean, it was great (and even with the Cinderella part it was okay). But she (author) basically copied Cinderella. I mean, the evil step sisters and step mother, the glass shoe, the prince, the pumpkin coach, the prince trying the shoe on peoples feet, then them living happily ever after (those exact words at the ending). I mean, COME ON!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I give a 2 to Ella Enchanted , I liked it a little. This book reminds me of Cinderalla"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella of Frell was cursed atbirth with obedience: she has to follow any directorder given to her by anyone. The book detailsher mishaps, as well as her quest to break thecurse and find true love. This was way too girlyfor me. Very much a Cinderella story (completewith wicked step-relatives and a pumpkin coach)with a new twist, kind-of-amusing twist. A younggirl might thoroughly enjoy this. Maybe? But perhaps the real problem was the squeaky narrator; just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"While this was definitely a fun and charming book to read, and one I'd recommend to friends or discerning preteens, I am not sure I would give it to a young child. Despite being clever and inventive, I was somewhat upset at the speciesm and stereotypes present here. Humanoid characters are mostly presented as \\"good,\\" but characters who are different from humans are usually shown as \\"bad\\" or soulless, unworthy of consideration or respect. Natural beauty is always \\"good,\\" but ugliness is always tied to evil. For instance, when the main character thinks of why she shouldn't listen to the ogres' presuasive speeches when they waylay her on the road, the only substantive reason she presents is that they have blood under the fingernails--her other (and in fact, primary) \\"reasons\\" have to do with the fact that they are ugly, hairy, etc. The ogres are likewise presented as unquestionably unsympathetic and \\"Other\\" due to the sole fact that they eat humans--and yet neither Ella, nor anyone else, ever thinks to question how non-human animals are treated by the human denizens of her kingdom, or that to the Ogres she is just the same as a pig she eats for dinner is to her. Ella tells the ogres, \\"I am not an IT!\\" but she enjoys going to see caged animals at the castle, and views non-human (yet sentient!) characters almost like circus curiosities. This is particularly troubling due to the fact that some of these non-humans, like dwarfs and elves, DO have intellects, so treating them so dismissively is jarring. For instance, centaurs, being not fully humanoid, are described solely in animal terms, and are presented as \\"dumb\\" (both in terms of intelligence and being unable to speak), with empty eyes and without personalities, souls, or feelings. In most other stories, centaurs are held to be equal with humans, but in Levine's world apparently being just a little different makes you beneath concern.When Ella first meets her future stepsisters, the author lets the reader know that we are to dislike them because they are fat and unattractive. (Ella, on the other hand, is always called pretty by others, and her only possible physical \\"fault\\" is that as a child she is very skinny.) The stepsisters' weight and appetites are continuously put to ridicule. Only several pages AFTER we meet them, are we actually shown that their personalities are also offputting, and even so, it's still necessary for another character to later clarify that they \\"never mean well\\" before we really know that there is reason to dislike these girls aside from their appearance and awkward manners.These are not of much concern to the plot, I suppose, which is overall enjoyable. I would just be a little concerned that these unfortunate undercurrents might cause a child to associate physical appearance with personal value, and to distrust and look down on people whom they might perceive as \\"too\\" different, as well as to lack empathy for other creatures."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Just about an hour after being born all Ella would do it cry. So along come a fairy named Lucinda. She touched Ella's nose and said \\"My gift to you is Obedience. Ella will always be obedient. Now stop crying child.\\" Ella stopped crying. But now she was always obedient. She has to do anything that anyone tells her to do.As Ella got older she noticed to spell more and more, while it kept getting her in more trouble. For example someone asked her to eat a whole birthday cake without it even being touched yet. And she did it. She shoved every last bit of that cake in her mouth. Her mom yelled at her. She wanted to get the spell off but Lucinda wouldnt take it off.The thing is that Ella doesn't have to listen to wishes. Like is someone says \\"May you please hang up my coat?\\" Ella doesn't have to do it. If they say \\"Ella go hang up my coat!\\", then she has to do it because it's a command. Most of Ella's friends take advantage of this. They all think they can get her to do anything they want. But what they dont realize is that Ella knows about this and she hates it.This is a book you have to read. It's filled that Ella has to overcome everyday. She worries that her life could be over at anytime. She is always in danger if someone says something as simple as \\"Go jump in front of a car.\\"This book Ella Enchanted is a book you will absolutley love."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought the beginning of the book was great. There were many details and lots of descriptive language. I had no idea where it was going to until about the last 5 chapters when i knew it was an almost complete replica of Cinderella. The ending shoud've ended more individual."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think that the book started well. However, it got unorigional as the book went on. By the time it got to the part that was exactly like Cinderella, the plot was very unorigional. the clever idea of the curse did not make the second half of the book really good. Probably the only really interesting part about the book was the curse."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The world created in this book is both familiar and completely new. The names are all familiar ones. Fairy. Ogre. Gnome. The fairytale the story is based on is familiar too. But the way they are done is different and unique. The story takes place in an entire world that belongs only to itself, complete with languages, geography, and history. And the story itself is brilliant. The characters are likeable (or hateful when they're meant to be), Ella is an interesting character, and the story unfolds just like it should. A brilliant book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This might have been the best book I have ever read!!!!! The characters are masterfully made with exquisite personalities. This book is about an obedient girl who is in danger every second. I love how this book is like Cinderella, except instead of Cinderella, the main character is replaced with a spunky girl named Ella who is cursed to obey any orders. Ella fights her curse but she faces many symptoms as the consequence. Her life is changed when she meets Prince Charmont. This book is SOOOO worth buying!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My two little sisters (now 22 and 24) share one BATTERED copy of this novel and they have each read it over 10 times. They discovered it when they were about 8 and 10. I finally read the book at age 29 and it did not disappoint! I stayed up late reading and thought about the book for days afterward. We are die-hard romantics. If you are too, I highly recommend this cute novel."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"{Ella Enchanted} had been recommended by some young ladies in a store. I am certain that it was greatly enjoyed. I have heard from many friends that Ella Enchanted is very popular."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an enchanting book about the main character Ella of Frell. At birth she was given the gift of Obedience by the fairy Luinda. But as the years go by this, \\"gift of obedience,\\" becomes a terrible curse. If you give Ella an order even if you don't mean to she has to obey. Weather its cutting off her head or hopping on one foot all day. And she meets the charming prince Prince Charmont. This book has many allusions to the Cinderella tale. Cause this book is sort of a retelling of Cinderella. There are glass slippers and Ella has a fairy God mother and she has a wicked stepmother and stepsisters and a charming prince. But its a whole different retelling. Because it also explains why Ella (Cinderella) is so obedient is because shes under a curse. But whats awesome is that Ella doesn't except that shes under a curse. She trys to find Lucinda and break it herself and not wait for a man to help her. Don't get me wrong I like the whole knight in shining armor rescuing me idea too. But at the same time its up to the girls to do somehting about their predicaments as well. If you're expecting something similar to the movie Ella Enchanted don't. Cause both the movie and the book is totally different from each other except for the plot and the name of most of the characters. But read the book before you watch the movie."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is my Grandma's account, I am eleven years old. Last year my reading group had to read Ella Enchanted. I had all ready watched the movie and the teacher said that the book is similar to the movie, but it is much different. I started to read and I didn't understand at first but around the third or fourth chapter I got hooked on it. We had certain pages we needed to read and I couldn't stop. I liked the storyline of the book. The author really did a very good job at writing it. It was about a baby who kept crying and a witch gave her the gift of obedience. So she was 18 and still had the gift, she figured where the witch was and followed her, she was at a Giant wedding (when I said Giant I was not saying it was big I was saying that the wedding was a Giant wedding, real Giants). She found her and she didn't get her curse/gift take away so eventually the witch takes the curse away and Ella finds a handsome prince and they lived happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Don't be thrown off by the movie, the book is significantly better. The first time I read this book, I fell instantly in love with the characters: strong-willed Ella, her fiesty godmother Mandy, the kind and gentle Areida, the noble Prince Char...I could go on and on. The story and the characters are so well developed, that it pulls you in and makes it a difficult book to put down.I would highly recommend this book, especially to middle school aged girls. In my opinion, Ella is am amazing role model. She's brave, smart, best of all, instead of sitting back and waiting for a handsome prince to come and rescue her, Ella takes her fate into her own hands and sets out to rescue herself.That's the kind of story I want my daughters to read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book was great.

That's how much I liked it - I nvr read a bk twice in a row bc i remem it too good but i read this one three times in a row. You'll love it!! It's like a twisted version of cinderella with magical creatures and fairies."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I just loved this book. As an adult, I thought for sure these types of books would be too juvenile for an adult to like - but I was so wrong. It is beautifully written and you just want to keep reading to find out if her curse is finally ever lifted? Cute, cute story. Can't wait for my daughter to read it. I also enjoyed The Princess Academy and other books by Shannon Hale, which is similar in style...."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I don't really know what to say about it. So, I'll say this; if you're a hopeless romantic like I am, this book is PERFECT for you."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine is a fantasy story with characters that go through very different changes in the story. In this book Ella starts out as being a very rich girl, but after something happens to her mother and she meets Prince Charmont, Ella's life has a chance of being changed forever.Then Ella goes off to finishing school with Hattie and Olive.Then she runs away and on her tralves she meets a band of ogres!Then she escapes and goes to the giants' wedding.Then her father marries Dame Olga.Then when her father leaves to go sell his objects Ella becomes a servant.A couple months later Char has three balls.Ella goes wearing a mask so Char can't recognize her.At the last ball Hattie pulls of her mask.Char comes after her and gives her a comand which could affect her life if she answers it.I think this book was extremely well written.

I have read it so many times it is falling apart. This is one of those books you can read over and over again nonstop. This book is based on the Fairy tale Cinderella but is different in its own way. You should definately read this book!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A charming retelling of the Cinderella story, &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; explains several of the more touchy points of that legend in a fun, intelligent, suspenseful and romantic way that makes the book a real page-turner. Why, for example, did Cinderella never just up and leave her rotten situation? Ms. Levine posits that unbeknownst to the brother Grimm, little baby Ella was under a curse to always obey - everything from &quot;Eat your peas&quot; to &quot;Jump off a bridge.&quot; The romantic element, promising love based on looks, Ms. Levine rectifies by acquainting Prince Charmont and Ella early on. Also incorporating intelligent language, good worldbuilding, a bestiary of mythical animals, and two fairy godmothers, Ella Enchanted is a sweet romp through Fairy Tales' most common story. A delightful read for every age!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is one of my favorite books, i first read it when i was in 5th grade(i think). i'm now in 10th grade and still read it ocassionally for a good read. This book takes place in a land of faires, ogres, centaurs and giants. The main character is Ella and when she was a baby, a foolish fairy gave her the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience. For instance, if someone said &quot;Ella, run around the lawn 10 times&quot; she would have to do it. In the begining of the story her mother dies and her father sends her off to finishing school. Ella goes to finishing school unwillingly with two girls who she dislikes. Eventually her father marries the two girl's mother and they become her step-sisters. Ella is about 15 and falls in love with the prince but her curse prevents her from telling him how she feels. This story is off of the fairy tale Cinderella but i didn't figure this out until near the end. the only thing that relates it to Cinderella is that Ella has two wicked step-sisters &amp; a wicked step mother &amp; she falls in love with the prince. It's a really good story and Ella gets into all sorts of messes like trying to escape from ogres who want to eat her. She's a witty, couragous, strong and funny character and i'm sure you'll love her as much as i do. Don't let the fact that it has some characteristics of Cinderella to stop you from reading this great book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I totaly fell for this book.

And she's going to go on this awesome journey that's going to be epic and life changing!\\"All that ended halfway through the book: The journey, the special creatures, the seemingly important gifts and details, the developmental steps... all gone.

Um..let's see...her father remarries...her stepfamily hates her...turns her into a slave...glass slippers...the prince has a ball...glass slippers...they get married...The end!\\"So really the book is two stories. The totally awesome cool story that the author started with...and the cliche, not-at-all-revamped Cinderella story that she ended with.And for Goodness Sakes! WHAT WAS WITH THE ELVES GIFTS?! She made it seem so damn important that we should know about these gifts and all the way through the novel Ella is hiding them and they're special and they're everything her father ever wanted...What happens to them?!We don't know!She kept them in a bag for the rest of her life!AND THE NECKLACE?! I thought for sure that was going to be the key to everything! It was special and important when it was introduced. it was an heirloom. It was gnome-made (gnomes are magic). It's stolen from her. She wants it back. She contemplates getting it back...Then for the next hundred pages, it's never mentioned, but suddenly at the end of the book, *poof* she has it back. All is well.

I hope this review will give you some idea of why I like it so much.\\"That fool of a fairy Lucinda did not intend to lay a curse on me. She meant to bestow a gift.\\" So begins the tale of Ella of Frell, a young lady who must obey any command given to her. Written by Gail Carson Levine Ella Enchanted answers the question, \\"Why did Cinderella obey her stepmother anyway?\\" with a delightful story of fairies, enchantments, and a host of adventures.After a brief background story, the tale begins just after Ella's mother dies. Told by Ella herself, the narrative reveals her innermost feelings, exploring her emotions and describing her unending fight against her curse. As she goes from her old home to finishing school, a giant's wedding, and a home with her new stepmother Madam Olga, readers gain a window into how she grows and learns with each new experience.One major aspect of this growth is her feelings for Prince Charmont, or \\"Char\\", whom she meets at her mother's funeral. They quickly become fast friends, and even after Char goes to the neighboring country of Ayortha for a year, their relationship not only remains, but begins to change to something deeper.During his absence, Char and Ella write each other letters, smuggling them to each other via Mandy, the fairy cook, to avoid Madam Olga's notice. Soon, Char begins ending his letters by asking \\"Are you still to young to marry?\\" in reference to a comment that Ella made during an earlier adventure. Ella, unsure whether this is a serious question, responds each time with her usual sense of humor. \\"If not too young, I was too tired to marry or too wet or too cross or too hungry.\\" Finally, however, Char reveals that he is serious, and asks flat out if she loves him. Though she has been realizing that she loves him in return, Ella also fears for what his enemies might order her to do to him. Therefor, she writes a letter, supposedly from her stepsister Hattie, explaining that Ella has gone off and married a rich old man just before that last letter arrived. The act breaks both the young peoples hearts, but Ella believes that Char is now safe from her.Unfortunately, it isn't so. Desperate to see Prince Char once more, Ella disguises herself and attends a ball thrown in his honor when he returns from Ayortha. She is revealed, however, and Char promptly follows her home and asks her to marry him. \\"Marry me, Ella.\\" he says, unaware of the curse. Her stepfamily also orders her to marry the prince, wanting to take advantage of her. With even her heart wanting to say yes, Ella is forced deep within herself in her struggle to defend her prince and her love by saying no. This final, desperate struggle finally breaks the curse, and by saying no, Ella frees herself to say yes, which she promptly does.

Her godmother gave her a gift called the Obedience Gift, which makes her do whatever someone commands her to do, even cutting her head off by herself. Then she goes off on her mission to get her godmother to take the spell back. On the way, she meets a prince her age, named Char( Prince Charmont). They fall in love and Char tries to convince Ella to marry him. Ella refused to marry Char, because she didn't want to endanger Char and his kingdom.ELLA ENCHANTED is truly a book with romance, and adventure. For those who like this book, I would TOTALLY recommend the movie that just came out. HONESTLY, Char in the movie is just SO(...) HOT(...)! I saw the movie yesterday, and I LOVED(...) it SOOO much!!! It's a great movie to see. I think it is the BEST romance movie I ever watched that were for teenagers!!

Ella is a clumsy, but good natured person--she's obedient, but not naturally. She was given the gift of obedience at birth which turned into a curse, and when worst comes to worst, Ella tells the story of how far she would go to free herself from the curse and guides you through her jouney on finding out the importance of being yourself. I rate this book 5 stars because it's not only the ultimate Cinderella story, but it's a mini love story in a way with twists and turns including elves and giants--because of this,Ella Enchanted has become my favorite novel and with each page my excitement grew larger and larger, forest to forest, town to town, and ogres to elves. I recommend this book to ages 10-14 because of its intense vocabulary. Both boys and girls who are interested in fantasy, adventure, and a good laugh every now and then, should read this book.

At 30 years of age, I read this book for the first time, and just couldn't put it down.Gail Carson Levine has created a world in which ogres, centaurs, elves, fairies, and giants are made real; where magic is an integral, but not commonplace aspect of daily life. Ella is a strong-willed heroine, with the courage and perseverence to achieve her goals. She is delightfully contrary, engagingly mischievous, and displays a nobility of character that is very becoming.In the end, what really hooked me was the Cinderella story told against such an original and whimsical plot. The heroine was courageous, the prince truly charming, and the love story believable."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Read this book! It is one of the best books I've ever read.

It's almost like a sequel to Ella Enchanted!)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A lifelong fairy tale fan, I thought I knew what to expect when I picked up Ella Enchanted, but even I was often startled over how Gail Carson Levine manages to make this story stand on its own, while also incorporating the traditional details with logical circumstances (for a fantasy). You forget that the old story elements - like the pumpkin, the glass slipper, and the fairy godmother - until you are actually reading about them and remember that you already knew that they were coming up. She takes the less attractive or believable aspects of the age-old tale and turns them gently and sensibly on their heads. I particularly admired Ella's rebelliousness against her forced obedience, and how she and her Prince fall in love corresponding in intelligent, involved letters.If you ever wondered why Cinderella put up with all the abuse her stepmother and stepsisters heaped on her, this is the book to satisfy your curiosity. A wacky fairy gives her the \\"gift\\" of obedience and Ella is forced to follow every imperative addressed to her. She learns quite a bit about the preciousness of free will and how to maintain her own independence. As soon as she is able, she begins a search to reverse her situation. This is no sitting-pretty damsel-in-distress. On her adventure, she encounters elves, ogres, giants, and her Prince.Levine creates a marvelous fantasy world that shows how priceless choice is. Appreciation for life's simple pleasures takes center stage here. In most fairy tales, it's more convenient to overlook weaknesses in heroes/heroines because we know the story will stop being a fairy tale if we question it. Ella Enchanted confronts the all-important \\"why\\"s of the story and is still a pure pleasure to read. This book's got it all - Ella is a spirited, charismatic character, the descriptive elements are crisp, the situations are clever and often very funny, and the romance isn't contrived at all (a true coup in re-telling fairy tales). I finished reading it and immediately wanted to begin again on page one. That's a rare feeling and this is a rare book - make sure you read this one and pass it on!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is the best book I have ever read.

It has unreal creatures such as ogres and fairies, and deals with magic and curses. Ella Enchanted starts out with Ella, a 15 year old girl with a curse, a curse of obediance. No matter what someone tells her, she must do it, or her head will ache and other symptoms show until she finally does it. She helps out her fairy godmother, Mandy in the kitchen most of the time.

I only suggest to start this book in the morning, because you won't want to stop until you finish it. (I started reading it at 11:30PM and ended somewhere around 2:00AM.) If you were stranded on a desert island, this would be a perfect book to be stranded with. Once again, and I can't stress this enough- this is a very, very, very, very, very good book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This version of the story contains more twists, turns, and surprises than any book I have ever read. The author uses suspense to keep your attention. My favorite part of the book was when Ella (Cinderella) was sent to boarding school. The most interesting character was Hattie, Ella's wicked stepsister. Unlike the original story, Ella is almost eaten by ogres. Also she goes to a giant's wedding. Nevertheless, these qualities make the book more flowing and interesting.

It's about a girl named Ella, when at birth was given a &quot;gift&quot; (more like a spell) to ALWAYS be obidient. No matter what someone says, Ella has to obey; if she doesn't, she gets dizzy, and feels sick. Ella is at danger at all times, because if somebody (for instance) told her to chop her head off, she would HAVE to do it! Anyway, in the begining of the book, Ella's mother dies. At the funeral, Ella meets a boy named Char, the prince. After awhile she falls in love with him but doesn't want to marry him in fear of putting him in her danger too. Well, that's all I'm going to say- other wise it will give a lot of stuff away. I really love this book, I have read it 2 times, in the middle of the 3rd.

By the end you'll wish you were Ella."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I remember when I first read this novel many years ago. Immediately after finishing it I picked it up again and read it again, so marvelously enchanted was I by this enchanting novel. I read through the novel a sum total of seven times one after another before I was finally able to put it down. The characters and well-drawn and interesting, the dialogue authentic sounding and enjoyable. Ms. Levine suceeded in creating a thoroughly believable fantasy world. There are a few plot holes, but these failings are minor compared to her success in drawing such life-like and sympathetic characters. Ella is endlessly charming and sympathetic, and the prince is well-done as well. The sinister father is also perfectly delineated. Many of the scenes are quite beautiful and full of drama. In fact, the fact that this novel is based off the fairy tale of Cinderella is not something I noticed until many years after first reading the novel. This is something that only becomes apparent in the last few chapters where obvious props like the pumpkin carriage are introduced. I would argue that these token homages to the fairy tale detract more than the add to the story.This is primarily because \\"Ella Enchanted\\" is not really based on Cinderella at all, as I have realized. The only connection to Cinderella are a few cheap props and plot points, as above noted. \\"Ella Enchanted\\" is in fact based on a literary work of more recent provenance. The work to which I refer is of course Charlotte Bronte's celebrated novel \\"Jane Eyre,\\" truly the most powerful and haunting novel in our noble English language. Ms. Levine drops the Gothic setting, but she faithfully retains in Ella all of Jane's spirited, independent, and admirable character. She also retains in Mum Olga the hateful Aunt Reed, and in Hattie and Olive Jane's two wretched cousins. In \\"Ella Enchanted\\" we even have and episode at a boarding school, though one not so sinister as Lowood. Furthermore, just as the characters of Jane and Ella are alinged, so does Ms. Levine reproduce many of Charlotte Bronte's themes. Jane Eyre must struggle to break free of restrictive Victorian social codes that limit her freedom; Ella must break free from a fairy's curse. Finally, both of our noble heroines break their respective curses by refusing a marriage proposal the proposers fully expect them to accept. By refusing they assert their freedom defy the forces that had been restricting them. My only regret is that, this being a children's book, Ms. Levine was unable to reproduce in the prince the dark heart of the Byronic hero Mr. Rochester. But, being a children's book, that is the way it had to be."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a fantastic book. It is well written and just plain fun. Ella Enchanted is the answer to all of the things that annoyed me about the Cinderella fairytale I grew up with. (\\"But why didn't she just stop obeying her stepmother and stepsisters?! Run away or something?\\" (She was under a spell!) and \\"UGH! I hate how the prince meets her at ONE BALL and they fall in love. One night and they get married? They don't even know each other!\\" (Char is friends with Ella and grew up knowing her mom AND they are pen pals!))I did think Ella's voice in this reading was a little too young for her character. I would have liked someone else to read it. But, still, even that I got used to and listen to it over and over.p.s. if you've read the book and are wondering if you should see the movie, DON'T. It's HORRID. Nothing like the book except the title (except that I think she would have been a better choice for the reader for this audio book. Other than that, no merit at all.). If you have seen the movie and hated it and are wondering if you should read the book, please read the book. Give it a chance! The movie is so ridiculous. If you LIKED the movie and are wondering, I have no idea what to tell you... seriously."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I came to this book in the odd position of having seen the movie first. I must say, I was quite surprised. Aside from the names of the characters and the curse of obedience, little was the same. When I started reading, my mind was trying to make comparisons... but the stories were so different that I had to stop. The two plots are so dissimilar, they can't really be compared.The book features a spunky heroine who can more than look after herself, even in the face of a curse that makes her obey any order that's given to her. I enjoyed reading about her adventures and her blossoming friendship with Prince Char. Since this story is loosely based on Cinderella, of course we all know that Ella will live happily ever after. But how she gets there is in turns entertaining, frustrating, romantic, and clever. And yes, there are glass slippers in this version of the story.My only real complaint was with the climax and the way Ella finally broke the curse. It seemed a little overly convenient to me, and I didn't really understand why she hadn't done it sooner. In that respect, the movie version of this event made more sense to me.So, even though the way Ella broke the curse wasn't my cup of tea, I quite liked the rest of the book. The climax may have fallen a little flat... but getting there was more than half the fun."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Since there's already thousands of reviews on Ella Enchanted, there's no need to go into detail. I'll just say that this book is fabulous and has everything I could want in a book. It's wonderfully written with action, adventure, humor, wit, and a beautiful love story that isn't too mushy. I like re-reading this book so much that this is the second time I've bought it; my first copy was misplaced. This one is definitely Gail Carson Levine's best."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It's getting harder to find what I feel is appropriate reading material for my 12yr old daughter. She's not interested in the fantasy and mythology type books, she's a little too old for the kid's fairytales and not yet ready for the high school romance and more grown up subject matter. Ella Enchanted was a great find. A modern day twist on the old Cinderella classic with much better and more detailed character development then I expect for this age of audience."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I actually saw the movie before I read the book and I loved the movie, but it's vastly different from the book. It was interesting to see the differences. I can see why some of the changes were made for the movie, but both are great in their own right.I liked the treatment of Lucinda in the book better than in the movie. In the movie, Lucinda never learned or understood what she did to people, but in the book she did when Mandy tricked her into experiencing what she put Ella through.I also liked that Ella had to find the inner-strength to break the curse, opposed to having an easy quick fix of undoing it. To be honest, Ella would have probably in more trouble if Lucinda had reversed the spell, so even if she wanted to obey at times, she would then be under a curse to never obey.I also like that the prince was treated as a real person and given a real personality. Rewatching Disney's Cinderella as an adult, I was shocked how truly vapid the prince was. He had no personality. He was just a stereotypical pretty boy.It was also nice reading the progression of Ella and Char's relationship, instead of her going to a ball and just falling in love with him.This is a great book, which I'll definitely read again."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Romance, although also could be fantasy. Upper elementary to middle school. Reading level is supposed to be grade four, but it seems higher to me. 232 pages.I read quite a bit of this book before I started to enjoy it, but because the librarian recommended it, I stuck with it. The book is the back story of Cinderella, although the reader doesn't realize it until near the end. Instantly, the story of Cinderella--which I never really liked--has a profound truth I now see: When we walk in another's shoes, our perceptions change. Honor book. No illustrations."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was between reading two serious books and decided to take a short break with something light-hearted and fun. \\"Ella Enchanted\\" certainly fit the bill. Cinderella was my favorite fairy tale as a child, so I really enjoyed seeing a slightly different twist on my favorite classic. This is a fun read whether you're 8 or 80 years old!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My grandmother made me get this book, but I confess, I was reluctant. I was not impressed by the movie... But when I started, I couldn't stop! I have always been an avid reader, but I didn't want to read a sappy love story. Surprise! Ella Enchanted was NOT sappy. It has a dash of romance, a dollop of comedy, and a headstrong heroine! What more could you want in this book?!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I bought this book because I was a big fan of the movie. Though it's pretty different from the movie (and truth be told, is probably a better movie than a book), it's still a quality book and excellent for young girls. It has a good message to young women (and to all children) about believing in yourself and having the knowledge that you can do anything you sset your mind to. I recommend this for a young girl."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is easily one of my favorite books. Like another reviewer, I too stayed up reading \\"till the wee hours\\" the first time I read it. It's now been six years since that first reading, and I still stay up late reading the book whenever I feel the need for some feel-good entertainment.Ella Enchanted is written for 'tweens, and deservedly won the 1998 Newberry Medal for creating a style appropriate for that age group without sacrificing quality or seeming to \\"dumb down\\" for the readers. The nature of Magic and Fairy lends itself to creating a world fit for any age that chooses to enter it, and the fact that it's written for middle schoolers does not mitigate the appeal of that world to those of us who are a bit older. I actually would most recommend this book for highschoolers, rather than middleschoolers, because the escapist joy I get from this book only grows as I get older. When you're old enough that few of your reading list books would ever mention \\"magic\\" without a snicker, you only enjoy this book more.The episodic nature of the book also makes it a favorite: you can read your favorite bits over and over without feeling you missed out because you didn't read the twenty pages prior or after.Or, if you do decide to read the whole thing in one sitting (as I often do!), the episodes are short enough that you never get bored and feel you need to \\"skip to the good part\\" and are entertwined enough that you don't feel jolted. Ella's travel from school to the giant's wedding is a good example. There are several episodes: meeting with the elves, dealing with the ogres, time with Char, and on the road with Sir Stephan. All are short, each leads to the next in terms of plot, and each helps develop and display traits of the main characters.On top of being an excellently executed book, Ella Enchanted has the advantage of being thoroughly likable. The Cinderella story is familiar enough that we can delight in details before they become integral to the story, as when the reader discovers that Ella's feet are smaller than most humans (and we can anticipate the final scene with fitting on a shoe that fits only her). And most people certainly aren't strangers to the creatures, like centaurs, and elves, and gnomes, and of course, fairies. Yet Gail Carson Levine allows herself enough leeway that she creates a completely new world, with such details as a stepsister who loves money but can't count very well and a suitor for Ella, picked by her greedy father. And we've all read about how wonderful it is that Ella herself is a spunky, three-dimensional character, complete with frustrations and fears and the determination to overcome both.Finally, who wouldn't want to read a story with a happy ending?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Obedience. Fifteen-year-old Ella never would have had this problem if that fool of a fairy Lucinda hadn't given her the gift of obedience at birth. Gift, more like a curse. Ella grew-up in the land of Frell, having to obey everything that anyone told her. She had no choice, for if she tried to fight the curse, she would make herself sick. Her Mother took excellent care of her, but her Father, Sir Peter of Frell, well, he was fairly nonexistent. Then of course there's Prince Charmont, whom she makes fast friends with. Of course, when Ella's Mother passes away, Sir Peter suddenly realizes that he has a daughter, and sends her to finishing school with two horrible wenches, Hattie, and Olive, who, unfortunately, have found out that Ella must obey everything that they say. Now Ella is searching for a way to escape from finishing school, break the curse, and live happily ever after with Prince Charmont, but all of that is easier to say, than do.I decided to pick up ELLA ENCHANTED when I heard about the movie starring Anne Hathaway. I was not in any way, shape, or form, disappointed in my decision to purchase this novel. Gail Carson Levine has created a classic novel in ELLA ENCHANTED, that will go down in history. She has put a new spin on the classic tale of CINDERELLA. A new spin that makes the story even more interesting than the original. Ella is an exciting character, whom is spirited, independent, and intelligent. It's a pleasure to get to read about all of the adventures she encounters, whether with royalty, ogres, trolls, wicked stepsisters, fairies, etc. Fans of the original tale of CINDERELLA will relish in the new twists and turns that Gail Carson Levine has spun into ELLA ENCHANTED. A must-have book for all ages.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"Ella Enchanted\\" by Gail Carson Levine is extremely well written, is humorous, and an altogether new Cinderella story!Ella is cursed with a 'gift' from the foolish fairy Lucinda. It is the gift of obedience which means that she would have to obey any command, even if it was a command to kill herself. With the help of her friends, Prince Char and Mandy, her nurse and cook (and something else), she struggles through a quest to find Lucinda to make her take her 'gift' away. She also has to tolerate her mean stepsisters Hattie and Olivia and their mother Dame Olga. But when her curse gets in the way of her love for Char, she has to find a way to break the curse all on her own.This book was wonderfully written! All the characters has such a nice and interesting personalities that you can't help but love every one of them, even Hattie and Olive, the stepsisters. The romance between Char and Ella is very cute, as my friend says. The story is very intriguing and you just have to finish reading it.Another book I like written by Gail Carson Levine is \\"The Two Princess of Bamarre,\\" which has a bit of a darker tone, but is still very interesting."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a wonderful fantasy book by Gail Carson Levine. She puts a twist to the classic fairy tale, Cinderella. I would recommend this book to girls of nine to sixteen years of age. This book has every kind of creature: goblins, elves giants ogres fairy-godmothers, you name it! With a dead mother a kind a kind but misunderstanding father, Ella has a hard time. But on top of that, she has been cursed from the moment she was born. She can't say no! This truly is a fairy tale. It has it's sad parts, but a happy ending, too. I like this book because I can relate to Ella. We are about the same age, and we think similarly. I also like the way the author makes it seem realistic. Ella is learning things ad the book goes on and she gets older. This is a good book for peeole who like Harry Potter books, because they both have magic and strange creatures and a main character that has a speciality. And for those who don't like Harry Potter, or haven't read it and don't plan on reading it, maybe this book will change your mind"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book and the Harry Potter books are my favourites ever! I'm 14 and I've read this book twice...it still is just as good as the first time I read it. I have never read a book that made me laugh so much. You end up feeling as if you know Ella and Char(the prince). I loved reading their letters back and forth to each other and the author describes things with so much detail that I couldn't help but picture every moment of the book. I still am thinking about reading it for a third time.It's an amazing twist of Cinderella. I didn't even realize it was a Cinderella type of story until 50 pages before the end because it's its own tale. If I had to choose between Harry Potter and this book, I really do think I'd choose this book.I could just picture Ella at the giants' wedding eating the gigantic cheese puff and the cheese oozing all over. LOL. You will seriously regret it if you do not read this book! I loved it and I know that the adults out there that read those romance novels(maybe you're one of them) would love it too! It has romance, it has excitement, battle, mystical creatures, and of course, it's topped off with the wicked stepmother and sisters.I started this book the first time as a one day read for silent reading in the 7th grade and I realized I couldn't put it down after the first 10 pages so I completely ditched the other book I was reading for it.

This story was an excellent variation of Cinderella and left me with a smile on my face. Ella Enchanted was the kind of book that leaves you wanting to read more and more of it. I personally found the story so grasping as if I wished I could be the main character for just one minute. In this book Ella discovers that even though she was put under the horrible curse that Lucinda the Fairy left her with at birth is restricting, she can with the help of her godmother and her very dear friend Prince Charmont that she can break free from the curse.

After Ellas father sends her to finishing school in a town far away from her home and her friends, she is forced to deal with the episodes of Hattie and Olive who have discovered her secret and are using it to their advantage. Ella goes through a lot but in the end?????????"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Retold fairytales, in which the characters and plots of traditional stories are explored in more depth, or told from an unexpected point-of-view, are a dime a dozen these days. But one stands out from the rest, and that is Gail Carson Levine's \\"Ella Enchanted\\", which takes the story of Cinderella and not only provides impetus for many of the nonsensical elements of the original tale, but builds a rich imaginary world around it and makes the titular character one of the best heroines to ever appear in YA novel.If you secretly always thought Cinderella was a bit of a pushover, sitting and crying by the fireplace when she could have been raiding her stepsisters' wardrobes and hitchhiking to the ball, then you'll be pleased to find that Levine gives us a perfect acceptable reason as to why her Ella is so slavishly obedient to her step-family: she's under a spell. When just a baby, an idiotic fairy called Lucinda blessed her with the \\"gift\\" of obedience, in which Ella is forced to obey every command she hears.A wish or a request has no effect on her, but a direct order, no matter how terrible it is, must be obeyed. Any attempts at disregarding it results in frightening nausea and dizziness. Levine takes this conceit and heightens the dramatic effect to its full potency. Ella's life is monopolized by her constant internal battle between obedience and defiance: \\"It was a tiresome game, but I had to play it or feel like a complete puppet.\\" Because she's naturally willful, she makes an art out of finding loopholes in the commands she receives. When someone demands that she fetch almonds from the pantry for a cake, she responds by bringing back just two. When someone orders her to take off their smelly shoes, she counteracts by throwing them out the window directly afterwards. Although there are moments of comedy involved in her plight, Levine never shies away from the fact that Ella is under a terrible curse; such as the horror that comes with the command to: \\"be happy to be blessed with such a lovely quality.\\"Ella nurses the dream of one day being free of the spell, but until then, we're with her as she struggles with her self-control, hoping that one day she'll either get Lucinda to remove the spell, or come across a command that's too heinous to obey. But what command could possibly be terrible enough for her to withstand the pain and break the spell through sheer force of will?Ella herself is a fantastic character, and tells her own story in first-person narrative (difficult to pull off without the narrator sounding too self-involved, but here it doesn't falter for a second). Ella is not perfect by any means, but she's intelligent and witty, gifted at languages, kind-hearted, and endearingly stubborn when it comes to dealing with her curse, clinging to her dignity even as she's forced into doing the most embarrassing things. One general thing does get on my nerves though, and that's the oft-repeated character trait among YA heroines: crippling clumsiness. Sure, we're all klutzy at that age, but the way the authors of YA novels write teenage girls, you'd think they couldn't perform the most basic physical tasks without skirting death itself. But where most YA fairytales/romances are dominated by the swooning damsel staring at the dreamy hero, Levine never looses sight of the fact that this story is all Ella's, culminating in a vindication of free will and inner strength.Like most fairytale heroines, Ella looses her mother; unlike most fairytale heroines, we the reader actually get a sense of the love between mother and daughter, and the pain that Ella feels when she looses her. Eleanor of Frell may only be around for one chapter, but in that time Levine makes us almost as sorry as Ella is to see her go. As the story goes on, the tale veers closer and closer to the familiar fairytale, and Levine finds amusing ways to insert the traditional Cinderella tropes, such as the glass slippers, the pumpkin carriage, and even the fact that Ella has small feet!Olga, Hattie and Olive (the evil stepmother and stepsisters, respectively) are rather cartoonish villains, being gluttonous, avaricious, and idiotic. Furthermore, Hattie snores, has smelly feet, is overweight, and hides a secret that exposes her to further ridicule. In short, they are grotesque, and although a part of me wishes that there was more to their characters, the greater part doesn't really care because it makes Ella's victory over them all the sweeter. And Levine compensates for this ugly-side of womankind by adding the characters of Mandy (Ella's fairy godmother) and Areida (a friend that she makes at school) as the more benevolent reflections of snotty Olga and vindictive Hattie.There are some hilarious one-liners, and Levine is a wonderful humourist, very much in keeping with J.K. Rowling's ability to dryly poke fun at the ridiculous. When Ella arrives at finishing school (where all the chamber-pots look like decorative cabbages) she is told: \\"it's never too late to start being finished.\\" When Hattie pens a letter to her mother concerning Ella's disappearance, she writes: \\"I hope she has come to no harm and has not been eaten by ogres or captured by bandits or caught fire or fallen into bad company, as I so often imagine.\\" And my personal favourite:\\"What a clever daughter I have.\\" Olga beamed at Hattie.\\"As clever as she is beautiful,\\" I said.They both began to answer me, and then stopped, confused.\\"Hattie isn't pretty,\\" said Olive.The centerpiece of the story though, belongs to the love that blossoms between Prince Charmont (usually known as \\"Char\\") and Ella. Basically, Char and Ella make up the best YA romance...ever. There, I said it. But it's true. Whereas other authors-that-shall-remain-nameless rely on strangling their lovers with the red string (that is, trying to convince us that their characters are in love because the author *says* that they're in love) Levine takes the time to build a relationship between Ella and Char that's based on more than just physical attraction, and it's all the more powerful for it. In the YA genre, in which love stories between a hero and heroine are about as deep as a paddling pool, these two are a godsend.Char and Ella learn about each other before they fall in love. They acknowledge each other's flaws as well as their strengths. They play silly games and share jokes. They converse via letters over an extended period of time, which include such reflective lines as this: \\"I trust you to see the good in me, but the bad I must make sure you don't overlook.\\" They love the big things about each other, like their kindness and honesty, but also the silly little things, like each other's freckles and a mutual enjoyment of sliding down banisters.And because it is a love that is based on friendship, respect, compatibility and intelligence, it makes the heartbreak twice as painful, and the declaration twice as rewarding. Just think, two people actually becoming *friends* before they become lovers! Who'd have thought?!The book was adapted into a rather awful movie not too long ago, which obliterated all the reasons why this book is so special, and replaced it with a story that relied too much on the popularity of \\"Shrek\\" (complete with a contemporary soundtrack, anachronistic elements and crude comedy) than the charm of Levine's story. Avoid it if you can, and hope that in later years it'll either be more faithfully adapted, or left well enough alone.As you can see, I've got nothing but good things to say about \\"Ella Enchanted,\\" though admittedly it may not appeal to the average boy-reader, being essentially a rather feminine coming-of-age tale in a fairytale kingdom full of fairies and elves. But for everyone else, this is a wonderful book, with a spritely, loveable lead, and a mature and healthy understanding of romantic relationships (and I'm pointing this out, because it's unfortunately so very, very rare). If your eight-to-twelve year old daughter holds up Ella of Frell as her literary role-model, then you've got yourself an awesome kid."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I thought the book would be about a girl,Ella, that was cursed by a fairy.

For example, if some tells her to go jump of the tallest structure in the world, she would do it, she can't help it because of her curse. Unfortunately, her mother dies early one in the story while she is only a teenager, from being extremely ill. At her funeral Ella meet the young, smart, talented, funny, and extremely dashing Prince Charmont (Prince Char for short) They both end up becoming friends, and a little more than that later on in the story, but let's not get in to that shall we.Sir Peter, Ella's father meets a lady after her mothers' funeral, named Dame Olga. He finds out that her two daughters will be going to finishing school. This is a place where girls get sent to become proper young ladies. Now Sir Peters wants to send Ella there too along with Dame Olga's daughters. Before leaving for school, Mandy the cook gives Ella two presents.

What a great spin on the Cinderella story.I was surprised at how different the book is from the movie - it follows the Cinderella story where the movie really doesn't - but both were excellent in their own ways. I often find that a book is so much better than its movie counterpart - especially when the moviemakers take too much dramatic license. HOWEVER, with Ella Enchanted this was not the case. I'm not sure the movie could have pulled off the Cinderella stuff the way the book did. But the movie managed to maintain the feel and premise of the book despite the numerous changes.This actually made it kind of refreshing when reading the book.

This book has it ALL! It has romance, sadness, adventure, and SO much more. Ella Enchanted is what i'd have to say the best book i've read in a long time! At first its really sad because her mother dies who she loves so very much and her awfully mean father has to take care of her which he doesn't do a very good job of either and she meets a prince and... well your gonna have to read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Imagine what it would be like if you had to do anything and everything anybody ever told you to do. No matter how silly and no matter how much you might not want to. Ella of Frell is in just such a predicament in &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot;. She was the recipient of the &quot;gift&quot; of obedience, irresistable and unquestioning obedience, from the foolish fairy Lucinda when she was a baby. Such a curse would be a burden even in benevolent surroundings and if kept secret, but after Ella's mother dies, her father sends her off to finishing school. Can she keep her secret from Hattie and Olive, the two disagreeable daughters of her father's friend, Dame Olga? If they discovered her secret, life could become miserable. And it's not an easy secret to keep in a boarding school. Worse yet, suppose her father decided to marry Dame Olga, making Hattie and Olive her stepsisters. Is there any way for Ella to escape such a mess and to avoid hurting her dearest friend, Prince Charmont?Gail Carson Levine has taken the old Cinderella fairy tale and given it a whole new depth and dimension. Cinderella becomes Ella, a very real young women with some serious issues to resolve. She also has to deal with giants, elves, and some hungry ogres who would love to have her for lunch. In the course of dealing with all this, Ella shows real courage, resilience, wit, and more than a little determination. This engaging book has won a bunch of awards, and deservedly so. Neither my daughter or I found it as engrossing as Harry Potter (our joint standard for five stars in this genre), but &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; is still a very good story for most older children and young teens. We rate it 4+ stars and definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Wonderful story overall!!! I'm sure everyone who likes the Harry Potter series will like this book because it contains magical things. It's about a girl named Ella who has the spell of obedience cast on her at birth. If she's orderd to chop her on head off she'll do it! It's a very exciting adventure and I hope lot's of other people will read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My sister brought this book home from the library one day from my summer reading list a couple of years back and told me to give it a try. I wasn't into books at that time and started reading it with a notion thinking I wouldn't like it. Boy was I wrong! When I started it I couldn't stop reading it. In fact I kept on renewing the book untill I read the book at least ten times. Then, afraid I would wear out the library's copy, I wanted to order my own copy in hardcover so I could read it another twenty times. Finally my sister came home with another book for me to read. I was so into 'Elle Enchanted' I didn't want to leave it behind to start a new book. But I tryed Patrica C. Wrede's 'Dealing with Dragons, Searching for Dragons, Calling on Dragons, Talking to Dragons- Enchanrted forest chronicles' anyhow. I loved these ones also! So if your stuck on what books to read after this one I highly reccomend these ones! Anyways, back to the subject. All I want to say is this is a wonderfully done novel. Gail Carson Levine adds a new and exciting twist to the Cinderella story. If you are a YA reader don't be discouraged by the 9-12 age level. I know tons of teens and adults who read and liked this book. If you treasured this book check out Gail Carson Levine's 'The Princess Tales Series' and her latest book 'The Two Princesses of Bammare'. This is a must read for any fantasy books fan!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I'd use more like an infinity of stars for this book. From the start, Ella Enchanted captured my imagination's Wild Side. Maybe it was the part when her curse is laid as a child, or when she runs away from finishing school to save a friend. But I know one thing for sure-Gail Levine puts Cinderella on the edge with this twisted form of it. Ella lives a royal life in a huge manor and turns from girl to woman.Ella as a child is given a 'gift' by the worlds most annoying fairy. Her gift is being obedient-which means living the worst life anyone could ever live-if someone says an order, she has to do it, no matter what-until they tell her to stop. So, if someone told her to kill herself-she'd have to do it. She travels all over through a magical world of a dream, it seems. But as soon as the prince asks her to marry him, she realizes she has to break his heart instead of ruining his chance of being king. In the end-it's a twisted way of happily ever after-and my imagination was sad to leave, and just slipped right off the horse!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is the best book I have ever read.

It is one of the most adventurous and exciting books I have ever read. This book has lots of details and the characters are really funny and interesting (especially Ella)."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I have read many, many books, and many, many different variety of books from the time I was 5 to the present. But none of them compare to the thrill, love, and beauty of Ella Enchanted. Ms. Levine catches the spirit of a sassy, spunky, brave girl which very few authors can do. It is a skill that few possess. I have lost count of how many times i have read this book at the tenth time. And yet this book still intrigues me in a way no other book can and will. No one can capture the story of Ella ever again as Ms. Levine did. This is a classic that I think every parent, child, adult, teenager, boy, girl, man, and woman should have in their library. No matter the age or gender. This will always be my favorite book as I grow and I will introduce it to my children and their children. The adventures, humor, and the love story will keep this book around for a long time. This is a novel, a novel with so much feeling in words that words itself cannot describe"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I picked up this book after hearing a good book report about it in school, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a twist on the old Cinderella story, but with more interesting characters. Like our spunky heroine Ella (CinderELLA), a lovable prince Char (Prince CHARming), and a foolish fairy Lucinda. It starts with Lucinda placing Ella under the powerful curse of obeying every command. What follows next are Ella's many adventures like battling orges and falling in love. Read this book, it's really good!

Read this book to find out!It's a Cinderella with that awesome twist! You will love it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is by far the greatest thing I have read since Harry Potter. Re-written from the Grimm Brother's 'Ashputtle' (more commonly known as Cinderella), this classic tale has been given some new twists. Even a four old would become wrapped up in such a wonderful tale of magic, friendship and a happily ever after!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ok, to start off, this book, in my opinion, was wonderful. It was thoroughly researched, because as anyone who has read the book would know, it doesn't take place nowadays. In a far away fairy-tale world, Ella was born. At birth, a fairy who meant well put a curse on her. The \\"blessing\\" from Lucinda the Fairy was obidience. What ever someone tells Ella to do, she must do; hence in danger at every moment. If you like fairy-tales, or mythical, magical, any type of stories in that genre, you will absolutely love this. It is, again, well researched, with a spin and an unpredictable plot. I think it is a must-read. Get it today!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Yeah, it's a kid's book. So what? I've recently been finding that much of children's fantasy is actually enjoyable by everyone, and this was no exception.Ella Enchanted is a retelling of Cinderella, although you might not figure that out in the first two-thirds of the book; it's only there that the story starts to compare. A fairy, Lucinda, who never follows the rules laid out for the fairy community, bestows a \\"gift\\" on Ella: she will always be obedient. She can bend commands so that her rebellious nature can play with them, but she must always follow them in some way, even if they weren't meant as commands. (An example: While running through the halls, she bumps into someone. The woman says, \\"Oh, go bump into someone else.\\" Ella sighs, knowing she then has to go bump into someone else.)Her father is a merchant, not home much; her mother dies when she is a child. When her father sends her off to finishing school, that's where the real adventure begins...This book is wonderfully written, and I couldn't put it down. I don't remember the last time I read a book start to finish in one day. Just go and read this; you'll be glad you did. :)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"For fairytale lovers, this is a must read! Basically it is a variation of Cinderella, but with so many unexpected twists and turns you don't recognize it without thinking about it.Gail Carson Levine does an exsquisite job of heaping all kinds of emotion into this book. You can't help but laugh at the jokes and cry during the goodbyes. There's the villains you love to hate and even suspense in some parts. The descriptions make you feel like you're really there - Ms. Levine describes the scenes with just the right amount of detail so you know exactly what is happenning but there's still room for you to use your imagination.If you want to read something totally different than anything you've ever tried before, read this book. It's a quick read - once you start it, you won't be able to put the book down. I'd reccomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was the best cinderella story i ever read!

When she was a child, a rather silly fairy named Lucinda placed an enchantment on her that made it so that Ella always had to obey an order.

When Ella grew up, her mother died and Ella found out that her fairy god mother was the castle cook who she loved very much. At her mother's funeral, Ella met Char, a boy who she liked a lot. Then Ella was sent to finishing school. On the way, one of the two girls who she was riding in the carriage with found out about Ella's spell. Her name was Hattie and was as mean as could be to Ella. All Ella wants to do is go home and be with her fairy god mother. Unfortunately, that probably won't happen."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved Ella Enchanted. It's my favorite retelling of the Cinderella story. I just wish it was a series or a longer book. When I came to the end, I was sad that it was over. I wanted to learn more about the fun loving Ella.The story starts when Ella was a baby and a fairy, Lucinda, put a curse on her or what Lucinda thought as a gift. The \\"gift\\" was obedience, which meant if someone(anyone even if they don't know) gave her a direct order she would have to do it no matter what it is. Ella grows up beliving she's cursed and had to be cursed. The only other people who know about her curse are her mother and their close friend and cook Mandy. Ella's mother orders Ella to never tell anyone about the curse after a expirence Ella had when she was little. This order and curse cause problems latter in Ella's life after her mother died. Mostly when Ella learns the Prince Charmont(she calls him Char)falls for her. Ella also lives in a fantasy land with ogres, gnomes,and centars. It's no ordinary story.An overall good book.

It has magic, great characters, really unusual creatures -- the giants, ogres, elves, fairies, and centaurs are such original takes on creatures you see in other fairy tales.I thought the premise was really good. I was aghast that poor Ella has to obey everybody and everything she is commanded to do! I remember when she had to kiss a parrot, and the parrot kept flying away, and she still had to try to kiss it.The story kept me wanting to read more.

While the horrors Franco created are not surprising, the despicable treatment the French afforded their guests and their unwillingness to recognize -- even today -- what they participated in are astounding. And while there were obviously political as well as humanitarian motives behind it, the kindness Mexican President Lazaro Cardenas and his ambassador in France showed towards the exiles is heartening and makes for a story worth learning.There are unfortunately a few important omissions from the book. Soler does not explain Arcadi's backstory, which is obviously crucial to the outcome of the book. He is also sketchy on why the plot at the end fails to kill Franco. Both of these definitely stem from the fact that even Soler, with his good investigative skills, couldn't figure this out. But these points notwithstanding, Soler's story is a compelling and worthwhile read.Soler cuenta una historia fascinante e iluminante del exilio de los republicanos de la espa&ntilde;a franquista. Aunque los horrores que hizo Franco no son sorprendentes, el tratamiento odioso que les dio los franceses a sus hu&eacute;spedes y su rechazo de reconocer -- hasta hoy -- en lo que participaron son pasmosos. Y aunque fue causado por motivos pol&iacute;ticos adem&aacute;s de los humanitarios, la amabilidad que el presidente de M&eacute;xico L&aacute;zaro C&aacute;rdenas y su embajador en francia les ense&ntilde;o es alentadora y hace una historia que vale la pena aprender.Desafortunadamente, hay unas omisiones importantes del libro. Soler no explica la historia antecedente de Arcadi, que es obviamente crucial al resultado del libro. Tambi&eacute;n no explica bien porque el complot al fin fall&oacute; a matar a Franco. Las dos obviamente provienen del hecho que hasta Soler, con sus buenas habilidades investigativas, no lo pudo determinar. Pero sin embargo de estos puntos, la historia de Soler es irresistible y vale la pena leerla."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"The main theme of this charming novel is how important it is to understand the irretrievable passage of time and to savor the good times that come along. The narrator tells the story of an enchanted summer he spent in Cornwall uncovering an ancient painting in a country church. He looks back upon this time (1920) as one of the most wonderful, important periods of his life. He meets several villagers who make an indelible impression upon him and pleas with us to appreciate our own little \\"months in the country\\"--those days when things are going well.

It is, however, a wonderful book, made into a decent movie about 6 years ago, I believe.It tells the story of Tom Birkin, recently returned from WW I, who goes to the town of Oxgodby to restore a medieval wall-painting in an old church. Over the course of his time there, he gets absorbed into the life of the town, falls in love, learns (and reveals) something about the nature of art, and the healing power of both art and love.That makes it sound as if the book's some sort of mushy new-age blather, and it's not at all. It's a short and profoundly entertaining novel. I would have loved to have been assigned this in a high-school english class, because (1) Carr's vocabulary is remarkable, and the occasional strange words he uses are worth looking up (e.g., &quot;sneck&quot;), and (2) it has a lot of the sort of structure that one is forced to write about in English classes (&quot;contrast the relationship between Birkin and his work with that between Moon and his...&quot;) but which in this book actually contributed something to the story -- there are multiple parallel threads in the book, and their inteweaving makes it richer.

My only objection is that it was too short!"},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"This is one of those works of art that falls into a category of its own.

This is a novel in which nothing extraordinary happens, but full lifes interact moving people closer (or father) from themselves, friendships, loves and human understanding.The narrator is a disfigured veteran of World War I. His wife has left him; his employer retired making this his first job as a self-employed professional. His life is contrasted with that of another veteran hired to find an ancient grave. The friendship of the veterans is the first step in reconnecting to the world. Along the way, a vicar and his wife, the family of the stationmaster, an organist, a dying girl all make their way into and effect the narrator's life.The author's writing style fits perfectly with the story, creating a literary gem worthy of your attention."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"A month in the country, the movie which starred Colin Firth and Kenneth Branagh was shown in 1987, but as usual, the book is better than the movie.Lovely and beautiful in its simplicity, the tale of two great war survivors healing their battle-scarred minds in the village of Oxgodby is one of my favourite novel.Watching the tape recently, I was strucked by the difference between the Birkin in the movie and that of the book. The Birkin in the movie is one-dimensional and the people around him, save Alice Keach is unpleasant. To exorcise this image of the Birkin of the movie, I re-read the book again and was immensely pleased at the Birkin of the novel, alive and likeable but certainly not flawless. The Alice Keach of the world would definitely falls head over heel for him.The beauty of the novel is further enhanced by the portrayal of the healing process in Birkin's nightmarish experiences as a war veteran. He and Moon are not your typical citizens from a nation of victims, where crisis counsellors would intervene and encourage those ceaseless and endless whinings whenever fate deal them a bad hand, instead they resolved the inner demons through themselves, in their own unique way."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"This is the only book that I have ever owned which I wore out reading it.

There is little to add save, perhaps, an English perspective. At first glance this book is an exquisite evocation of a lost England, a lost world. But I wouldn't want the presumably mainly American readership of this site to think that it is all Merchant-Ivory daydream material. Read this book and you will breathe in a little of a slow summer evening air in a village where the past is so palpable it almost overpowers the present and yet where life as we know it is lived. I can't describe it with due justice, but this book captures a hint of the multi-layered past and present that makes up rural England, together with the way in which that past sometimes heals the present. I recognise the world this book describes. I grew up there."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"\\"A month in the Country\\" is a literary gem. A unique book which gathers in its 135 pages a wonderful, well told story full of poetry. A twitchy, unhappy and shellshocked veteran of WW I, Tom Birkin, arrives in Oxgodby, a village in Yorkshire, hired by the Vicar, to restore a mural painting in the local church. In the time it takes him to delicately uncover and shed light on what was the work of a medieval artist, Burkin heals himself, assisted by the discovery of love, friendship and a cast of wonderful but fundamentally flawed characters. He comes to terms with his past and is prepared for what appears to be a bittersweet future. Carr writes with a light touch while not superficial; subtle but clearly not tentative. Included are interesting observations of art, lyric descriptions of a glorious English summer and some hilarious moments in his relations with some of the villagers. He brings us along a story that unfolds like flowers slowly opening to the sun, offering many precious moments which linger in you mind and tug at your heart. Like many, finishing a book always makes me sad but in this particular case, I had not only read some extraordinary literature, I was also being cut me off from a group of people that had become my friends and I wanted to know more about them."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"If you have seen the movie you will love the book.If you have read the book then you will love the movie.1920 England has slowly climbed out of the Great War and many are still finding their way in the aftermath of it all.Tom Birkin is an art restorationist who is called to the North English town of Oxgodby in order to uncover a 500 year old painting in the the nave of the village Church.There he is met with the most unusual likeable and unlikeable characters who are there to help,hinder or confuse Birkin during the hot summer months as he tirelessly and obsessively works to reveal a Judgment Scene that will play as the key to unlock his troubled heart and soul.J.L Carr's book is extremely intimate and personal,told more from the thoughts and observations of Birkin than dialogue from supporting characters.The 1987 film version is incredibly accurate and is extremely good in bringing out the subtleties of the book.I highly recommend both."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"I had to buy this book for my english class and i decided to choose Goodwill seller.

I am happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"The blurb on the back cover calls _A Month in the County__ \\"a deeply charged, poetic novel.\\" But what is a \`poetic novel'? In truth, it is mostly a phrase thrown about to give rather generic works a (false) claim of literariness. But, here, the phrase has great merit, especially if, with that phrase, you mean, simply, the poetic idea of \`no word not necessary to the poem.' Yes, Carr's language is graceful, often mellifluous. It is a British work, and carries with it the vocabulary of the world of Oxgodby, the locale of the book. But what truly marks the book as poetic is more its sparcity. Not in the sense of being bare bones, but in the sense of saying only that which _needs_ to be said, using only those words that serve the purpose of writing an aesthetic, literary work. And with those few words generating a greater ideation than one finds in most of the NY Times bestseller list.And it would be very, very easy to rewrite _A Month in the Country_ into a generic, four hundred page, Nicholas Sparks-like, disposable book - and without having to change an iota of the story. In fact, for the size of the book, the story is quite dense. There is more than sufficient material for translation into mass market consumption. But Carr pares the elements of the story down to its elegant essentials. What would be forty pages in the hands of such as Ann Patchett is here but four paragraphs. And yet the work is exponentially the better for it. For this is not a story, it is book. It is, to permit the conceit, a poem. It is about the experiences over a summer (and of the past and the future), not only of the main character, but of those around him, some of whom are part and parcel of the lands around Oxgodby, some of whom are not. But it is also about . . . or I should it is far more accurately about the ideas that are generated through the interplay of those experiences. No simplistic ducks in a row writing, here: in fact, the last two paragraphs create wholly in themselves quite a expansion of ideational complexity of the work.And in such this is a book that demands to be re-read. In fact, it is a book that demands to be read in one sitting, on one afternoon (it is only a hundred and thirty odd pages, and not that dense a typesetting), cogitated upon, and read again. And then put up not back into its slot upon the shelf, but somewhere where you will prompted to pick up again a few weeks later. As said, this is not a disposable bestseller. This is something to take into yourself, to breathe in, to savor and contemplate, a bottle of fine wine whose every glass offers something deeper of itself. But like a fine wine something that needs to be sipped, to be treated delicately, to be attended to. Give it the thought it deserves, and it will give you a spirited pleasure of equal - and greater - measure.An absolute must."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"One of those books that leaves you with a sense of loss when finished, wishing the author had written a sequel, but knowing there should be no sequel (sort of the point of the story, really). A short fiction, seemingly not about much, but an engaging writing style; and several surprises crop up during the short time the narrator spends in Oxgodby, working on restoration of a medieval chancel painting. As you get into the feel of the period (1920 village/rural northern England), you begin to see what has disappeared, for better or for worse, and you realize the surprises in the story really shouldn't have been surprising at all."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"A real fan wants to know everything about her/his idol.

Nothing much happens and the English country atmosphere is not nearly as strongly evoked as in Elizabeth Goudge's books about recovering from war trauma eg \\"Pilgrim's Inn'."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"This is a very well written, if peculiar little book. I did not find it so engrossing as some of your other reviewers, nor so fulfilling."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"J. L. Carr's 'A Month In The Country' (1980), which is set in the 1920s, is the story of Tom Birkin, a budding restorer who accepts a job uncovering a church mural in a small Yorkshire village, a village predictably populated by greenhorns, cranks, and eccentrics of all stripes and colors. What is immediately apparent is that the novel is not a product of the earlier era in which it is set, nor is it an attempt to recreate the style of the period.Though Carr attempts high British humor in the grand 20th century tradition of P. G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Stevie Smith, Denton Welch, and Muriel Spark, much of what is supposed to be funny throughout the novel is in fact only obvious, smug, and not nearly as intelligent or crisp as Carr apparently believes it to be. Thus, when Birkin's employer warns him about a scythe that hangs in the outdoor privy, Birkin speculates whether \\"it was the loss of life or only manhood he was concerned about,\\" and most of the attempted humor continues at about this level.A 'Month In The Country' might have been saved by a compelling plot or theme, or simply a collection of perceptive insights uniquely expressed, but none of these elements are present, and so what little story there is merely plods cutely along. Whether is it is Carr himself, or merely Tom Birkin, who is so self-satisfied is difficult to say; either way, the combination of the anemic first person narrative and the idiosyncratic attempts at humor, in which the author indulges himself at every turn, sink the book quickly."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"at first i thought this book had been written in the 20's; i was surprised when finishing it to find the publication date of 1980 (it was even a booker shortlist). the simple story of a WW I vet coming to some peace with himself while restoring an ancient church painting has more to it than it first appears. sexual tension, barely repressed rage and a historical mystery all lock together at the end. carr has lovingly created a small countryside world full of noble, if flawed people who express more by what they don't say or do than through their actions. while possibly hard to find (my copy was a folio society edition; beautifully bound with woodcut illustrations) it's worth tracking down."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"It is a few years after World War I. A young artist sufferingfrom post traumatic syndrome(shellshock) effects of his wartime experiences comes to a small English village to restore a medieval wall mural in an Anglican church. Another veteran has been commissioned by a dead woman's executor to search near the same church for the body of her ancester who was not buried in the consecrated church cemetary.What happens to these two men and how they are brought to resolution, love, and healing through their tasks and interaction with each other and the people surrounding them makes for a touching story. James Lloyd Carr is excellent in his description of intricate details, as well as in his unraveling of an exceptionally original plot, to reaching one's deepest feelings of sadness about experiences of unrequited and unfulfilled love, and finally to the revealing of the mural behind the old paint and the secret of the original artist himself.Things slow down at times and we do wonder where it is all going, but patience wins the day and we are brought to the brink of both pathos and joy. It is well worth making it through a few dull pages.I thought the movie flowed better than the book. Colin Firth plays the wounded artist, Kenneth Braughan is the one looking for the bones, and a very young Natasha Richardson is the wife of the vicar."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"Sometimes it is good to revisit a favourite novel or to watch again a film that always brings you pleasure.J. L. Carr's exquisitely written novella A Month in the Country was first brought to my attention in 1987 when I saw the film adaptation at the cinema in London. The film affected me so profoundly that I went out the following day to buy the book and what immediately struck me was the fact that there were only one hundred and five pages to it. The concise nature of this story does not reflect upon the depth of the prose and, in fact, the author imbues every line with description and dialogue so wonderfully rich that the length of the work is irrelevant.The book is rich with characters and atmosphere. There is a gentle, bucolic peacefulness and a kind of restrained beauty as the idyllic summer unfolds. But it is the final scene (both in the film and the novel, although they are treated differently) that never fails to take my breath away.Carr writes: \`We can ask and ask but we can't have again what once seemed ours forever - the way things looked, that church alone in the fields, a bed on a belfry floor, a remembered voice, a loved face. They've gone and you can only wait for the pain to pass. All this happened so long ago. And I never returned, never wrote, never met anyone who might have given me news of Oxgodby. So, in memory, it stays as I left it, a sealed room furnished by the past, airless, still, ink long dry on a put-down pen. But this was something I knew nothing of as I lifted the loop and set off across the meadow.'This passage never fails to tug at my heart; the acknowledgement that there are certain moments in time that have passed and will never again be recaptured. It is one of the very few pieces of fiction that never fails to blur my vision by the final line and, for one so cynical, that is no mean feat.If you have never read this spellbinding analysis of love and art then I suggest you buy a copy immediately. This beautifully crafted and understated story of ordinary people, places and experiences is a treasure to be revisited time and time again."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"This is a delightful book -- an offbeat story line, illuminated by beautiful writing, excellent characterizations, and an intriguing denouement.A World War I vet travels to a small English village in the 1920's to restore an old painting on a church ceiling. You might think there wasn't much of a story here, but the interweaving of a half dozen lives, and the lives of more than few dear departed, frame the several months of intricate and skilled restoration of the painting contrasted with a kindred soul conducting a search for a particular grave. These concurrent activities lead to the eventual unravelling of who those mysterious faces in the painting are and how they relate to who is buried in the church yard.Carr very deftly creates a picture of his characters and their quirks - the painter's facial tic, a souvenir of being an infantry runner in no man's land (enough to give anyone a tic!)-is described in a manner such that you can practically see his eye twitch. And the inner thoughts, urges, and dreams of the preacher's wife, locked in what would, to most people, seem a hopeless, dreary marriage are opened to our view. But the crowning glory of the book is just its sparkling, gorgeous prose throughout.I found this book at a bed and breakfast. I had finished only about a third of it by the time we left, so I immediately tracked down a copy (it's part of the New York Times Classic series). It includes a fascinating narrative by a contemporary British writer who vied with Carr for a writing prize (and won!), and a short history of Carr's career, outlining an enterprising talent who did many things other than write."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"This wonderful book proves that a great book can be short. I have read the book many times, often in an afternoon, and I'm always completely taken into Carr's world. Birkin's uncovering of the mural and his own heart never fails to move me, and the love story is something exquisite and unique. I am very excited that it has been re-issued and hope that many more readers will discover it in future."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"You wont read a better piece of fiction in as slim a volume as this one. JL Carr captures and enthralls the reader from the minute Tom Birkin steps off the train until he leaves Oxgodby. I have read most of the NYR Classics like A High Wind in Jamica and Hindoo Holiday, but this work is unique. A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"Like many others, I enjoyed this novella and will undoubtedly read it again. It is a slender book--both in length and in substance--but the lyrical quality of Carr's prose enhances a simple and charming \\"old-fashioned\\" story.Tom Birkin returns from the First World War with a shattered body and to a shattered marriage. He spends a summer in a small church in a Yorkshire village and rescues a mural that had been covered by hundreds of years of paint and grime and had only recently been detected by the locals. As he restores the painting, he finds himself equally renewed, especially as several of the villagers adopt him as one of their own. There are a couple of small surprises concerning one of the friends he makes and the painting itself, but for the most part the story is like a leisurely vacation in the English countryside.It\`s fair to compare this story to a Merchant-Ivory production (but without the lush landscapes). A period piece written in 1980, it feels like (as one reader points out) it could have been written in the 1920s. That is both the book's accomplishment and its weakness: although Carr impressively reproduces the tone of the era and its people, I couldn't help but compare his book to novels by, say, E. M. Forster (whose writing his occasionally resembles) or D. H. Lawrence and reflect that Carr just can't quite fill their shoes. (In his excellent introduction, Michael Holroyd reminds us that Carr initially wanted to invoke the work of Thomas Hardy, but, like Holroyd, I couldn't detect much of a likeness beyond the superficial.) Nevertheless, \\"A Month in the Country\\" is a worthwhile read, especially if you approach the book with reduced expectations."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"The book tells the story of how Tom Birkin, a veteran of the Great War, spends a summer in the little town of Oxgodby in Yorkshire to restore a painting in the medieval church. It is a very happy time for him, but at the same time the book is suffused with a deep, quiet sadness over how nothing is permanent and that every moment of happiness is fleeting and can never be entirely revisited, only remembered."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"One of those books that leaves you with a sense of loss when finished, wishing the author had written a sequel, but knowing there should be no sequel (sort of the point of the story, really).

As he slowly reveals the forgotten images, he builds friendships and connections with the people in the town, as well as the medieval artist who originally painted the fresco. Another veteran of the war, a young man named Moon, is hired to find a lost grave outside of the church's cemetery. A fast friendship is made between the two men as they both work to uncover something long lost while trying to recover themselves from the brutality they survived.As Birkin peels and scrapes away the layers of plaster on the church's wall, summer blooms and flows through the town. Carr's descriptions of a singular and glorious summer are incredibly evocative, and it was easy for me to feel like I was there with Birkin, Moon, and the others, feeling the sun on my back, hearing the breeze shush through the trees, smelling the ripeness of the world.The richness of the book rests not only on its descriptions, though. Recovery, restoration, longing, memory, and loss are all explored alongside the gorgeous prose. Carr weaves thought and emotion through the narrative effortlessly. There's an honesty in the book, one that keeps true to the splendidness of that one summer, as well as the yearning and ache that the narrator feels as he reflects on those months more than sixty years later.A short, but beautiful book that draws in the reader and invites them to relish every word."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"I dote on this book.

The middle ages did not end in a particular year with the populace of Europe awaking to the Renaissance the next, and so on with subsequent ages.This thought came to mind as I read this evocative, adagio-like story. The world of the small country village of Oxgodby in the summer of 1920, where Tom Birkin is called up to a church to restore a medieval wall painting, is one that time seems to have passed by. Existing in a time that is worlds away from the civilization of urban life, it was a bit like being in a different era, perhaps one more romantic than medieval.The task he undertakes was one deeded in the will of an eccentric and recently-deceased gentrywoman, Miss Hebron. The painting is barely visible, covered by seemingly indelible layers of grime, lime-wash, plaster, and stove smoke - just as the village is sheltered from the modern world and Birkin's quarters are more rustic yet just as his heart is neglected. He arrives in Oxgodby with searing memories of World War I, a facial twitch from exposure to gas at the Battle of Passchendeale, and an ego shattered by a flighty, vindictive wife who remains in London with a lover.The story develops at a deliberate pace and Birkin slowly begins to recover, meets villagers, completes his task. There is the task itself, dinners with the Ellerbecks, Birkin's own thoughtful meditations and dreams that slowly force the pain of the war to dissipate into the more distant past, if not to disappear. The impressive aspect to the novella is its length, which suits the subject well, and the levels of meaning - only one of which is the way memory and time mesh inside and outside of young Tom Birkin.\\"We can ask and ask but we can't have again what once seemed ours forever -- the way things looked, that church alone in the fields, a bed on the belfry floor, a remembered voice, the touch of a hand, a loved face. They've gone and you can only wait for the pain to pass.\\" (p 135)A Month in the Country is short enough that the reader can easily take in the whole tale or stop to delve into its layers, and there behold: evocations of beauty, the subtle portrait of Birkin's shell shock, and the sense of loss as Birkin looks across decades at a time when he was happy. It was a time that he was sheltered and surfeited with the power of a world from another age."},{"Title":"A month in the country","review":"Possibly one of finest books I've read in years. J.L.

A couple who, on the outside, don't seem to belong together, but their hearts understood each other's pain long before they recognized it for themselves. I couldn't put this story down, I wanted to know if Ms. Lee would settle for the same old ending and the same old resolution. She didn't. I was entranced.The second story, Ironheart, took longer to get into. It was a four and a half star story because the development of the relationship between beautiful Mouse and fantastic Gideon took a while before I felt a real connection. Once there though, Gideon proved himself to be a true ero; not by solving Sara's problems or killing the bad guy, but by understanding her and bettering himself for her. The dramatic tension in this one wasn't as high, but the intimacy Ms. Lee used to build the emotional tension was compelling. Ironheart was a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Conard County Homecoming","review":"If you haven't read Rachael Lee's Conard County books this is a great way to introduce yourself to one of the best romantic series available. In this reissue &quot;Homecoming&quot;, you have &quot;Miss Emmaline and the Archangel,&quot; as well as &quot;Ironheart.&quot; You need to read them in order and be introduced to the characters of the area. I've always thought the story between Emmaline Conard and Gabe Dalton was one of Ms. Lee's best. The brooding hero is the soul of Gabe and Emmaline's love. While in &quot;Ironhart&quot; Sara Yates and Gideon have a strong relationship based on a past secret. Both are great reads for anyone who hasn't yet been introduced to this series. You'll have to find the rest and indulge your romantic soul in the life and loves of the people who live in Conard County. Then you'll say you want more!!!"},{"Title":"Conard County Homecoming","review":"This is one of those marvelously gluttonous delights from Silhouette Books, a DOUBLE novel in 1 volume. There are two complete romance novels in one cover, and they are both great romances from Rachel Lee's classical and hugely popular Conard County series of Western Romances set in Wyoming. This is a re-release of two novels which Ms. Lee wrote in 1993.The two novels are \\"Miss Emmaline and The Archangel\\" and \\"Ironheart.\\" If you have never read any of Rachel Lee's Conard County romance novels, this is a great place to start and you have so much to enjoy here with two full novels.\\"Miss Emmaline and The Archangel\\" is a story of two troubles souls with a painful past who are tossed together one evening, and through a series of events, come to love each other and to push past their wounds enough to truly dare to love each other. The mood is brooding and nearly Gothic, evocative of Jane Eyre.\\"Ironheart\\" introduces the conflict of racial prejudice and interracial love and families, each with a few things they want to hide. \\"Ironheart\\" is definitely a tale of modern love with our heroine being a Conard County Deputy Sheriff.Interwoven through both, the reader is introduced to a number of the Conard County cast of favorites: Jeff Cumberland (who finds love inThe Catch of Conard County (World's Most Eligible Bachelors), Sheriff Nate, and Micah.If you read fast, you might be able to get through both in one delightful weekend!"},{"Title":"Our Chosen Faith: An Introduction to Unitarian Universalism","review":"Unitarian Universalism offers seekers a map to find truth and meaning in their lives.

Some portions focus on the historical and doctrinal roots, while others draw on the experiences of the authors (who are both UU ministers) as well as contemporary understandings and practices of the UU faith.Good: This is an easy read and for a short volume seems to cover all the basics of UU well. The experiences of the authors are particularly helpful. A good example is that of Buehrens' marriage to an Episcopal priest. He says, &quot;The truth is that most of our debates are rather more mundane: the unholy trinity of checkbook, chores, and children, not the holy one.&quot;Bad: The authors sometimes contradict themselves by proclaiming the virtues of being all-inclusive, and then highlighting their perceived inadequacies of orthodox Christian understandings. For example, Church writes that &quot;[James Freeman] Clarke and [Jenkin Lloyd] Jones helped to expand Unitarianism beyond a liberal Christian faith to a faith that might best be described not as non-Christian, but as more than Christian.&quot; To most of us in other religions, Christian or otherwise, the UU faith is not &quot;more than&quot; anything but a hodge-podge collection of bits and pieces that fails to embrace the fullness of any of the world's religions. Opinion: A quote from William Schulz in the introduction sums up the essence of Unitarian Universalism: &quot;Born Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Muslim, or into a secular or 'mixed' household, when it came time for us to affiliate with a religious institution we sought one that fit our own thinking, not one that imposed its thinking on us.&quot; To those of us who view religious discipleship as letting go of our own ways of thinking in order to grow closer to God, this view is inadequate. It does not do us well to create a god in our own image."},{"Title":"Hebrew and English dictionary, Biblical and Rabbinical,: Containing Hebrew and Chaldee roots of the Old Testament post-biblical writings (Welae's educational series)","review":"Best in its class.

I've begun going through the old classics (Ginger Lacey -- Fighter Pilot, Nine Lives, Thunderbolt!, Reach for the Sky) once again after a gap of about 25 years and what strikes me right away is how well Clostermann writes. There is none of the tired, cliche-riddled \\"On August 15th I got up, had tea and was soon in the air ready to do my very best to beat the enemy\\" approach you find in some of the books.With Clostermann you know exactly what it is like to be woken at 4 am on a freezing morning, gulp down an uninspiring breakfast and then struggle into your cockpit, realising you could easily be dead in less than an hour. He is dog tired pretty much all the time and soon is vomiting every time the klaxon sounds to scramble the pilots. The vivid descriptions means you are with him as he stamps on the rudder bar to avoid enemy fire and looks into the cockpit of the enemy plane as it flashes by. You shudder with him as a 20 mm cannon shell rips into the armour plate behind his shoulders and hold your breath as he flies through the solid wall of German anti-aircraft gun fire that claimed so many of his colleagues. The malevolent English Channel waits to swallow those with damaged planes who are stuggling to get back to base.The author is also exceedingly good at portraying what it is actually like to fly these machines. After a period of rest he is taken off the versatile manoeuvrable Spitfires and transferred to a squadron that operates the monstrously heavy Tempest aircraft that are used for ground attacks. The Tempest is little more than a flying brick with a massive engine and you live every second of Clostermann's struggles on his first flight as he battles to prevent the plane from smashing into the ground. And all along, death is never far away. Colleagues and friends are killed in action or in accidents every few pages.A couple of minor points -- the translation, while generally pretty good, can be patchy. On several occasions the author writes \\"I was creased\\", which makes little sense. In fact, I imagine he initially wrote the French word \\"creus&eacute;\\", which means exhausted. Also, some reviewers have criticised Clostermann for allegedly anti-American sentiment. This I think comes from two parts of the book, firstly when he expresses anger when U.S. pilots and anti-aircraft gunners shoot down several allied planes without bothering to make sure first who they're firing at. Secondly, he is unhappy the Americans decided to carpet bomb a number of French cities and towns before and during the Normandy campaign without apparently taking the time to identify precise targets. A lot of civilians died in these attacks. Clostermann is French. So you can perhaps see why he was upset.In short, though, this is a classic work of its type."},{"Title":"The big show (Wings of war)","review":"...buying this book.

I have the older edition. The new reprint offers more material and I would reccomend it. What I like about Clostermann's story is his combat in the aftermath of D Day and the winter of '44-'45. His D Day entries are in direct contrast to every aviation history you've read which will tell you the Luftwaffe was non existent during the August and September ground action. When he gets his canopy blown out by a FW190 cannon shell at 7,000 feet or so in a swirling twisting dogfight, it takes your breath right out of you. He tells you how his feet slip on the rudder bar because he's sweating so much with fear. He describes what it's like to hunt Me 262's that are returning to their base in dirty weather, nearly invisible in the dusk twilight. And you get the unvarnished anguish/relief he feels at the end of the war when the RAF summarily dismisses him from service.It doesn't get any better than this.

Highly recommended.My only complaint, and what robbed the book of a fifth star in my humble opinion, is that Clostermann's transparent anti-American agenda is pursued at every turn, without any perspective or sense of balance. For example (a) his (arguably fair) criticism of French civilian deaths at the hands of American bombers is devoid of any similar reference to Bomber Command's exploits in the intentional area bombing of German civilians; (b) friendly fire events actually appear at every turn in his narrative, but the Americans are singled out for special criticism on that point, for no apparent reason other than bias; and (c) Clostermann claims at one point, without any evidentiary basis whatsoever, that a directive about \\"proper\\" targets in the theater was ignored only by the Americans.Indeed, at times one detects Clostermann's generic distaste even for some of the Brits in the RAF! I was left wondering whether Clostermann was \\"projecting\\" in an effort to avoid discussion of the frankly shameful conduct of so many Frenchmen during the war.But all that is, in the end, a small bone to pick. Certainly Clostermann himself was not among the group of disgraced Frenchmen. His devotion to duty, skill, and courage -- characteristics shared by many of the Free French pilots -- can't be doubted. Moreover, his frank discussions of his own fear, and the effects on his flying, give this narrative an authentic feel. This is a very good book."},{"Title":"The big show (Wings of war)","review":"This book is a page turner. It's amazingly exciting and you will feel like you're into the cockpit of Spitfires and, later, Tempests. But some strong issues arise...First of all, the number of victories by Clostermann. He says he had 33. RAF official claims put him with \\"only\\" eleven! A great, very GREAT discrepancy;Second, a lot of facts are simply untrue. He says, about Walter Nowotny's death, that the German ace was a long foe of him. Goosh, ALL of Nowotny's victories were obtained on the Eastern Front, save one or two pairs, while he was flying an experimental Me-262 unit in Western Europe! Also, he said that a pilot of his Wing shot down Nowotny, when it was Mustangs.This new hard cover version is definitive, and Clostermann himself confess that he made a lot of mistakes, saying that he did not have the means of research to be totally correct at the time. He also attributes the problem concerning number of kills to the fact that he served in a lot of squadrons in just three months (3, 56 and 274). Strangely mising even in this new edition, was the mission when he was shot down into the Channel.It seems that, after losing Mouchotte and adding this to some previous discipline problems, the mood in 341 Alsace Squadron became very bad for Clostermann and that was the reason they sent him to 602.Also, there are some strange tales that Clostermann's ego was enormous and some strange tales of him filling claims when he had not even fired his guns.Anyway, Clostermann passed away in 2006 and his memoirs remain an unforgettable treasure of war literature."},{"Title":"The big show (Wings of war)","review":"I'm glad to see that Clostermann's book is re-printed, as my old Ballantine edition is worn thin.If you want in-the-cockpit action, you'll find little to rival this memoir, which was compiled from Clostermann's letters to his father during the war. Clostermann began on Spitfire V's, when the going was tough; he ended in Tempests, when the going was even tougher!Forgive Clostermann's ongoing error in referring to FW-190D's as Ta-152's: it's likely that he used the same terminology as the intelligence services.I'm fifty.

This is the first time that it has been presented in its entirety and the additions only increase the book's value as a window into the world of the combat aviator.The book was originally written shortly after the war and as a result there is an immediacy about it that is, at times, electrifying. It was an international best seller and deservedly so, highlighting the career of a fighter pilot who started flying combat on Spitfires and ended up in Tempests. For many years it was the only book that dealt with combat action in the Tempest, a beautiful and powerful warplane introduced late in the war to combat the V1 and the new German jets. The original edition has some minor errors in it, but the descriptions of the missions were just outstanding! The swirl of the dogfights, the dives into flak, dealing with zero visibility weather, the victories recounted in detail, the losses of friends recalled with a warrior's stoicism, this fine book set a standard that has only been approached by other works.As V. M. Yeates WINGED VICTORY was the finest First World War fighter pilot book, THE BIG SHOW is the second war's. Yeates told his story as a novel based on his experiences as a Sopwith Camel pilot on the Western Front, but the latter book, while reading like a novel, has the extra advantage of being true.Pierre Clostermann wrote two other books, but his first book was his finest and cannot be recommended highly enough.

Full of action and a 'vital elan' that was unfortunately in short supply among Frenchmen in the 30's and 40's. Some drawbacks to the book are an uneccessary snobbish attitude towards the Americans and Brits as well as minimizing of some of his own failures (the most critical being the lack of air discipline that led him to fail to support his wingman, Mouchette, that led to his companion's death).

Having said that the Patriotic American in me really got angry as I read his constant bashing of the American airmen who fought the same enemy, many who did not get to return home as Mr. Closterman did. As I read it Mr. Closterman seemed to give the impression the American Airmen were just in the way and would have served the war effort better keeping thier planes on the ground. As I read the many insults he writes about my fellow Americans who died helping to Liberate his country I could not help but recount the many times I have read how his own countrymen threw down thier weapons and ran from the German Army! What I read was not your typical friendly friction between services that always exist but outrite hatred and complete disrespect.

A book with that sort of lasting influence could hardly be \\"obsolete,\\" as another reader suggested.Actually, some of Tiger's suggestions seem fresh and relevant, especially in light of recent trends that take another look at long buried, \\"dangerous\\" ideas like \\"Human Universals.\\" (Notably referenced in Steven Pinker's excellentThe Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature)Current thinking on chimpanzee social structure is irrelevant to the ideas presented in this book.The key idea is here is that men seem to gain some sort of sense of well-being from male-male bonding and that male bonding seems to center around aggression (which Tiger defines broadly, not only in terms of violence but of seeking mastery of something--where violence is but one possible outcome of aggression). That aggression can be real or simulated. So this idea, in an age where cooperative online gaming (a new but highly male interest), ESPN, UFC and the movie 300 are all such popular points of reference for young , straight men, it actually seems that Tiger was actually more correct than he wished to be. Male bonding, and aggression, ARE part of human nature, and they can't necessarily be suppressed or rendered impotent despite the best intentions of \\"positivists.\\"He was correct that male bonding needs to be accommodated in our plans for our species, and I would add, in a productive and positive way. Because young men will seek out manly identity and bonding from those who offer it--be they Boy Scouts or gangs.

Who knows? But I have heard curses from men who are coaching teams of women (soccer, basketball, etc.): \\"They just don't GET IT!\\"The reviewer who claims that the book is \\"obsolete,\\" in my opinion, has a highly-inflated idea of human flexibility.Nevertheless, although this is a \\"ground-breaking\\" book, I find that it has aged, and it has not aged well. I don't know whether Lionel Tiger was simply too lazy to attempt a revision of this book, or whether his mind has gone to sleep over the last fifty years. Whatever: there are false notes struck on almost every page, and they are mostly political false notes. An example would be Lionel Tiger smugly asserting that racial segregation in America was due to whites not wanting to live with blacks. It does not even seem to occur to him that there is another side of the coin: that blacks do not want to live with whites. Even more incredible (for Tiger) is the concept that this might be a pretty good way to arrange life: whites and blacks do not necessarily live cheek-by-jowl, but perhaps in adjoining suburbs, where they have softball games on the weekends. OK, the whites probably lose the softball games most of the time, but why is this sort of living pattern assumed to be unthinkable?Another example is Tiger's feminism: he actively wants more women participating in politics. (\\"Why?\\" does not seem to occur to him.) He confesses that the political strength of men in groups is going to make realizing that goal very difficult, and therefore *profound political changes might be necessary to achieve this goal.* Making \\"profound political changes\\" to achieve some (perhaps imaginary) goal is actually an extremely dangerous idea, and I suspect that its time is very nearly over.A lot of important data is gathered here. I don't think it's well organized, but it is at least *gathered.*But I don't think any of this changes the fact that men naturally tend to form self-selected teams. If you have a social unit with fifteen guys in it, perhaps seven or eight will form themselves into a team. They will probably do it (in Western society) by trading insults (in person or over the Internet). Very often, a guy's \\"mates\\" are among the most important things in his life. An entrepreneur in New Zealand; a college boy in Chiang Mai; a Burmese refugee who has a pack of at least twenty friends --- find me a woman who operates like these guys. :-)Why do we Western folks need an entire book to document the obvious?

Only thing I dislike is that he keeps talking about things like \\"direction 7\\" (he has 8 directions I believe) and if an instructor is just fast forwarding up to a lesson they want to focus on, like scrolls, or perspective, the students have no idea what he is talking about when he says directions seven. But really, you could even run the tape with no sound and still follow along, even if you have no idea what direction 7 is, you just copy what he's doing.My students at first beg for me to put VCR on pause thoughout the first shows, but when they find I won't stop it they hurry up and start sketching fast and wild which is the whole point. Unlike that \\"other guy\\" who stops for many silly comments to make kids giggle, and draws things that are totally un-useful, like silly creatures and cities (how often do you need that?) McIntyre does allow just enough drawing time to not be too fast or too drawn out. I only wish there was DVD of this series, or that someone would remake this series over again. I'd also like to see one that shows faces, bodies, contour drawing, and still life and landscape, on a simple beginner level of course. One that'snot for kiddo's and not for college bound adults. Or maybe there is one but I have yet to find it."},{"Title":"Sight of Proteus","review":"At his best, Sheffield fits in the category with Larry Niven in that Sheffield is able to deliver a fully developed world driven by several far-sighted predictions of where technology and need will drive mankind. Sheffield seems to produce his very best material when he writes solo and (frankly) when he writing 20 years ago.&quot;Sight of Proteus&quot; fits both those parameters, and in my opinion is among the two or three best that Sheffield ever produced. The story is based in a world where changes to the human form can be ordered from a public catalog - and of course the darker underworld where prohibited changes can be obtained.In an over-populated world where underground scientists are willing to push the envelope of human form and evolution, this novel broke new ground pushing the &quot;what if?&quot; question related to human potential.

While some of the stories are brilliant, such as \\"Jacking in\\", \\"Video Date\\", and \\"Godflesh\\", others drag a bit. But, even the worst story in Hot Blood: Stranger by Night is better than the other books and short stories out there. Just remember, if you share this book with someone you love, just hope they don't get too many ideas from it.... that could be down right scary."},{"Title":"Stranger By Night: The Hot Blood Series","review":"This is the second book in the hot blood series that I have read, and I enjoyed it. Many of the stories got my blood boiling, and the combination of horror and erotica made the book original. It is definitely not a book for children or the sensitive. There are some very graphic sexual content here, and most of it is dark.Stories that I liked included \\"Jacking In\\" which was about a computerized sex toy that takes revenge on a violent man, \\"Just Sex\\" were two writers of erotica decide to have a relationship in order to further their literary ambitions, only to have to face violent and unexpected consequences, \\"Home Movies\\" were a womanconfides in her friend about sex and murder, and perhaps my favorite story in the collection by Graham Masterton which was about a rare beetle that enhances sexual pleasure between partners. There was also a suspenseful story about the struggle of a morbidly obese woman trapped in her house after her mother is murdered, a cyber sex connoisseur who stalks her partner, two twins in a game of strip poker that turns bad, an incident where a clerk tries to blackmail a man who runs pornographic tapes that also goes bad, a sexual succubus, the story of two dead girls who take revenge on their murderer and the story of an old man who goes to the movies and hears a couple making out behind him, but with a twist."},{"Title":"Stranger By Night: The Hot Blood Series","review":"This is part of the Hot Blood series, so you know what to expect, being an erotic horror anthology series.

Now, I'm a music major and I have tons of music books, but I must say that this is the most useful book I have ever bought. Everything is explained in a concise and direct manner, and is easy to find. Whenever I'm in doubt of how to use a punctuation mark, or how to phrase something correctly I always come to this book. Whenever I have to write a paper, this book is right next to me. I love that its relatively small, too. Great book.

This particular edition (a required purchase for a course in college) provided me with critical information on using the now ubiquitous MLA and APA parenthetical citation styles. My undergraduate days are behind me, but I employ this book today in the workplace.While there are now a number of excellent online sources for style citations, information literacy (especially how to avoid accidental plagiarism and suggestions for intelligent research strategies on and off the campus), and there is plenty of help embedded in (for example) Microsoft products for spelling and grammar checking, a well organized handbook on the desk is still an important tool for well written letters, notes and memos around the office."},{"Title":"The Longman Handbook for Writers and Readers","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

Great, versatile recipes, from extravagant-looking (but possible in 20 minutes or less) to, well, desperate... but still delicious. It is by far the most-used cookbook I have."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"Good recipes, easy to make, no strange ingredients, no special skills needed. This is the cookbook that I turn to when I have to figure out what's for dinner. The food is GOOD! My family is so glad that I have this cookbook. They were getting tired of the same things for dinner every night."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"My family has been using this cookbook for about 15 years. Growing up when we asked mom what's for dinner, if she answered by saying a desperation dinner that is all we needed to know, we knew we were going to love it. I have not encountered a recipe that I do not enjoy. I have absolutely no dislikes or negatives about this book. Although they claim every dinner can be made in 20 minutes I never really do this, but mostly by choice. I would have way too much mess to clean up if I went through my kitchen like a tornado. I also rarely cook on high heat as the book recommends to speed things up. I also do not by ingredients as package ready as the recipe recommends. For example, instead of buying frozen veggies that are already cut/chopped I will chop by own which increases prep time."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This book has rescued me from many a \\"Oh no! What's for dinner?1 It's 7pm and all we have is a solid block of frozen ground beef, a few shriveled veggies in the crisper, a bag of noodles and a cabinet full of herbs and spices!\\"They really mean desperation dinners. And they deliver. You can have absolutely nothing thawed, and still have a delicious, creative, amazing meal on the table in 20 minutes. They opt for healthy ingredients when possible and it isn't just a book filled with ground beef and creamed soups over noodles. There are quite a few kid-friendly recipes in here, as well.I like to cook and I still use this book all the time."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This cookbook is for everyone! I am retired and seem to have even less time to cook... The recipes are tasty, the directions easy to follow and it seems I have given this cookbook to at least 10 people as gifts... Try the black bean soup--it is terrific!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've used this cook book for a couple of years now, and love it so much that I bought one for my Mom and my sister and had them shipped to them. I'd been trying to find a way to put veggies into my diet for years, and it did that and a lot more. In the back of the book is tips on setting up the pantry, frig and freezer to facilitate such quick meals which it really did. An unexpected side benefit was that if you use their method then grocery shopping is simply replacing what I use, virtually anything that I see I'm low on all I've got to do is put it on the list, so keeping my kitchen stocked now a days is a breeze. I own about 40 cook books but this is the one I use day to day. It's made me love cooking."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I think I've had this cookbook for about ten years. Tonight, I went through it and counted how many dishes I'd made from it. The answer was over 25. I once read that the average person uses three recipes from each of their cookbooks, so I was pretty impressed to see my total on this book. These recipes are tasty and easy to prepare and I'd especially recommend this book for a beginning cook."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I love this cookbook and have used it more than any other I own over the years. If you're really into fine dining and cooking, then I doubt you'd be interested in this, but, if like me you're a busy mom who'd like to make something a little out of the ordinary without spending a lot of time in the kitchen and money on weird ingredients, this is your book. My favorite recipe is the Fajitas in a Flash. They are something I often serve to company, and they get rave reviews. The Minute Minestrone is also a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This is a great cookbook. It is well worth the money.The book is full of tips and hints and advice about how to speed up the cooking process. And not once is quality, good taste, or ease given up. The ingredients are common, easy to find, typically on your shelves ingredients. Every recipe I have tried out of this cookbook has turned out wonderful. It is an enjoyable read as well."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"After following their column in my local newspaper and reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to check the book out of the library. I had to wait about a month for my turn to come up, and before I could return it, I had to buy my own copy. This book is filled not only with delicious, quick recipes, but also with time and sanity saving ideas. It taught me a few things about having a well-stocked pantry and freezer. Now I can whip up a meal in no time. I have at least two &quot;desparate&quot; dinners at my fingertips at all times. My favorite recipe in the book so far is the &quot;Balsam Inn Fancy Fettuccini&quot; ...ummm... I've got to get home and make it tonight!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've been using this cookbook for about 5 years. We now have a number of standards that we use every other week or so. I agree that many of the recipes are rather bland, but I figure the authors are writing for the masses and these recipes are easy enough to amp up to suit my family's tastes. Case in point, we would never, ever, use instant rice. Any recipe including such is simply revised. I see this cookbook as one very helpful tool in weekly menu planning. As with any tool, it's how you use it that dictates the results."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've never felt compelled to write a review on Amazon, but this book is worth it. Of my massive collection of cookbooks at home, this one is by far the most used. I've made at least 20 of the recipes, and none of them has failed me. My brother in law told me that the pasta dish I made from this book tasted like &quot;restaurant food.&quot; A friend from work asked me for so many recipes (mostly after peering over my lunch containers) that she finally ordered the book. My step mom and I both cook from this book frequently and report back to each other on which recipes to try next. I've recommended this book to countless people, and everyone has loved it. The recipes are incredibly fast and they all taste great. If you're going to invest in a quick cooking book, make it this one!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"In keeping with the recipes in this book, this review will be short and sweet. It's true -- the meals take anywhere from 20-30 minutes to make. And they're good! The cookbook comes in very handy on those nights when I crawl into the house at 6 PM after some afterschool acvitity and now have to cook dinner and help with homework. I wish the authors would write a DESPERATION DINNERS II."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this cook book after reading a review in the newspaper. It is wonderful! Using convenience foods from the grocery store you can fix dinners in 30 minutes that taste great. One of our favorites is Easy Enchilada's. My college age son requests it when he's home (this from a mom who is not known for her cooking!) Also try the bean burritos. I've given out 10 of these books to friends, family and teachers!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"As a new, busy lawyer, I simply cannot make most of elaborate, delicious, time-consuming meals I enjoyed preparing as a student. I thought my family would be reduced to frozen ravioli and pizza and take-out until I discovered this book. Even when I've had a stressful, 11-hr. day at work, I can take 20 mins. to make something fairly nutritious and delicious from this book. I pick and choose favorites based not just on taste and ease, but based on nutritional value and calories (I follow Weight Watchers), and I have not been disappointed. My favorites, off the top of my head, include: Spanakopita in Pastry Cups, Summer's Best Pasta, Jamaican (&quot;Me Hungry&quot;) Macaroni, Flexible Jambalaya, Middle-Eastern Eggplant with Pita Points, Winter Pesto Pasta . . . I could go on and on."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"My friend (who has 4 children) recommended this book to me and I have erected a statue in her honor in my front yard (just kidding) to thank her. One day my 8 year-old could tell I was stressed out about preparing dinner. He came to me, looked up and said &quot;It's OK Mom - just make one of your speedy dinners&quot;. Enough said. This cookbook has great recipes that my children and husband like and many that I crave. You can't go wrong. Thanks Cynthia."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"If your goal is to make something easy that's edible than this book gives you lots of choices. Most of the recipes are of the caliber of Hamburger Helper or maybe Applebees. I can understand the appeal of the book for those without much time who need to feed indiscriminate eaters. It has it's place but it's not the food I want to eat on a regular basis."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I use this book all the time. Love the quickness of the meals since I've got small children. Just wish that more of the meals were complete meals (meat and veggies together). Most are just meat or pasta with a few veggies thrown in here or there. I still use this book a lot though and some of the recipes do include veggies. I'd recommend it to mothers/fathers of young children. If you don't like pasta or rice then don't buy it though."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"My neighbor gave me this book when she was moving a couple of years ago and I moved shortly after so it satayed packed away in a box along with several other cook books until just recently. Tiring of stopping for fast food or making the same quick meals like spaghetti or tacos, I figured I'd give this one a whirl.I've typically found that in many of these books that promises quick, good meals in 30 minutes or whatever, that it generally takes you longer. I don't know whether the authors are just cooking under optimal conditions or I'm just slow. I suspect it's a bit of both. Still even at 40 minutes or so, Beverly Mills and Alica Ross whip up some very hearty meals always with ingredients that are either in your pantry or easily found at the grocery store. No scouring exotic gourmet food stores with this book.The book is arranged by section starting with soups, then moving on to stews, Skillet meals, salads, Entrees, Veggies, etc...All very well formatted although unfortunately no color photography. The recipes range from typical American fare like hamburgers and baked chicken to Asian, Mexican, and even Caribbean dishes. My family really enjoyed the chicken Fingers Parmesan, easily made with refrigerated or frozen chicken fingers. I also love the Potato corn chowder that was very rib sticking on a cold day. The selection of salads is very strong too with some excellent seafood, pasta, and traditional salads.Desperation Dinners is a solid cookbook. It's the kind you will probably find a half dozen receipes you really like and will make over and over again."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I'm late to this cookbook, as it's been out for some time. I think I was put off by the &quot;Desperation&quot; in the title--desperation and food together does not appeal. Title aside, this is a wonderful cookbook that IS quick. It's a security blanket for me--to have a cookbook with decent meals that I can prepare in 20 mins or so. I use fresh ginger, garlic, etc. instead of the bottled they suggest, but I think it's worth it in taste and it doesn't take much extra time for me. Recipes I have enjoyed include Jamaican macaroni, Deceptively simple fish, Real-life lasagna, pepperonata with sausage, BBQ shrimp on spicy rice, and the black bean soup. My life is not so rushed that I would ever resort to using canned chicken in a recipe (there aren't many of these, and you can always substitute). I'd also recommend going for low-salt varieties of canned tomatoes, for example, as a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chicken broth can really ratchet up the salt content of some of these recipes. Highly recommended for those who enjoy having a nice meal, but are short on time. I use this cookbook all the time, and I have a shelf full of cookbooks. It's a winner."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have never been accused of being a cook. I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea, but I've just always been inept at making things taste like I think they should. &quot;Desperation Dinners!&quot; (which I received from my husband-- hmm, was that a hint?) has given me renewed confidence. The simplicity and 20 minute preparation times are wonderful assets but my greatest thrill has come from actually being really pleased with the flavor of so many of the dishes. I recommend this book to not only busy people but anyone who has become intimidated by other cookbooks because of a &quot;fear of failure.&quot;"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"These are really tasty meals you can get on the table in 20 minutes or less using basic staples ... makes a simple dinner easy.

It's an insult to the many, many fine cooks/authors who have spent years testing and revising recipes until they come up with a book worth publishing.

I think the author's forte is likely making reservations rather than dinner."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I got this for Christmas a few years ago and have used it so much I will have to replace it soon.

Everyone in your family will enjoy sitting down to a home-cooked meal. Now I'm looking forward to buying their other book!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This cookbook has changed my life! Instead of feeling desparate each night when wondering what to eat for dinner and settling for saltine crackers, I can plan easy and quick meals. These recipes keep the list of ingredients manageable and are designed for lots of freezer/pantry items that you can keep around to increase your flexibility. I have stopped going to the store every day and am eating better and cheaper than ever. My husband enjoys the variety and I am able to plan a week's worth of meals that are nutritious and delicious!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I wasn't sure about this book at first, because I didn't really think that what the authors claimed could be true. But, I am happy to say, that for the most part their claim of 20 minutes a recipe is true. Now, you have to really MOVE that entire 20 minutes. As the mother of an 8 month old, that sometimes means that 20 minutes takes 30 because I have to stop and pay attention to my daughter. Overall, though, the recipes taste great, are easy, usually provide leftovers and don't take a gourmet stocked pantry to make. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"Hands down winner for quick dinners (20 minutes!) that are easy and taste great!

This is one cookbook that will definitely get used."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book two years ago and have hesitated posting a review because I wasn't sure how many stars to give it. On one hand, I'd give it five stars because (a) it was a lifesaver at the time I bought it, (b) I still use it frequently, (c) I have learned many quick cooking tips and tricks from it, (d) the recipes are really ready in 20 minutes (*many* quick cookbooks do not include ingredient prep time and assume you are starting with already-diced onions, etc.; this one does include prep time), and (e) many of the recipes in the book are excellent. Yet, not all of the recipes are winners, and some are completely ignorable. This is the only thing that drops the rating of the book in my mind.This book was a lifesaver in the months after my second child was born, and dinner was ready later and later each night. I was still in my Julie Child-mode, spending at least an hour on dinner. With a newborn and a toddler underfoot I was tired and constantly distracted. One night I didn't get dinner on the table for my husband and myself until 10 p.m.! Enter Desperation Dinners. This cookbook taught me to get dinner ready in under half an hour when I need to. My husband was just as happy with the food, and while these are mostly not gourmet recipes, many are good enough to be an acceptable compromise.The Desperation Dinners method involves certain principles. First, you need to buy yourself a good extra-deep large nonstick skillet. Second, you need to give yourself permission to buy certain convenience foods to cut down on prep time. These include already-minced garlic and ginger in a jar ... already-prepped fresh vegetables (e.g., shredded carrots); frozen vegetable blends like red, green, and yellow pepper mix; and pre-made potato dishes, like Simply Potatoes brand mashed or southern-style hashed potatoes. They also have many pantry and refrigerator tips of things to have on hand--e.g., frozen shredded cheese, variety of cans of diced and stewed tomatoes, individually quick-frozen chicken breasts. Side bars throughout the book offer tips and suggestions for things such as quick side dishes.My favorite desperation recipes are Anti-Stress Antipasto, Chicken Caesar Salad, Real Life Lasagna, Summer Meatballs and Yellow Squash, Barbecued Shrimp on Spicy Rice, Mind-the-Clock Chicken Marsala, Pan-Seared Tenderloin with Bearnaise, Dinner Huevos in a Hurry (not very authentic, though), Mom's Mini Meat Loaves, Lemony Chicken Piccata, Flash-in-the-Pan Fish Fillets, Carolina Crabcakes with Creamy Horseradish, Rio Grande Rib-Eyes, Chinese Steak on the Spot (an excellent quick marinade), Moussaka in Minutes, Grilled Shrimp Dijon, and Fish in a Boat Asian Style. ...There are also plenty of good recipes for sides, like doctoring up Bisquick biscuit mix with cheddar cheese and garlic or sour cream and dried chives. There are several excellent desserts, of which Magic Brownies (a microwave recipe) and the Peach Crisp are outstanding.The only two real disasters I made from this book were the Amazing Apple Tart (hard as a rock and stuck to the pan) and the Miracle Pork Chops (tasteless). Many recipes I know I will never make, but there are enough in here that I do like that I have decided to go ahead and give this book five stars. The fact that I have given many copies of this away to friends in family reinforces that rating...."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book because my husband and I had run out of quick dinner ideas for our family. This book covers the gambit from appetizers to salads to dinners and uses common foods most people would normally have in their pantry.The pantry guide is wonderful, as is the convenience foods section. I began using many of the suggested products after I received Desperation Dinners and haven't gone back since. We often refer to the recipes on the weekends when we have extra time to cook, just because the food is so great.The book doesn't have a huge selection of dessert ideas.I plan to buy this book for all my working mom friends and even for those friends who have time to plan their meals.You don't need to be &quot;desperate&quot; to use this cookbook. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I used to love to cook and prepare good food, but now that I have two children under three and a husband who comes home for dinner anywhere between 5:30 and 8:00, dinnertime had become a nightmare. I have used other 20-minute cookbooks, but they required at least 30-minutes of clean-up time. We were surviving on take-out, which was really getting old. This book is wonderful. The recipes are very good and the clean-up time minimal. The book itself is well organized and has great tips and advice on food shopping, preparation, and using convenience products. I've used this book at least every other day since I bought it. The recipe for Magic Brownies is worth the price of the book. They take less than ten minutes, start to finish, and taste great."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I'm a guy just learning to cook. I bought \\"The Joy of Cooking\\" and just was not excited by those recipes. But the recipes in this book are really fun and tasty and very easy. Unlike others who recommend their favorite recipe, I'll recommend the easiest of the tasty recipes: \\"Sausage Zucchine Skillet\\". This was very tasty and incredibly easy. I did have to buy a \\"chef's skillet\\" for the skillet dishes, but I bought it at [a local store] and the cost was small. (A word of warning for you guys: be careful with the step in \\"French Peasant Supper\\" where you brown bread crumbs in the broiler. Beware. Bread crumbs can catch fire and create a large flame. The bread crumbs brown in 10 to 15 seconds, so just stand there and wait patiently.) This is my favorite cook book. I use it every week. I have yet to cook anything in 20 minutes, but I'm new to cooking. It usually takes me 40 minutes, including all the time to pull all the ingrediants from the fridge and panty."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This book is just fun. I will say that the only beef I had with it is there are no pictures! Like I said in another review I did on a cookbook, many people are visual creatures, especially my four little boys. They like to SEE what they are about to eat, and with this cookbook I can't do that. That said....I learned to get over that!I have made a number of recipes from this book, and ALL were hits not only with the boys, but with my husband and I as well. I highly recommend trying the Chicken Picatta...wonderful flavor and a cinch to make. The Jamaican Macaroni was a nice take on the old standby of Mac and Cheese, the kids liked the flavor and I got some vegetables into them as well.The recipes are indeed quick, although for some I think the author's boost of 20 minutes is pushing it, but so what. I made the Chicken Picatta last night with a fettucine side and some corn, along with a salad, and it took me about 35 minutes to get it all on the table-start to finish. 35 minutes works for me!For the price...you just can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I was prepared to love this book (and do like some of the pantry tips) but have been disappointed with the 3 or 4 recipes I've tried. Maybe I've had the bad luck of choosing the worst recipes in the book but everything so far has been very bland. I judge a recipe by the criteria, &quot;would I make it again?&quot;, unfortunately none of these passed. I'm ready to retire this book.From my notes: Two-For-One Noodles: &quot;a little bland&quot;; Mock Spinach and Ricotta Lasagna: &quot;just OK - not outstanding&quot;; Hamburger Steak with Mushroom: &quot;gravy too bland/pasty&quot;."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"My mother got me my copy of Desperation Dinners a couple years ago because while I love to cook, as a busy college student I didn't usually have the time to prepare an elaborate meal.Nearly every recipe in this book *will* be ready in 20 minutes. The exceptions are the recipes where you have to boil water; those can take up to 10 minutes more to prepare. The important thing to remember is that you have to keep moving. Of course, if you have someone helping you then things move along much faster.I have enjoyed every recipe I've made using this book. The ingredients are easy to find and prepare, and you get a variety of flavors and meal types. Plus, the recipes are easy to modify if you need to.I highly recommend this book as a starter cookbook for college students and new couples who want to do more in the kitchen but may not have the time for elaborate meals."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This book has saved me from feeling guilty when there are too many things scheduled and no time for a healthy meal. The recipes are great and so easy to follow. I haven't found one that took longer than the 20 minutes. My family loved the Topsail Spaghetti, we have it even when we aren't rushed!

This is great purchase for busy families."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this cookbook about a month ago. I just love it! It has easy recipes that taste great.

Living in a small town I need recipes that take \\"normal\\" ingredients, and with 4 kids things need to go together pretty quickly with our busy schedules. The recipes are easy to follow, and you truly can put them together in 30 minutes or less. The authors of this cookbook also make the book an interesting read with great tips and ideas for a busy cook. Everything from stocking the pantry and freezer to ideas for easy short cuts. You'll love it!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This cookbook has made it possible for my family to eat dinner! So many cookbooks assume that you have several hours available to cook a meal-and that's just not possible with everything that is going on in our lives-work, school, etc.After looking at all the other good reviews this book got, I decided to go ahead and buy it. I've been burned by &quot;quick&quot; cookbooks before-the food they produce is mediocre at best.But &quot;Desperation Dinners&quot; IS different. The dishes really can be prepared in 20 minutes or less AND they taste good.A wonderful, much needed book that every busy family needs. I can't recommend it enough, and I hope the authors write another book soon!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"No more frantic dinners after work. With a little work on the weekends, our weeknights are calm and satisfying with delicious meals. Great - thank you so much!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book a few weeks ago and have already tried several recipes. They are fast, taste great and my husband will eat them! I have found that some of the recipes take closer to 30 minutes rather than 20, but maybe I just putter around the kitchen more than they do. Desperation Dinners is just what I needed being a full-time working mom of a 10 month old baby!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This was recommended by a friend and I use it all the time.

I use it at least once a week."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I love this book! I've had it for several years, and use it often. Almost every recipe that I've tried has become a family favorite. Our favorites: Chicken Tortilla Soup, Citrus Chicken, Cheesy Ham Casserole, Jamaican Macaroni, Hunter's Chicken (a quick, flavorful variation of Chicken Cacciatore), Fajitas in a Flash, Sloppy Janes, Lime-Garlic Chicken Saute. Julie's Best Ever Baked Asparagus is amazing; comes out perfect every time. The only recipe that I've tried that was bland was the Chicken Ole. I highly recommend the book though. Lots of fresh veggies, interesting meals, and all of them done in 20 minutes."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I enjoy having people over for dinner on a regular basis but I'm a busy lady so trying to come up with something fast, tasty, and aesthetically pleasing can be tricky. No more though! I love this book, I use it more than just about any other (I have lots!) except for one other book also by these gals (&#34;Cheap, Fast, Good!&#34;). The steps are simple, the ingredients are fairly inexpensive, and the results are always delicious! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be able to eat a good meal without having to spend all day in the kitchen to get it."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"my daughter in law is in graduate school, works full time and has a very busy 4 year old. this will be a big help"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"now we can find simple meals to fix, which helps with our diet and lifestyle,hope to find a lot of inflo from this book."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"If you're a busy woman on the go, but would still like to give your family a home cooked meal...or you're not a well practiced cook & would like to make a meal with better flavor...this is the cookbook to use.

Meh.The recipes all seem to have the same ingredients. I tried the meatloaf-patty dish, and couldn't believe how tasteless it was. Would I try it again? Well, only if I added some other seasonings...Not very inspired recipes here; at least Rachael Ray tries things with some kick, and they don't take too long; granted, these recipes don't take long either, but they're pretty dull."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I love this cookbook. The recipes are really easy and fast. What I like about this book is that the recipes are ordinary downhome cooking. I hate to get a cookbook where I have to go to a gormet food store to find any of the ingredients. You can find any of the ingredients at your local supermarket. And the best thing that I like about this cookbook is that the recipes are delicious."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have well over 300 cookbooks, and accelerating.

Yet not one of my 50 cookbooks has come close to being opened and used as much as this one, despite the fact that I bought it only 4 months ago. I have a 5 and a 4 year old and they enjoy the entrees as much as their Daddy and me. I especially love the sausage and potatoes, the chicken parmesan, and the chili. The meals truly are quick to prepare, but they are full of taste and texture. I use these recipes weekly, and have yet to find a dud. If you are looking to find a cookbook that you can really use, this is a winner!!!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"My mother gave me this cookbook for Christmas a couple years ago and I've been using it nonstop ever since. The authors have done a great job of creating great tasting, healthy recipes that go together fast. The cold soup recipes are awesome for hot summer days...never thought of making vichysoisse from canned potatoes. Some of my other favorites: moussaka in minutes, sloppy janes, spaghetti with clams, mindless mu shu, hollandaise sauce, garlicky green beans, perfect baked asparagus, and tuna and fusili alfresco. Other reviews have mentioned recipes they didnt like, but I've loved every one I've tried and am looking forward to trying new ones. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"As a guy starting to live alone, there had to be a point where I wasn't eating gut-busting and unhealthy fast food. Having seen the book at a friend's house and having her mother-in-law recommend it; I bought it for myself. I always enjoyed a good meal, but never knew how to make one. The recipes in this book are so easy to follow, it's like, cake! When I make a recipe out of the book and bring it to dinner parties, people are amazed!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This is a great cookbook for both novice and experienced cooks. Many nights my husband and I get home from our first jobs at 5:30 and need to be out the door by 6:15 for our second jobs. These are the nights that I use this cookbook. I have not had a bad experience yet. The mindless mushu tasted just like the real stuff from a restaurant. The tuna melts were yummy, skillet shepherds pie, awesome, broccoli cheese muffins, fabulous, and the garlicy green beans, to die for.... I could go on and on. I try a new recipe every week, and will be re-making all of them in the future. Great basic rib-sticking recipes."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I work full-time, have a young child, and write books, too. I love to cook, but seldom have time to spend an hour or more making a meal. In addition to all my &quot;regular&quot; cookbooks, I have a dozen with the words &quot;Fast&quot; or &quot;Quick&quot; in the title. This is by far the best, and very few of the recipes start with &quot;Open a can of Campbells Cream of Mushroom soup.&quot; I would cook many of these recipes even if I had lots of time. I have given it to all my friends. My only quibble: I want a follow-up!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I am a mom of two, one toddler and one nine year old in competitive gymnastics! This book is a lifesaver for the evenings that he has practice. I can throw something healthy and delicious together and make it look like I have been in the kitchen for hours. Some of the recipes do need more spices, but I just add to taste, like it tells you to in the book. We cook from this book at least 3 times a week. My husband loves the Real-Life Lasagna, almost better than the real thing! This is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This is such a great cookbook that I feel I must write my first review here to tell everyone about it! This is the solution to my dinner problems. Now my family gets more then just pasta with sauce when I'm fresh out of ideas and time.The recipes are simple but delicious. Categories include soups, salad, entrees, skillet meals, breakfast for dinner and even desserts! My favorite is a Ham &amp; Cheese Pasta Salad...great during the hot summer months!If you're looking for a &quot;dinner in a hurry&quot; cookbook, this is it!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've got a little of everything on my cookbook shelf, from gourmet to so-called Working Womens' Cookbook. Ha! Nothing I've tried so far is as fast, and as good as the recipes in this book. I also hang over the book, reading the story that goes with each recipe, while my water heats, hamburger browns, or whatever. I work at home, so I grab a recipe about 5:00pm and check for any ingredients I don't have on hand. I pick up maybe one thing at the store on my way home with the kids, and 30 minutes later, it's supper time! Not bad, considering how &quot;needy&quot; my kids are when we first get home. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have yet to get one of these dinners cooked in 20 minutes - even the honey-mustard pork chops took 40 minutes to cook - but I still like this cookbook. The recipes are good, and I know I can get dinner done in less than 1 hour with any recipe from this book."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"So- you get this book. If you live near any good grocery stores/ gourmet boutiques/ ethnic markets- you stock up on interesting spices/condiments. In less than twenty minutes you whip up a simple inexpensive meal (yes convenience foods add expense but less than a restaurant, and come-on 'yall making your own darn rice from scratch instead of using the box like they suggest is no big deal in terms of time!) You're in the kitchen cooking, you add a sprinkle of this or splash of that making the dish your own. Notch up the flavor! I wouldn't have it any other way. No pickled ginger here unless I'm eating sushi. Clean up kitchen during the end of the cooking, and get the meal on table in less than twenty minutes from ingredients you have. Not gourmet, but it's okay. It saves a trip to fastfood/a restaurant or another night of toast and fruit."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"Before we had a second child I rarely cooked.Another child changed all that.A friend w/5 kids suggested this cookbook to me.I can't say enough good things about it.Have given several of these cookbooks as presents.My family likes these recipes even my picky 11 yo daughter.Plus the recipes are relatively healthy!!!!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have purchased many many cookbooks, but I have never used one as thoroughly as I have this one. The recipes are very easy to follow - even without pictures of how the dish is supposed to look when done! I have had the book for almost 3 months and I have made well over 30 of the recipes in it. I plan my week's menu's straight from it. I am buying this book for all of my busy friends for birthday gifts this year!!!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have truly enjoyed using the recipes out of Desperation Dinners! They are easy, delicious, and did I say easy?! My favorite by far is the French Onion Soup, which I always make double of and freeze for those really frantic days!This book has become my cooking bible!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I love cookbooks, I adore them. I oh and ahh over fancy recipes and exotic ingredients. Desperation Dinners doesn't fall into that category. Simply put, when you're desperate and it is 6PM and all you have is defrosted chicken and everybody is hungry, this is what I turn to. I can always find a recipe for which I have all the ingredients in my pantry and/or freezer. I highly recommend it to all working moms (and busy stay at home moms too!) There are lots of great recipes even my finicky 6 year old will eat, and it sure beats the expense and nutrition of Pizza Hut or a trip through the drive through at McDonalds.My mother always had the Joy of Cooking or the Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook that she scoured for recipes. This is THE cookbook for the next generation."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have a confession to make; I love cookbooks. They constantly give me inspiration and great ideas on what to make for special occasions. &quot;Desperation Dinners&quot; is different. It is a book that you can use everyday. Most recipes are a meal unto themselves, the rest only need bread or a side dish to round them out. Not only are the recipes excellent and diverse -- French Cassoulet, Individual Meat Loaves, Corn Chowder, and Fresh Summer Tomato Sauce for example -- they are all complete in 20 minutes or less.This time includes the chopping, dicing, slicing, and opening of cans. None of the recipes require special gadgets or appliances and most can be made on the burner with one pan. The authors are both working mothers who write a column together every week called...you guessed it... &quot;Desperation Dinners!&quot; They are busy just like you and me, and their solutions to the &quot;What's for Dinner?' question are incredibly delicious."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've made 10-12 recipes from this book....the desserts aren't anything to write home about, but the dinner recipes have pretty much been a hit at our house. Yes, they can be done in 20 minutes of focused work. No, these are are not exciting, gourmet, ethnic wonders, but they do feed a family of 3-4 in a short time....which, from my vantage point, makes it pretty much a miracle! The relative simplicity of many of the recipes makes it easy for our daughter to help, which I think if pretty great.The French Peasant Supper, Tuxedo Chicken and Grandma's Chicken Stew are family favorites."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I have owned this since it first came out and it is my \\"go to\\" gift for bridal showers. The recipes are delicious and truly simple to prepare. The writing style of the authors is entertaining and holds my interest.The book is organized into catagories making it easy to find recipes for ingredients you may have on hand. In addition a basic \\"stock your pantry\\" list at the front of the book keeps shopping quick.I just gave this book (again) as a gift to my future daughter in law at her shower last month."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book along with Desperation Entertaining on the advice of another busy working mom. I love to cook and I love this book! The food is simple and easy and most everything I have made, everyone loves. We have our favorites, for sure, but some of our family favorites are from this book and I have shared with many friends. I recommend it to anyone who is busy but doesn't always have the time to dedicate to figuring it out in advance. I also love that the ladies give you a list of things that should always be in your pantry, that way you're always prepared for a desperation dinner!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I admit that I was skeptical when I purchased this book. I was expecting yet another book full of \\"canned\\" recipes -- you know the type: a can of this, a can of that, few fresh ingredients. Boy, was *I* surprised!While the book does take advantage of convenience foods -- pre-chopped veggies, frozen chopped onions, etc. -- it uses mostly fresh vegetables, meats, and readily available herbs, spices, and condiments. I've made several recipes from this book and haven't had a problem yet. My first was the cream of wild mushroom soup -- a heavenly silky concoction made with several varieties of mushrooms that reminded me a soup I'd eaten in an excellent Swedish restaurant some years ago. Outstanding!And the authors are true to their word -- if you follow the directions, you'll complete each dish in 20 minutes or less. You'll keep busy for those 20 minutes, but you WILL finish. Each recipe is marked to let you know if you need to pre-heat the oven, boil water, etc. -- which aren't usually included in the 20 minutes.As a cookbook collector, I purchased Desperation Dinners as another example of \\"quick and easy\\" cuisine. It's now on my \\"most used\\" shelf!August 2007: It's now six years later since I wrote that review above, and this is STILL my most-used cookbook. I have over 2500 books in my cookbook collection, but this is the one I reach for first. I've made probably 30-40% of the recipes in the book, but I still have my favorites (that cream of mushroom soup, for instance). If you're looking for down-to-earth recipes that use everyday ingredients, but use them in creative ways, this is the book for you. Seriously. It's worth the investment."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book about a year ago and it is so well-worn I think I might need to buy a new one soon!While I kinda like to think of myself as a &quot;gourmet&quot; cook, many nights I just don't have the energy, motivation, ingredients, etc. to even THINK about dinner, much less make it. That's where this book is indispensible. In 20 minutes or less -- no lie-- I can make a very tasty, filling meal, using pretty much what I've got in the cupboards (maybe with a short trip to the grocery to pick up a couple of fresh ingredients).Now, I agree with one of the reviewers who said that these recipes are kinda bland. Many of them are. Mills and Ross certainly don't impress us with their cultured palate, and in some instances (for example, their Fiery Chinese Beef, or should I say, Fiery Chinese &quot;Blech!&quot;) their use of spices is just plain wrong. But fortunately, they don't go astray too often and if you have a rudimentary grasp of salt, pepper &amp; semi-exotic seasonings like curry powder, dijon mustard, &quot;fresh&quot; (bottled) ginger, etc. you can easily flavor these dishes to your taste w/ wonderful success.Many of the recipes keep you moving, but some of them are so amazingly simple I wonder why the heck I didn't think of them on my own (the Shrimp Dijon and Honey Mustard Porkchops come to mind here: just slather &amp; cook; served over rice these dishes are delicious). There are great recipes for gazpacho, shepherd's pie, chicken fingers parmesan, spaghetti w/ clam sauce, golden fried fish fillets and an interesting bunch of recipes for the grill, too. Along with the meals, Mills &amp; Ross provide lots of simple recipes for delicious sauces, salsas, vinaigrettes, you name it. I've used these to spruce up old favorites from other cookbooks, as well.Side dishes are kinda limited, but there are a lot of ideas for dressing up muffin mixes &amp; refrigerated &quot;tube&quot; biscuits to make savory accompanyments. And I find myself whipping up homemade salad dressing all the time now, rather than use the preservative-laden bottled kinds. Oh yeah, and the ladies have a whole section on breakfast foods that I've turned to many lazy weekend mornings when my husband &amp; I are in the mood for a big breakfast w/ minimum time in the kitchen. These hearty breakfast meals make satisfying dinners, on occasion, too.So, if you frequently find yourself standing in your kitchen, staring blanking into the refrigerator, wondering what in god's name you can make for dinner... Do as this book instructs and start frying an onion. The smell will motivate you to start flipping thru your cookbooks and before long, dinner will be on the way. Do yourself a favor, though, and add this book to your cookbook collection, cause I bet my favorite non-stick frying pan that --nine times outta ten-- this'll be the book you turn to in such instances."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend that runs a cooking store. Wow! I'm always short on time and ideas, running for fast food when my brain goes numb - it always happens near 6 p.m. - well, this book stopped ALL that! Not to mention side effects I hadn't anticipated! The recipes are simple, full of flavor and healthy. I'm not saying this book is solely responsible, but my husband's cholesteral level dropped significantly and I lost 15 pounds. I normally have 5-7 people at the table each night - 3 generations - and this book has something for everyone. I'm giving it as my Christmas present to all my friends, making sure my daughter has a copy to take to college with her, and moving all my other cookbooks off the kitchen shelf. I even packed this book for our 2 week vacation at the beach. This is the one cookbook no cook (busy or otherwise) should be without!"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I agree with the other readers' sentiments in saying that this cookbook fast becomes an &quot;old standby.&quot;Using readily available ingredients, these recepies take only 20 minutes. (If you're using a mandoline slicer or food processor, you can assemble many of the recipes in a mere 15.)While I do love to cook, I am often left with tons of leftovers, as I am a single twentysomething. The recipes in _Desperation Dinners_ are not only quick-cooking, but incredibly easy to scale. Therefore, I can enjoy good, fast home cooking without leaving tons of leftovers. Also, the side dishes make excellent one-person meals.Additionally, this cookbook is great to have handy if you (like me) frequently have friends and family stop by unexpectedly. I just grab my copy of _Desperation Dinners_, go to one of my Post-It-Note-marked pages, and make something great. Guests always comment on my Martha Stewart-like way of whipping up something delightful whenever they knock on the door. (Little do they know that _Desperation Dinners_ is my secret weapon.)Despite my words of praise, I have a few words of caution: 1.) Don't buy this book if you only like using fresh ingredients, as many of the recipies rely on bottled sauces and condiments. 2.) This is not the best cookbook choice if you're on a low-carb diet, as the meat and veggie-only options are minimal.Regardless, this is a great cookbook! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I must admit that a year ago I was ready to throw this book away. A friend had recommended it to me and I am always eager to find quick and easy recipes. I made a few of the dishes and thought they were awful. I did't want to give up, though, so I looked at the other reviews on Amazon.com Several reviewers listed recipes that they liked so I tried those. Turns out, I found some really good ones and I'm keeping the book. I have only made about 20 of the recipes so far, so I'm looking forward to trying the rest.My favorites:White Bean and Chicken ChiliMindless Mu-ShuTempting Thai ChickenBalsam Mountain Inn's Fancy FettuccineDinner Huevos in a HurrySweet & Sour Broccoli SlawGarlicky Green Beans (these are worth the price of the book; they taste like they are from a fancy asian restaurant; we eat them like candy)I would avoid these:Garlicky Potatoes and SausageTuxedo ChickenSouthwestern Chicken on the SpotFrench Peasant Supper (this was awful- nobody wanted to touch it; it's pictured on the front cover!)Primo Chicken-Vegetable PastaPepperonata with Penne and SausageI would consider this a book with some fabulous recipes and some horrible ones. It's true that you can have dinner in 20 minutes. Yes, it is worth the money, but just know that you will have to weed through the bad ones (and/or read all of the Amazon.com reviews and follow customer opinion about what to cook from this book)."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"Because of this cookbook, I attempted my very first meatloaf. Previously, the reputation of my mother-in-law's meatloaf intimidated me. My husband loved the Desperation Dinner meatloaves and he couldn't believe that I did it in such a short time. The chicken caesar salad was so good that my husband had two servings - virtually a miracle for someone who disdains vegetables. My daughter enjoys helping me cook the real-life lasagna (which I call &quot;crazy lasagna&quot;) - she breaks the noodles - and she doesn't mind eating it two days in a row, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I actually look forward to cooking, just to try out the new recipes from this book. The book is packed with hundreds of quick, easy, and nutritious meals, is well-organised, and gives so much information even for a non-beginner like me. There is a lot of variety; I appreciate the Asian-inspired dishes so much. I definitely recommend this book - in fact I've given one as a gift and will soon be giving another."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This Book is my kitchen &quot;bible&quot;. I love this cookbook over any other book in my kitchen, and believe me, I have a ton. Beverly and Alicia take the simplest things in your kitchen and turn them into masterpieces. I live in the midwest so our tastes are not caviar and pate. My family likes a good homecooked sit-down meal. This book can give a simple cook like myself a sense of confidence in the kitchen I've never felt before. A &quot;whatever&quot; attitude. I've had this book for a year now and feel like I am a better cook now than I was two years ago. I am not new to the kitchen. I'm a 37 year old wife and mother of two boys. Until I owned this book I felt like there was a right and a wrong way. Now I know different. I can't tell you how wonderful this book is. It gives you ideas and shortcuts in areas you would never dream of. And when they say dinner will be on the table in 20 minutes flat; they're not kidding. I've made some fabulous dinners I'm almost ashamed of. Dinner tastes like you've been in the kitchen all afternoon. But it's 5:30 and you didn't even start dinner until 5:00. This Cookbook teaches a person how to use what is on the shelf. How to use convenience foods and make a meal taste wonderful. If I could, I would give this book an eleven star review. I've never found a cookbook I read as often as I do this one. Like I said, it's my &quot;Kitchen Bible&quot;."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've had this book for about 5 years now, and while I only rarely use it now- it literally saved my sanity 5 years ago.I bought this book after seeing one of the authors on a Discovery channel daytime program. She was cute, perky and promised to have the answer to my prayers- how to cook dinner every night. At the time I had just moved 2,000 miles away from everyone I knew, had a 7 yr. old, an 18 mos. old, and was pregnant with child number 3. My husband had just taken a new job where, for the first time in over two years, he was not traveling. That meant he suddenly expected to come home every night to dinner! Sheesh! I was in no shape to suddenly start cooking, and the two kids had no desire to eat anything \\"weird\\". This book provided simple, kid friendly, easily made recipes that really hit the spot.The recipes in the book are easily done in a half hour- 20 mins. if you follow their directions and devote the entire time to cooking. I usually am in the middle of checking homework, making phone calls and finishing laundry so it adds a few extra mins. Still, easily finished in 30.There is a pretty good variety of recipes, especially if your family is open to eating shrimp, fish, and salads. It is broken down by groups, such as skillet meals, pasta, and breakfast for dinner (always a hit in our house). The recipes do rely on \\"convience\\" foods such as frozen, chopped onions, ready to eat mashed potatoes, and bottled ginger. I balked at the expense of many of these items, but their use is what makes it possible to get the meal on the table in 20 mins, and even with their high price the resulting meal is still cheaper than fast food.I used this book steadily for the first two years, and then found out one of my children was Diabetic, and another one has food allergies. In the third year I took the recipes that I could adapt to the food allergies, plugged them into my Diabetes software to calculate nutrition information, and thus haven't touched the book in a while. I still make my new versions of many of their recipes, and continue to use many of their ideas for how to get a meal on the table in a short amount of time.I also took their ideas and combined them with the \\"once a month\\" philosophy and have had good results. I buy hamburger and cook it with onion and garlic and then freeze in one pound portions. Then when the recipe calls for ground beef I just pull out my cooked meat and go from there. I also buy onions and freeze them, chopped, so when the recipe calls for \\"frozen, chopped onion\\" I pull out my baggies. Ditto the frozen peppers. This has allowed me to save money by not relying on their convience foods, but still make fresh meals in under 20 mins. That's important because I don't have the freezer space to do full \\"once a month cooking\\".I do understand some of the complaints about the recipes lacking flavor, but when you're feeding picky kids the lack of spice is a bonus. My kids really enjoyed the \\"Sloppy Janes\\", \\"Schnitzel\\", and most of the pasta dishes. My husband has found much to enjoy, and with precooking/chopping the ingredients I find the clean up to be pretty easy. All in all, it's a winner for us. It's also one of my favorite baby gifts- along with a casserole dish filled with one of the recipes. I've had more than one new mom tell me it was a blessing."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've tried many cookbooks that promise meals in 20 or 30 minutes. Most of them don't include the time it takes to chop ingredients, so it ends up taking 40 minutes when you include the prep time. This book delivers on its promise. Symbols alert the cook to start boiling water, defrosting meat, or preheating the oven as soon as he walks in the door. From there, instructions are complete and simple. They make an effort to reduce the number of pans needed, and many efficiency tips are built right into the instructions.As with anything &quot;fast,&quot; there are drawbacks. Some recipes lack a homemade flavor since they rely on many convenience items, like instant rice, bottled chopped garlic, and canned sauces. And some are a little bland, but I've remedied that by adding my own herbs and spices. I have made a few recipes that were remarkably flavorful and have become some of my &quot;old standbys.&quot;This is a lifestyle-changing book for people who work hard, care about their health, and think there's more to life than cooking."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I've made 12 recipes from this book: 2 of them are keepers with a few slight additions but the rest I'll only make again after reworking the ingredients significantly. I agree WHOLEHEARTEDLY with the reviewer who said these are too bland - there's not a recipe I've made that hasn't needed extra herbs/spice and they're still too blah (I'm feeding kids, ages 13,16,17,18 and 42 &lt;grin> and they agreed). Also, there's a heavy reliance on Instant Rice and bottled garlic and ginger. If you don't like these you'll have to do the prepare-ahead thing to make these recipes quickly or just add in the extra time (which slows a lot of 'em down).My other gripe: food professionals or not, based on the recipes I suspect the authors need a better acquaintance with (or fondness for?) Southwestern/Mexican & Asian cuisines. Their versions of these dishes lack some of the basic supermarket ethnic ingredients that would give them some life. This was surprising given the number of really excellent cookbooks addressing these foods and the increasing availability of interesting ingredients in supermarkets.I'd only recommend this book to experienced cooks who can modify recipes with some confidence, and then it's probably redundant to their own skills at getting flavorful meals on the table quickly.------2010, trying this book again:------At this writing I'm the grumpiest reviewer for the book. 10 years later I found it in a basement box and checked to see if I was just frazzled by work and 4 kids in 2000 and took that out on the book. Cookbooks are NOT a genre for the faint of talent, or of heart. If you & family love DD then good on you, no offense meant - but DD lovers are probably not reading this.It takes enormous dedication to produce a worthy cookbook and this remains no worthy cookbook. Honestly I don't think the authors gave or perhaps had much time to work these recipes - this has all the feel of a book pushed too quickly to take advantage of a current market trend.DD remains a big NO. If you are a frazzled cook, young, or not thrilled by the art then you are better served looking elsewhere - avoid this book, it's a waste of your precious cash and time.But COOK and BLESS YOU for making your own meals: kids do grow up and stop complaining about cilantro/onions/garlic/mushrooms/sitting next to their brothers at mealtime. And if they join the military they'll seriously appreciate your efforts, and seriously ask you to send that weird marshmallow fluff + chocolate chip 'fudge' they loved so much, when you didn't have time to cook but they didn't quite know it.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"Love this book, when I need a quick & yummy meal the kids will eat. Our fav is the orange french toast! :)"},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"I received this book as a gift from my husband (my request) two years ago and since then have made dozens of the recipes from it. It is one of the best presents I've received! This has become the cookbook I reach for almost every night when I think &quot;What am I going to make for dinner?&quot; Most of the recipes are very tasty and all are fast. Some of the recipes are a bit dull but I have never used any cookbook as much as I use this one because so many of the recipes are great! I love being able to cook interesting meals for my family quickly. There are many kid-friendly meals, but also a lot of fancier, &quot;adult tastes&quot; dishes as well. One of the best features of this book is the section that discusses how to set up your pantry and freezer so that you always have the ingredients on hand to make dinner. One of the biggest problems for me has been not having the ingredients around to make dinner with, fast or otherwise. Since using this book, I always have the makings of a good meal handy. I have recommended this book to many friends and have shared many of its recipes.Downside: Maybe I'm just a klutz, but for the most part I can't make these recipes in 20 minutes. Usually it takes me more like 30-45 (max) minutes. I think in order to finish the recipes in 20 minutes you much have all the ingredients within very easy (fast) reach and you have to follow the directions EXACTLY. But still, the recipes, even very intricate ones, are much faster than you would expect. Another drawback is that some of the recipes (but only some) definitely suffer in the flavor department from a lack of longer cooking.Overall, this book and way of cooking has dramatically improved my ability to get a good dinner on the table every night. Now I don't panic when I think of making dinner. I just figure out what I really want to eat! I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone who likes interesting meals and doesn't have a lot of time to shop and cook."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"This is the best cookbook I own. I have made approximately half of the recipes in the book and only one (Mindless Mushu) has not turned out well. Most of the recipes are so simple that my culinary-challenged husband can prepare them with delicious results. Everything is done in 20 minutes or less and many of the recipes are complete meals with meat and veggies. There are not many desserts in the book, but when you are in a hurry who has time to make dessert? Open a bag of cookies! Of course, this is not the book to use if you are preparing a fancy dinner party, but nothing beats it for day to day cooking."},{"Title":"Desperation Dinners","review":"These women are geniuses!

This book (Soccer duel) is about a kid that stars on the basketball, football, and baseball teams, but when he tries out for the soccer team he discovers that he will not be the star. When he tries to be the star he gets benched because he is not being a team player. Terry takes the place of Henrik (the star sweeper) when Henrik gets hurt and the team wins.I think this is a great book because it never has a part when the author interrupts the action. The book has a lot of action, for example, very close soccer games. There are flashbacks of football games, too. Overall I like the book because of the story. It is very exciting and enjoyable. There are a few parts that I feel could have been better. Sometimes I got confused because there wasn't enough information in certain parts especially in the middle. In other parts there was too much information which made me bored, but I finished the book and it's terrific. I loved the book and I hope you read this book."},{"Title":"Soccer Duel (Puffin story books)","review":"I don't really read a long book that's about 220 pages, but I can't believe I did this one so fast.

Instead I found an unabashed celebration of the beauty of the Black male body in various dimensions, positions, moods, and ambiances. The book is worth the buy.ESKing"},{"Title":"Black Versatile","review":"This book is one of great beauty. Here we find masculine beauty played out in the many shades of mocha that only the Gods and Goddesses can produce. BLACK VERSATILE is simply a joy to behold as here we have a lovely book celebrating the multi-faceted gorgeousness of black men; but what these original photos do that most other don't is capture the wonderful spirit and energy of maleness, joy, and play of these interesting men. While I believe the target audience is for the gay male world, I do believe some women and even some non-gay men would appreciate the diversity of expresion here in this most expressive book. I almost didn't order the book as I didn't care for the cover picture, but I'm glad I did as I throughly enjoy just about every shot in this superb book. What stands out to me reguarding this particular book is that so many of the guys are clearly and honestly having an excellent time. Even the men in the serious shots have a real shimmer or light to their eyes; there's definitely a sincerity about this project that I like, and it translates into this wonderous diverse collection of male expression that is really a celebration to behold. While some of the photos are explicit in the sense that some of the men at times are comepletely nude or arroused; the work is never lewd and always remains tasteful and creative in my artistic window. I highly recomend BLACK VERSATILE to anyone who appreciates unique, fun, and often beautifully sexy male photography. If you especially find the black male facinating; this book is definetely one that you should order now and add to your personal library today. Cheers to the excellent photographers, models/actors, and all who worked on this creative endevor - WELL DONE !!!!!"},{"Title":"The American Street Gang: Its Nature, Prevalence, and Control (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)","review":"As a (former) Bay Area gang officer, I find that my personal experience validates Dr. Klein's research, surmises, and experience.

This is a snapshot of history on the eve of when this subject actually became interesting.

And our readings/ discussions led us to deeper understanding of life and how to view the various life challenges each of us is facing. I highly recommend this book to anyone at ANY level of understanding of Eastern wisdom...you will be awakened to many helpful concepts."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth & Death: . . . And Everything in Between, A Buddhist View Life","review":"For adherents of the SGI version of Nichiren Buddhism, a number of books exist that explain the sect's basic beliefs and practices in an engaging manner. Woody Hochswender's \\"The Buddha in Your Mirror,\\" and \\"The Buddha in Your Rearview Mirror\\" spring immediately to mind. Such books leaven the explanation of Nichiren's thought with personal anecdote and illustrative similes.While it is a very good read, Daisaku Ikeda's \\"Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth and Death\\" lacks this personal approach. Rather, the book is a methodical overview of Nichiren's thought that makes no concession to the reader who wants to skim. It can be very deep going.Nevertheless, I found the book engrossing due to the clarity of Ikeda's exposition and the intrinsic interest of the material. Regardless of what one thinks of chanting nam-myoho-renge-kyo--the basic practice of Nichiren buddhists--one has to admire the sect's realistic, gradualist approach to enlightenment, an approach that does not ask its practitioners to eliminate desires but rather to recognize the possibility of 'human revolution' through compassionate pursuit of those desires and an ethic of public service.The first four chapters deal with the buddhist view of birth, aging, illness, death. This discussion is followed by a chapter entitled \\"Life's Unlimited Potential,\\" in which Ikeda explains the concepts of the ten worlds (a psychological concept rather than a theory about the cosmos) and \\"3000 realms in a single instant.\\" This latter concept is an attempt to explain how our physical, spiritual, and psychological makeup combine with our environment to produce each person's unique experience. I found this chapter difficult and I needed to re-read several parts. The next chapter deals with the concept of \\"9 consciousnesses.\\" The final chapter treats the title of the Lotus Sutra as that sutra's summary and essential expression, Nichiren's key innovation.Prospective buyers should be prepared to read slowly and carefully, ideally with a notebook to hand for recording the many impressions that will undoubtedly arise from Ikeda's discussion."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth & Death: . . .

And Everything in Between, A Buddhist View Life","review":"Many people start to study Buddhism because they are interested in the ultimate mystery of life and death and have not gained a sufficient insight from western based philosophies. Unfortunately, much of the Buddhist literature we read focuses on how to perceive or deal with our heads and not on how to address the ultimate issues such has how to change our lives, why we are here, what is the happiest way to live. This book tears right into these issues and is thus remarkable in it's scope and relevance to a thoroughly disenchanted culture."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth & Death: . . .

And Everything in Between, A Buddhist View Life","review":"I had read the 1988 edition many years ago after beginning my own Nichiren Buddhist practice in 1990. It opened my eyes at that time to an understanding of the ten worlds as 10 life conditions. I realized that I experienced Heaven and Hell from moment to moment in my daily life as opposed to places I might go after I died. But as I reread this excellent book as part of a Nichiren Buddhist study group, I learned so much more and achieved a much deeper understanding.Dr. Daisaku Ikeda is able to express complex Buddhist concepts in a way that the average non-Buddhist can easily understand.This is a book that you can read sections of depending upon the circumstances you find yourself in. Once you really understand that you and your environment are one, you realize that you can affect your circumstances by how you think about them and can then take value-creating action towards resolving them.We all have unlimited potential and can turn poison into medicine. During the nine months that we studied this book, my husband went through a serious operation. He had never been that ill before. I had to study harder to find the guidance I needed to turn our circumstances around for a favorable outcome. It is my firm belief that if I had not had the support of my fellow Buddhists chanting for him and for my happiness as I deepened my faith, he may not have survived. The chapter on Illness and the medicine of Buddhism was especially helpful.Towards the end of the book study, my mother passed away after a brief illness. She overcame the illness, but had seemingly made a decision that this year was going to be her time to die. Her greatest fear was that she would outlive her children and couldn't cope with that. She passed away peacefully sitting in the chair of her walker on the way back from the mailbox on a beautiful summer day in Maine on a mountaintop witnessed only by her flowers, butterflies, and the hummingbirds she fed. She never even fell out of the chair. A neighbor called 911, which was heard by her son-in-law, a police detective who notified my youngest sister Lori. She was well protected by what we call Shoten Jenjin - the protective forces in the universe that we appreciate in our Buddhist practice. The Buddhist view of the eternity of life and its cyclical nature as expressed in this book, helped me to cope with my loss. Even more importantly, my practice with the aid of the study of this monumental work by Dr. Ikeda allowed me to be the pillar that my 4 non-Buddhist siblings could rely upon during this sad time."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Mysteries of Birth & Death: . . .

Nichiren Buddhism is all about victory in this lifetime. With President Ikeda's help, this book serves to show how to change karma into purposeful mission and obstacles into life enhancing experiences. Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this book is a whole new appreciation of time and the eternity-of-life contained within each life moment. The author on page 105 points to our lack of power and wisdom as the source of our real cause of unhappiness. Then he goes on to explain in graphic detail how understanding the principle of \\"three-thousand-realms-in-a-single-moment-of-life gives rise to understanding life itself.

Mr. Ikeda discusses ideas as complex as dependent origination, what is a proper definition of health, the ethical dilemmas of euthanasia, and what exactly is death, from the perspective of a Nichiren Buddhist. Without any impression of judgment or direct expression of opinion, Mr. Ikeda provides ideas for the reader to ponder and encourages them to explore their own opinions on the topics of birth, sickness, old age, and death. While describing a holistic approach to life, in which all aspects of each individuals existence affect all other aspects, Mr. Ikeda also acknowledges the benefits which can be gained by seeking modern and traditional healing methods. Indeed, in many instances Mr. Ikeda encourages the reader to both embrace current opportunities and recognize the wisdom of tradition.

One of the many reasons I selected his company was his obvious knowledge of business. Even more, I appreciated the motivation he placed in us (and himself) to always become better as contractors and as businessmen. We met frequently to \\"log in\\" new discoveries, efficiencies, risks, and methods of profitability that he had wisely accumulated for us. As I \\"ventured out\\" into the world and developed my own business with very little experience, I quickly noticed that although I was a \\"great\\" project manager that running a construction company was an entirely different issue. For example, do you understand the unique requirements of the construction firm owner? Terms in the project owner's construction agreement that can unfairly shift major risk onto your plate and what to do about them? How to ensure that you get paid for change orders? What to do when hard times suddenly strike (and they will)? After 25 years of experience in operating a commercial construction company, Mr. Ganaway explains chapter-by-chapter these and every other risk area you must manage if you are going to survive in construction. I know these explanations well as they ring in my mind from discussions with Mr. Ganaway concerning my very first projects and through calling for help with running my own construction business. You will feel like you're having these same discussions with him as you read this book. Every contractor, project manager, and construction student should read it. Today I use this very text to teach our students at Georgia Tech's building construction program how to run a business, as well as consulting in the same area. His principles work!An added bonus to this text is the final chapter, where Mr. Ganaway makes the case for specializing in chain store construction. To \\"outsiders\\" who have not reviewed this market segment, I think you will be surprised at the benefits. If you are not already specializing in a niche market, this chapter is sure to start you thinking about it."},{"Title":"Peterson's Toefl Success 2001","review":"I run an educational advising center where we also administer TOEFL tests, and &quot;Peterson's TOEFL Success 2001&quot; is the most popular TOEFL preparation product we have.

In his book, \\"The Human Side of Enterprise\\", McGregor examined theories on the behavior of individuals at work. His examination included Abraham Maslow's work on human motivation which greatly influenced his work.From his examination, he formulated two models that he called Theory X and Theory Y. Theory Y is based on the traditional assumption that people don't really like to work and would only work if they were threatened in some way. Management assumes that employees would avoid work if possible. Based on this belief, managers would attempt to control workers in order to \\"make them work\\". Theory Y is based on the asssumption that people have a natural interest in work when it is a satisfying experience. They will apply self control and self-direction in meeting the objectives of the organization without external control or threats of punishment.In \\"The Human Side of Enterprise\\", McGregor demonstrated how Theory Y affected the management of promotions and salaries and the development of effective managers. With the Theory Y (Participative Management Style), there were positive results. When management acknowledges that it is under estimating the potential of its employees and incorporates Theory Y assumptions, then it can focus its efforts on developing improved applications of Theory Y.Although some organizations may find it difficult to incorporate Theory Y, it is still worth the effort to train management using this principle. The potential increase in productivity would be worth pursuing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a involved in organizational management."},{"Title":"The Human Side of Enterprise","review":"Unlike later and earlier books in this genre, this one strikes a balance between two world views: \\"theory X\\" (a set of ideas that exclude all needs, motivations, and influences outside authority and dependence) and \\"theory Y\\" (a set of ideas derived from imagining motivations and influences without managers). And the author maintains a style that never becomes unjustifiably preachy. There's a lot of optimism at times, but taken in the context of the entire book, it's acceptable.Some authors never go out of style. By the way, McGregor makes it quite clear that under most circumstances, in most situations, and with most people the appropriate approach is \\"theory X.\\" McGregor fully admits that the application of \\"theory Y\\" won't work except with certain people and under certain conditions. Applying \\"theory Y\\" in the wrong situations to inappropriate people is an all too common SNAFU. Though applying \\"theory X\\" in the wrong situations to inappropriate people is also a SNAFU, it is apparently rare.This last paragraph was just FYI. In case a reader happens to be some kind of spiritually and socially abused polymath.I have a confession to make. The second part of this book (\\"Theory Y in Practice.\\" Chapters 5 thru 12.) was very hard for me to read. This difficulty was partially because in order to really gain some understanding of it, it forced me to judge myself. But this was more importantly because all the examples of Theory Y in Practice that McGregor himslef could find indicate that its application has limits and it requires discipline. To this reader, the limits and this discipline of Theory Y in practice appear far greater than that required by Theory X in order to be successful. For example, successful unschooling would require more discipline and commitment on the student's part than traditional public, private, or even homeschooling."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"The Vintage Mencken, edited by Alistair Cooke, will have readers reaching for their dictionaries and laughing uproariously at the same time.

If you were to strike up a conversation with any person 90 years ago I would think their speech would shock modern sensibilities on the race issue.

L. Mencken. H. L. Mencken (1880 - 1956) was a journalist and writer who was born and lived in Baltimore for most of his life. Mencken is perhaps best known as one of the founders of _The American Mercury_. Mencken's commentary on American life and politics in the early Twentieth Century is often bitter, sarcastic, cynical, and abrasive, but the intent is almost always humorous. Mencken is also well-known for being brazenly politically incorrect and has been criticized extensively for his alleged \\"racism\\" and \\"anti-Semitism\\" by the usual suspects. However, like all Mencken's opinions, his views remain highly idiosyncratic and difficult to define, and Mencken frequently rails against \\"Ku Kluxry\\", though whether he is being intentionally ironic is difficult to determine. However, while Mencken's challenge to the political correctness of his day is to be applauded, in certain respects he can become infuriating. Among other things, Mencken takes on Prohibition, religion, \\"puritanism\\", racial equality, the plutocracy, American militarism and World Wars I and II, Presidents Wilson and Roosevelt, feminism, Anglo-Saxon superiority, the South and rural people, populism, \\"quackery\\" in medicine, fundamentalism, and anti-Darwinism. Philosophically, Mencken appears to have been influenced by the caustic style of both Mark Twain and Nietzsche. Mencken's political views have been described as libertarian (and he even at times uses the very word \\"libertarian\\" to describe the general gist of his viewpoint); however, they differ in certain respects from modern libertarianism. Mencken also retains an elitist attitude, frequently looking down at rural people and the middle classes (what he ironically calls \\"the American booboisie\\"). Mencken also is believed to have been an ardent Social Darwinist and was a defender of Darwinism against religion. He also had very idiosyncratic views on race and frequently made deprecating remarks about blacks and Jews (though privately he had many friends of both races), which has led some to claim that he was a racialist. However, his views on race are complicated (as he also attacks Anglo-Saxons and certain points about segregation towards the end of his life) and thus may be seen as despising all races. In terms of religion, Mencken is frequently considered a \\"free thinker\\" and possibly an agnostic or atheist and he frequently refers to himself as a \\"heathen\\" and \\"infidel\\". However, like all things concerning Mencken it is difficult to discern exactly where he stands on any issue, partly because he is frequently contradictory and takes contrary positions merely to be contrary and partly because his intent is frequently humor and thus one can never be certain how serious he is.This book begins with essays by Mencken featuring comments on his early life in Baltimore. Mencken describes the brutal surroundings in which he grew up as well as youthful experiences at the Y.M.C.A. (before he became fed up with their preaching and abandoned it). Mencken would retain a lifelong distrust of religion which frequently bubbled over into hatred. His hatred seems to be particularly directed against various American versions of Protestantism (Baptists and Methodists) as well as \\"puritanism\\" and may have been in part caused by the excessive efforts of religious to prohibit alcohol at the time. (Even G. K. Chesterton was to praise Mencken's efforts against \\"puritanism\\" and Prohibition while at the same time castigating him for his irreligion.) Included also is an essay by Mencken on cops which details Mencken's generally positive experiences and view of them. Mencken sees cops as largely honorable people (he frequently distinguishes between \\"honorable\\" and \\"moral\\", of which he is cynical) and defends them from charges of graft and corruption. Mencken also defends the sort of folk wisdom of the Baltimore policemen, arguing against the intrusion into their domain of more book-learned individuals. Another essay of Mencken's deals with the novelist Theodore Dreiser, a man whom Mencken admires. In a separate essay, Mencken tells the story of his involvement in the Cuban revolution as a reporter. Mencken also has much to say about George Washington (who he admires), Abraham Lincoln (who he also appears to somewhat admire though he maintains that in contrast to his popular image Lincoln did not intend to free the slaves and that Lincoln may have been a non-believer), and the commonplace of lying as well as the universal public hatred of truth-tellers. Mencken also expresses his distrust of democracy (which he sees rooted in envy in the same way as he sees \\"puritanism\\") and the need for a genuine aristocracy (as opposed to the plutocracy). Mencken next goes on about the failure of American letters, he comments again on the failure of democracy and the need for an aristocracy as against the plutocracy, and he also notes the silliness of the obsession with the \\"Reds\\" that existed at the time. Perhaps one of Mencken's best essays is his essay \\"Star-Spangled Men\\" - a highly sarcastic commentary on America's military culture, patriotism, and the absurdity of World War I (Mencken also states that he maintains the same feelings towards World War II). Mencken also exposes the silliness of various fraternal organizations such as the freemasons as well as expresses his hatred for Woodrow Wilson (the arch-puritan). Mencken's commentary on women and the relationship between the sexes is profound (although sure to displease any politically correct feminist). Mencken's views however are not anti-woman, but merely realistic. He shows the differences between the sexes and appears to put woman on a pedestal though noting certain other deceptive aspects of her nature. In an ironical essay on the Anglo-Saxon, Mencken argues against Anglo-Saxon supremacy, maintaining that while the Anglo-Saxon is prone to braggadocio he is largely a coward and a failure. Mencken notes that many in America have Celtic blood and thus are not true Anglo-Saxons. He also appears to praise other European races instead. Some have maintained that this essay on the Anglo-Saxons is an argument for Germanic racial superiority (Mencken was partly Anglo-Saxon himself but mostly German) and thus an expression of disgust at the Anglo-American involvement in the world wars. In other essays, Mencken comments on Holy Writ, music, Prohibition (Mencken is an ardent promoter of alcohol), and religion and Darwinism. Mencken mocks rural people, the religious, anti-Darwinians, chiropractors, Freudians, and much else. In a particularly disgusting essay, Mencken engages in a tirade against populist hero William Jennings Bryan. Mencken also has much to say about F. D. R., Coolidge, the presidency, the Supreme Court (and its horrendous attempts to destroy the rights of Americans), segregation, death, and several other topics.I certainly applaud much of what Mencken says in his efforts to lift up the veil of the political correctness of his day. However, there are certain aspects of Mencken that I find particularly disgusting. For example, in his early essays, Mencken revels in his youthful abuse of animals (something intolerably sickening). Mencken also is a vehement critic of religion and rural people. While Mencken is largely correct about much of American Protestantism, his complete denigration of religion is uncalled for and would make any latter-day elitist liberal proud. (Ironically, Mencken appears to have had some admiration for the Roman Church and may have even predicted the disasters that befell it with the advent of Vatican II. Mencken notes for example that someday they will \\"translate the liturgy into American\\" and thus ruin the Roman mass.) Mencken's comments on rural people are equally disgusting. But, perhaps most disgusting is his assault on the populist Bryan who adamantly opposed Darwinism.Today, Mencken is read by all sorts. Liberals, secularists, and \\"rationalist skeptics\\" frequently express admiration for his comments on religion and rural people; however, they then try to excuse or downplay his racialism, hatred for democracy, hatred for F. D. R., and opposition to World War II. For example, the arch-liberal S. T. Joshi has quoted Mencken on religion while at the same time castigating him for his hatred of Roosevelt. Liberals and genuine conservatives alike have also found an ally in him in their opposition to the \\"neoconservatives\\". On the other hand, Mencken has also found supporters among those who maintain an idolatry of the free market, while they ignore his comments on the \\"plutocracy\\". All such attempts to co-opt him for various modern causes are pretty disgusting overall. In many ways, Mencken himself was a disgusting man who was too arrogant to believe in a personal God and looked down upon rural people. However, in terms of his opposition to World Wars I and II and his hatred of Roosevelt, Mencken is refreshingly correct. Roosevelt is today worshipped by all kinds from leftists to neoconservatives, but his disgusting policies put into effect have utterly decimated the underpinnings of the United States. I am certain that Mencken himself would be horrified were he to witness the world of today.For a modern day iconoclast in the spirit of Mencken, one should consult the works of the late Australian philosopher David Stove. Also, for a book which features Mencken's views as well as those of other political alternatives consult Willis Carto's _Profiles in Populism_."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"Some classic Mencken here.

A worthy read."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"I have never read anything by Mencken, but it was high time to do it. This is a good beginning. Mencken may be out of fashion, but his newspaper style is very readable, and he had opinions about everything"},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"No doubt the man was a gifted wordsmith and an entertaining read. But his colorful irascibility about practically anything under the sun did get tiresome at some points in this selection. His quasi-obituary about William Jennings Bryan was one hell of a mean-spirited diatribe. Wow, talk about kicking a person when their down. Also, I don't ever recall having to use my electronic dictionary so frequently with any other author. Half the fun was laughing when I discovered the meanings of some of the words he had used. Yet, despite Mr. Mencken's surliness, his remarkable writing and insights made the book well worth reading. Just keep your dictionary handy."},{"Title":"Vintage Mencken","review":"This book is a very good introduction to Mencken's oeuvre.

Mencken was born in Baltimore in 1880 and for his developmental years was a &quot;bookworm.&quot; He resolved to pursue a more active life as he grew and discovered his niche in journalism. In 1899 he went to work for the Baltimore Morning Herald and found the going difficult at first, but as he persisted he discovered that was where he was most suited and kept the title &quot;newspaperman&quot; the rest of his life. He remained in his home town and continued to live in the home his family had lived in rather than seeking career advancement in larger markets. One of the first essays in this collection is one he wrote about his hometown, &quot;The Baltimore of the Eighties.&quot; Another early one describes the local YMCA. His piece on Theodore Dreiser contains a segment on the art of communicating via the written word. A tribute to William Jennings Bryan which was published in the American Mercury in 1925 is included in this collection. Other pieces are on the people, times, circumstances, and issues of the era in which he made his observations. While I do not agree with him on many topics, his work demonstrates the efforts of a skilled writer."},{"Title":"365 WWJD: Daily Answers to What Would Jesus Do?","review":"I purchased the book for my 8 year old daughter because I wanted to help her with today's challenges in society.

They are marvelous - easy and interesting to read, but challenging to put into practice.

Throughout this book there are also quotes by Tersa of Avila, Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, C. S. Lewis, Charles Haddan Spurgeon and many others. Each entry has a bible verse along with a quote and then Nick Harrison sums up the message in a short WWJD? Reflection.While reading I also learned interesting things like the history of the Salvation Army and the origin of the J. C. Penny stores. Nick Harrison reminds us of things like the \\"love of money\\" is the root of all evil instead of money being evil. I liked his thoughts on time management and his practical advice on how to become more active in your own community.I started reading this book and before I knew it I was already at March 14th.

Enhanced with 350 illustrations, the text also features a time line to guide the reader through eras of agricultural trends and places events and movements within an easily identifiable context of human history. The short essays address a wide spectrum of subjects from what the Japanese noel &quot;Tale of Genji&quot; tells us about Japanese flower fetishes, to how herbalist healers were targeted in the Salem witch trials, to what the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; has to say about gardening. A Brief History Of Gardening is highly recommended for anyone who has ever enjoyed the feel of working the earth to bring forth a crop, or labored in a grove or vineyard for the season's harvest, or simply shopped in nursery for seeds, plants or bulbs for their household garden."},{"Title":"A Brief History of Gardening","review":"My wife is a keen gardener, belongs to a Garden Club, Trustee for our church's memorial garden, etc. - she has rhapsodized over this book, I believe it has given her more pleasure than any other birthday gift I've ever given her.

The title says &quot;brief,&quot; not &quot;totally in depth.&quot; But Fairbairn doesn't skimp on details, either -- he just doesn't try to cover all of agricultural history.

But when one member, Nick, smashes the window of their school, they are faced with the task of rasing Five Pounds- the equivalent of about Five Hundred Pounds in that time. So it's fine- except that the money is stolen. The gangs, with good reaon, suspect Ted, but it turns out that it was probably the town... well, two very shady characters named Johnny Sharp and The Wart. After chasing them for a day, they get a confession out of The Prune, a previous gang member, and then get themselves locked up the Abbey Tower. They use The Prune's confession to break into a workshop, where Ted and Toppy are threatened by Little Slasher, NB Johnny's razor. The book reaches its climax when there is a battle in the workshop. What they see their leads to the arrest of Sharp, The Wart, Skinner (who owned the workshop) and a Fourth accomplice for Smuggling goods on the Black Market and trying to murder the children. In the end of the book they are congratulated by the Head of Police and the School Headmaster.

He prefered the relative solitude and training methods that are now employed by the great Kenyan runners before anyone knew of Kenyan runners. This book is a highly motivational book for anyone training to run a serious marathon yet it would be good for a beginning runner also. Buddy Edelen was a class runner who didn't need drugs or &quot;aids&quot; to set a world record in 1963. I have personally read this book at least 10 times and will no doubt continue to read it."},{"Title":"A cold clear day: The athletic biography of Buddy Edelen","review":"Reading this book was a delight. What got was that Buddy was nobody special at first - just another guy in the American collegiate system. Nonetheless, he took a risk, went to England to train with and compete against the best, and it paid off with a marathon world record.The glimpses into Buddy's mind are great, especially the narrative portion about the Olympic trials at Yonkers. You can't read this book and not love Buddy Edelen."},{"Title":"A cold clear day: The athletic biography of Buddy Edelen","review":"What I found so amazing in Frank Murphy's work is his lyrical skill that makes this non-fiction book read like a wonderful tale.Historical accuracy and insightful exploration of personal determination give a clear psychological landscape of the kind of athlete that put long distance running on the map of today's sports.A must read not only for long distance runners, but for poets as well."},{"Title":"A cold clear day: The athletic biography of Buddy Edelen","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Other people may go for the swagger of Pre or the domination of a Salazar or Rodgers. But, of all the the runners I've read about, Edelen is the one I identify with most. I suppose it's because he's more of an unsung hero of American running.The book is fairly well written, and unlike many biographies, it does not drag on with boring uneeded details. It documents the man that Edelen was and shows excerpts from his training to give insight, to those of us who run ourselves, the kind of grueling training he did.One of my top five running books."},{"Title":"A cold clear day: The athletic biography of Buddy Edelen","review":"As a runner in Alamosa, where Buddy lived for many years, I was shocked to learn one day that a friend of mine was the son of this former world record holder. Having of course never read the book, much less heard of the man himself, I found myself buying this biography of Buddy Edelen. What I discovered was awe-inspiring: a man who worked himself past the brink only to run into oblivion. Even had I not known some of the particulars of Buddy's life, \\"A Cold, Clear Day\\" impressed me with a great sense of respect for Buddy as an athlete. Beyond tough, he deserves to be remembered in the annals of running lore."},{"Title":"A cold clear day: The athletic biography of Buddy Edelen","review":"When I picked up this book I did not know who Buddy Edelen was.

With this as a basis he has produced the first history of the Dalai Lamas, in terms of them as an institution, as a beacon of spiritual leadership as well as showing the unique personalities of the Dalai Lamas and their close associates. This remarkable work should be of interest to anyone who likes a great story, whether they are Buddhists or not, religious or not. It shows a view of Tibetan history from the political intrigues of medieval Asia, the Great Game of Britain and Russia, to the genocide of Tibetans and their culture at the hands of the Communist Chinese. Its a fascinating look at one of the world's great spiritual traditions. It provides insight into one of the world's great tragedies - the refusal of the Chinese government to allow the Tibetan people their right to self determination.

Sidney Saylor Farr does a great job capturing the words of Tom Sawyer, an ordinary man who had an extraordinary spiritual awakening during a near death experience and returned with a mission to help facilitate a far ranging spiritual awakening.This book outlines Tom's experiences and perspectives in a way that can open you to the possibility of seeing your life in a new, perhaps more spiritual, way. Tom defines spirituality, not in a conventionally religiuos way, but as an attitude of compassion, selflessness and service to others. Although Tom doesn't offer false hope about the present and future human condition, he conveys the hopeful future that is available for us to choose.Perhaps the most important message, conveyed in many different ways throughout this book, is Tom's firm conviction that positive change, in fact spiritual awakening, is possible for all of us, individually and collectively; that we can evolve from human creatures into a true identity as spiritual beings. This message is conveyed in a plausible way.I had a hard time putting this book down and find myself going back to it often."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer & the Spiritual Whirlwind","review":"Tom Sawyer was and is an ordinary man. An ordinary man who had an extraordinary experience. In 1978 his pick-up truck fell on him, crushing his chest. He was clinically dead for 15 minutes yet he came back to tell of his first-hand experience with death and a new resolve to live. &quot;Tom Sawyer and the Spiritual Whirlwind&quot; is the second book written in collaboration with Sidney Saylor Farr, a respected writer and editor the the Appalachian Heritge. Tom's story of God's unconditional love and Tom's infectious enthusiasm for life helped to create this second book about how a shift in perception can change your entire outlook. &quot;Tom Sawyer and the Spiritual Whirlwind&quot; describes Tom's trips to Tibet and Nepal to visit the Dalai Lama. It also provides Tom's insights into the future of our world, coming earth changes, healing, politics and world peace. Tom says his mission is to enlighten all people on how to communicate with God through prayer. The book suggests that we try a deliberate shift of perception. This occurs &quot;...when you step outside the limitations of your usual measurements and viewpoints.&quot; Such a shift can allow you to see things in a different light, thus changing how you see everyday things, which can benefit the spirit. &quot;Tom Sawyer and the Spiritual Whirlwind&quot; provides deep insight into the possibilities of change."},{"Title":"Tom Sawyer & the Spiritual Whirlwind","review":"I actually know a former co-worker of Tom Sawyer's. That is how I heard of the book & it's credibility. After reading the first book, I had to get the second. They are good reading."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler","review":"This book is, of course, the biography of Adolph Hitler, in all probability the greatest mass murderer in world history, but, because of its subject, it is much more than that; for it presents the complete story of World War II in Europe from the perspective of Adolph Hitler and as it might have been seen, understood, and experienced by those closest to him. As such, the book should be of interest to anyone having even the slightest interest in history; how tyrants come into being and maintain their power; the causes of World War II; World War II itself; or simply the life and death of Adolph Hitler. What makes the book even better, however, is that it is written in an easy going, fluent, and conversational style that makes it easy to read and hard to put down. I especially relished the many creative descriptions of Hitler and his cohorts scattered throughout the book. The author obviously doesn't care much for \\"der fuehrer\\" and his henchmen.In reading this book, the reader will learn a lot about Hitler, the events which he caused, how he caused them, and why. He or she will also learn a lot about Hitler's ancestry, his childhood and early life, and his experiences as a corporal in World War One - mostly gleaned from Hitler himself and from those who knew, taught, and lived with him. During that time, Hitler can be seen as a child traumatized by the death of his older brother; as a seemingly lost soul struggling to find his way while hoping to become a great painter; as a young man deprived of his life's goal by a lack of talent which prevents him from gaining admission to art school; as a derelict living on the streets of Vienna, eking out a living by selling painted post cards to furniture makers; and finally as a dispatch runner in the trenches of World War One where he serves honorably and is one of only three survivors of his original eight-man group.The reader will also see him as he rises to prominence in the National Socialist Worker's Party, seizes power in Germany, and becomes the most powerful and ruthless tyrant the world has ever known. Along the way, he or she will learn the true story of Geli Rabaul and the Night of the Long Knives; discover why Hitler despised Catholics, Jews, Bolsheviks, and Communists; why his greatest goals in life were to eliminate all Jewry from the German Empire and to obliterate Russia from the face of the Earth; how he single-handedly and ruthlessly ran the war; and what really happened in his underground bunker before and after he and his newly minted wife, Eva Braun, killed themselves.Bottom line: You can't get a better bird's eye view of World War II than this one. It is a great book and, strange as it may seem, an easy and enjoyable read. I loved it! Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler","review":"Very informative book on Hitler. Author met Hitler with his father while Hitler was in power.

This story focuses on the life of Richard Hunter, a poor bootblack from New York City. It is a classic story about a young boy without parents who works hard and is honest. The honesty and hard work pays off for him when he does deeds for people in high places.In Ragged Dick Richard Hunter's honesty brings out the best of people. The wealthy people give him extra attention for his deeds and notice his honesty. For example, he receives money for a shoe and cannot get change so within a few days of the business interaction, he goes to the work place of the man and gives him the change. It also represents respect for his elders.Story number two of the series is Mark The Match Boy. This too has good morals starting from the youth. This story displays the innocence of a boy coming into the real world. Mark is a boy who is deprived of love. He has no living mother and no family. The purity, which he displays to Richard Hunter, is charming. In this story thievery motivates the conflict. The story display Mark as a by who is similar to The Catcher in The Rye as where Holden Caulfield does not let his sister be corrupted by the real world, Richard is doing this to Mark.These two stories should be read by not only the youth, but by everyone. They focus on universal morals such as honesty and trust. I can say nothing negative about this book because it is well written, to the point, and very appealing. Not only is it motivating, but also it brings out the best in people and it could change your view on the less fortunate population."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"i think everyone should read at least one horatio alger book, since he so helped shape american morals at the turn of the last century. his very name is a constant catch-all for the american rags-to-riches machine. i inherited my grandfather's set, and, even though one can call these books formulaic, moralistic rot, they capture a spirit and a time in simplistic, bold language that is readable, entertaining, and a fresh peek at cultural history through a primary source. Add to this that i am a teacher who is having my 8th grade boys read it (yes, in part for a laugh), but they are digging it. More than i could have anticipated. Read one paired with Nathaneal West's &quot;A Cool Million,&quot; which parodies alger, for a real bully debate about americanism."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"Elizabeth AnastasiMark The Match Boy by Horatio Alger is about a young, poor, orphaned boy forced to make it on his own on the streets. He gets through many obstacles and troubles that come his way with integrity and honesty. Mark shows honesty and integrity throughout the novel. When his friend Ben, who he met on the streets, told him to lie to his customers about the price of his matches to make more money, Mark wouldn't do it. Even if it meant he would go hungry that night,he said he would never accept money if he didn't earn it; that is why he doesn't like begging. Maybe it was fate or pure luck, but Mark catches a break when he learns he has very wealthy extended relatives searching for him. This story will broaden your idea of what is important in life. At the end of the book, you are left with the question; is he just lucky, or is there such thing as fate?A reason why I liked this book so much was because it was very easy to understand. No matter if you are rich or poor you can appreciate the struggles of being less fortunate or the desire to be wealthy. The characters are realistic and the actions they do are as well. Everything that happens in the book is something that could happen in real life.Another reason why I liked Mark the Match Boy so much was because it was an easy read. There was no embellishment added to the reading. Because of this, it seemed as though each chapter was its own story. The author speaks to the reader to help them understand and follow the story. Even if you haven't read Ragged Dick, the story that preceded Mark the Match Boy, like I didn't, the author relates back to it so you can understand the entire story better.I recommend Mark the Match Boy because, Young or old people can be thankful for what they have. This book will open your eyes to what you really need in life and what is really important. After reading this book you will value morality, integrity, and honesty."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"Mark the Match Boy is the tale of a young, poverty stricken boy who makes it through life with his good morals and honesty. Mark, the main character, lives with a gaurdian who puts him on the streets to sell matches and make profit for the both of them. When Mark finally works up the courage to run away from his temporary home, a string of good fortune suddenly comes upon him. Mark is taken in by a very nice young man by the name of Richard Hunter, the main character from author Horatio Algers previous novel. The two characters seem to go hand in hand with eachother, and are very easy to relate to. Everything seems to go Mark's way, especially the surprise ending which contains a very good twist.I would, without hesitation, reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys to read. I would also reccomend this book to anyone who has had some bad luck recently. Mark the Match Boy comes with the life lesson, work hard, mind your business, and treat people with respect, and you shall recieve the same. Possibly a little good fortune to go with it."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for several reasons, the first being that it was easy reading. I was a junior in college and all the books that I was used to reading were in some sort of foreign language that I could not understand. Ragged Dick was a very simplistic, yet interesting book that I could not put down. The second reason that I enjoyed it was because it talked about real issues during that point in history. Ragged Dick had to struggle in order to get the things that he needed to survive, but in the end it was his manners and his personality that enabled him to prosper as much as he did. I read the book twice and it was still good to me. There are some people that believe that Alger writes about the same things over and over again (depression, poverty) but there are so many other authors that do and still get rave reviews."},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"This book is so bad, it's good.

I was given an old copy of Alger's \\"Driven From Home\\", which turned out to be a serendipity. We have read four Alger novels and, so far, each has been a delight. They are quickly paced, strong in plot and character development, full of witty dialogue and humor and, most importantly, carry the message of the value of hard work, determination and never giving up. My son sits unflinching through every reading-not customary for him! :) As the cliche goes, these are, indeed, timeless classics, which I most highly recommend.These are the books we have read so far:Driven From HomeRagged DickFame and FortuneMark the Match Boy"},{"Title":"Ragged Dick and Mark the Match Boy (Two Novels)","review":"It's doubtful that Horatio Alger's work is readable by a contemporary reader. &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; sounds much more like the title of a skanky porno film than a tale about a boy growing up on the streets of New York.But &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; was Alger's crowning success, and a highly celebrated and popular work when it was originally published. His later works (such as &quot;Mark the Match Boy&quot;) never matched the success of the first of the series, but even at the end of his career (when his books were almost completely formulaic; not that they ever weren't, but they got significantly worse over time) he was still highly regarded as a popular author for juveniles.These stories have mostly historical interest now, but they may be good for a laugh. (And if you're just curious, several Horatio Alger works are available on the net from Project Gutenberg.) I can't in all honesty recommend that someone just randomly buy an Alger book without already knowing what they're getting, as the stories are awfully trite and filled with the moralizing one would expect from a Victorian-era manual intended for young men. &quot;Work hard and succeed&quot; may be a valid message, but Alger's heroes had far more luck than would ever befall a normal person. [Dick might still be looking for a job if he hadn't happened to save a businessowner's son from drowning... Oops, I just gave the story away. Double oops, I just gave *all* of Alger's stories away.] The plot in all of his stories is identical, they're full to overflowing with coincidence, the dialog is horribly stilted even for the era, etc, etc. And yet...I'm not quite sure how I got interested in Alger's work, but I've pretty much read everything he wrote--it's rather a morbid fascination with just how *badly* people can write, and yet people will still read it, and worse, think it's good.As for this specific edition, it's probably one of the few versions of Alger's work that are in print, so what choice do you have?"},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"easy reading, takes you back a few decades-one century...enjoyed reading it.It will stay on my kindle for good time to read again"},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"I bought the Kindle version of Fighting the Flying Circus. I had read the hard cover version many years ago, but this review is based on having re-read the Kindle version in full, and I was not disappointed. Much as I enjoy the convenience of having a Kindle, I frequently find that Kindle versions of old books do not live up to the dead tree version. But I was away from home with nothing compelling to read, so I took a chance and bought this.Eddie Rickenbacker was a member of the famed 94th Aero Squadon which fought The Red Baron's Flying Circus over France in the last years of World War I. He set the pattern for another generation of Americans who had to skirt bureaucracy and red tape in order to fight to preserve democracy 20 years later in the skies over Britain.As a kid I was fascinated by the &#34;glamor&#34; of leather jacketed, silk-scarved knights in their wood and fabric box kites, sallying forth to joust the enemy, but as an adult, I appreciate something much different about Eddie Rickenbacker and his fellows. The deadly brutality of trench warfare notwithstanding, this is a pretty honest account of how truly dangerous the air war was.Rickenbacker was no cavalier. He went into battle with a full understanding of the odds and dangers he faced, and he survived, not by excess of caution or shirking his duty, but rather by strict care for his machine and careful planning. He had guts, he credited his fellow airmen their due. He also admits his own mistakes and failures, and not only learns from them, but shares his experience with the men he served with and lead.This is not a tale of boast and bravado, but a well written book and an engaging read. Pour yourself a glass of brandy, prop your feet on the hearth and settle in, you are probably not going to want to put it down."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"I have always been interested in what it must have been like to not only fly a machine made out of wood and fabric but to actually engage the enemy while doing it. Eddie Rickenbacker makes it very clear. His description puts you right in the pilots seat. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in WW I flying machines."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"This book is a biography of one man, told by himself of his experiences in World War One. It should be of high interest to anyone interested in this war and the fighter pilots in it. It is an easy read, plainly written, and interesting. All of the men who participated in this war are now passed on. Knowing this, it left me with a bitter-sweet feeling when I finished the book. I wish I had the opportunity to have met him, or any of his colleagues. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"1. Short review: :-) (Amazon rating: 4 out of 5 stars -- I like it.)2. Long review:2.1. What I liked: The pictures. The first-hand account.Roller-coaster or walk-in-the-park? Should be a roller coaster but it reads more like a walk in the park.2.2. What I did not like: Lack of detail for September and October 1918.2.3. Who I think is the audience: Air combat buffs. History buffs.2.4. Is the book appropriate for children to read? Yes. No worries.2.5. On the basis of reading this book, will I buy the author's next book? Yes.2.6. The plot in a nutshell:There is no plot. Fighting the Flying Circus is an edited memoir. It was pieced together from Rickenbacker's (EVR) war diary and his letters.EVR's story mirrors the story of the United States Air Service in WW1. He wrote of flying Nieuport 28s on patrol without guns; then with one gun to a plane because they had not enough to equip every plane with two; of many pilots shredding their top planes in dives.EVR spent June, July, and August in the hospital recovering from an ear operation. He returned in September to find that his group had not downed many Boche during his absence and that the Nieuports had been replaced with Spad XIIIs.EVR wrote of Frank Luke's comet-like fighting career. He ended with Luke's disappearance. When Fighting the Flying Circus was first printed in 1919, the USAS had not received the story of Luke's last fight nor the location of his grave.Fighting the Flying Circus contains details about guns jamming and using incendiary ammunition to ignite German balloons.I was pleased with the photos in Fighting the Flying Circus. These included photos of EVR, his squadron mates, observation balloons, and the Hannover CLII that EVR brought down.About a quarter way through the book, I said to myself, \\"I think this was ghostwritten.\\" It was. The ghostwriter of Fighting the Flying Circus was Laurence La Tourette Driggs. The Aerodrome has a short piece about him. Search for the write-up by Ira Silverman.In the appendices at the end of the book, there is a table of Rickenbacker's confirmed kills. The list in Wikipedia echoes this list. I found it better than EVR's list at the Aerodrome. Together, the two lists seem comprehensive.YMMV.2.7. Other:This is a later edition. It includes appendices that detail EVR's accomplishments after the war, such as the fact that he was presented the CMoH by President Herbert Hoover in 1931."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"Loved the book \\"Fighting the Flying Circus\\", very interesting, filled with facts found no where else!

This hard-to-find book is _the_ classic account of aerial combat in World War One. It fairly breathes the cocky, pugnacious spirit of the successful combat aviator, and is, in itself, a remarkable survival story.Rickenbacker was a squadron leader of note as well as a formidable single-combat warrior, and his observations on command are applicable today. Like other great aviators who racked up impressive victories but survived, Rickenbacker was aggressive and confident but not rash. He took pains to plan his missions and to assure their success, attending to the smallest details himself (even to inspecting the individual rounds loaded for his SPAD's machine guns).Rickenbacker is a skillful narrator, and his precise description of the lethal ballet of aerial combat is readable and comprehensible for the flyer and non-flyer alike. Rickenbacker had the reputation of being overbearing at times, but this is not communicated in his writing. Indeed, one of the most memorable passages in this book describes his repeated but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to bring down a particular German observation plane.This is a wonderful book that deserves to be read. Any reader with an interest in flying, but especially combat flying, can do no better than to pick up this excellent work."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"Rickenbacker's adventures, told in Rickenbacker's own words. This story is the definitive acount of WWI air combat. The only books that come close are by British pilot Arch Whitehouse, but those lack the descriptions and heart of Eddie Rickenbacker's &quot;Fighting the Flying Circus&quot;. One can almost smell the dirt and grass from the runways and see the tracer fire from the machine guns. Throughout we see the character of a simple midwestern man who became the Ace of Aces in American flying history. The individual flying episodes are memorable such as the time he refused to let an (allied) French Nieuport get behind him after he became lost on patrol. He later found out that a German pilot in a captured Neiuport was slipping across the lines to wreck havoc on the Allies. Or the time an anti-aircraft shell lodged in his engine yet failed to detonate. The story is vivid and thrilling until the end, even though we all know the larger outcome."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"I read this years ago while Rickenbacker still lived. This race car driver turned fighter pilot wrote this he was still a young man just back from the first air war in 1919. In reading it again as an adult I was surprised to find that he was quite honest and self efacing. When he made a mistake he was forthcoming about it. In many incidents contained in this book it is obvious that luck played an enormous part in survival of pilots in those days, as the training and equipment by today's standards was to put it bluntly, inadequate. I imagine that this book is still a good one for fighter jocks of today because there are still lessons here that apply to today's combat environment. It is always easier to learn from someone else's experiences than to repeat them yourself. If you want to learn what it was like to fight in the air in the First World War this is your book. It is on a par with James McCudden's book \\"Flying Fury,\\" and that is high praise indeed.Since reading this book I have read Rickenbacker's autobiography and was not nearly as impressed as I was with this book. By the 1960's Rickenbacker had mellowed and his words were carefully chosen and not nearly as spontaneous as in this book. After all, by then he had been a CEO of Eastern Airlines, and seemed more guarded about his reputation.The Kindle price of this fine book works for me!"},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"To an American Airman, the name Eddie Rickenbacker evokes images of the earliest chivalrous days of dogfighting. One immediately thinks of daring American Airmen in open cockpit Spads flying against the German Fokkers of the Richthofen Jagdstaffel. It was incredible to learn that the American Ace-of-Aces from World War I was not the larger than life hero that I had always thought he was - instead I learned that he was a humble man that survived his combat tour because of his squadron leaders. His hard learned lessons from almost one hundred years ago are still applicable for today's generation of Airmen.Eddie Rickenbacker was one of the first 150 American Army Air Service pilots to fight in France. The famed Lafayette Escadrille was a group of American volunteers that had previously fought alongside the French, so the Army Air Service formed the initial cadre of officers around those experienced officers. Major Raoul Lufbery, Rickenbacker's first commanding officer was one of those men. It was men like Major Lufbery, whose experience would keep Rickenbacker alive through his first few missions. More importantly, Major Lufbery's leadership style rubbed off on Rickenbacker and taught him how to teach the next generation of pilots when Rickenbacker himself would lead the squadron later on.The book follows Rickenbacker through his combat tour in France. Readers are also introduced to the Air Force's first Medal of Honor winner, 1st Lieutenant Frank Luke, who is credited with 18 aerial victories (second only to Rickenbacker).I was struck by the humble tone of the writing in the initial part of the book. As a lieutenant, I remember being confident enough to solve every problem thrown at me, and I immediately identified with Rickenbacker's first flight with Lufbury. Then, then immediately he had to eat the humble pie when Lufbury pointed out the numerous flights of aircraft that Rickenbacker missed. These are very important lessons for every Airman - there is book learning, but you still get familiarized with the combat zone before you can go out on your own.I listened to the unabridged audio version of the book. To read the book, Tantor Media hired John Pruden, who happens to have one of those \\"golden voices\\". Each of the chapters is its own 10-15 minute audio track. As an added bonus, Tantor included a .PDF copy of the book to throw onto your eReader.This was a fascinating book. As I mentioned before, I always thought Eddie Rickenbacker was larger than life. This combat diary added an unexpected touch of humility to him. I highly recommend this book to any reader interested in the history of the United States Air Force."},{"Title":"Fighting the flying circus (Wings of war)","review":"This book has to be taken in context and with the view that Rickenbacker is a typical warrior who took the savage and heartbreaking experiences of war with a detachment and sang froid that allowed him to participate and keep a clear head. One may need an historical understanding of the situation and the early history of aerial warfare to fully understand the stress and complications that he writes about in spare and unemotional tones.

These two areas are highlands and mountainous, rather atypical of Africa. With the help of colonial officers and numerous African guides and porters he completed the assignment, filed his report and later wrote this short book.&quot;Venture to the Interior&quot; is a thoughful, philosophical, and introspective account of the expedition. Van der Post very much writes in the style of travel writers like Bruce Chatwin and Paul Theroux; the reader sees as much of a mental landscape (Van der Post's) as a geographical one. He describes the journey, both the physical and the mental, in prose that is honest and clear. His thoughts on Africa are usually interesting and often profound.The people he encounters and writes about are mostly Europeans: the district officer, the businessman, the settler-farmer. It would have been nice had he written more about the African population. Still, overall, this is a book well worth reading for those interested in Africa, exploration, travel writing.Most of Van der Post's other books are also well written and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Venture to the Interior (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"This is one of van der Post's earliest books written in 1952 about his post WWII journey by \\"aeroplane\\" across Africa and to Nayasaland (Malawi)to survey the highlands of Mt.

After many years I found this on Amazon and finally read it and had a very difficult time putting it down to attend to the other demands of life. It is a very good, engaging book.As you read this you will have to look beyond the colonial perspective that van der Post had regarding the British and the Malawian \\"natives\\" and see the riches of the country and it's people of that period. van der Post reflects often on the people and his recent return from his ordeal as a prisoner of war."},{"Title":"Harwell Hamilton Harris","review":"Harwell Hamilton Harris (1903 - November 18, 1990) was a modernist American architect, noted for his work in Southern California that assimilated European and American influences.He began his studies at Pomona College but left after a year to study sculpture at the Otis Art Institute, now Otis College of Art and Design. In 1928, he began apprenticing under architect Richard Neutra with whom he was associated until 1932. Fellow apprentices included Gregory Ain and Raphael Soriano.Adopting Neutra's modernist sensibility, Harris merged the vernacular of California with a sensitivity to site and materials characteristic of the American Arts & Crafts Movement. In his residential work of the 1930s and 1940s, primarily in California, Harris created a tension and a continuum between exterior and interior with continuous rooflines. Learning from Frank Lloyd Wright, he designed interior spaces that are often based on the cruciform plan. His work is characterized by a careful use of materials and clean, fluid spaces.From 1952 until 1955, Harris served as the Dean for the School of Architecture of the University of Texas, The group of modernist architects he attracted to the faculty there came to be known as The Texas Rangers. In 1955, he left the university and established a private practice in Dallas, which he maintained until 1962 when he moved to Raleigh, North Carolina where he re-established his practice and began teaching at North Carolina State University.

The book was initially published in 1968.Views of this book, coming from a Japanese scholar who lives during the period of Japanese warmongering from 1931 to 1945 turned out to be quite insightful and perceptive for most American readers. Its always a treat to read what the \\"other side of the hill\\" are saying but this book bring out an unique point of view.The author appears to be extremely hard on the Japanese leadership during this period. His views are also pretty hard on the behavior of the Japanese military and their commanders as the primary warmongers of Japan. Of course, historically speaking, this view is correct although the author almost seem to be venting on them with vengence!! The author however, also point out some of the good things that happened during the war for Japan, like ending white colonialism in most part of Asia and ironically, ending the role of the military forever in Japanese government thanks to the Allied powers!!A book well worth your time to read, it will helped any historian gain a well rounded view of the Pacific War which started nearly ten years before Pearl Harbor."},{"Title":"The Pacific War: World War II and the Japanese, 1931-1945","review":"This book is from the Japanese point of view.

It's been out of print for years, but touched me deeply when I read it at age 10. I'm 30 now, and it has stayed with me all these years. Bittersweet is the best word for it.If your child is ok with the events of Charlottes Web, they will be able to handle this.

There wasn't exactly very much action. If you like cloaked plots and emotional stories, though, this is the book for you.

I struggled with putting pragmatic people and their pragmatic ways (yes, I know, like we adults) in the same plot line with a creative, imaginative little girl -- one who clearly lived in a fantasy world. Walt Disney Fantasia music with pictures would be fun to do with this work.

Besides that, I most certainly don't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"This book is so fantastic. It has all the qualities I consider appealing to non-committal fantasy readers. A young girl searching for something, a goose prince, a magic present and some characters that oppose all that the main character does. Georgie is a young girl who is a little out of the loop of day to day life, seeing as how she lives near a place called Walden pond, this is no surprise. Georgie starts believing that she can fly and actually injures herself a couple of times. Truth be told she really can with her goose prince who seems to have been drawn to Georgie. There is an awful lady who lives next door. She plants shrubbery with thorns on them to keep children out of her yard. She has seen Georgie flying and opposes this very much. This story becomes a tumult between nature and man , childhood beliefs and adulthood notions. I would highly recommend this book to any age person. In the begiining of the book there is a quote from Thoureau's Walden to bring the natural connection to this book even closer. There is more here than meets the eye."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"My daughter and I just finished reading this book together a little over a week ago.This book has upset her more than any other book we have ever read together (and we have read thousands.) She cried for nearly an hour after we finished and basically fell asleep crying. She was still very disturbed the next day and I wasn't sure if she would be able to go to school.My daughter bought this book from her second grade book form and it was, of course, highly recommended. It has won an award and everyone we had spoken to about it while we were reading it, said it was a great book, even though they hadn't actually read it.I am not sure after actually reading it how appropriate it is for a young girl such as my seven year old.I discussed the book with my daughter's school's librarian. He did a research on it and said that it was geared towards a minimum of 5th grade level and that it was definitely inappropriate for a 2nd grader.I was very shocked by the ending - something very bad happens to one of the main characters in the story and you should know this before reading this book to your child. This is what upset my daughter so greatly.It is definitely a good book, I will not argue that. It is well written and has interesting characters. But, for an imaginative 7 year old who is drawn in to the magic and wonder of this story, you will find that the ending can be quite psychologically disturbing to the young reader or listener when the violent ending occurs.If I had read this book before reading it to my daughter or been warned at least about its content, I would have never shared this story with her at this age.Please read this book before reading it to your child and decide whether or not it is appropriate for them."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"The FledglingBook review by MaddieI read the book The Fledgling, by Jane Langton. She illustrated and wrote it. The genre is fantasy, which I have much sympathy for. For it may be easy to just make up any old thing out of your head and write it down, but I have learned from writing fantasy books, (because they are my favorite genre) that having a limit of magical powers is important. Because if you say at the beginning of your brilliant story, \\"There was a guy named Henry. Henry was unpopular. The special thing about Henry was he could fly.\\" Then later in your story you have Henry get stuck in an icky, dirty, dungeon and he can't reach the open window, then you have to change that. Because I bet the readers know or still remember that Henry can easily fly out the window.This story is about a young girl named Georgie. Georgie thinks she knows how to fly. After finding out she can jump down twelve steps in two graceful bounds she's sure she can fly.Then one night a Canadian goose appears outside her window. It seems like the bird is telling her, \\"Come, climb onto my back and I'll teach you how to really fly.\\" It seemed to Georgie that the only thing to do was to climb on his white and black, fluffy and soft, back and have a fascinating adventure flying over the whole town.She meets the goose every night. She seemed to trust his shiny, black eyes. Soon she's flying all by herself. But there's one problem, this terrible Ralph Preek will do anything to stop her goose from coming. Hunting season is coming up, Ralph Preek gets all hands on his gun... To see what happens next, you'll have to read this amazing, fantastic book!!!The story takes place in a little town near Walden Pond. The geese are stopping at Walden Pond because that's part of their migration. Georgie lives at No.4o Walden Street.Georgie is a very creative little girl that is not one of those fancy girls that walks around in a perfectly sewed velvet dress that doesn't have a speck of dirt on it. She's more casual type. She has a little \\"bush house\\" that she plays tea party in. The rocks are cups, the leaves make good seats, and the one big rock in the middle is the table.Eleanor is a happy, determined young girl who never gives up. She cheers Georgie up, and even tries to get Georgie a friend. Eleanor still has her bad times too. She once made a beautiful yellow dress with orange spots on it. She was positive everyone at school would like her new dress!!! When she came home from school, she ripped her dress up and screamed, \\"A giraffe! I look like a giraffe! Robert Toby called me a giraffe!\\" (On page 115).Eddy is a very supportive brother. He always seems to know what to say at the right time. When Georgie put to much frosting on the cake, Eddy says, \\"You can't have to much frosting on a cake!\\" (On page 115). Eddy always has a new way to look at things. One time Georgie jumps down the stairs, but she falls. Eddy then explains to her that nobody can fly, but you can leap. Then he shows her how to leap down the stairs.This book is a very nicely written book. It really has a way to get to you. Like when it says, \\"and hunting season was over.\\" You get a sigh of relief, because you know, \\"Yes! Now Ralph Preek can't kill the goose!\\" but then Ralph sets his watch five minutes slow so hunting season is still going! You become overwhelmed with things to say like, \\"That's not fair!\\" or, \\"That's against the law!\\" you get extremely intense. I think that shows a good book, because that must be hard to do.Eleanor reminds me of my sister. Always standing up for me, and never scared to try something new. She can get mad, but she's mostly nice, just like Eleanor.Georgie reminds me of Stanley, in the beginning of the book Holes. Stanley is unpopular and he doesn't have any friends. Georgie is really unpopular also, and she wouldn't even think of having friends.Its funny, when I read the sentence \\"Hard work was something Miss Prawn knew how to do\\", on page 36, the first think I thought of was my mom and dad. They work their heads off taking impeccable care of me and three other children.I don't think that you will ever find a book like this one, so if you want a good book to read, pick this one. Don't worry, it has an interesting ending, which is like no other book I've read, so I don't think I can relate to any other book. You'll have to read this supreme book that is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"The Fledgling is truly amazing! I think that every book is unique in its own way, and this book is definately in my top ten favorite book list. This book is so wonderful that it makes you feel as if you could talk to geese and fly, but only while you're reading it, and that's why it's great. This book is so amazing and wonderful. My friends say that this book is ha ha funny because this girl (Georgie) talks to a goose,flies with a goose, and keeps hurting herself because she jumps of a staircase thinking she can fly. I must admit that at some points it was funny, but I like books that make you laugh. ...it's my #5 favorite book, and that's not bad.

It wonderfully captures the feelings of a chld who yearns for things that adult sensibilty considers impossible. I remember playing w/ Maple seed helicopters because of it, but I think anyone will be able to relate to her desire to fly, and for companionship in her lonely life. At the time, I didn't notice that it was well-written, but looking back, the images seem vivid. I remember crying at the end. Readers who like stories of children who befriend and fly w/ wild geese may also enjoy The Wonderful Adventures of Nils by Selma Lagerlof, which also has a strong emphasis on nature."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"I loved this book.

Chelsea - 10 years old"},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"I read this book sometime in the fourth grade. I only read it one time, even though I am an avid re-reader. It was mostly that the entire content of this novel was impressed upon my mind and I never felt the need to go back and relive it. It's a very memorable book, and even now at the age of 21 (it's been 10! years) I remember this book fondly.It's a beautiful, engrossing story that can be enjoyed by literary minded children everywhere. I noticed another reviewer give this book a negative review, because her child was very upset by the ending of this book. I read \\"Bridge to Terrabithia\\" at the same age, and I cannot help make connections between the book. I'm pretty sure the reason why people dislike this book is the same reason why people disliked \\"Bridge\\" (and likely the same people would dislike both). Even though I brought the other book up, this novel is miles ahead of \\"Bridge\\" and is a much better read.I distinctly remember sitting down to read this book at night, and not being able to put it down until the end. Of course, at that time I was crying so hard I could barely breathe. If you buy this book for a middle school aged child, probably expect waterworks at the end.Despite the fact that I bawled for hours like a little baby after reading this book, I want to impress upon you that it was amazing and touching. I loved the juxtaposition between the little girl's fantasy life, and the cold, impartial world that the adults lived in. It's a beautiful, sad story and I'd recommended it to any child who liked to read. I'd say this novel is enjoyable in the same way as \\"Tuck Everlasting\\" to give another comparison. The ending is sad but the book is still timeless and enjoyable.Just remember to buy some tissues!"},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"I read this book 20 years ago as a 9-10 year old and it is still one of the books that moved me most as a child. I read an enormous amount as a kid but this book is always the first that comes to mind when I look back. I remember not being able to put it down in spite of its length and having vivid dreams that I could fly the entire time I was reading it. There is a sad segment of the story, as is true of other award winning children's books like Bridge to Terabithia. But this should not discourage a well-adjusted fourth or fifth grader from reading it."},{"Title":"The Fledgling","review":"Chalk up yet another book in the Kid and Bird category! Eight-year-old Georgie is small and spindly for her age; she looks much younger and even insists that she can fly! Her attempts using the stairs to launch her slender frame into space cause her family (mother, step-father and half siblings) great concern--enough to lead the teenagers to privately form the Georgie Protection Society.When a flock of migrating Canadian geese takes up temporary residence at Walden Pond, she feels an unexplained but special affinity with an old, single gander.The proud loner spots her red hair and tries to make friendly contact with one of humankind's most receptive ambassadors. In her own childish mind she names him the Goose Prince.But other eyes and spying and prying into their private dream world: the snooty new neighbor, Miss Madeline Prawan, who plants plastic roses in her garden! Her boss at the bank, Mr. Ralph Preek, is even worse; he wages an unreasonable but deadly vendetta against the old goose, who is not only harmless, but seems to want to bestow a special gift upon this unqiue child.Can the GPS foil the cruel intentions of enemies of the Goose Prince? Will this little girl really be able to fly, or is it just a a hallucination: if she has lost touch with reality, how about the adults who savor the hunting season? Can profit be made if she turns out to be some kind of levitating saint? And just what is the unique present which the old goose finds, to later share with his flying companion? A curious fantasy for young readers, who will actually learn something about Henry David Thoreau, who immortalized Concord's Walden Pond."},{"Title":"OPERATIONAL RISK","review":"This is a book that has an opinionated point of view. It is not fact based, but rather a comment on the frameworks of operational risk management. Overall, a good learning tool."},{"Title":"The Revival of Pragmatism: New Essays on Social Thought, Law, and Culture (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"This is an excellent and important book of well-written positions from a variety of perspectives. A fan of pragmatism may be turned off by the 2nd through the 6th essays, but of the following 25 at least 23 or 24 are well worth reading. The section on law debates the question of whether philosophy influences or &quot;supports&quot; law. I came away, as I'd been before, convinced that moving to pragmatism in philosophy is likely to have a good effect on legal opinions and that Rorty is absurdly unfair to the value of his own work by stressing that law can get on without traditional philosophy. Of course it can, but what needs to be said is that we would be better off if it did. The concluding essay by Stanley Fish is wonderful and makes a point I've been trying to find someone to agree with for years, namely that religious tolerance is a contradiction in terms; tolerance is a restriction on religion."},{"Title":"The Revival of Pragmatism: New Essays on Social Thought, Law, and Culture (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"The revival of pragmatism, which can largely be traced to Richard Rorty's work provides an important framework for a variety of problems ranging from philosophical, through legal, cultural and literary. For someone who wants a good overview of the debates around pragmatism, this volume provides a good introduction.The variety of essays provides a good selection of the span of modern pragmatist thought. It includes excellent articles by both Rorty and Putnam, who have very different philosophical takes on pragmatism. A few excellent survey articles on the history of pragmatism and articles that engage specific applications of pragmatist thought. As might be expected, the summary article by Stanley Fish is sure to infuriate some readers.This is a book for someone who has a background understanding of pragmatism, but wants to learn more the uses to which it is being put."},{"Title":"Mortal Remains in Maggody","review":"Generally I read pretty heavy murder mysteries (James Patterson, John Sandford, etc.). But now and then I like to take a break from novels that are of course fiction, but are close enough to reality to make you uneasy. The Maggody books are murder mysteries but they are also little gems of cartoon like comedy set in a one stop light town on a not so busy highway. This was my fourth Maggody book and it had all the zany regulars back along with a set of newcomers who supply the book with both victims and suspects. If you're looking for an easy read and a pleasant diversion try this Maggody or any of the three that came before."},{"Title":"Mortal Remains in Maggody","review":"My favorite Maggody story yet, what with hot X-rated action and sexual tension all over town, it seems maggody is ready to have its own soap opera.

A good value."},{"Title":"Wintry Night (Modern Chinese Literature from Taiwan)","review":"Translated from a Taiwanese trilogy, this book has two parts: Part One is the first book of the trilogy, Part Two is the third; the second book of the trilogy was omitted. Unfortunately, an unabridged translated version isn't available.A few pages into the book, I had to draw a family tree. Part One of the book focuses on the extended Peng family, and without writing it all down, the names and relationships would have been a big jumble to me. Part Two shifts the focus onto the extended family of one branch of the Peng family, and I had to draw a whole new family tree to keep up with the story.Before reading this book, I knew very little about the details of how Taiwan was settled by people from China, or of the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. Through the members of one extended family, Part One describes the hardships of those who first opened up aboriginal mountain lands for farming (a period of time that reminded me of the harsh life of American pioneers who moved West into Native American Indian territory). Part Two tells of the difficulties faced by Taiwanese men conscripted into the Japanese army towards the end of World War II. Frequent references were made to the anti-Japanese resistance movement (which reminded me of the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation of France). I would have liked to have read more about the anti-Japanese resistance, but alas, it was the omitted second book of the trilogy that focused on that part of history.Despite finding similarities to other more familiar histories, the stories in Wintry Night are entirely Taiwanese. While the book at times read like a non-fiction account of one family's history, the author interspersed the story with poetic descriptions of the Taiwanese mountains and the spirit of Taiwanese people. One understands how much the environs were an integral part of the lives and livelihood of the early settlers, and how much being Taiwanese (and more specifically, Hakka Chinese) was at the heart of their identities.While Part One told of hardships and struggles, it's clear that hope existed, and perhaps the Peng family would one day prosper. In this part of the book, people seemed to act rashly, and I didn't always understand a person's motivations. I wasn't sure if I was missing something, if the author wasn't developing the characters enough, or if some important detail was lost in the translation.Part Two, meanwhile, was somber and depressing, with graphic descriptions of the casualties of war. Even the rare faint glimmer of hope felt more like a yearning, blind faith rather than a practical possibility. The endings of both parts were poignant and artistically beautiful, but left me feeling empty. As the reader, I knew the family would survive - as they did after every setback - but I still wanted to read more, to find out how they would do it."},{"Title":"Multiagent Systems: A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence","review":"While perhaps this should not be your first book in AI, it should definitely be your first book on agents. It took me years to accumulate the knowledge present in this book, and it's a great survey of the field for the beginning investigator. However, while this is a great way to get started in agents, understand how agents can be used in intelligent applications (from distributed AI type problem solving, to resource optimization problems), and \\"get the agent paradigm,\\" coverage of agent software engineering techniques is light. This is not a fault of this book - you will simply need other resources to understand the difficulties and current research in engineering multi agent systems (or indeed any concurrent distributed system). So if you are trying to figure out what to do with agents, or how agent systems work, this is the book for you. If you already know that and want help with formal specification of an agent, verifying your agents meet the specifications, etc. this is not the book for you. Understand that to build systems you will need both!"},{"Title":"Multiagent Systems: A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence","review":"Thogh edited the book looks like a single authored text.

Originally titled, &quot;My Uncle Peter&quot; this Victorian Christmas story was published in 1870 and recounts the heart-tugging adventures of a badly-abused street urchin who is adopted by a kindly gentlemen, then viciously, greedily kidnapped.MacDonald 's literature (mainly for adults) exerted a great influence on subsequent writers, who freely admit the importance of his literary legacy. C.S. Lewis regards him as his master, claiming to have quoted from him in almost all his books. JRR Tolkien used his work as a measuring stick for his own writitng in Lord of the Rings. MacDonald himself claims that he writes not for children, but for the childlike.Named Little Christmas this pitiful waif is a character out of Dickens; she inspires both evil and generous reactions in those she meets, while suffering great injustice with stocisim. This story transports the reader back into violent times, with an ingenuous heroine and a tender benefactor. A delightful book to remind us of Christian charity and rekindle the flame of Christmas generosity."},{"Title":"The Letters of James and Peter","review":"I have read many commentaries and Barclay and John MacArthur are the best in my opinion.

I was astonished to learn how much important just these three books (James, First Peter, Second Peter) are for the Christian thought and the Christian faith and, equally astonished,at the wealth of information a scholar, the like of William Barclay, can pour in a commentary the size of this one. This is a work of art as far as erudition goes but, most importantly, it is a spring of refreshing and still pertinent Christian thought. I would have loved to make the acquaintance of such a learned and profoundly Christian character as the author of this book, Mr William Barclay.It is a beautifully worded book, highly readable and, also, it is a complete success as far as bringing, what could be termed as highly technical concepts (including etymology and semantics of mostly Greek words) into a lay people level of comprehension.

Also a chapter discusses how to grow your own food for economical and ecological reasons. I think one of the best Chapters of the book is Chapter 9. It is called &quot;Clean Enough.&quot; This chapter discusses Americans' fetish with anti-bacterial products. However, I found some of the tips in this book to be obscure for somebody like me (21-year-old college student with a part-time job). One of these tips was to wash your hair once every three days. That would create a problem for myself because I am judged upon my appreance where I work. I also dislike to let my hair get oily and greasy looking. I think probably the worst thing about this book is the tip on how to make your own sanitary napkins. I can understand the reasoning behind this idea but it is hardly practical for somebody like me. That part kind of made me sick. If EVERYONE on the planet followed the guidlines in this book the world would be cleaner and perhaps more enjoyable. Though, I am not sure if everyone in the world would find these suggestions practical and worth the time. If you are interested in reading the book then buy it. I enjoyed reading it, and it did enlighten me."},{"Title":"How to Live Green, Cheap & Happy","review":"This book offers some insightful information although i don't think the value is really worth it.

Set in the village of Suez in the fictional state of Dixie, the novel revolves around the coming of age of its hero, John March. As a young southerner, March struggles to develop his own value system when confronted with the questionable ethics of his father's slaveholding generation, as well as the corruption of both blacks and whites in the New South. When John March, Sr. dies, John Jr. becomes involved in a scheme to industrialize Widewood, his family plot. His earnest desire to grow into a gentleman, coupled with his bumbling naivet&eacute;, saves John from corruption, and he remains an endearing character surrounded by individuals intent on swindling away his land. Even his mother cannot be trusted; she enters into a clandestine engagement with General Garnet, a neighbor who is chiefly responsible for John's lost inheritance. The land is returned to the March name when General Garnet's daughter, Barbara, goes against her father and alerts John to his fraudulent dealings. Barbara ultimately emerges as the novel's heroine as well as John's love.John March, Southerner was not a popular success, nor was it well received by contemporary critics. Though ambitious in its attack of the New South's corruption, the novel has been criticized for lacking clarity. Cable's efforts toward realism are overshadowed by the text's romantic structure, particularly when details of Barbara and John's budding relationship obscure plot resolution. However, Louis Rubin argues that the novel deserves reconsideration for Cable's realistic character portrayal. Cable did not rely on stock characters; rather, he drew from his own experience of Reconstruction. Paving the way for William Faulkner, Cable depicted in General Garnet a former Confederate general who abuses his power and position in his small town. In Cornelius Leggett, he offers the portrait of a former slave who becomes a blackmailing, greedy politician. John March's mother, Daphne, is rather humorously sketched as a southern matron who stakes her reputation on her miserable poetry and incessant hypochondria. In each of these portraits, Cable infuses frankness, humor, and psychological complexity, imparting a realistic dimension to his work that is reminiscent of his good friend, Henry James. However, Cable is most often celebrated for his use of dialect and his earlier foray into local color fiction."},{"Title":"Horsemen of the Plains","review":"This is my absolute favorite book of all time. The book carries you away in its fantasy and innocence. The characters are warm and likeable and it gives you a different perspective than you normally see of early America. It is a book you will long remember and want to read again and again."},{"Title":"The Spy Next Door (Five Star Expressions)","review":"Author of three romantic spy novels under the pseudonym of Hope Starr, Hope Hathaway lives in Bearsville, New York raising her fifth grade son Theodore by herself and driving the school bus. She does not trust men ever since her ex spouse Robert walked out on her after cheating while she gave birth.Moving into her Uncle Cary's B&B; is hunk Chandler Adams, who informs her that he is an international spy going domestic. She assumes somehow he knows about her other life and has a sense of humor. Still when he leaves for Manhattan, she decides to be just like her heroine Sela Theodore and follow him. However, she soon learns that the glamorous world of her novels is not quite the same inside a musty car trunk. Already realizing she is involved and wanting to keep her safe, Chandler decides to let Hope stay by him as he works to uncover to break up an art fraud ring, but finds he loves sharing under the cover work even inside car trunks with Hope at his side.Though Hope trailing Chandler seems out of character for this single suburban mom, THE SPY NEXT DOOR is a tongue in cheek undercover romance. The lighthearted story line is fun as Chandler tells Hope he is a spy just in from the cold and she reacts by spying on him, which leads to both into trouble. Fans of blithe romantic romps will appreciate this second chance at love starring a debonair former spy turned under the cover operative and an author no longer in the cold when it comes to warm relationships with her man.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A display of Arminianism","review":"His first published treatise and where he exposits Reformed vs Aminianism thoroughly.

Anybody who has tried their hand at role-playing, Star Wars fandom, gaming (or other) conventions, computer gaming, or other such geeky pursuits will easily identify with John Kovalic's understanding of Dorks. Guys involved in these hobbies will certainly understand Matt's (one of the main characters) difficulties in meeting women with similar interests, as well as his agonies as a gamemaster.His fabulous sense of humor is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enjoying his comic. Give in to the dork side! It's worth the meager cost of this trade paperback."},{"Title":"Dork Covenant (Dork Tower, Vol. 1)","review":"John Kovalic's &quot;Dork Tower&quot; is more than a niche-market comic for wargamers and sci-fi fans. It's a big-hearted and utterly hilarious comic for anyone who feels a little outside of the mainstream and is trying to make sense of the craziness of the world around them. Kovalic doesn't just joke about the gaming world and it's complex politics and humor. Kovalic takes aim at holiday consumerism, the World Wide Web, rampant media hype and stereotyping, the XFL, and the joys of working in retail. If you are a gamer, you'll love &quot;Dork Tower&quot;. If you haven't gamed in a while, it'll re-awaken the urge to roll D-20's on a Friday night. If you've never gamed, you'll still get a great big laugh!"},{"Title":"Dork Covenant (Dork Tower, Vol. 1)","review":"Don't let the cover fool you. This is not an adventure tale. No, this is the story of some ordinary people (at least they think they are ordinary) who share a common hobby/lifestyle. They like games and they, like real gamers, tend to spend a lot of money and time on them.The book is a collection of strips of various lengths that center around gaming and its effects. Anyone who has met a beanie-baby collector with be familiar with the types of personalities portrayed.This volume opens with some interesting jokes about how gamers are viewed by non gamers (no true fan of anything is ever fully understood by a non-fan), and continues with high humor (extreme lack of puns despite the title) and plenty of laughs. No topics are sacred as everything is spoofed from friendships, relationships, movies, dating, stereotypes, and fanaticism to, uh, well, games.Very funny for anyone who knows that the game world is populated by more than Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers."},{"Title":"Dork Covenant (Dork Tower, Vol. 1)","review":"A great collection of comics about a group of gamers and their antics.

Discussions around the movie that have taken place at the time of its release and today have altered significantly. And that is what the book reflects on. Arthur Penn's essay in the collection gives an enlightening impression on the making of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and describes the difficulties connected with the production of the film. His and David Newman's (who is analyzing the on going discussion of what &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is really about)pieces stand in refreshing contrast to the &quot;academic&quot; interpretations of the movie, because they reveal more than a view from outside that only sees the movie and succeed in giving a feeling for the artistic process instead of just analysing the final result. Steven Alan Carr's and Stephen Prince's essays offer wonderful contextualizations by looking at &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; in the context of the film's influence on and from society and the film's influence on violence in American film history. This is for sure one of the books one should read in an attempt to understand &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; in its historical context and its significance for American film history. And it is not only a source of knowledge and thought it's definitely also a lot of fun."},{"Title":"If All the Swords in England: A Story of Thomas Becket (Living History Library)","review":"Barbara Willard's If All the Swords in England, first published in 1961, makes a happy comeback in this quality paperback edition by Bethlehem Books.The drama unfolds during the turbulent years of the argument between King Henry II Plantagenet and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, concerning juridical authority in church matters.After the tragic deaths of their parents, brothers Simon and Edmund Audemer are separated. Edmund becomes a page in the court of King Henry II, while Simon becomes a scribe in the household of Thomas Becket.Willard's use of the literary device of the two brothers allows the reader a &quot;first-hand&quot; glimpse into both the characters of Thomas Becket and Henry II as well as into the climate of the times.The book is full of exciting episodes (including a miracle), and interesting characters. Barbara Willard's If All the Swords in England presents a timeless story of courage and conscience. It is also an excellent introduction to the heavier Becket by Anouilh and T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral. Grades 5-7."},{"Title":"If All the Swords in England: A Story of Thomas Becket (Living History Library)","review":"If All the Swords in England tells the well-known tale of St. Thomas Becket and King Henry II through the eyes of two twin brothers, Simon and Edmund. Separated in their youth by the death of their parents, Simon, who is lame in one hand, becomes a servant to Becket the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury. He witnesses the sufferings of the Archbishop's household in France and the numerous attempts to bring about a reconciliation between the estranged churchman and his sovereign.Meanwhile, Edmund comes of age in the royal court. He sees first hand the rages of a king obsessed with protecting his royal power and extending it even into the realm of the Church. The King will not reconcile with his former friend due to Thomas's insistence on standing up for the honor of God.This book starts off slow but the climax is exceptionally well done--even if you know what's coming. In St. Thomas Becket, one can see a reflection of Christ, who fearlessly stood face-to-face with brutal, murderous men having nothing to defend himself with but the cross. All in all, this book is a fine introduction to the life of a very admirable man, and is easily read by young folks 12 and up."},{"Title":"If All the Swords in England: A Story of Thomas Becket (Living History Library)","review":"The story was well told. It pointed out many of the traditions of the church at the time."},{"Title":"If All the Swords in England: A Story of Thomas Becket (Living History Library)","review":"Even if you know what happens to Becket, Willard weaves a fascinating tale of drama and intrigue. Henry II and Thomas Becket are locked in a battle of the wills. Henry is determined to win, but will he? Henry II wants more power. Becket believes Henry's thirst for power has extended too far when he wants to include Church matters.Even though we learn about the raging battle between Henry II and Thomas Becket, the story centers around Simon and his twin brother Edmund. Tragically, Simon and Edmund are orphaned. Where will they go? Who will they live with? Sadly, they are unable to stay together. Simon eventually enters the household of Thomas Becket as a scribe. Edmund enters the service of Henry II as a page. They provide eye-witness accounts into the personalities of Henry and Thomas and their ongoing dispute.Willard not only outlines the facts of the case, she also engages the heart of the reader. We sympathize with Simon's suffering, the loss of his family and his inability to use his hand. In doing so, we also see gain compassion for Becket and his dilemma. Through Simon's compassion for others, we come to admire Simon's noble spirit.Willard expertly educates by entertaining the reader. We learn about Henry inflicting his impulsive, raging temper on innocent lives and the devastating impact it has on them through his whims and forced marches, resulting in death to many. Most people just know that Henry and Thomas disagreed, through this story we learn how far ranging the effect of his temper had on others.Willard accomplishes what few children's authors are able to do; She holds the interest of adults as well as children. She creates a story that holds the reader's attention, by developing a multilevel story that engages the heart and mind. We not only learn about Henry II and Thomas Becket, but we also learn about the greatness of the human heart, the strength of character to stay true to conscience, and the value of a loving family."},{"Title":"Wealth on Minimal Wage","review":"I was disappointed in the book. Perhaps I've already read too many financial books, but I honestly didn't get any new good ideas from this book. One of his ideas really concerns me - Mr. Steamer offers that if one is fairly young, in good health, and has no family history of health problems, he/she could consider going without health insurance (in effect, they become self insured paying their own costs out of pocket). He doesn't explictedly recommend this, but he does offer it as a potential cost saving. I believe this is a bad idea, since a major medical emergency (although perhaps remote), would lead to financial ruin. It's just too great a risk in my opinion. I should add I'm in no way affliated with the healthcare or insurance industry. I also believe that most financial planners would agree with me that this is a bad idea.The other thing that bothers me about the book is that we're to believe Mr. Steamer somehow managed to sock away $250,000 over a ten year period with a cumulative gross salary of only $220,000 for a family of three. At one time, I tried to live by myself on an annual salary of less than 17K and it was difficult (and I consider myself a pretty frugal person). The book offers cost savings tips and financial advice, but I don't see how you could achieve what Mr. Steamer claims he has even if you used all of his ideas. I guess that was the biggest problem I had with the book. That fact kept bothering me as I read more of the book. Perhaps Mr. Steamer should have included some more factual information on how he himself achieved all that wealth. I wouldn't have been so bothered if he claimed to have gotten real lucky in the stock market, bought a house at auction for next to nothing and fixed it up himself, etc."},{"Title":"Wealth on Minimal Wage","review":"Mr.Steamer's suggestions imply that in order to become a millionare, one must be essentially perfect and alone- that is, having no health problems, minimal bills, no family, and find the cheapest place to live. I think it can be assumed that if one were to live alone and have perfect health in the cheapest city in the world and not spend their money on frivelous things, they too could be a millionare. Personally, I would rather sacrifice the millions of dollars that James Steamer claims I can make, and rather have a family, accept my imperfect health (and treat it with the backing of health insurance), and spend money on fast food or an occassional movie once in awhile."},{"Title":"Wealth on Minimal Wage","review":"This is an excellent book for families to read. Especially husbands! Jim Steamer takes a common-sense approach and I'm impressed that he's actually achieving financial independence in spite of low-paying jobs. It just proves to me that it CAN be done. It was inspiring to me to know that sometimes a low-paying job can be seen as a &quot;temporary&quot; choice if it gives you control of your time and your life. The only reason I didn't give this book a &quot;10&quot; is because the one thing I didn't find in Jim Steamer's book was more background about what motivated him or his wife's comments or input. However, I was glad to find this in &quot;Woman's Day&quot; magazine, the September 1, 1997 issue.

The explanations of high school or 1st semester calculus are reasonably succint and clear. I will be commencing multivariate calculus shortly and coverage seems adequate for that as well. There are truly a vast number of problems so I find it helpful for reviewing earlier subjects in preparation for my next course.I strongly recommend the Kindle version (which only works on the iPad or computer please note) as it is a fascimile of the written book but without the weight.

I spend a great deal of time referring to other text. &quot;Advanced Mathematics A Precalculus Course&quot; by Richard G. Brown and David P.Robbins has been very helpful. I found there is not enough examples or explanations. I found explainations before the examples, not hints with them, more useful."},{"Title":"CALCULUS","review":"In taking the whole calculus sequence, teachers have pretty much forced me to buy a calculus book with every new class I took. I bought Anton's Calculus With Analytic Geometry for my first calculus class ever and throughout the following courses, I have always relied on it to explain to me what isn't explained in other calculus textbooks. It is not only a classic, but in my opinion, it's the best there is on the subject.By the way, the companion's books written by James E. Ward, are also great books. They take the reader into greater depth in understanding Anton's examples and explanations.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"CALCULUS","review":"I have used Anton's Calculus texts off and on from the first edition. He is far and away the best writer I've ever used. Particularly helpful is the way topics in a chapter flow one into another.It is always difficult for 3-semester or 4-quarter courses to decide on a sequence of topics. Anton's choices in the fifth edition are different from what I would prefer, but they are acceptable to many programs. Regardless, he is again strong on the many ways he encourages and develops his readers' intuitive understanding of fundamental calculus ideas. My own students have actually come to believe that they can READ a calculus text because of Howard Anton."},{"Title":"CALCULUS","review":"This is really a great book. I learned calculus from this book 20 years ago, and now, as I relearn it, I use it again. The writing is clear, and the examples progress from the easy to the difficult. If you are studying on your own, I recommend getting this or any other old edition of the book, along with the teacher's manual that has every problem solved. (If you're teaching yourself calculus, you do not need the latest and greatest book. Save your money and buy an old classic like this. If you can't find the complete user manual, consider ordering it through your library using an interlibrary loan.If you are inquisitive, sometimes, along the way, you might have an idea about something and want to test it out; for this I recommend either alpha.wolfram.com or Mathematica. You could use a graphing calculator instead of these, but Mathematica is extremely powerful. If you're not ready to buy Mathematica, alpha.wolfram.com is an excellent substitute.The one flaw in this book that I suspect many books share is the fragmented way in which it approaches integration techniques. The books teaches around 10 methods for integration, and it's difficult to remember them all. However, I am not sure what could be done to improve this, so I don't deduct anything for this.A great feature of the book is that towards the latter part of the exercises, you are generally forced to reuse old skills that you may have started to forget. For instance, you may be working on integration techniques but then have to find the surface area of a solid of revolution, forcing you to recall how to set up that integral.Finally, I'll say that I'm slightly prejudiced, because I learned calculus from this book (or one edition earlier) years ago."},{"Title":"CALCULUS","review":"Let me start by saying that I have tried reading several Calculus books and have found them to be either too vague and/or not analytical enough from a student's point of view. But with Howard Anton's Calculus books, especially if used in conjunction with the Comapnion books, learning calculus becomes very imformative and fun.

Throughout the 1880s Cruse participated in a number of campaigns against the Apache: the Cibecue Expedition in 1881, the Big Dry Wash campaign in 1882 (where he won the Medal of Honor), and a number of other campaigns throughout the Southwest. He married in 1882 and his wife accompanied him throughout his years of service. In the 1890s he was appointed to the Quartermaster Corps (an assignment he didn't relish) and served as chief quartermaster during the Spanish-American conflict. He spent time in Manila and retired from the army in 1918.Most of this memoir deals with Cruse's years in the Southwest. A professional soldier, he makes no bones about his duties as an Indian fighter; political and social issues are not his concern. He gives a good picture of life at Fort Apache (and other camps), on the trail during campaigns, and encounters with \\"the enemy,\\" which included Victorio and Geronimo. He also gives first-hand accounts of Generals Crook and Miles, and was particularly impressed with the leadership abilities of General Eugene Carr, especially at Cibecue. Cruse is a clear, objective writer, and the book is informative and interesting. A major disappointment is the lack of an index. Otherwise this is a good account of an army officer's reminiscences of the Indian campaigns in the Southwest during the 1880s."},{"Title":"Apache Days and after","review":"This book chronicles the travels of a young - then older, Cavalry Officer in New Mexico, west Texas, and eastern Arizona during the second half of the 19th century.Being a resident of New Mexico for the past 40+ years, I was struck by two things in this book.First, the great distances these people traveled via horseback, and the surprising speed, in some cases. Secondly, the travels were easy to follow because many of the communities mentioned still exist to this day!!

One thing was that the main character (Francis Tucket) was the oldest of the three kids a brother (Billy) and a sister (Lottie). All alone in the middle of no ware running away from the Comanchero outlaws a ruthless gang. Then they make it to the forest they where trying to reach. They set up camp and Francis went out away from camp and hunted a deer but it didn't die until twenty minutes after Francis shot it.

SPOILER ALERT*)Book #4, \\"Tucket's Gold\\", starts with Francis, Lottie and Billie in the desert plains, on foot and without food and water. They are moving as fast as they can, hoping to evade the Comancheros who still hope to sell them to the Comanches.This book, for a change, is a little slower paced than it's siblings. Not that there isn't excitement, but it's time for Lottie and Billie to 'come into their own', and for the reader to learn a little more about the Pueblo Indians.For myself, I really enjoyed this book, and thought the ending was fantastic.It's a good series for younger readers. As I've noted before, the 4th graders at my children's school all read the series.

And when easterner Madeline Hammond gets off the train near midnight and things begin to happen right away, you know that this is going to be a good one. Gene Stewart, the other half of the romance is a man's man with the traditional western values but who has at first kind of lost his way because of drinking too much. But that gets straightened out through the love of a woman. The cast of characters includes some cowboys, old time cowboys, you will never forget. There's an animal, a magnificent horse, in the story; an automobile, driven by a cowboy who loves to go fast and scare his passengers, and this plays a vital role in the climax of the story as only ZG can describe and tell it. This is another of his books which take place in contemporary times, written when these events were playing themselves out along the US-Mexico border. This is another of his books which is told primarily from the woman's perspective and would indeed appeal to the female reader; it's NOT a bang, bang shoot'em up with street duels and impossible violence, but realistic characters and events.

What is it that makes a person evil? That is at the heart of Breitman's absorbing book. Unlike a devilish Faustian caricature, the narrative shows the SS Reichsfuehrer, a mundane, pedantic organizer who came terrifyingly close to translating Hitler's vision of of a \\"racially-pure\\" Europe into reality.Heinrich Himmler may be the personification of Hannah Arendt's \\"banality of evil.\\" A man who fawned over children, stopped to pick flowers and was every thoughtful with those under him, quietly and efficiently produced the machinery to send millions to their death.(...) Breitman's book is not a \\"popular biography\\" in the modern sense, but rather a scholarly and academic treatment. However, this is a weighty subject and the author accomplishes much more with this approach through a fascinating narrative that assures the reader that this is an exquisititely researched picture of one of the most dispised personalities of modern time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)","review":"Not a biography of the Reichsfuhrer, but a carefully researched and annotated analysis of his role in the final solution. Himmler's own office logs and appointment books, where extant, are convincingly used. The most thorough account to date of the so called Madagscar proposal which preoccupied the nazis in the late 1930s as a way of exiling Jews. Himmler's often mutually suspicious dealings with underlings such as Heydrich and Eichmann are particularly well portrayed, although his relationship with Hitler is sometimes sketchy. The years 1944 and 1945 are treated rather briefly, presumably because Himmler's initiatives were mainly restricted to trying to arrange coverup of the atrocities. But Breitman has done a first rate job in showing us how Himmler's bureaucratic mind ticked. The book illustrates that you don't need to be a personal sadist to organize murder on a massive scale."},{"Title":"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)","review":"A common misconception regarding \\"The Final Solution\\" is that it was constructed and sought out under the leadership of one man, Adolph Hitler. Richard Breitman, in his well written book, clearly shows his readers the involvement of several brilliant minds that eventually created the horrific answer to the Jewish question. Breitman goes through the progressive steps of Heinrich Himmler's ideas as well as his involvement in the \\"Final Solution\\" while keeping his readers full attention. Unlike many authors writing about this issue, Breitman seemed as if he, through his work, was attempting to see Himmler's view points instead of labeling him simply as a \\"sadist barbarian\\" as many would do. His ability to put aside the atrocities performed by the Nazi's and give his reader's an alternate route of understanding is just one of the reasons why I consider this book a success and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)","review":"\\"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution\\", Richard Breitman, 250 pgs, Glossary, Notes & Index, 6\\" x 9\\".Author or co-author of 3 prior books on socialist Germany & Jewry issues, this Yale & Harvard degreed Professor Breitman provides a scholarly analysis of Nazi Germany with especial reference to the 3 principals: - the Triumvirate of Hitler, Himmler (SS) & Heydrich (SD) & the roles each played formulating plans of re-Germanization that encompassed comprehesive plans to (1) purify Germanic Nordic blood lines by eugenic measures, (2) eliminate those designated as enemies of the Reich (Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Slavs, etc.) & (3) provide Lebensraum, especially Eastward for expansion of the Fatherland.The book profiles Heinrich Himmler as a cradle-Catholic turning into a militant anti-Catholic & anti-Semitic who participates in Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch, & in short order becomes Reich Fuehrer SS, Chief of all Police, & confidant of Hitler. In 11 chapters we are introduced to the origin, delineation, & execution of the \\"Final Solution\\" to solve the \\"Jewish Question.\\" The author attempts to demonstrate authorship of the genocide design & of its implementation was really a product more of Himmler's that Hitler's. Diverse details are provided on alternative plans including deportations to Africa or Madagascar, types of gasings, exclusions from euthanasia, labor camps, etc. All in all, the author's arguements are detailed but sufficiently conjectural as to make for good reading but truly falling short of singling out Himmler as chief architect. Of the many books on the Holocaust & Final Solution, Bretman's is the most detailed accounting of alternative plans and details unanticipated problems not forseen in ethnic cleansing & military in-fighting, etc. A good read for the student of genocide."},{"Title":"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)","review":"Unfortunately, Breitman repeats the Nazi-propaganda canard of Poles killing several thousand Germans, at Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) as fact (p. 70). Otherwise, this book seems to be free of obvious errors. The author traces Nazi German policies against various groups, with especial attention paid to the Jews. He also provides information relevant to the Jedwabne massacre without mentioning it. He shows that the Germans tried to disguise their first wave of murders of Jews, at the start of Operation Barbarossa, as the work of locals acting alone (p. 172, 207).Breitman (pp. 19-21) addresses the debate as to whether the term Holocaust should refer only to the Jewish or to all the victims of the Nazis. He believes that the extermination of the Jews is sui generis in many ways (p. 21), for example, because: \\"The Nazis are not known to have spoken of the Final Solution of the Polish problem or of the gypsy problem.\\" (p. 20). Yet he demolishes his own argument in several ways. To begin with, he elsewhere tacitly acknowledges that his is an argument from silence: \\"Other cases of genocide in history have not left much evidence of advance plans either.\\" (p. 27). There is also the problem of semantics: \\"Could one really say that Hitler had already decided upon genocide? A lot depends on what constitutes a decision. Is it a decision if a person keeps an idea firmly in his mind but tells no one about it and does nothing about it? Or is the decision made only when the individual begins to commit himself--not necessarily to start the executions, but at least to commit time and resources to the preparations?\\" (p. 27). Finally, there is the question of earnestness: \\"With mass murder or even genocide, however, there is a huge gulf between talk and action.\\" (p. 63). Considering the many European Jews still left alive at the end of the war, can it definitely be said that the Germans were really serious about exterminating ALL known and accessible European Jews?Breitman shows that exterminatory plans against Jews developed gradually (p. 206) and, by implication, so did parallel exterminatory plans against Poles: \\"Anyone planning a campaign of mass murder had to start thinking on a smaller scale than the continent.\\"(p. 65). Also: \\"If the Polish intelligentsia was now being killed off, could large number of Jews be far behind?\\" (p. 104). One could just as easily reword this: \\"If the Polish intelligentsia was now being killed off, could large numbers of other Poles be far behind?\\"In many places in his book, Breitman undermines the Holocaust-uniqueness argument by acknowledging that the Poles were seen as a problem (that, by implication, demanded an eventual solution) no less so than the Jews: \\"[In addressing Mussolini] Himmler added that this also meant solving the Polish question, the Slavic question, and the Jewish question.\\" (p. 92). Also: \\"Next he [Himmler] explained that the Fuhrer had had given him the task of resolving the Eastern situation, which was not so much a political problem as a racial problem.\\" (p. 113). Finally: \\"The eastern races posed another major obstacle to Hitler's and Himmler's racial and geopolitical goals.\\" (p. 246).Pointedly, the destruction of one group (the Jews) cannot be dichotomized from the eventual destruction of other groups: \\"There was a logical as well as a technological link between Nazi euthanasia and genocide. The Nazi concept of a healthy and pure German Volk excluded a number of groups. Within Germany itself, the misfits were the mentally disturbed and physically deformed, the criminals and those considered socially deviant, and, of course, Jews and gypsies. Outside of Germany or in the annexed territories were Poles, Czechs, and other Slavs, whose racial status was regarded as inferior. Their treatment depended in part on Nazi plans for their territories and in part on how usefully they could serve the Nazi was machine. Actions to clear the Third Reich of all these groups--either by expulsion, sterilization, imprisonment in concentration camps, or mass murder--were part of the same effort to purify and extend the German race.\\" (p. 91).Ironically, during the early years of the Nazi occupation of Poland, some German officials had recommended that Jews be better treated than Poles because of their economic productivity (p. 85, 119). Otherwise, the Germans never attributed any more inherent worth to Poles than to Jews. For instance, in sharp contrast with the fear of the \\"race defilement\\" of Germans, the Nazis saw no problem of interbreeding between Poles and Jews (p. 138).So Poles and Jews became \\"unequal victims\\" owing solely to practical considerations. Already in 1940, Hans Frank had concluded that the Polish population was too large to be exterminated under existing conditions (p. 97). There was also the problem of keeping genocide secret (p. 207). Even the earlier resettlement of Jews to the Lublin region had generated unfavorable publicity for Germany (p. 120). Mass gassings became attractive because of their relative unobtrusiveness compared to the earlier-used mass shootings (p. 92). But if the extermination of a few million Jews couldn't finally be kept secret, how much less the extermination of tens of millions of Poles!Hitler himself juxtaposed the eventual fate of the Poles at the hands of the Germans with the extermination of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks: \\"...with the order to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish race or language. Only in such a way will we win the vital space that we need. Who still talks nowadays of the extermination of the Armenians?\\" (p. 43). In addition: \\"...a Swiss doctor named Theo Lang...told a British Secret Service agent in December 1941 that he knew definitely that Himmler's staff had been considering \`for a long time' the sterilization of all adult Poles.\\" (p. 153). Odilo Globocnik also had plans for the extermination of Poles (p. 186)."},{"Title":"The Architect of Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution (Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)","review":"The author was very honest about any biases, hypothesis, and lack of information (i.e. paper trails or interviews).

My daughter says she enjoys the information in the book.Thank you so much. Beverly"},{"Title":"Think Yourself to Health, Wealth, & Happiness: The Best of Dr. Joseph Murphy's Cosmic Wisdom","review":"Here is another take of the Law of Attraction. The author, Dr. Joseph Murphy, is \\"D.D., D.R.S., Ph. D., LL.D.\\" (the author seems to have refused to release his bio, so I don't know the specifics of these titles, such as when and where he received them) In addition to the term \\"Law of Attraction,\\" he uses terms such as \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" (which is the title of his million seller book, first published in 1963, and still available in paperback), but you will find he is talking about the same thing.The Law of Attraction is a natural law and it is working always whether someone believes in it or not. Just as the law of gravity is working always. The question for us is: how can we use it to our favor? How can we effectively attract the things we want?This book offers many easy-to-use techniques and encouraging real-life examples of those who used the Law well. For example, he points out the most effective time to do affirmation is just before sleep, when our consciousness is off guard. He presents several success stories with this technique, including the man who found the rare book he had been searching for months to no avail until he tried this.Another technique I like is to use words like \\"love\\" \\"abundance\\" \\"radiant health\\" in affirmation and meditation so that my subconscious mind soak up the idea of the words. This seems to help my mind, which often wander off to worry and fear, to get back to the right path. In time, I think it will be my second nature to think from these principles, which the author calls \\"God's principles.\\"This book is the compilation of the author's various works. As such, it is like flipping through a magazine - it works well to get the tips and reminders, but if you want to follow the author's way of thinking, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind may be a better choice. I have both. For me, The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is not very enjoyable to read because the paperback is printed on low-quality paper. Also, if you are interested in how the Law of Attraction can be explained scientifically, maybe with quantum physics, there are other resources that came out in recent years, and more will be coming as this is an area where science has a lot to explore.(I am giving three stars because this book doesn't have the power likeThe Secret. Still it is a good read. We need ways to stay in the right track, and this book will help you)"},{"Title":"Think Yourself to Health, Wealth, & Happiness: The Best of Dr. Joseph Murphy's Cosmic Wisdom","review":"I rely so heavily on the reviews posted at Amazon that I didn't order this book for years, even though it kept popping up as a recommendation, because nobody had written a review of it. I'm writing this in hopes of keeping other readers from making a similar mistake.This book is an absolute treasure. I don't post many reviews but I own at least 100 books by Joseph Murphy, Ernest Holmes, Catherine Ponder, Eric Butterworth, Sanaya Roman, Frederick Bailes, Story Waters, et al, and I have to say that this is well up in my Top Ten favorites. It's a fantastic distillation of Joseph Murphy's wisdom; I've used it both as a reference for just a single paragraph to think about and as a fascinating read when the house is quiet and I can really take in all these brilliant thoughts.I love this book so much...

In this section, he covers the power of thoughts, affirmations, belief, prayer, forgiveness, desire, gratitude and many other powerful concepts.In the second part of the book, he talks about how to enrich your life by using the power of your subconscious mind. Here, he covers how to overcome worry, fear and negative thinking. He also talks about how to achieve prosperity, self-acceptance and healthy relationships, among other topics.He pulls together some of Dr. Murphy's greatest quotes, like \\"When you think negatively about others, the trouble is in your own thought life. Other people are not responsible for the way you think about them. There is no one to change but yourself.\\"Of course, to really delve into Dr. Murphy's thinking, you should read his books (especially \\"The Power of Your Subconscioius Mind\\"), but Morgan does a good job of compiling Dr. Murphy's greatest insights."},{"Title":"Think Yourself to Health, Wealth, & Happiness: The Best of Dr. Joseph Murphy's Cosmic Wisdom","review":"My Mother told me that she was ordering this book for me as a gift.

I would recommend these books. Also Learn how use meditation to talk to your subconscious mind. I had a eye problem (where every time I look to the right, I would see two of everything) which I was told by specialist could not be fixed. Well my vision is perfect now again. These books helped.1)Think yourself to health wealth and happiness2)Turbo success how to reprogram the human biocomputerHere is some of the helpful points.Thoughts repeatedly sent to your subconscious are accepted as true and brought into reality.To affirm is to state that it is so, and as you maintain this attitude of mind as true, regardless of all evidence to the contrary, you will receive an answer to your prayer.Your thoughts can create. It doesn't matter how often you may have used your mind in a negative and destructive manner. The minute you begin to use it in the right way, right result follow.Faith is accepting as true that which your reason and senses deny. Whatever you mentally accept and feel to be true come to pass. It is not what you profess to believe with your lips that matters. What matters is the belief deep down in your heart that is made manifest. It is done unto you as you believe.You know when you have forgiven another, because you can meet the person in your mind and there is memory of the pain but no longer any sting.Nothing is accomplished without desire.The desire and the imagination must agree. When your desire and your imagination are in conflict, your imagination always wins.Project a mental movie in your mind night and morning, knowing that your conscious mind is the camera, and it will be developed in the darkroom of your subconscious mind.All the powers of God are within you, waiting to be drawn forth by your conscious mind when it is still. The quiet mind gets things done. To attain peace, learn to let go.Prior to sleep, charge your subconscious with the task of evolving an answer to any problem, and prove its miracle working power to yourself. It will answer youWorry is God's alarm, reminding you that you are thinking wrongly, and you should redirect your thinking process immediatelyNegativity is a mental poison. Immediately substitute a positive, constructive thought for a negative one.Never finish a negative statement. Never engage is such negative thinking as lack or limitation. For as he thinketh in his heart so is he.The negative thoughts of others have no power to reach you, if you refuse to accept them, and they will return to their point of origin with double force.Carefully monitor your self-talk. The law of mind responds to what you believe and decree yourself to be. Ideas are conveyed to the subconscious by repetition, belief, and expectancy, and are made manifest in your life. You cannot grow if your self-talk is negative.There is only one process of healing and that is faith. People may say it's impossible, but with God all things are possible. God, who created you, can heal you.All healing takes place according to the belief of the individual. The subconscious mind is creative medium; it is the builder of your body and the healer of the body. Whatever the conscious mind impress on the subconscious, the latter faithfully reproduces.The law, simply stated, however, is that the Universal can only act on the plane of the particular or individual by becoming the individual. The only way God can work for us is through you; through our thoughts, feelings and mental imageryThanks"},{"Title":"Think Yourself to Health, Wealth, & Happiness: The Best of Dr. Joseph Murphy's Cosmic Wisdom","review":"This is a wonderful compilation of the best thoughts of Dr. Joseph Murphy.

What waits for Nicholas is a legacy of secrets and death which he discovers rather quickly, a legacy that does not stay in the past but becomes his present and future.R.L. Stine has created a haunting world for his characters, where ghosts, magic, good and evil roam free.
