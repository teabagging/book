And taught me so much about the value of self. I have also never recommended a book more as much as this work."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"An excellent read! This would be a great book for jr high and high school students as part of their curriculum. Once in jr high and again before high school graduation - so the learning is there. Thank you Erich Fromm for this book!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book is more than about relating to romantic love but also learning to love human kind, parent to child, yourself, etc. I really grasped the concept of how love has to be practiced everyday and like a skilled painter doesn't all of a sudden pick up a brush and create a masterpiece on a canvas, love is also an art that you have to practice everyday. You have to be a loving person in all that you do, not just romantically, not just loving your family, not just loving mankind, etc. It truly makes sense to me and since reading it, I've felt more appreciative and more open minded."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I remember reading this work in my teenage years. It made a great impression on me then. One of Fromm's points is that we cannot really love others unless we love ourselves. This went against the notion I had at the time that ' self- love' meant ' selfishness only, and that one had to choose between loving oneself and loving another. I think Fromm's point here is a deep and true one.Another important point Fromm made is connecting love with responsibility, care and concern. In other words as a young person there was a tendency to think that love is simply a ' romantic feeling' Fromm broadened the conception of ' love' I had. And this too through indicating that there are different kinds of love, depending upon the kind of relationship it is.Fromm also, and this is another important point gave the sense that it is ' right to love' and that ' love is not a sin'. He gave a sense that love is an essential part of a meaningful life, and something each and every one of us is capable of.His connecting love with truly understanding and caring for ' the other' is another major point. So instead of the instinctually driven, fundamentally sinful view of Man given by Fromm's teacher Freud , Fromm presents us with a fundamentally positive view of human nature and its capacities. This is an especially wonderful book for young people. It can give hope and strength to help them make better lives for themselves and those they love and are loved by."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Certainly Erich Fromm's best work, The Art of Loving summarizes the core aspects of Fromm's idea's on love and human nature. It would be incorrect to describe The Art of Loving or any of Fromm's work as scientific theories of human behavior. Rather, his work puts forth a complete philosophy of love and harmony that is at odds with the dominant scientific and technical philosophy that dominates post-Enlightenment Western thought. Drawing more on the humanistic and Marxist strain in Western thought, Fromm argues that love is a paradox. It is the union of two people who remain independent individuals. It is a situation where \\"two become one, and yet remain two\\". He contrasts this with the situation where one individual dominates the union (sadism, masochism), which he likens to the dominant-dependent love between parent and child. Whatever its philosophical origins, however, Fromm's ideas very simple and the book is very simply written and quite short. Of all the great philosophers, Fromm is by far the most accessible. All the better, because Fromm's central idea, that love is not the excitement of having a new lover, is not the asymmetric union of man over woman or woman over man, but rather that love is the union of two individuals who remain independent from one another, is an idea that modern society must discover."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Although Fromm covers theoretical territory best left to his other books, he produced a useful little guide for everyone who wishes to cultivate a larger understanding of the psychology of love. (However, I still think that for the majority of readers, it's actually more difficult to be love, to accept love, than it is to give love--the reverse of what the author maintains.) Good social commentary on why love is so lauded, and so seldom approached, in our capitalistic and consumeristic Western civilization."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"So far (as of 8-4-99), EVERY customer review of this book has been 5 stars.

If you own one book on personal psychology, this is it."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"&quot;The Art of Loving&quot; is an essay on all sides of love. The style is that of an analysis, studying love from a theoretical angle most of the time. This makes the text a bit dry and somewhat demanding, but it is full of insight. Among the kinds of love treated are motherly, brotherly, erotically and religious love as well as negative and positive self-love (narcissism vs. &quot;loving your neighbour AS YOURSELF&quot;). Love is seen as the basis for human life, individually and culturally. One could say that the book enlarges on why &quot;love makes the world go around&quot;!One stylistic point continued to annoy me: The author seems unable to use the word &quot;she&quot;. It is purely stylistic - the book is equally about male and female sides of love, and the author is no chauvenist. Probably this style has to do with the fact that the book dates back to 1956. But it is annoying and in some places confusing.The bottom line: If you want a &quot;how-to&quot; book this is not it. If you want new insight in love and its implications this book should be on your list."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"\\"Love,\\" says Fromm, \\"is the only satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence.\\" Poets have written that, \\"Love conquers all,\\" and to \\"surrender to it.\\" Urging one to surrender implies resistence to Love, but why?Fromm asks, is Love an art, or is Love a pleasant sensation or feeling which to experience is a metter of chance, i.e. something one, \\"falls into,\\" if one is lucky. Fromm asserts that Love is an art, and says that to truly Love, in all its forms, one must possess: Maturity; Self-Knowledge; and Courage.\\"Object,\\" or \\"faculty,\\": Many people pursue objects or affection, or objects to love, and correspondingly treat them as possessions. Fromm asserts that Love is the faculty or ability to Love in its different forms: brotherly love; romantic love, etc. Since Love is an art to be practiced, Fromm asserts that it can only be practiced in freedom with one another. In other words, people cannot treat others as objects or possessions to be controlled for ones own egotistical or selfish purposes. Such behavior to result in certain destruction and never to attain true Love.\\"Love,\\" vs. \\"falling in Love/Infatuation,\\": People speak of falling in Love, with new people they meet. Falling in Love is not necessarly Love, but infatuation, e.g., strangers meet, they break down social walls between one another, they feel close/as one. This new experience, infatuation, Fromm describes as \\"one of the most exhilarating and most exciting experiences in life. However, Fromm argues astutely, that this initial infatuation feeling slowly and naturally loses its miraculous character more and more with time, as the two people get more acquainted and learn more and more about eachother - flaws, character defects, etc. Fromm says the problem all-to-often arises when people confuse infatuation feelings (exhilaration/excitement) for proof of the intensity of their Love. As the infatuation feelings naturally subside, it results in the wish for a new conquest, a new \\"Love,\\" with a new stranger. Again the stranger is transformed into an \\"intimate\\" person, again the experience of falling in love is exhilarating and intense, and again it slowly becomes less and less, and ends in another wish for a new conquest - a new \\"Love,\\" always with the illusion that the new \\"Love,\\" will be different from the earlier ones. Fromm says this is not Love. These illusions are greatly helped by the deceptive character of sexual desires. Sexual desire aims at fusion, says Fromm. It can be stimulated by the anxiety of aloneness, by the wish to conquer, by vanity, by the wish to hurt or even to destroy, as much as it can be stimulated by Love. Because most people associate sexual desire with the idea of Love, says Fromm, they are easily misled to conclude that they Love each other only when they want each other physically. Fromm asserts this is not unlike a drug addiction, when people constantly seek out the exhilaration/excitement of infatuation. Fromm cautions that if the desire for physical union is not stimulated by Love, if romantic/erotic Love is not also coupled with other forms of Love, that it will never lead to union in more than an orgiastic, transitory sense.An implication of this that when this happens, i.e., when one finds new infatuation, the other one on the losing end gets scarredm then after a few times of getting burnt will begin to actively destroy or sabotage Love in the nascent stage when it occurs in the future, in an effort to avoid the past painful feelings associated with Love gone wrong or to avoid feelings of vulnerability and/or to maintain control -- in essence to not surrender to Love.Fromm describes what he calls the essential components that need to be mastered, for all forms of Love: Care (the active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love); Responsibility (to be able, willing and ready to respond to the psychic nneds of the other); Respect (concern that the other person should grow and unfold as he/she is on their own, to be aware of her unique individuality - freedom); and Knowledge(a desire to discover what makes the other \\"tick,\\" an active penetration of the other person).Fromm concludes that Love is not just a feeling, it is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. To love means to surrender and commit without guarantees. Love is an act of utter faith says Fromm."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I have reread this book more than any other that I own, partly because it's short, but mostly because Fromm is such a lucid and perceptive writer. I simply cannot recommend this book highly enough. I don't agree with all of it -- his take on homosexuality, for instance, which may or may not be attributable to the day in which it was written -- and many readers may not care for the way he frames behavioral patterns in psychoanalytic terms. That said, you can read right past those stylistic elements, because his prose is positively oozing with compassion. I don't think it's overly dramatic to say that it would take me longer to convey how excellent this little book is than it would take you to read it."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"In a world of fuzzy love epitomised by trashy love songs whichbrainwash young people into thinking such things as 'I can't livewithout you' and 'I love you more than life itself', this book offers an invaluable perspective on just what it is you might be feeling when you 'fall in love' with someone. Indeed, Fromm questions the whole concept of 'falling in love'. One will conclude that there is more 'falling' than there is 'love' in the whole process. He argues that we are better served by 'standing' in love. And how true. While practice makes perfect, and no book can compensate for that, Fromm's enlightenment is sure to raise an eyebrow of awareness among anyone who has ever loved or been loved. While we older, and perhaps wiser, folk may say 'yes, indeed' to Fromm's lucid and thought-provoking work, surely it's the teenage generation which needs this map of the one emotion which is perhaps most prominent in their minds. If you have ever experienced the pain of love, this book will change your attitudes towards the whole emotion, for ultimately you will conclude that where there is love,ie. the real honest variety, there is no pain and there can be no pain. Excellently written, like all Fromm's work, you will want to read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book expressed may feelings about true spirituality.Being 31,it was an eye opener to realize that in 1956,the year the book was published,our cuntry had essentialy the same socio-spiritual problems as 1999.Fromm writes about love being an action instead of a theory that requires discipline,concentration,and patience,traits that are challenging to pursue in our capitalistic culture.Furthermore,the book explains that our society is trapped by a need for instant gratification which creates long term suffering.Fromm believe's that love is the only valid remedy for our socitie's inner suffering and he expains how love is an art requiring effort and care.I very much agreed with Fromm,with his belief in mysticism transcending religions and putting love into actual practice.After reading this book,it confirmed my belief that whether we are Christian,jewish,MUslim or any &quot;ism&quot;,there is one Creator and as the bible states&quot;faith without works is dead&quot;.This book gave me hope that if we at least try to follow through on the principles of love,the world will be a better place because as the book expressed,we are all one human race in the Creator's eyes.I recomend this book to anyone wishing to gain knowledge into being a better person and understing our journey on Earth more."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Fromm does a great job of reviewing the various \\"types\\" of Love and providing the characteristics of each. His review clarifies what purpose each kind of love serves in our lives.The book is an exceptional treatise on this most elusive topic. It's a very rational breakdown of what it is to love, what it means to each of us to love, and how it serves us (and the world) to love.This isn't a Leo Buscalia book, but rather a very good compliment to one. This book is more an analysis of fundamental principles involved in love and loving. It's an in depth discussion, not a collection of stories. But it is very unique in a field of less thought provoking (but good feelings) books.If you are a thinker, and still want to be a feeling person, the book can help you. For the mind, this is clarity. The book will help you get your mind out of the way so you can begin feeling - because it will teach your mind what your heart is trying to say."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I have finished reading &quot;Art of Loving&quot; by Eric Fromm just yesterday. It is a good book but more based on psychoanalytical studies. It does gives a very good information on the art of loving but less life based examples and more researched material. The description of the kind of love father, mother, son, daughter, and others have is amazing Or rather I would say much well researched. The book does not at any word inspires you to love but just tells you what love is. It does not ask you to start loving but rather gives you the meaning of what love stands for. It is a very good and well written book. In fact to be more precise a well researched book. It is definitely not meant for any of those people who think that reading it will be fun, because it has such profound studies incorporated in it that the book requires definitely a very high sense of understanding and concentration. It is one of those kinds of books which have only hundred pages, but each page is so strong that sometimes it takes two days to understand what the author wants to tell through that page's writting. I would definitely recommend you to read this book as it not only gives the view points of the author but also of the others whome the author has met and read. It is a researched material where the author not only discusses his view points but also every now and then tell and discusses each topic with others opinions and then later comes to the cumulative conclusion. Most of the teachings and the thoughts are though very personal but then that applies to most of the authors writtings and thats okay.I hope you all will enjoy reading this book as I did.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Erich Fromm frequently uses paradox to get his points across. In The Art of Loving he begins by talking about how competition in a capitalist society tends towards uniformity and mediocrity. As Emerson says, in his essay on Self-Reliance, \\"Conformity is the rule. The world whips you with its displeasure for non-conformity.\\" And, \\"He who would be self-reliant, must be a non-conformist.\\" In any case, Fromm says that most people want to be Loveable. We wear dark sunglasses so no one can see our eyes, in order to appear \\"different\\". We must have the whitest teeth, the darkest tan, the best clothes, so that we become \\"attractive\\" and then we become like commodities in a market. We want to make the \\"best deal\\", that is, get the best mate, trading our qualities for those of another person, while \\"getting over\\" on the other, that is, we want better than we offer. What is called a \\"bargain\\".Instead of becoming Loveable, Dr. Fromm suggests that we become more Loving. He defines Love as involving four things: care, knowledge, respect, and response-ability. Think about it, how much can you love someone if you don't really know them? And if you care about someone, you surely want to be able to respond to them. Love without care, or careless love is famous, as there is a song about it. In any case, over the millenia we have heard of different kinds of love and Fromm spends time going into the different kinds.From love of your enemies, to love of yourself, to love of others, and from selfish love to self-less love, Dr. Fromm runs the gamut.For a discussion of Diotema's Ladder of Love, see a different book, by James Diefenbeck, Wayward Reflections on the History of Philosophy, which covers Plato's Symposium on Love.However, Plato is limited, in a way, by his place in history. Dr. Fromm also includes a discussion of Taoism in The Art of Loving.dr"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Fromm is one of the classics - along with Freud, Jung, Adler. He studied psychology, philosophy and sociology, received his PhD at the age of 22, became interested in Zen Buddhism at the age of 26. One of the true geniuses.This book was written in 1956. Here Fromm discusses love from philosophical, psychological and sociological point of view. What love is and isn't? In what ways do we misconceive love? Is love indeed an art? Why do we need it? What is the difference between love of a mother and a father (as archetypes)? He discusses different kinds of love: brotherly love (love to any other human being - just because he is a human being), erotic love, self-love, love to God. The last half of the book is dedicated to how love disintegrates in modern western society and how we can practice love."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book was hugely popular when I was in high school. Many boys picked it up, thinking it was about something more graphic. Many girls read it, thinking it would validate what they were looking for in romance.Actually the book is neither about sex nor the paperback pirate-ravishing-damsel-on-cliff version of romance. It's about true love - what it is NOT, what it IS - and how to build it in your own life.Notice I didn't say it was about how to FIND love. Such a quest implies that love is an object or resides in an object - out there somewhere. And that's exactly the sort of sentiment that this book was written to correct. That's exactly what makes this book such an urgent antidote to our current conception of love and to the current tenor of our times.Our 21st century society is characterized by breezy dismissals such as \\"I'm just not attracted to you,\\" and \\"I'm just not that into you.\\" Such attitudes reduce individuals to something less than full human beings. They reduce all players to mere chess pieces being maneuvered by some unseen power, against their will, on a chessboard. And even at that, the chessboard is just one of those miniature, magnetized toys you carry on long trips. Oops, the square lost its magnetism - I'm falling off! Good-bye!Fromm's main purpose in writing this book was to re-awaken us to become fully active participants in creating the unity of love between two people. As he eloquently points out - love is not an involuntary magnetic attraction or any kind of irresistible impulse. It's a decision, a commitment, and ultimately an art. It calls for a genuinely active spirit and not just a churning busy-ness.In the first chapters, Fromm distinguishes between true brotherly love, motherly love, fatherly love, love of God, and erotic love. There are a few archaisms along the way that show this book was first published in the 1950's. For example, Fromm implies a belief that homosexuality is a failure to achieve \\"polarized union,\\" perhaps due to parental or societal imbalances.Overall though, this man knows love. He ends the books with a brief chapter on how to practice the overarching love that encompasses all the rightful kinds he distinguished. The discipline starts with the practice of little gestures that might at first seem unrelated to the ultimate goal. The art of love turns out to be very like the practice of Zen or the practice of any Eastern religious art. Erich Fromm becomes a sort of Mr. Miagi by our side - \\"Wax on, wax off.\\" Through this book, he can help launch all of us karate kids into a truer, more fulfilling concept of love."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"As a young girl I read this book because I was searching for answers to life's oldest questions concerning true love. Now 35 years later, while searching for a book to give to my niece who is searching for the same answers to the same questions, I rediscover this incredible book. However, most amazing is the fact I now realize it probably shaped my ideas about life and love and without a doubt is responsible for the choices I made along life's journey in my marriage.

I met a young psychology professor the other day and I thought I'd name drop. I mentioned Erich Fromm. He never heard of him. I was shocked. But a week before that I was at a law library and the law student behind the take-out desk never heard of Clarence Darrow. You know there are young people who don't know who Bob Cousy is?In any case, this is a very intelligent book. I still have Erich Fromm sitting on my night table. Right now I am reading the Anatomy of Human Destructiveness. The Art of Loving was one of my favorite.I took psychology in college because I liked so many of Erich Fromm's books.

As pointed out in other reviews, it is somewhat reflective of the time it was written - mid-20th century - but concepts are still fully relevant in 2010. In order to fully treat the topic of Love, Fromm discusses much wider social philosophy, covering the pain of separateness, the evolution of religions, the motivation to consume, the approriate role of thinking within the wider scope of being (contrary to the predominant view in Western culture, thinking and being are not equivalent!). Thus, the reader gets a good understanding of Fromm's social theory and by the end of the book can indeed perceive Love as an action to be approached with discipline, concentration, and patience - as preparing oneself for a great work. I give this a 4 rather than 5 star rating because the book is written in an academic style; it definitely does not read like a best selling psychology book. I felt like I was back in a university philosophy course - not a bad feeling at all, but you must be in the right mood."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Easily the most profound book on Love that I have ever read. Nothing like the pop-culture self help books that saturate the market (t.v/lit/radio/web). I enjoyed his commentary on how conformity pulls us further away from love. And his idea that Equality does not mean lack of individuality. Our desire to be the same fogs our pursuit for true love because we don't recognize love in all its forms when it is presented to us.This man was a genius and this book was written at an interesting turning point in Western Civilization- focus from family to money.I didn't expect anything from this book so I was extremely pleased. I am now reading everything else he has written."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Everyone should read this book. It resonates at a very deep level in the human psyche. Love as a self-directed activity instead of the \\"whats in it for me\\" mentality is huge. Current American thinking is the exact opposite of what Fromm was trying to say about love being a self-directed activity. The books explanations show the reader why our current culture is so miserable, thankless and disloyal. We are taught to love passively instead of actively and its progressing more toward self-centerness everyday.I highly recommend this book, especially if you are sick of being miserable."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book was very impressive and I learned a lot about the subject of love and myself. It would be nice if every couple who are deciding to get married would read this book. If they did, perhaps they would understand going in that there is a lot more to it than 'what is in it for me.' Perhaps the sad divorce rate in our country would dissipate some extent. This book belongs on the top shelf with the other books I consider master works.

He makes it clear that no easy cliches will teach us the art of loving. In other words, this is no self-help book packaging easy-to-swallow bromides about love. Rather, Fromm argues we must first eradicate our illogical and inaccurate notions of love in modern society and see that love is not an \\"object\\" but a \\"faculty,\\" a way of being that requires complete transformation of the whole personality. Once he establishes that being loving is a rare achievement, he establishes the theory and practice of love. The theory is rooted in a tragic view of humans, namely, we are lonely and separate and this separateness can only be overcome by love, which requires discipline and patience and of course practice. This small gem of a book has survived and will survive because even though the answers are not easy they are true and universal.

Shortly thereafter, on a trip to the U.S., I bought my first copy. Since then, I have been reading the book, and in the book, over and over again. In the late 1990s, I actually worked through it and summarized the main ideas to be sure I fully internalized them. Over the years, I gave copies of it to all of my children as they reached adulthood, as well as to many young friends. Through this book, Erich Fromm opened my eyes for an understanding of the meaning of life. As a result, I bought and read most of what Fromm wrote during the years he spent in North America, from 'Escape from Freedom' (1941) to 'To Have or to Be' (1976). From these other works, the one that most impressed me and helped me to form my own views was 'Psychoanalysis and Religion' (1950). Fromm is a humanist with uniquely deep insights into the human soul, into the world of religion (Judeo-Christian and other world religions), as well as the world of philosophy (Western and Eastern).- I just recently ordered a new copy of 'The Art of Loving' because my original one is coming to pieces."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book literally invaded the stage of the intelectual world in the sixties .Fromm reflections about the nature of love are deep and wise .

In fact, Dr. Fromm wrote an outstanding work about what it means to live a passionate, engaged existence. It's short and my copy is filled with two different kinds of ink from my circling at least 25 quotations over a couple of readings.In order to love, we must appreciate, and in order to appreciate, we must know. A person without seriousness and focus is worthless. We must work and make the most out of the time that we are given.As far as romantic love is concerned, Fromm was quite perceptive when he wrote that the lack of polarity between the sexes meant the death of love. In order for men and women to have harmonious relationships, they cannot be exactly the same. Without \\"viva la difference\\" there can be no eros.The first time I read The Art of Loving I did not fully comprehend the Marxist bend to Dr. Fromm's criticism. Now I do unfortunately. It is a distraction but it in no way undermine's the work's message. He was a member of the Frankfort School and they supplied us with the evil cancer that is political correctness, so it is rather predictable that a critique of capitalism is included in these pages. Fifty years have made these political asides and observations trite. If man is a cog in the capitalist machine what would he be in a bureaucratic socialistic one? Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao, and Castro teach us that under socialism man exists to be endlessly trampled by the heel of a boot (ala Orwell).Regardless of politics, Fromm understands better than most commentators what we should be doing with our lives on this earth and I respect this work immensely. Fromm truly challenges the reader in the text and it is the thinking man's self-help guide. And unlike all of the garbage on tv and in the bookstore, is actually helpful."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Very thought provoking. Fromm uses visual imagery to guide the reader on a journey of self discovery. Thoughtful use of historical periods and analagies help the reader understand the ideas and concepts he presents."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This author is amazing. His insight from back in the 30's- 50's is really incredible.A perceptive and great writer. I enjoy his work. This book is very special because it the first one I read of his. I've given this book to many friends.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I have a better understanding of what love is after reading this book. In the modern society, people in general seem to know the meaning of love very well. Most think that love is simply a male and a female getting together happily, just as what they can usually see in the films. But I can tell you it is not so simple. Love is more than that!In the beginning of the book \\"The Art of Loving\\", Fromm first carries out several premises behind the attitude of people treating love. These are about the problem of how to be loved, the object to love as well as the confusion between the initial experience of falling in love and the permanent state of being in love, which has a great impact on me to think about what love is.Fromm then talks about the theory of love. It is really true that love is an activity. It is primarily giving, not receiving. Moreover, love is not just to a specific person, the \\"object\\" of love, but to the world as a whole. There are different kinds of love toward different objects: brotherly love, motherly love, erotic love, self-love and the love of god. All these will be covered in the book. And at last, Forrum puts these theories into practice. With the capacity to love our neighbor as well as true humility, courage, faith and discipline, the satisfaction in individual love can surely be attained.In the \\"polluted\\" world, love is indispensable. We should try most actively to develop our total personality, in order to achieve a productive orientation. \\"Love thy neighbor as thyself\\".It is appreciated that Forumm tries to use non-technical language to avoid unnecessary complications. Still, there are some areas that are difficult for me to understand. Besides, it focuses much on the theory, making it a little bit boring. Overall, the book is worth reading.How can I know if the theory works? Put it into practice!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Erich Fromm's work remains a vital commentary on our culture, its discontents, and its untapped potential. In this fine volume, he delves into the concept & nature of Love. As other reviewers have noted, don't mistake this for a shallow self-help book! Instead, it's an intelligent, humane exploration of what we mistake for Love, and what Love actually is (or can be). It will make you stop & reconsider the cliches you've been fed by our mass-market culture, cliches we've all absorbed from an early age without ever really examining in depth. This slim volume does just that, explaining complexity with clarity, while challenging the sound-byte mentality of our culture, which reduces everything to simplistic slogans & superficial thought.Let me also note that Fromm's socialist humanism has absolutely nothing to do with the straw men of crude communism, groupthink power culture, or political correctness that some mistaken reviewers have called it. His analysis of the alienating power of mass capitalistic culture remains accurate; and it's clear from his entire body of work that he holds tyranny & oppression of any ideological bent in deepest disdain. He was & remains a champion of human freedom, not only politically, but emotionally & spiritually. Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I echo the sentiment that this is not a self-help book. If you're Joe Six Pack looking for some quick-fix PowerPoint presentation style solution to your marriage problems, you won't find that solution here. If that's your lot, just find a therapist who can set you straight in person. This book is a good old-fashioned Marxist-style critique, complete with denunciations of the connection between love and capitalism. In some ways, this book is more about capitalism than it is about love. I just wish Fromm were still around to write a book about Internet dating."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book was amazing, I think everyone on the planet should read it.The two points he made that stuck out to me were:1) in his piece about parenting, he talks about how (ideally) mothers have to love their children so much, unconditionally and in every circumstance -- and then *let them go.* He talks about differences in fatherly love [fathers discipline, give praise and love when you're successful], and concludes that at adulthood, people need to find a way to give themselves *both* fatherly and motherly love from the inside, regardless of how their childhood went...2) he talks about concentration and attentiveness, and how it relates to fatigue and mental health. he speaks at length about what it means to really concentrate and not be scattered doing a hundred things at once, and how, when you've concentrated hard on something, you're tired and sleep well vs. when you are all over the place, focusing on one thing for two minutes and moving on, you feel tired but it's hard to fall asleep. This resonated with me and my terrible reading and Internet habits!It is a beautiful book -- obviously some concepts are a bit out-dated, such as the ways in which he tries to incoporate gay relationships in his parts about love. But how amazing is it that he's trying to think through and incorporate gay men and women's experiences at all? I was impressed. He really spoke from a place of love and IMHO speaks the truth as it is."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I think that the real progress of humanity is not in technology,in scientific knowledge, in wealth or anything like that, but is in the always greater awareness that the only reason of life is LOVE. Maybe today many people think to know this, but they really don't know, 'cause love isn't just finding a man or woman to spend life with. And this book will help them understand what's really about it. And, hopefully, it will convince people who think life's purpose is somewhere else.OK, knowing is not enough, as Fromm teaches, but it's the first step, and I hope we all will do it someday..."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"After reading several books by Fromm, and being his admirer (I find his insight into both the society and individual very clear and unburdened by personal agenda), I was dissapointed by The Art of Loving.While providing some very valuable glimpses into the possibility of unselfish personal love, the author falls into the proscribed conditioning of his era (not very different from ours) that would turn off many that are looking for a non-judgmental and objective analysis.From hard-nosed blanket statements (animals cannot experience love, the fantasy of &quot;prehuman harmony&quot; we have all somehow lost by the nature of being human, &quot;homosexual deviation is a failure&quot;) to the uneasy mixture of the late 19th century mechanical Western Universe with only partially understood spirituality of Eastern philosophies, this is a study of Fromm's personal chip-on-the-shoulder more than a work about Love.Recommended to a reader interested in Fromm as a person, not author, or one studying the society of the time.

I would recommend it to people who are confused in themselves and the relation that they have with others."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Too many people believe love is all about creating your \\"shopping list\\" of you want/need in someone. While it is important to know what you want, it's more important to know what you bring to the table, who you are and what you give. The unfortunate thing is most people are not conscious of this. Most people in our \\"hook up culture\\" are so concerned with what they get and how fast they get it and through never practicing love, they have no sense of what it really is.Love is much bigger than just some romantic/erotic thing. If one cannot love his neighbor and fellow men in a brotherly type love, he can't love just the one person he desires. If love is not a character within himself, naturally bubbling forth from inside, he can't just conjure it up for the one person he wants erotically. He is probably suffering from some dominant or submissive complex which is not love but comes from fear.This book goes deeply into the subject and you do feel that loving is an art. If only more people would take the time to learn that rather than take the time to learn silly games like pickup artistry which don't require much brains or thinking and are only about a means to an end. The art of loving is about cultivating something great that doesn't end but goes on, lives on, evolves and furthers everyone around you."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Love is part of our daily life whether we like it or not.

Over the years, the idea of 'learning' how to really take care of oneself is soooooooo important and I have found this book to offer the central theme to both 'having a life' and 'having a good life'. I highly recommend the book to all people from late teens to early 'elders'."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I first read this book about 30 years ago and loved it. I re-read it recently to see if it's still meaningful and: yes, it is. It is not a recipe book on how to love and catch a mate. It's more of a philosophical work on why love is important in our lives, including romantic love, parental love, frindship and love in society at large. It also explains what happens in societies where material values take presedence over love for a fellow human being. The book is a classic, easy to read and understand, and the content should be common knowledge. Unfortunately, it isn't. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This is the better book I have ever read. THere is a part, that I would never forget, and Fromm writes something like that: Our deepest fear is not , not to be loved,Is to love, because TO love is get a commimet with the hope to produce love in the loved person. I am so sorry because of my bad english, but, If you feel lonely and sad, please read this book."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Salve for the broken heart, THE ART OF LOVING is a must-read for anyone who has been hurt by love -- especially those who feel they were tossed aside for the more primitive pleasures of merger (manifested by acceptability to community of friends or family of origin, and/or the corrupt values there embodied).The great achievement of this book is Fromm's clear-eyed insistence that to merge is not to live, that to merge is to flee, and yet that people escape anxiety and isolation through unhealthy merger -- drug and alcohol use, participation in destructive groups and ideologies, and, yes, sexual relationsips.What is problematic is that it would seem that the experience of romantic and sexual love necessitates levels of merger and overlap in order to provide pleasure and a sense of mutuality. Fromm is less good at offering a realistic vision of healthy love. But even if his superego seems a bit harsh to our contemporary psyches, his vision is essential: love must not be based on sadomasochistic fantasy but on two separate realities that come together for mutual enhancement."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Here is a book about various kinds of love (between persons only) taking the old, but to me still valid stance of the world as the union of opposites (contemporary homosexual culture, for example, challenges it to some extent, as Fromm points out). I read it after having come separately to very similar conclusions, so for me it mainly systematized clearly a series of ideas. But given its convincing insightfulness and its accessible, although by no means simple, and highly theoretical, approach to the topic, I can imagine its impact on people who have not come close to its ideas by themselves but are in fact searching for them. It is an utterly heuristic book. Fromm has the rare faculty of going straight and quickly to the core of the problems, without many words. I found however a few oversimplifications in some details. For example, by far not all Western philosophy is based on Aristotelian logic or is Western religion just a &quot;thought&quot; (i.e. logical thinking) experience. I am not convinced by his survey of the religion evolution of man. Fromm dismisses the techniques of good marriage preached by modern therapists, but isn't it them we see at work in truly loving couples? He means not to use them without feelings, but I think the form (the technique) may create the content (the feelings), and not only the other way around -- or, better to say, the form and the content continuously interact. Finally, I am not sure, but I think he implies true erotic love should last forever, and I am not sure this is the case. Fromm does not discuss the both conditional and unconditional character of erotic love, which includes aspects of all other types of love, without being their sum. These are however details and do not diminish the powerful discourse of the book. A more serious shortcoming is, I think, the fact the Fromm does not discuss the very important relation between thought and action in the learning and practice of love. Isn't thought a form of action as well? He stresses the insufficiency of the &quot;right thought&quot; (logical conclusion), but then he speaks of the necessity of &quot;reason&quot; (the faculty of thinking objectively) and of theoretical knowledge (of which the book itself is a proof). How are thinking (objectively, but not simply logically) and action related to each other? I would have liked to read more about this, especially because thinking tends to be poorly appreciated when we come to the discussion of emotions or feelings. In any case, a book to love."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Fromm reminds us that there is really no greater purpose in life than knowing love. Yet it seems that we do our best to hide from love, and hide love from us, with all the material and meaningless things with which we clutter our lives. A little book that has stood the test of time. Because deep down, we know he's right!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Love- such an enigma- but Fromm helps us to discover what love might be in different types of relationships and, in the process, elucidates what healthy boundaries might be in our relationships. He also has interesting ideas on the effects of our consumer society on our ability to truely love."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I was really disappointed with this book, especially since it was so highly recommended by friends and in general. I guess perhaps when it was written the ideas Fromm expressed were new, or at least the way he expressed them were new, but I can't believe that any minimally self-aware person hasn't thought about at least 80 to 90 percent of these ideas themselves. Fromm seems to be the typical over-educated, intellectual psychologist/philosopher, who takes a simple idea (if you don't know and love and understand yourself and the world around you, you can't love another person) and over-analyzes it, giving historical and biblical examples. Just another 90-odd pages of psychobabble."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Here is a book that talks about thoery, dinsintergration, and practice of love, but really says nothing. He uses vauge phrases like &quot;the union of conformity...is insufficient to pacify the anxiety of seperateness&quot; Does't help a person have a better relationship. Only creates mythical boxes for love such as &quot;God Love, Brotherly Love, Self Love, and Motherly Love&quot; which he describes in equally abstract language.

THANK YOU@!"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I am not able to say that Erich Fromm's book The Art of Loving really is about the art of loving. The only important message I was able to digest is that loving is something you do, not something which happens to you. I do not follow how this book could be labeled as practical when it does not really contain any program at all, rather, it contains a lot of unwarranted criticism of modern society.The book contains many easy to disprove statements. Also, Fromm does not bother to explain how he came to his conclusions - it's like a mathematical textbook that contains theorems and claims without any proofs or defitions. In other words, there are not many lines of reasoning to be found. All in all, I am disappointed with the quality of Fromm's thinking."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Erich Fromm, the author, was born in Frankfurt in Germany in 1900. He claims that love is the only sane and satisfactory answer to the problems of human existence. However, most people do not bother to develop their capacity to love. Learning to love requires practice and concentration.Dr. Fromm discusses romantic love and all the wrong notions that surround it as well as love of parents for children, brotherly love, erotic love, self-love and the love of God.The book is filled with challenging observations about a complicated subject that the author treats in a lively, human and extremely interesting manner. This is a must read for anybody who desires to expand their ability to give and receive love."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Because Fromm was not only a psychoanalyst, but a philosopher as well, I would argue that this book should be approached more liberally than one would if it were only a psychology. The Art of Loving is a work of theory, and while it lacks the kind of support it deserves, the ideas expressed are well worth consideration.I like his concept of love as an ideal rather than as a mere emotion. It's sets a ethical and emotional standard that requires, in order to be considered mature, to fully recognize the Humanity of all people (and all that it entails) and by it to become compassionate, sympathetic, and Humane.Fromm's analysis is generally based on an existential approach; however, some of his comments on heterosexual attraction and homosexuality do not live up to this standard. Bias is a detriment to any argument and to objectivity (obviously) and I was rather disappointed to find Fromm making the same mistake as Freud and others. The problem here is the failure to see beyond the relative expression of something to the underlying causes.In his chapter on the theory of love he argues that heterosexual attraction is based on difference between the sexes, that a feeling of oneness is accomplished through uniting opposites. While this may very well be true to some extent, it is shallow compared against Fromm's ideal of love. It is true that when we love another person we feel \\"whole\\" but I think this feeling is more likely the result of resolving one's feeling of separateness than the fulfillment of sexual productivity.Along with this comes the following statement,\\"The homosexual deviation is a failure to attain this polarized union, and thus the homosexual suffers from the pain of never-resolved separateness; a failure, however, which he shares with the average heterosexual who cannot love.\\"Fromm strangely reduces heterosexual love to a matter of being complementary opposites, which contradicts his argument that love is based on the care of and for another Human being. Of course, the understanding of homosexuality in the 1950's was short-sighted and utterly biased, so his commentary on it was likely influenced by this general misunderstanding.My only other criticism is his use of the terms \\"motherly\\" and \\"fatherly\\" love. While Fromm acknowledges that these terms refer to relative archetypes and are not meant to suggest that all mothers and fathers love in strictly conditional or unconditional ways, it still uses these terms instead of merely referring to either types of love as conditional and unconditional.With all this, I would recommend this book but also highly encourage any readers to take it into careful consideration, partly because it is a theoretical work (and there nothing wrong with this, as another reviewer seems to think) but more importantly because one should do this with any argument."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book is a product of the 1950s and does contain some outdated attitudes about gender roles and sexual orientation. That being said, it is a remarkably thoughtful and penetrating examination of the theory and practice of loving. Many of Fromm's observations are astute, and his concerns re narcissism and consumerism in the search for a mate are even more cogent today (witness reality TV's \\"Who wants to marry a millionaire\\" and \\"the bachelor\\", e.g.). Most people I know could learn something from this book. Be forwarned, though...it is not a quick or easy \\"self-help\\" read, and Fromm's advice, which is to behave altruistically, is not easy to follow, either."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Many books have been written and are being written on love,romance and spirituality. In todays world that is either fighting on the name of religion without any real spiritual quest or qenching it in hedonistic ways, I feel there is a major need to learn about love and cultivate it than never before. Spitituality as I see it is but a question- \\" we are born without our will and we die against our will. And things in between seem to happen without me having to say anything much. So, what am i doing here?\\". Well, there is no real answer to this question, but there is a solution, and that is to feel at home here in this world from the day we are sent to this world untill that day we are forced to call it off. And love for ourselves and for this world is what we need to achieve that state of restfulness. All dogmos and ideologies are nothing but theoretical derivations out of the above mentioned axiom, and problems arise as people stick onto the derivations without really understanding the basic problem, that is, \\" how to love?\\". All the spiritual texts put great emphasis on love, but, they associate great sins with the failure to achieve love, and so it is looked upon as a virtue of saints and monks that is not a necessity for ordinary people . But as that is the very problem this whole humanity is trying to answer without really understanding it, no one can really feel peaceful and call himself spiritually matured without mastering this art of loving. And to my knowledge, this is the only book that says love is an art that can be mastered by anyone and everyone by cultivating three simple virtues namely patience, perseverence and practice. With all my heart i recommend this book for anyone with real spiritual quest, for anyone who is interested in finding his place in this world.

I wouldn't say that his ideas weren't entirely original but I enjoy it so much even as a Buddhist. Sometimes, religious books/doctrines kind of give you a sense of boundary and restrictions but a psychological book like this doesn't.A lot of the time we see people do and say things we don't understand or feel uncomfortable about. There is always reasons for that, and Fromm here gave a lot of very good examples that penetrate the the truth and insights of their actions and behaviors.What he recommends are truely practical and useful techniques in terms of building a healthy 'self' before you spread your healthy and loving self to others. At least, these are what Buddha said.

Hence the problem to them is how to be loved, not how to love.\\" -Eric Fromm, The Art of LovingI picked up this book by chance at the Miami Dade County Book Fair. I had heard of Fromm briefly in my psychology class, and thought this little book (the actual text not more than 130 pages) would be a great companion to another book I picked up on love in Shakespeare's plays. Judging by his background psychology, I prepared myself for The Art of Loving to turn out like many other psychoanalytic books tend to be: a small book that would take an unimaginable amount of time to read. However, it was quite the contrary; what I encountered in this small book was an eye-opening experienced that made me aware of both my accomplishments and my failures in life. I found myself reading the book from cover to cover, flipping it over and starting again.As I read (and reread) the book felt like Fromm was talking directly to me, as if he and I were sitting down and having an in-depth conversation on love's role in my life. Fromm touches on all forms of love from parental love, to brotherly (neighborly) love, to erotic love, to love of God, and to self love, which he specifically explains is very different from narcissism. He speaks of the problem in the Western world's concept of love as a temporary gratification and a purely selfish act and discusses how to rectify it by attempting to invert what is seen and practiced in the world by learning to live in love, hinging it on the art of giving of oneself.However, do not expect, as Fromm states in the first section of this book, that you will find a step by step guide on \`how to love'. This book is more of an awareness of what love is and how humanity does not love. It very much reveals yourself to yourself, and shows you how love is verb not a noun (thus an art and not a name). It is something you have to do constantly, not wait for it to come to you. As Fromm says, \\"What are the necessary steps in learning any art? One, mastery of the theory; two, mastery of the practice.\\" For Fromm love is the answer to human existence and one must first learn to love oneself before he can attempt to love others. It is a self-changing experience."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"The most beautiful non-poetic description of love. Love, according to Fromm, is the conscious act of connecting with others in kind and compassionate fashion. In doing so, we overcome the primary fear we feel as humans, which is to feel alone.

First, loving is a skill just like painting, writing, or anything else, and we must consciously work to improve our ability to give love. And second, our focus should not be on receiving love, but on giving love, and through giving love we receive love. I have recommended this book to family and friends, and everyone who has read it has had much to say about it, which has sparked some wonderful conversations. This is a book that I will read many times throughout my life."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Recomendable para cualquier persona que tenga preguntas en relaci&oacute;n con su sanidad amatoria"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"Erich Fromm hit love right on the nail with this book"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"the book really helped me while I had a lot of time on my hands."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I bought this book for a psych class, my teacher mandated the purchase of this specific book, and at the end of the class I ended up asking my teacher to consider another book to talk about loving. Fromm's book starts off with good insights into certain relationships (which is the only reason it got two stars instead of one) but by chapter three those insights are long since forgotten and replaced with hot air. Fromm tends to take a chapter to say what only needed to be a page or two. He talks in circles after a while and that makes the book unbearable to finish.

Love is not defined here, and it is merely described. That's nice, but is narrowly defined as loving everyone and as part of a \\"loving personality.\\" For some reason, it's not okay to love say, your girlfriend or your child or your mother more than anyone else... according to him, we must love everyone. Love is not a personality type just as much as excitement is not a personality type. Love is sometimes exclusive... isn't that why there is jealousy? It is a good read and a good text, and offers insight into human nature."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"THE ART OF LOVING purports to be a manual for the heart. Reading this book evokes within me feelings of irritation & frustration rather than love. Much of the irritation comes from his incapacity for logical thinking and consistency. Perhaps he disdains logic, but this is probably a symptom of my inability to empathize with his logical blindness.It may be true that a loving person will sacrifice truth & logic at a moment's notice for the sake of love. if this is the case, Fromm is a very loving person. Fromm comes across as someone at a typewriter free-associating every possible statement he can make about love -- and many of the things he says are true.For example, he says that romantic love is unlike parental or brotherly love in that it is exclusive and the other two are not. Yet, a parent has an exclusivity in the love for his/her child that is different from the love that is held for other children.Brotherly love also has a level of exclusivity.Fromm implies that exclusivity makes romantic love a less desirable form of love -- contradicting the more positive use of romantic love in the second premise and in the conclusion.It's untrue to claim that the exclusivity of romantic love diminishes the love those lovers give to selected others. A happy lover usually feels more loving toward others in general because of that happiness.Anyway, if you're reading this for any type of logical or step by step comprehension of love, this probably is not the book for you. If you're reading it as the \\"art\\" of being a loving individual, you may want to be prepared by having an appreciation for non objective abstract art.Billy D SquiresBillyDSquires"},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"I remember buying this book in about 1967; I'm revisiting my copy, to see if it had any substantial content. I can remember almost nothing from it - an account of wartime trampling to death; maybe an account of a patient wasting Fromm's time. Fromm suggests to me, now, the Frankfurt 'school' - is the purpose of this book to damage Gentile society? Then again it might be related to Freud - sexual undercurrents, plus weird voyages into excrement and incest. Or 'Depth psychology'? Could it be about traditional love - couples, parents? Intense love? Love of country? Love of tribe? Love of perhaps art and culture - or just possibly food or football games or the mass media? Love of cruelty, perhaps? Love of solitude? Maybe it's full of allusions to the 'dysfunctions' of Americans and Europeans - in 1957, white Americans and Europeans? Of course it could be about the maltreatment of Jews - not anyone else, of course; possibly with emphasis on Germany? Maybe the book was designed to look like a sex manual, for extra sales? Or was it perhaps written to make a reputation - publicity handled by the usual types? Or written to make money? Or to get a job? Or as something like how to influence people and win lovers, but in an artistic way?On reopening my copy, I was surprised to find I'd made notes - it was unindexed - years ago, mostly on authors - Spinoza, Albert Schweitzer, Freud - on Sex, but also 'Civilization and its Discontents', Isaac Babel, Weber and Jung, Simone Weil (a notorious 'survivor'), Calvin (on the Christian Religion) and Luther, William James, Meister Eckhart, Maimonides (of 'The Guide for the Perplexed'), Heraclitus, Hegel, Marx and Aristotle, Marcuse. Non-authored written material includes the Talmud, the Book of Jonah, the 'story of creation' and the Old Testament, and material on mysticism and Indian beliefs and Zen. Fromm refers to the 'Western Enlightenment' which *may* I think be a code-word for Jews being allowed more freedoms - the Renaissance and Reformation getting less, or no, attention. Dale Carnegie and Norman Vincent Peale of the strenuous self-improvement types are in there.And there's quite a bit of unreferenced stuff on India, China, the 'mystic poet Rumi' and so on, and on earlier cultures, all mostly uncheckable and vague - patriarchal and 'matriarchal' systems, the function of 'orgies', possibly meaning holidays, and so on.It's strange how little psychological material there is: H S Sullivan with an 'interpersonal theory'. The blurb describes Fromm as 'possibly the greatest of the post-Freudian psychologists..'The book has four parts - I Is Love an Art?, II The theory of Love - by far the longest section, III Love and Its Disintegration in Contemporary Western Society, and IV The Practice of Love.Quite a lot of the book explains that an 'art' - and Fromm includes anything that needs training - needs concentration, patience etc. It reads like a child unwillingly forced to do piano lessons. He has a very strenuous outlook, at least in theory, though I can't imagine he ever put it into practice.The 'theory' section includes types of love. People in (or having heard of) the Christian tradition will be familiar with the idea that everyone deserves love - though perhaps only after a dose of correction. The idea of universal Christian love is almost absent from this book. So is the idea of loving a small racist cult! It's striking how unloveable Fromm finds people - he states most people have never met a mature adult in their lives; and zombie-type people who chatter without thinking should be avoided; and how hardly anyone has known real love. Insanely, he then describes mother love in terms of the highest praise, despite presumably referring to real mothers. This is 'unconditional love'. Fatherly love is conditional on the child doing things the father likes, however. There is a male principle which inserts, and a female principle which receives. However everyone has a bit of each - Fromm reads almost as though he thinks sex is a 'social construct', but isn't quite ready yet to push such nonsense.The final practice chapter has more strenuous material, pages of absurd stuff on 'faith', which Fromm confuses with scientific belief, and some samples of psychological oddities.In fact the book is full of sentences which are nonsense, or obviously untested or not properly defined. And I mean this! I can only think he considered his target readership unable to manage long sentences, or so impressed they won't notice they are evasive. Some examples:-'The nature of unselfishness becomes particularly apparent in its effect on others, and most frequently in our culture in the effect the 'unselfish' mother has on her children.''Love of man is not, as is frequently supposed, an abstraction coming after the love for a specific person, but it is its premise, although genetically it is acquired in loving specific individuals.''The basic need to fuse with another person so as to transcend the prison of one's separateness is closely related to another specifically human desire, that to know the 'secret of man'.''To be concentrated in relation to others means primarily to be able to listen.''[Erotic Love] is often confused with the explosive experience of 'falling' in love, the sudden collapse of the barriers which existed until that moment between two strangers.''There is hardly any activity, any enterprise, which is started with such tremendous hopes and expectations, and yet, which fails so regularly as love.''Giving is more joyous than receiving, not because it is a deprivation, but because in the act of giving lies the expression of my aliveness.''While it raises no objection to apply the concept of love to various objects, it is a widespread belief that, while it is virtuous to love others, it is sinful to love oneself.''If love is a capacity of the mature, productive character, it follows that the capacity to love in an individual living in any given culture depends on the influence this culture has on the character of the average person.'There's some material on 'capitalism' which, as is customary, isn't defined accurately. Of course Fromm says little about the USSR and its hellish history. Fromm has a problem common to anyone who claims psychological expertise, but also claims to dislike a social system, namely how can you give sensible advice if the whole society is skewed or hostile to most people?Unimpressive. And difficult to review because of its gelatinous opacity."},{"Title":"The Art of Loving","review":"This book is a classic!

She has spanned the globe collecting, admiring, studying, photographing and writing about needlework. See also her books:The Complete International Book of EmbroideryEmbroidery: Traditional Designs, Techniques, and Patterns from All over the WorldA World of EmbroideryIn this modest Dover paperback of 1998 which republishes Ms. Gostelow's 1976 English, the world of blackwork is opened to us from medieval times to today. I have included in Images above several photos from the book. The front cover is a detail of the pattern for a coif. The book gives props to Catharine of Aragon, King Henry VIII's first wife, and her supposedly bringing \\"Spanish work\\" to the isles. (It cracks me up that she was the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, of Columbus and Spanish Inquisition fame.) As the author explains, there was good cause to associate Catharine with blackwork because she was an avid embroiderer and the detailed running backstitch began to dot every rich and royal costume in Tudor England. However, as we see in a modern reading of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, in \\"The Mylleres Tale\\" (Miller's), his young wife's \\"smock was white and embroidered in front and behind with coal-black silk and embroidered also on the inside and outside of the collar.\\" This was written between 1490-1500 and Catharine was born in 1485.The chapters of the book are as follows:Chapter 1 The history of blackworkChapter 2 English blackworkChapter 3 Blackwork of the worldChapter 4 Artists' blackworkChapter 5 Costume and blackworkChapter 6 Techniques for Blackwork (including needles, ground fabric, embroidery thread, metal threads, other equipment, stitches and samplers)Chapter 7 Designing blackworkChapter 8 Useful blackworkand an index and bibliography.Even of more interest to me is the discussion in the 4th chapter of Bess of Hardwick who was married to George Talbot the Earl of Shrewsbury who was the jailor of Mary Queen of Scots from 1569 to 1584. Bess and Mary were stitchers nonpareil and they pumped out much blackwork. Of course, blackwork is not called \\"Holbein\\" stitch for nothing: Hans Holbein the Younger was Henry VIII's court portraitist and he painted about 150 portraits, many showing exquisite details of oriental carpets and blackwork.

I was living in Minneapolis and was starting a writing workshop, so I took the unusual tack of tacking postcard notices around in the West Bank neighborhood. No one locally ever contacted me about the postcards. But a visitor to Minneapolis, in the visage of a bona fide bearded beat poet from the west, who was passing through Minnesota in his microbus on a poetry tour of America, found himself, as poets do, standing and copying a stranger's phone number from a telephone pole. Charles Potts called and asked to visit me. We huddled as equals, drank iced tea, sized up one another's poetics, and agreed to stay in touch.We have been friends ever since. Good friends. I sometimes feel Charlie knows what is in my heart better, and respects it more, than I myself do.Charles was vastly more advanced than I was. He, even in his twenties, knew who he was, knew how the world worked, and knew what he wanted to do. I'm still working on all three. Talking to him, and corresponding later, I felt I was communing directly with the wild prophetic side of American poetry.Most poetry I read in the early 70s was elliptical as all get-out, dreamy, posey, and mainly about the self's deep interest in itself. Charlie was doing something nearly the opposite. You could feel the gravel under his poems -- they were roughcut, fearless, and unfailingly straight about what they wanted to say. You didn't wonder what psychic level Charlie was writing from (8? 13? lingerie and notions?) any more than you'd wonder what level a gun pointed at your darkest suspicions and prejudices was on. Even when his poems were funny they were dead-on serious, like Lenny Bruce on a good night. I had to be reminded he was a youngest, not an oldest child, because of that quality of gravitas.Anyway, on to the poems in Nature Lovers. Charlie wrote these poems in 1989, under the influence of his study in the field of Neuro Linguistic Programming, and readings in the microstructure of cognition. The title is a tip-off to Charlie's ragged irony -- because it is impossible for humans to truly love nature, because we are helplessly separated from it by language and consciousness -- the makings of poetry itself. &quot;I go way back with writers who identify themselves with nature,&quot; he writes in an afterword. &quot;Wordsworth, for the mystifying and mystical unity to be fond there; Menzu (Mencius) for his insistence that the entire state has to operate in obeisance to natural law; and Lucretius, who said poets should never lose the power to irritate.&quot;Each poem is a meditation, or an editorial cartoon, about some aspect of nature. Listen to the fussy cadence and the caustic syllogistics, and tell me you don't hear the unmistakable ring of Menzu in the following:Natural Causes&quot;He died of natural causes.&quot;How many times have you relaxed while readingThat sanguine phrase and paused to wonder:What causes would not be natural?Car wrecks, overdoses, the fall of Flight DC 10?Mechanical, pharmaceutical, aeronautical?If everything is by definition natural,What's left to experiment on?Pig out on Haagen Dazs ice cream diet?Fall down my one-time publisher's nomenclature,The Empty Elevator Shaft?Will you pass on a drug bust or a cardiac arrest?You ask too many questions.See death of a naturalist,Watch Hermes put Argus to sleepWith an interminable story.Bored him to death, naturally.Maybe that is not a &quot;great&quot; poem, but it is great discourse, and poor, loathed poetry desperately needs this sense of engagement, this sense of mental acuity.But Charlie Potts's poetry is. His oeuvre is immense and intelligent and so keen. Besides some twenty books of poems, he has written harrowing memoirs about going crazy in the 60s, plus a terrific polemic about U.S. politics, How the South Finally Won the Civil War. Plus, he is a noted publisher and editor. His own presses: Litmus, Inc. in the 60s and 70s, and Tsunami, publisher of the great multilingual magazine published on rag paper, The Temple and Pacific Northwestern Spiritual Poetry, one of the most remarkable anthologies of recent decades.This little book is one of his most striking collections. In it he achieves what every political poet should ache to do, yet so few try -- graft the confusion of the heart to the evidence of our senses. This is no-nonsense poetry from a visionary who long ago stripped the gears off common sense. His best work swirls the spirits of Ginsberg and Ken Kesey and Phil Ochs at their best, and more anciently, the poets Walt Whitman and William Blake, the pamphleteer Tom Paine, and the mountain man Jim Bridger.Here's a poem which achieves the same kind of connection, with a more gripping lyricism:The Stream of ConsciousnessThe stream of consciousness flowsEffortlessly forward like an unfed brain,Given nothing new to think about,Merely rotates in space, the same sounds,Pictures, and sensations in predictable order.Who will muddy up this stream,Then purge and purify the cluttered tableauOf the extraneous features preventing youFrom actualizing your ideal self,The way you always wanted to look and sound?The quicksand of the collective unconsciousnessWill tempt you many timesWith its lurid renditions of quackery imagesStories in the millennia of Christian denial,Hallucinated forward at the speed of pain.Down a lazy river to the polluted seaThe flotsam jettisons thoughtlessly along,Contributory to a natural disaster.Throw yourself onto the banks to stimulateYour freeflowing sense of contrary motion.Let it work on you. Here is a poem about nothing less than the significance and substance of thought -- everything that means meaning to us. He simultaneously reveres the gift and potential of consciousness, while despairing of our ability to leverage it into truth. Like eschatological Emmett Kellys, the best most of us manage is to sweep the spotlight of our own desire into the ashcan as we depart. The language is unflinchingly ambitious, but never pompous or &quot;poetic.&quot; In fact, it's fun -- &quot;flotsam jettisons,&quot; indeed. Here's a living, thinking head, giving you its best peek at the dynamic that makes us what we are. Hey, poetry isn't supposed to be important.We think we love nature, says Charles Potts, but nature doesn't love us back. In fact, you'd be smart to keep a close eye on it, because one of these days, nature's going to get you."},{"Title":"Nature Lovers","review":"Charles Potts is an experienced poet with more several published works to his credit.

The &quot;new&quot; edition I've got says it's completely updated, but when? My main impression is that it must be about 10 years ago at least, and that many, many changes may have taken place in the Greek backcountry since.Beware this is a book about hiking for hikers, so it doesn't cover the usual tourist info on Athens, Greek antiquities etc. -and so it should, cos there is plenty of that around. It will not interest you if you are not into hill walking. The introduction is fascinating stuff and still useful. The particular routes are another matter, though. Personally, I find them very difficult to read, and the abbreviations 'R' for right and 'L' for left, which are used systematically, don't make things any better, I think they are an unnecessary nuisance. If I go hiking in Greece I reckon I'll just use a compass and my eyes to find the path. Another warning: although the author claims wild animals are scarce in the Greek hills, I have received reports of wolves in the Agios Merkourios area (near Athens!) and although I did not SEE them myself I have no reason to doubt the reports and I _did_ see a large snake while hiking there, so even if there are very few wild animals left, they might still be too many, depending on the circumstances and one's point of view. Agios Merkourios, by the way, is NOT covered by this guide (and it's a shame, because it is a beautiful hill with thick forest and wonderful views of the island of Evia and the sea beyond). Neither is Mount Kitheronas (on the limit between Attica and Boeotia) which also has great hiking and a numerous population of scorpions. Take an antidote when camping, they are nocturnal. And my last complaint is the transcription system used for the Greek names, which I find rather uncomfortable and excessively English; I really wish he had kept them in the original form, after all, we are not so FEW who can at least read the Greek alphabet are we?"},{"Title":"Shooting Star","review":"I ENJOYED THE BOOK A LOT, BEING A MCGREGOR FAN MYSELF,BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT IT HAD MORE INFO ON HIM AND NOT AS MUCH ON HIS FILMS AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM.

He talks of the possibility of living life in a prayer, which in fact is living a life in the space of continuous intentionality and co-creation with God.

One does not have to belong to any organized religion to benefit from this book. This book is well researched, and very well written."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Gregg Braden's infectious enthusiasm is evident in every page of his book, THE ISAIAH EFFECT, as he describes his quest to find ancient wisdom in sacred places around the world. Braden covers some big ideas in THE ISAIAH EFFECT, including: how ancient spiritual writings have been removed and/or altered in much of our modern western education; the tremendous significance that those ancient writings have for us today; and how these teachings explain ways that we can rediscover how to choose the outcomes and possibilities in our life. Braden takes us on an exciting spiritual adventure to Egypt, Tibet, Peru, and the American southwest as he ponders these questions and shares his epiphanies along the way.I find the single most powerful section in THE ISAIAH EFFECT to be Braden's explanation of how to regain the lost language of prayer by learning to align one's thoughts, feelings, and emotions. This &quot;fifth mode of prayer&quot; is not anything like the more common categories of prayer noted by prayer researchers (Colloquial, Petitionary, Ritualistic, Meditative). Those of us who have experienced times of being at one with everything will be thrilled to see this way of praying being adequately described in some detail.I am also fascinated by Braden's assertion that several different religions and cultures describe prophecies of apolocalypse side-by-side with an alternative path of peace and cooperation. Both possibilities may seem to be contradictory, yet they are likely helping to show us how we can actively participate in selecting the future we prefer.This book renews my sense of optimism that together, people of Earth can join in prayer to make a choice between greed, comfort and profit... or love, strength, and balance."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"After reading the book, I decided to put this &quot;new&quot; understanding of how to pray to the test.Instead of praying &quot;for&quot; something, with the implied understanding that it does not currently exist in my life... I decided to focus my prayer on the outcome I wanted... and feeling what it felt like to have my desires manifested.Two things happened to me: 1. I started feeling really good. Even though that might not seem like very much, I noticed that by experiencing my desires, in advance, in my mind's eye, in detail, I felt really good and confident that something good would happen. Things have started happening in relation to my prayers. If nothing else, it definitely is changing my outlook for the better... and I am more motivated to receive the desires of my heart.2. The second thing that has happened to me is that I have experienced a LACK of willingness to visualize in my mind's eye, as sometimes, it is hard to accept that it is I who am responsible for the quality of my life.I mention this second part, because it has also been my experience and I cannot discount it. From a religious perspective, one could say that it is the devil trying to sabotage me (although I have a hard time believing in a literal devil). From my own perspective, though, I simply feel that it is a matter of replacing old habits with new ones.What Gregg Braden writes about, I am living. Please review these parts of his book (hardcover edition): Page 160, 2nd paragraph: &quot;The secret of our lost mode of prayer is to shift our perspective of life by feeling that the 'miracle' has already happened and our prayers have been answered.&quot;Pg 166, para 3+ : &quot;When I (the Indian guy, David) was young, our elders passed onto me the secret of prayer. The secret is that when we ask for something, we acknowledge what we do not have. Continuing to ask only gives power to what has never come to pass... I began (praying) with the feeling of gratitude for all that is and all that has come to pass, I gave thanks for the desert wind, heat, and the drought, for that is the way of it, until now... Then I chose a new medicine. I began to have the feeling of what rain feels like. I felt the feeling of rain upon my body... Our prayer becomes a prayer of thanks for the opportunity to choose which creation we experience. Through our thanks, we honor all possibilities and bring the ones we choose into this world.This works! The only hard part is simply being disciplined enough to &quot;slow down&quot; and do the work (e.g. envisioning the prayer, feeling it through in detail, and believing that this is for real)."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"An excellent book dealing with topics such as quantum physics, prophecy, and the dead sea scrolls written in a language anybody can understand. This book gives new perspective to many of the doom and gloom prophecies of both Edgar Cayce and Nostradamus.

The one about it being the same as Gregg's Lost Mode of Prayer audio tape obviously did not realize that the tape was released before the book as a preview of the book.

The research and background is magnificently done. You can tell Gregg's dedication to his craft and his passion in his art.

It is documented very well and brings reality to the ideas Mr. Braden is trying to get across by his use of examples. I found this to be one of the top three most profound books I have read in my entire life.This book will not speak to everyone, but everyone who is open minded will know how the future that has been predicted can be changed. It is eye-opening in that we can be players in what happens. I found it to be a book that I couldn't wait to see what the next page was going to reveal. People who poopoo prayer won't find the book impressive, but those who have an open mind will find this very thought provoking and credible, especially with specific scientific documentation, for those who consider themselves an empiricist. I feel this book can have a profound effect on the future of the survival of this planet. This book is very motivating to start making a difference by recognizing the possibilities and knowing you can have an active part."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Wait for the paperback. While the author offers some important insights, particularly in his chapter on \\"the lost mode of prayer\\", the remainder of the book seems to be a thin wash without depth and substance. Instead the author seems to hitch a ride on a popular wave of ideas without arriving at a new destination. Even his strongest discussion on prayer lacks substantive reference to specific sources. Nevertheless, his findings seem to ring true. He suggests that in our Western traditions regarding prayer we're taught to ASK God for something we perceive ourselves to be lacking (which is fear based). In doing so,we reinforce and cultivate a reality of lacking because the act of ASKING suggests that we do not perceive abundance. He suggests that ancient texts and cultures reveal something about prayer that we have lost... that the universe contains multiple parallel realities and potentials from which we can actually choose (this is also born out in the science of quantum physics). We can crossover from one reality to another. Prayer is the key, but that prayer must be based in FEELING. We must first acknowledge things as they are without judgement. Then step into the chosen reality and experience this reality as though it has already come to pass. This cannot be fulfilled through thought alone. We must feel it as real. Perhaps the author has other such pearls of wisdom to share but is unfortuantely a very unseasoned writer and researcher which weakens the book considerably or leaves it on shakey ground. He uses information that is in the mainstream, like the Bible Codes, which is treated as truth, glossing over the intense controversy surrounding these findings. He also fails to share the ancient texts and other resources from which he seems to have drawn so much of his own \\"truth\\", so readers can evaluate it for themselves. Hence it doesn't hold its ground amidst weightier historical research. There are numerous seasoned and perhaps more spiritually mature authors who have brought much fuller experiences to their readers to speed them on the path to enlightenment without giving in to the temptation to sensationalize a topic in order to get your attention. Larry Dossey's, Healing Words, comes immediately to mind. It is the inherent truth of a thing that resonates the longest and penetrates the deepest."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Quantum biology and spirituality are merging, and Braden expains, in his view, how this is so.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"The Isaiah Effect ties together prophecy, the Dead Sea Scrolls (most notably the book of Isaiah), Tibetian teachings, Mayan, Hopi and a multitude of other religious thought as well as new discoveries in quantum physics to arrive at the conclusion that these cultures understood prayer as a mechanism for change in the world. As I read through the book I came to the realization that what he has discovered can only be described as holistic prayer. It is prayer that involves every part of you; thought, emotions, belief, etc. Why go another day with a prayer technique that we have learned from childhood with ritualistic repeating of things like, \\"Now I lay me down to sleep.....\\"? Why not have a whole understanding of prayer and how it can be used to change the world. That understanding is available now through this book. Carefully researched, inspirational and full of information, it is the missing piece to learning effective prayer."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"I got so absorbed in this book I couldn't put it down.

Reading this book invigorated my prayers and meditation. They say that when the student is ready, the teacher will appear.

From the cover I was expecting to learn something about 1) the prophet Isaiah -- especially some mysterious, recently unearthed version 2) a scientifically critical and rational way to examine prayer, and 3)how Gregg Braden managed to create a synthesis of Old Testament prophecy and quantum mechanics. The single star rating should illustrate how far short he has fallen in all of these goals.As near as I can tell, Mr. Braden is a tour guide and a New-Age philosophy advocate. This book represents another way to drum up business...a new way to attract tourists. Consistent with that perspective, Isaiah only rates a superficial treatment, while his visit to Tibet is treated as a sacred and monumental event in human history. The word &quot;quantum&quot; appears throughout the book, but never in a way that suggests Mr. Braden has the background to do more than use it in an occasional sentence. Last, his ideas on prayer being a harmonization of mind, body and feelings is just silly.In short, this book could be of interest to a &quot;New-Age-Post-Modern wanderer starting out on a spiritual journey. However, for the serious amateur scientist or theologian, this book is of little value."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"The Isaiah Effect draws on new discoveries in the new science of quantum physics and other spiritual and religious documents such as; the Maya, and Hopi prophecies among others and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The author Gregg Braden writes of the discovery of a lost science he clains, holds the power to bring an end to all war,pain and illness, leading to the predicted golden age of peace and(unlike now), bring healing to humans and the earth. He also deals with many of the predicted prophecies of a catastrophic event. Greg Braden writes that mass prayer is the tool to achieve peace and change. \\"We all know that prayers are energy,\\" and when used in the right way can bring about changes to peoples lives and the environment! But he is right in saying, it will depend on the peoples choice and the amount of effort they put into it. He is a fortunate person in as far as he is able to travel to many ancient and sacred sites to experience firsthand the phenomena.

Though the dead sea scrolls haven't changed in 1,500 years then he makes several extremely obvious errors 1: the Hindus don't teach out of there copies of the dead sea scrolls, 2: If they did learn from the dead sea scrolls they show no evidence for it A: if they did learn anything from it it would have made them think 'well we've learned truths from these Essenes this is making me question my religion.' B: assuming, again, they learned from said scrolls wouldn't the years of teaching generation after generation of those teachings the time passing would have altered the teachings as he says it has for western religion. In fact he never asked them were they learned there method of prayer.Further he often confuses meanings for example we are taught, in the bible, to pray whole heartedly to pray with all thy heart might and mind, while Gregg says pray with your thoughts feelings and emotion aren't the last two the same? YES! they are you feel emotions!Their are better books out there which you not only get what you ask for (if its right) but also sensitize you enough to hear God!Those books are as followsRECEIVING ANSWERS TO OUR PRAYERSPrayers That Bring Miracles"},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Braden's book, The Isaiah Effect, demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering are either symbolic or may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom. Moreover, it establishes that we have the power to determine our future, and avoid catastrophe, which is what another great book also emphasizes. In fact, Real Prophecy Unveiled, by Joseph J. Adamson, explains how we can and will inherit the earth and establish God's &quot;new kingdom,&quot; which will &quot;last forever and never be destroyed.&quot; That's what real prophecy foretells. (Daniel 2:44, Revelation 11:15, Psalm 104:5, etc.) We can thank God that books like these debunk the &quot;end times/last days&quot; nonsense and shed light in a world that has been made dark by religious bigotry, hypocrisy, and violence."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"This is a great book. It is easy and fascinating to read, yet well researched. The book offers so much hope for improving and changing our world - with fact based spirituality and prayer.

I felt better about the possible futures facing us after I read this book. After we do everything that is possible to keep ourselves healthy, safe and at peace...our individual and collective prayer is SO powerful."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"This book is pure bull-schtick.First of all, the book's title is completely misleading. Braden's research is shoddy & suspicious no matter how 'sincere' & 'heartfelt' his voice may sound. I don't believe for one moment Braden didn't know what he was doing & what his motivation was (my number 1 guess: MONEY????).And certainly his editor? My goodness you'd have to be completely clueless about religion, metaphysics, science & scholarly research to the grift going on here - not to mention just plain bad writing (it's all name dropping!).Braden's writing is full of misleading statements, non sequitors & so many blatantly false statements (not to mention repeated misspelling of 'Nicaea') his editor is either indulging in some mind altering drugs or was (just like Braden) simply in it for the money. If a book like this can be published then the one caveat in reading such trash is that Braden's book is absolute proof that one day any one of us can be published.If I may mention a few of the outrageous & ridiculous comments Braden makes. Braden strangely (meaning in a whacked out way without offering any scientific data) connects the Essenes to modern day Tibetan monks & even to the Mayans?!? And what would a fanatical non-rabbinical sect of Judaism have to teach us about a mode of prayer in order to achieve earthly goals & desires when they themselves were ascetics?Essenes were fanatics who believed in an apocalyptic ending to all mankind. They shunned everything from sex to cooked food & their beliefs had nothing whatsoever to do with manifesting in the here & now - or even manifesting anything other than apocalyptic destruction & the return of their messiah. Yet Braden doesn't appear to know these important facts about the Essenes.Braden also doesn't seem to be aware of the fact that it has been many years since scholars have refuted the widely accepted belief that the Essenes wrote the DS Scrolls. Regardless the DS Scrolls (some of the DSS - including The Great Isaiah Scroll - I have read partial English translation) have so far offered nothing in the way of instruction for a secret mode of prayer.Here is an example (there are several of these) where Braden states an opinion as if it were fact. In chapter 7 entitled, 'The Language of God: The Lost Science of Prayer & Prophecy', Braden comments:\\"Revelations from the pre-fourth-century texts, however, remind us that there are no magic codes of vowels or consanants that open doorways into forgotten realms. The secret of prayer lies beyond words of praise, the incantations, and the rhythmic chants to 'the powers that be.'\\"This comment, which is Braden's opinion, is in my humble opinion NOT TRUE. There ARE secret pathways which the power of language can unlock simply through the vibratory pronunciation of vowels & consanants found in any language modern or ancient. The Kabbalists teach this. So too did the ancient Greeks. As well as certain schools of both Hinduism & Buddhism. Any modern day occultist will also attest to the power of both the spoken & written word which one may use in prayer to influence our environment & in turn manifest our desires (within reason).Learning how to use this power properly does take dedication & practice. Read anything by Israel Regardie, Peter Carroll, Phil Hine, Dr. Jonn Mumford, Franz Bardon, Harish Johari's chakra writings & CD if you are interested to learn more about the power of prayer, visualization, language & sound. Another great book is Magical Alphabets by Nigel Pennick.Before buying this book (or any of his slop - The God Code is terrific for a real laugh) I urge you to research Braden's credentials. I felt funny as soon as I read, 'Earth Science Specialist' listed as some sort of \\"scientific\\" title of Braden's. He is nothing of the sort. Nor is he a scholar of ancient texts. I'll venture to say that he's nothing more than another charismatic narcissistic delusional superstar which the \\"new age\\" seems to attract, cultivate & make famous.Hopefully, real scholars & scientists will take Braden on. Unfortunately, I am not an \\"Earth Science Specialist\\", nor even a scientist. But sketchy titles combined with the overwhelming lack of proper footnotes & references is, as always, an excellent BS indicator. Please do not support this dishonest hack or others like him.There are REAL scientists, archaeologists, scholars etc...who are honest, compassionate & doing very important work with integrity. If you desire to give your money away please choose wisely so that more progessive research will be made available by real scientists with proper credentials; making charlatans like Braden fade away."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Greg Braden is a former earth science expert as well as a computer systems designer turned tour guide of sacred and religious sites all over the world. He has written a number of books on similar subjects.The Isaiah effect examines many tenants and religious beliefs throughout man kind's history. Looking at who wrote the Bible, why books were left out and what it meant to the overall understanding of the Bible that the books were not included in the final project. He looks at the Bible with all the books and also looks at Native American, Mayan and Aztec beliefs among many others (to be listed later). How are they similar? The writer will show you.Greg Braden believes we are missing something today. He explains how mass prayer has been proven to work. He discusses quantum physics theories that make many of the ancient prophecies seem plausible. The book spends a good bit of time discussing \\"The Bible Code\\" and the possibilities that it teaches us. The writer also has chapters discussing healing through prayer among many other faith based actions.This book tries to make you think. Common prophecies, common threads in religion, did we all come from one belief? The book also presents a new way to look at time, time travel, dimensions, religions and quantum physics, prayer and prophecy, alternate realities, multiple paralleled universes. Can we bounce back and forth between them? Maybe even without knowing? Are we actually just now starting to learn or relearn what the ancient people knew? If so, why? How do the prophecies from Peru, Tibet, Egypt, Jerusalem and the American Southwest coincide?Many questions are explored in the book. Some answers are given which in turn just raise a few more questions. This is a book that makes you think about many things including how we, as a race, relate to the seen and unseen worlds. If you are in a contemplating mood this is the book for you. If you are interested in the history and contents of religions this has some interest. If you feel something is missing in today's religions, read this book. It will make you think."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"There are two overarching messages of wisdom I get from this work by Gregg Braden. Firstly, the new age adage, \\"you create your reality\\" is more accurately expressed as \\"the blueprints for all possible realities are already in existence and it's our choices that determine the one reality that manifests.\\" So we have endless choices of outcomes before us in terms of materialising the reality we want. We don't even have to imagine it - it already exists, we just have to \\"become\\" it, and then we're there. Gives a lot of support to the idea we are \\"waking dreaming\\" and what we collectively dream becomes more concrete until we \\"believe\\" it as an objective reality. And then we stand around arguing that our particular interpretation of that reality is the right one when in fact it's just changed again because someone else has made another choice.The second message is that we have the power, through \\"choice points\\" and heartfelt prayer (the language of feeling and the connection to the Field) to embrace any reality we want - peace, compassion, acceptance, or war, aggression, disease & judgement. Our destiny to a large extent is undetermined once the consequences of our past choices have played themselves out. We have windows of opportunity constantly and patiently being presented to us within which quantum leaps can be made. All it takes is a critical mass, enough conscious coherence - negative entropy - to make the leap.Perhaps the important messages in this book could have been condensed and there may be some material that on first glance has weak connections to Isaiah. But it's a challenge presenting anything that attempts to integrate left and right brain thinking especially when reader's expectations and prior knowledge can vary drastically.The information relating to the incompleteness of our historical knowledge is a fascinating explanation for why we seem to repeat and recycle the same military rhetoric, and intolerance of those who have different values than us. I am reminded of the film \\"Monsters Inc.\\" where the possibility of using the more potent energy of laughter instead of screams had always been in existence, but no-one had ever found it, or it had simply been forgotten. Perhaps there is some truth to Graham Hancock's (Fingerprints of the Gods) assertion we are a species with collective amnesia.\\"The Isaiah Effect\\" is definitely a useful read and there are gems (like Poponin's DNA and light experiments) scattered throughout.Regards,Daniel John Hancock"},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"Gregg Braden's, The Isaiah Effect, is probably one of the most important works of our time. Having lucidly given background on quantum physics and the meaning in our everyday lives, as well as researched lost biblical teachings and prophecy, Gregg not only effectively clarifies the role we have in recognizing a peaceful world, but clearly and concisely reveals how and where we must begin. I believe this to be an inspired work, written with heart rather than ego, and would recommend it to anyone willing to take the time to read it. You'll be glad you picked it up. It reads quickly, and can change your thinking forever."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"After having read all other works by Braden, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of new information.

While it is disheartening to learn that in many of his workshops, people admit that when they pray, it's usually for money, it's clear that the underlying intention of this book (anything but pecuniary) is to pass on knowledge of how to pray for the only thing that really matters: our own peace and healing, which is then reflected in the world.

Sure, it might make some people feel good, but it does it at the expense of their brains. In the intro he mentions 325 ad. He is referring to the Council of Nicea - which omitted certain gnostic writings from the Bible - oh, like the one in which Jesus had to remove Mary's imperfection- so he changed her into a man. The author evidently has a problem with the Council's actions. I would say more, but it all would be about the same.

The personal story examples he shares with the reader serve to remind us of the wonders of the world. Since Braden is a scientist, he lends credence to the power of the mind many of us have understood.While I enjoyed reading this book for the most part, I was and am peeved that he like so many other Christians, refers to the \\"New Testament\\" for things which are merely a repeat of what is written in the Five Books Of Moses. Many Christians like to pretend, or are ignorant of the fact they are an offshoot of Judaism. Intellectually, his negligence of researching completely his thesis is insulting at best. If he read the Five Books of Moses, and looked into Jewish prayers, he would have understood Judaism has known the \\"secret\\" he thinks he discovered and unearthed of how to pray. He went to Tibet to look into old books, and look for ancient wisdom which made for an interesting story, however all he had to do was read, and ask some rabbis questions. It is unbelievably insulting when current Jewish teachings which have been part of our traditions since Abraham are completely overlooked and ignored, and researchers think they must look elsewhere because why, because the Jewish people couldn't possibly have any real insight.While I liked the premise, and the stories, the basic ignorance of his research was a glaring insult. He should look into what I have written about, and can even ask me for specifics, so he can revise this book to be a more accurate reflection of truth. As a matter of fact, the subtitle of the book itself is incorrect, as the Jewish people know, practice, and continue to pray the way he thinks he formulated and deduced.

With my interest piqued at the title and the book description, I delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's \\"precise instructions\\" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon.What I found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts. The mixing of religions, for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again, drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books. In only one chapter does Braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of Isaiah. Instead he relegates the books of the Essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence.In the brief pages in which Braden actually does discuss Isaiah, his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science. His basic premise of \\"The Effect\\" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present. Such a revelation is not a new interpretation of Isaiah at all. Any student of the Bible and Christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the Old Testament are records of God warning Israel, and the world, of turning away from Him.To Braden's credit, his discussions of the effects of prayer in today's society are commemorable, albeit somewhat misguided. I agree with him that people in today's society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they've surrounded themselves. However, I believe Braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer. He fails to discuss how humans, and their emotions, are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes.Braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts. In the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created. Humbleness before God and the filling of the Holy Spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings.A disappointing read."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"It arrived in a timely manner.I haven't gotten to read it yet, but I'm super excited about it.I've been reading through Isaiah and I wanted something to go along with it."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"The lost art of prayer revealed and made accessible to today's believer."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"This nonsensical book has precious little to do with Isaiah, making very little mention of Isaiah while dragging the reader from Tibet to Hopis in Arizona. Braden's baloney name-drops quantum physics, a subject matter that, clearly, he does not begin to understand but does know how to exploit for his mush-minded readers. What Braden also understands is the mindset of so many irrational readers who are positively triggered by words such as \\"Decoding,\\" \\"lost,\\" \\"science,\\" \\"prayer,\\" and \\"prophecy.\\" Combining all of these trigger words into one book title evidences Braden's marketing savvy, attracting the ignorant and the neurotic into a mire of mystery and mishmash.

Anyone interested in being part of the healing of the world will embrace Gregg Braden's profound insights.The subtle but very noticeable &quot;shifts&quot; may be part of your awareness, and as each of us feels this connection it creates a wave of hope as it spreads and blossoms so beautifully; and as our thoughts unite us with hope for our future and the emotion touches our hearts, each heart will share this peace with the next as the feeling based prayer helps us remember...&quot;that we are here to love and to find a love even greater than any known by the angels of the heavens.&quot; This book is dedicated to our search for love and the memory of our power to bring heaven to earth. Please read The Isaiah Effect: Decoding the Lost Science of Prayer and Prophecy and trust that when the thought of hope and positive feeling based prayers are felt within our hearts all hearts will resonate as one and this world will be a wonderful place to be."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"It's an intriguing concept--that prayer might allow one to choose one's reality. It's not wholly a bogus idea--Evan Harris Walker explores similar territory in his &quot;Physics of Consciousness&quot;, in which he says that it may be possible that one's will, when properly marshalled, can have effects on quantum events, and, perhaps, events in the macroworld.Braden is not as careful as Walker; he interprets suggestive research as proving his thesis, even when it does not. Indeed, he breathlessly reports as if modern science was in general agreement with him, which it is decidedly not. I would wager that most scientists would have little sympathy for these ideas.Braden's idea that prophecies such as that of Isaiah in the Old Testament reveal different possible quantum futures is an interesting idea--one that Braden doesn't really develop fully.Braden also suggests that ancient the Essenes somehow had intuited all of this. To support this thesis, he quotes heavily from Edmond Szekely's &quot;Essene Gospel of Peace&quot;, and infers that it is one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. This is quite false.In truth, the actual Dead Sea Scrolls have a completely different focus and concern--they are reveal a profoundly apocalyptic mindset, quite unlike Szekely's &quot;gospel&quot;, which most scholars believe the French-Hungarian Szekely wrote himself.It is unfortunate--Braden seems sincere, and the basic idea of the book is an interesting one--but his scholarship is so sloppy that it is hard to take him seriously."},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"This is a must read for anyone who cares about the direction our world is heading...For anyone who truly wants to choose world peace...For anyone who has tried to change their own life without success, and wants to know how to choose something different...For anyone who has ever prayed and wondered why the object of their prayer was not forthcoming. It is well written and reads easily, aided by personal anecdotes. It is also well referenced and gives us practical direction based on truths that have been known since ancient times.

Oh, the things that I heard and was encouraged to believe and accept as true. It wasn't like other cults. I was free to come and go as I pleased but I still felt trapped and every time I left that place...that wretched, horid place...I felt like I was going to throw up. But I eventually found the courage within myself to leave this sick and twisted place. Oh, they did a great job of \\"brainwashing\\" me. For years I felt the affects of this cult; low self esteem, insomnia, depression. Now, after 20+ years of being away from that cult I finally have the strength to tell people the cult I once belonged to...The Christian Church.I think I just set myself up to be booed and hissed. I think I'm going to make a few people angry with that statement. But you know what, so what? Does this mean that I am an atheist? No. Just because I don't belong to a \\"traditional\\" religion and follow blindly their dogmas and creeds, rites and rituals does not mean I don't believe in God...err...strike that...I forgot...I don't believe in God...I KNOW there is God.This incredibly wonderful book by Greg Braden is a book that will send the \\"traditional religionist\\" into a tailspin because it contradicts things most people believe; that God is 'out there' somewhere and if you pray hard enough and long enough and you're 'good enough' and you just happen to be praying on day where God might be in a good and jovial mood, you just might get your prayers heard and if you're lucky enough, you might get one of them answered.This book reinforces the idea that we are always in prayer/always in communion with God. How can the created be separate from the creator? How can a wave be separate from the ocean? How can life be separate from living? Tradition religions have done a terrific job of making Almighty God small and weak and powerless. How can something that is all-mighty be thwarted by sin..error...mistakes? God is centered in what God holds as \\"good and very good...\\" God only know Itself and God is Love and Love only knows Love and the only thing Love does is extend Itself always and in all ways mment after moment after moment because to God/Love, all there is now and \\"now is always the accepted time...\\"I stopped praying to God a long time ago. Now I pray 'through' God...of an awareness that all things are already within me. Many people would call this materialism, but all things that are in the physical world are but symbols of things that are already present in the spiritual world. Everything in this world of form - including you - is at its essence, invisible and this is what Braden asserts over and over again.There are some people who feel very threatened when one has the courage to say and mean, \\"I and the Father are One...\\" and over 2,000 years ago most people still felt the same way when a young Jewish carpenter began his ministry. So threatened were they, that they killed him. But he had the last laugh, didn't he? How can you kill Truth...the invisible...God? You can't. And that very essence...indeed, that very Presence is within us now and is at our root, the Truth of who we are.There will be those of you who scoff at this review because maybe I challenged you...but believe it or not...it was you that brought you to this place. Maybe you needed to read this review. Maybe I gave you something to think about and believe me, I don't want to change what you hold as true but don't try and convince me what I hold as true, either.This book truly had a powerful affect on me and every day I give a prayer of thanks that I am free to choose again and again and again what I desire to have God be in my life.Peace and Blessings,john, 'the Light Coach'"},{"Title":"Isaiah Effect","review":"I have read many books which discuss quantum physics and creating your own reality. They are all very interesting but few actually give you a nuts and bolts idea of exactly what thoughts to think or what words to say. Gregg Braden does, in fact, give us a formula, which comes to us from the ancient Tibetians and the Essenes who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls. Some of it is in the Bible but a lot of it has been edited out by the Catholic Church. It is very empowering because we can use the \\"technology of prayer\\" as Gregg puts it, to change ourselves and our world.

The Western Marches had not yet been subdued by English authority, and clouds of banditti continue to make inroads into English territory. Our characters are besieged in a castle that only at the moment of crisis is it put into a posture of defense to withstand the siege. A phlegmatic Fleming and his daughter form the sensible counters to the hot-blooded English family who owns the castle. Intrigues and sorcery (the product of the times), conflicts between religion, the foreign wars, infighting within the family (when a son would murder his father for his possessions) all have equal place here. A fascinating glimpse of the times, and a highly readable story make this yet another jewel in Scott's wonderful body of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The betrothed: A tale of the Crusaders (The illustrated Waverley novels)","review":"I enjoyed this book.

As a child, I used to dream about becoming an author so that I could encourage people I would never meet...but I NEVER planned that my first book would be about grief, but it is. I wrote Grieving The Loss of A Loved One as a fellow-griever still in the journey of losing my three children through miscarriage and an infant son, being married to a man who lost both of his parents as a child and out of the pain of experiencing many other life losses.After my son died, I went to the bookstore and found (and read) many good books about grief (I list several of them in the back of my book) but I yearned for a book that would give me permission to grieve, be a companion in my journey and include a Scripture, short reading, prayer, and place to journal my thoughts and feelings. I searched but didn't find this book, so I wrote it.Although my loss may be different than yours and I may not understand exactly how you feel, I can relate to some of your pain. I encourage you, the reader,to think of my book as a personal friend with whom you can laugh, cry,vent, question and share your deepest thoughts and feelings. Think of the table of contents as a compass and choose the section that best meets your needs: Denying, Venting, Questioning, Bargaining, Crying, Surrendering, Accepting, Praising, Being, Celebrating, Relating or Living. Each section contains five short readings and carry the theme of &quot;being on a journey&quot; throughout the book.I also created a special readings for special days section to point you to specific devotions to read on birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, and special events when the pain of losing your loved one can trigger your memory and emotions.Sooner or later you will suffer the loss of someone you love. It may be a parent, child, spouse, friend, or co-worker. When that time comes for you or others you know, I pray my book will be a comforting companion of hope that points you to the One who understands and can heal your hurts.I would love to hear from you!

I was also surprised there weren't more direct references to the holocaust because of when the book was written.Worth picking up a used copy if you have time to kill."},{"Title":"Existentialism and the modern predicament (Harper torchbooks, TB28)","review":"This book was written almost immediately after World War II. It does not mention the war though it does take Heidegger to task for his support of the Nazis. It is not basically a political work though it makes it very clear that its support for and understanding of Existensialism means relating it to the free socieities of the West. Heinemann quite oddly begins the book by suggesting that Existensialism is an adequate philosophy which must be corrected and replaced by a new philosophy which he will expostulate. Quite oddly then he goes on to present the views of a number of major Existensialists, Kierkegaard, Gabriel Marcel , Sartre and those he classifies as existensialists who are questionably so i.e. Jaspers, Husserl, Heidegger, Berdayev. He shows great sympathy for both Kierkegaard and Marcel and it seems to me he himself leans toward a religious position. He elucidates why for Kierkegaard Despair means alienation from God. And in fact he gives an extensive analysis of the concept of Alienation in a Technological Age. His own answer is that a new philosophy is needed one which centers on the concept of 'response' This means a kind of thought in which personal involvement and communication are central. It seems to me however he makes his case too briefly and in a quite weak one.But he does in the course of the writing show himself to be intelligent and humane and does provide introductions to the thinkers he writes about.Considering that it is a work of philosophy it is not especially difficult to read.A good book written fifty years ago which still has something to say today."},{"Title":"Biowarrior: Inside the Soviet/Russian Biological War Machine","review":"Readers of Russian politics and world peace will find Biowarrior: Inside the Soviet/Russian Biological War Machine to be an intriguing insider's look at the Soviet biological war machine, written by a leading Russian scientist who worked for decades at the heart of the program.

Here is one from the ACCU.org website.\\"Reviewed by Silvia de Beer in Overload OL37 (May 2000)This book has not taught me anything new. I can not think who the intended audience would be. In the preface the author claims you need to be thoroughly familiar with the relational database model and that you do not need a background in the OO paradigm.Part one, a hundred pages of theory, explains the OO data model. UML is shortly mentioned, but throughout the rest of the book ER models are used. The quality of some of the models is doubtful, as inheritance seems overvalued. Normal associations, like delegation or other forms, are not mentioned as an alternative. I do not know why this book has OO Database design in the title, because hardly any specifics about this topic can be found in the book.The equivalent of SQL for OO databases is ODL and OQL, but it is stated 'A discussion of OQL is beyond the scope of this book'. So what is in the scope of the book?Part two, two hundred pages, consists of three case studies. It contains many pages on useless company descriptions. The OO database design is based on the relational model, copied from the book Relational Database Design by the same author. Some tables are slightly objectified, but this is all that is done. There is no design, just repetitive code listings, of which the book contains no less than hundred pages.I cannot recommend this book, you better read a good OO introduction and find another source for OO databases.\\"I couldn't have said it better.

You might want to look at \\"Introduction to Object-Oriented Databases\\" by Won Kim or better yet, just go learn to do Object Oriented Analysis and Design using UML from the \\"UML Distilled\\" book, then (and only then) create am Object Persistance Model from the UML design.Devin."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Database Design Clearly Explained","review":"I really like the way this book steps through the progression from relational databases to hybrid databases to fully object-oriented databases. This is not a book on designing object-oriented applications (of which there are many good titles). It is about designing databases. The content is excellent, and is, indeed, &quot;clearly explained.&quot; In my opinion, it is most appropriate for people with some experience with entity-relationship diagrams, and some programming background. The references cited are the &quot;masters.&quot; This book does not waste the reader's time with silly humor or unnecessary material.I hope there will be a second edition. If there is, the glossary might be somewhat expanded. I would like additional unified modeling language (UML) diagrams. I would like an explicit explanation of &quot;impedience mismatch&quot; between object-oriented applications and relational databases, although this may be slightly out of scope.This is a unique and valuable book. Being a teacher, I see its value in the classroom. It is a practical book which surely is also of immediate value to progressive database administrators and programmers who are helping bring object technology into their organizations. It is an excellent textbook for courses on object-oriented database design. I plan to use it as a second textbook for a general course on databases. I think it would also be ideal as a second textbook for courses in object-oriented systems design which include database design.Bruce Neubauer -- Pittsburg State University"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Database Design Clearly Explained","review":"If you don't already know and understand the basic object terminology explained in this book, you probably don't need to start with a book on object databases. I would also read the reviews of this author's other books. They are mostly very bad. This author seems to write more book than anyone could write and do a good job - even if they wrote fulltime - much less if they taught college as this author claims to. This book is probably not worth the money or your time."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Database Design Clearly Explained","review":"This book is a relatively easily read intro., but is nowhere near being the definitive work on OODB. This book is useful but only in conjunction with other works. For example you will do at least as well with Stonebraker's (old) OODB book; SQL99 refs. covering OO concepts; some vendor publications; the OO parts of some general db books (e.g., Silberschatz, et. al.); the ODMG 3.0 spec book, etc.As other reviewers have said, it's not clear who this book is aimed at. Including a general (and mediocre) OO introduction is seemingly pointless. No reader moving beyond relational db's into OODB is likely to be unfamiliar with OO. Also the DB modelling intro. is lame. There are some mistakes (typos in code that clearly wouldn't work!), but the narrative is generally good. The examples are long winded (multiple chapters) to make points that could be summarized in a lot fewer pages.I'd give this book only 1 or 2 stars, but I don't know of a single clearly better volume available yet."},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Database Design Clearly Explained","review":"Needing a database backend for one of my projects but not quite up to speed on the relational database model, I stopped by the campus library and found this book. I plowed through the first half of the book in an afternoon, and started writing code for PostgreSQL the next day.This book is short, to the point, and fairly shallow. A great starting place if you want just enough background to understand a database product's documentation.

It's by far her best cookbook!"},{"Title":"QUEEN OF TO-MORROW","review":"THIS IS A NECESSARY BOOK FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN ENGLISH ROYALTY....AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO, LIKE MYSELF, PARTICULARLY ADMIRE HER MAJESTY, QUEEN ELIZABETH II.The paper is of the highest quality....and though it was published in 1947, (it was written to commemorate Princess Elizabeth's 21st birthday in that year....and was obviously published before her wedding to Prince Philip), the sheen of the paper, (at least in my own copy), has not diminished, and any \\"tanning\\" of the pages has been reduced to an almost indiscernable, lightest of light, daffodil yellow!It is said that \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\"....and there are SO many, and quite wonderful pictures, of Princess Elizabeth, her family, and her life, up to that point, here! A few of them are formalized, colour plates -- but the real joy of these pictures, black and white, and colour, is that I, at least, have never seen the great majority of them before! I have been interested in HM Queen Elizabeth II since I first heard of her, as a child, when her coronation was featured in \\"My Weekly Reader\\". How delighted I was that there was a WOMAN around who was more powerful than all the little male-chauvinist boys in my 1952 second grade class-room -- and even more powerful than my august, and rather stern, lady teacher! In the library, in \\"Royalty\\" Magazine, and on Amazon, I have read all I can about her -- and treasured each photo I found of her. And though I have seen many, many photographs of Her Majesty, the great majority of those in this book, are, as I have said, wonderfully and wonderously, brand new to me! And the expressions, and poses, do tell much about the personalities, not only of Princess Elizabeth, but of all those pictured with her.The text is very full. Much, much information is here, to delight the curious royalty-watcher. Although much of it is couched in the formal politeness of the time, when royalty, (and especially, heiress presumptives!), were never, never criticised, there is SO much text, that a lot of revealing information is within! (And much of it, I suspect, would not be allowed in print today!)You can tell this book was written with love, loyalty, and respect. I also respect the Queen...not only as Queen, but as an individual. She was the first royal personage to actually SERVE in the armed forces -- many had commanded regiments in the past, but she herself BESIEGED her father with requests that she be allowed to actually JOIN the services, like other girls of her age. The suggestion that, at birth, she had been obliged to a very different kind of public service, did not dissuade her. She became a driver, for the Women's Auxilliary Territorial Service, and was given the rank of second sub-altern. Today, her grandsons follow in her path.... She is strong, feminine, wise, witty, and enjoys jokes far more than most people know. Today, she has one foot in the 21st century, and one foot in the 15th century. This is as it should be, for a modern-day queen.I have read that the Queen's personality is such that, had she not been born to royal status, she probably would have become a TV anchorwoman. This book shows the Princess she was -- human, humane, and yet very regal.Reading it, one sees she is basically the same person today, with the addition of accumulated wisdom and knowledge that the experience of years has given her. This book -- filled as it is with tid-bits of her personal life, and information on the occasions she had attended up until when this book was published, in 1947 -- is a true and wonderful portrait of a responsible, serious, yet fun-loving person!I have read elsewhere that the author of this book, LOUIS WULFF, was born in 1903....and is, at this writing, on August 3, 2008, still wonderfully alive! It may be very true that doing things one enjoys lengthens one's life! This book is obviously a labor of learning, love and respect...and reading it, one gains much resepct for both the author and the royal person he writes about! It is wonderful such people exist in the world today....and wonderful to be able to own a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"It does take some time to study and learn, but what great thing doesn't take time.

Ligaments hold our joints together. If they were to stretch like rubber bands, they would not provide stability for our joints. Tendons connect muscles to bones. If tendons were like rubber bands, the contractile force developed by our muscles would not be transmitted to the bones to cause movement.

What a difference it has made in my world! Following Boston, I completed the 8 mile run of a team event in our area called &quot;Ski-to-Sea.&quot; There are 8 member teams consisting of skiing (cross country &amp; downhill), running,canoeing, biking (road and mountain biking), and kayaking. The run portion is an 8 mile run from the base ski area near the top of Mt. Baker, in Washington state, to the Dept of Transportation center, near the bottom.The entire 8 mile downhill course consists of a grade of about 3 - 5%. I was envisioning total quad damage, shin splints, and other aches and pains. Fortunately, the night before I ran, I skipped ahead in the book and read the section about techiques for running down hill. To make a long story short, I ran the 8 mile course in 56:07 (not bad for age 51)and have experienced little, if any, residual aches and pains. These techniques really work!

I started from scratch several times, but I consistently got pain in my shins or knees whenever I ran more than a couple miles. This book has helped me focus on my form and I've made consistent progress. Now, I must admit, I always just thought I could run and that it would be a natural, easy thing to do. I'm not sure why it never occurred to me to practice running the way I practice yoga: to focus on tiny, incremental changes in your body to free yourself and become better. I had seen this book in the stores before and thought it sounded just a little too new-agey for me. The technique does borrow some of its ideas from tai chi, but the author is a serious runner who has an incredible amount of mileage under his belt and, while the approach may not be entirely scientific, it works. I think it's really more grounded in common sense, ie. if what you're doing hurts, you're doing something wrong. This book has made me excited about running. Instead of thinking exclusively about how many miles I'm going to do on a given day, I think about how I'm going to get better and make myself feel good.

I found it because of a silly injury that wouldn't go away and the \\"injury free\\" on the cover dragged me in.Until then, I thought running was something that we did and didn't need any instruction on how to do it. I was dead wrong.Danny's approach will transform your running form, make running fun, and most of all keep you injury free while you're doing it.I've told many clients since being introduced to ChiRunning to pick up the book, read it front to back, and do every drill in it. Once they have they come back to me thrilled and ready to give in another shot even though their doctor has told them \\"never again.\\"The book will transform your running by allowing you to lighten up and use less force to propel you forward. Danny's approach is to let gravity work with you and lean into your run while you let your legs pick up then swing forward. When you get what he teaches it's almost effortless.This approach has allowed me to run longer distances and for longer periods of time without getting tired out of breath or injured. Sound good to you?!I introduced the technique to a client of mine who was suffering from some IT band tightness. We worked to stabilize her side-to-side hip swing (lateral) while she was running using some of the techniques and now the hip doesn't hold her back at all! It even allowed her to participate in her first triathlon, something she thought she could never do because of her injury!The book is a must have for those with knee, hip, and lower back troubles as well.

A major positive effect is that one becomes very focused on running form, proper breathing and relaxation. \\"ChiRunning\\" basically involves running with a forward lean, letting gravity pull you forward (as the author describes it). Instead of lifting the knees, you should keep them low and lift your heels instead. Landing should be done on midfoot, and not on the heels. When running this way, you almost get the feeling of falling, which is how it's meant to work! Granted, it's a slightly unorthodox method, but I am willing to give it a try. Danny Dreyer claims that this is a more effective (less effort-demanding) way of running and that it makes you less prone to injuries, compared to what he calls the \\"Power Running paradigm\\" (the \\"no pain, no gain\\" mindset; developing muscle power to do the work). These claims aren't quite substantiated in the book, at least not scientifically, but many of the underlying principles (keeping relaxed, listening to your body, gradual progress) are quite sound. Despite the author's constant use of \\"chi\\" (which is a somewhat controversial and elusive concept), he manages to avoid becoming completely new age-y - there are lots of highly practical tips throughout the book, from exercises to loosen up tense muscles and ligaments, to a couple of creative ways to ensure that your shoelaces don't come untied! I have to admit though, that the chapter on diet had me giggling a little. \\"Getting the most chi from your food\\"? But even here, the actual advice given seems sensible: Eat lots of fruit, vegetables and grains, eat meat, fish and eggs regularly but sparingly, etc. Honestly, I'd rather go with the \\"High Chi\\" diet than the ridiculous low-carb fad suggested by Atkins and his followers!ChiRunning is a nice book to add to your library of running books, even if you don't intend to change your running style as drastically as it asks you to. It's a welcome change of tone if you've been reading sundry training books full of training schedules and pace charts. If you desperately want to break 35 minutes for the 10K or 3 hours for the maraton, you'll get a much needed reminder from Danny Dreyer to put less emphasis on externally motivated goals. Instead he tells you to \\"let your goals be an expression of who you are\\". That sentence alone made the book a worthwile read for me."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I was lucky enough to discover ChiRunning in 2004, shortly after the first edition of the book was published. Learning to run with more efficent form ended 25 years of knee pain for me known as Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITB). With ChiRunning, I learned to engage my core properly which reduced the side-to-side motion of my hips. This in turn relieved the extra stress on my ITB and eliminated the rubbing on the outer part of my knee. In the new edition of ChiRunning, Danny Dreyer has added an in depth section on running injuries called \\"Troubleshooting: Injury Prevention and Recovery.\\" All common running injuries and their related form issues are addressed including ITB syndrome, shin splints, achilles tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, groin pulls, hamstring pain, calf pulls and soreness, and other knee, ankle and foot pain. Chapter four on the \\"Basic Components of Technique\\" and Chapter five on \\"How to Learn ChiRunning\\" are also greatly expanded in the new edition. Step by step lessons and additional pictures clearly explain and illustrate the ChiRunning technique."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I think many of the concepts featured in this book are useful in helping me improve my running posture. However, I think this is a concept created by one person that works for that person - and has fortunately worked for enough other people to become a 'craze'. Based on the number of years I have been a runner (25) and the number of injuries I have sustained (3), this system of Chi Running is not something I am going to spend a lot of effort trying to learn. The most useful things I took away were some breathing techniques and some posture techniques, but this 'flat foot' way of pounding the pavement simply does not feel natural to me.Just like everything else in life...take a little bit of different things, think and act critically about it, and make it your own."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I am 43 and had quit running because of knee and ankle pain.

The step-by-step approach is easy to follow and quickly apply. Important concepts covered include mental focus, body sensing, breathing, relaxation, posture, and gravity-assisted running. As a martial arts instructor these ideas truly resonate, though most anyone can take advantage of them.

Too many runners run without enough attention to their form. Unfortunately the book is overflowing with self-reported testimonials litered throughout. The constant repetition of what the author perceives to be core messages will insult your intelligence.

It left me with an aftertaste of having read an infomercial for a DVD, website and training courses. My recommendation to the autor: read Steven King's &#34;On writing&#34;. The current form of writing must be be limiting the success of this book -preventing it from realizing its true potential. I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"There is a lot of 'fluff' in this book to make it as long as it is.. but once you wade through it.. you will discover a new way to run pain free.I have been recovering from a knee injury for over 2 years where it really hurt to do just about anything to include sitting for long periods of time or even walking. I am a very active person so I tried a couple of times to start jogging and other activities again but I was just in too much pain. A friend of mine who is a marathon runner told me about this book and how it really helped with his knee pain. I picked up the book, read it and did what the author suggested.I AM AMAZED AT THE DIFFERENCE!!! Within 2 weeks I was running 3 miles everyother day with NO PAIN!!! And if I start to notice some pain I actually look at what I am doing and it is either my posture changed or the position of my feet (pointing more out than straight)are the cause. I adjust accordingly and the pain is gone. Within 2 months I ran my first 10K in 45:40... Within 3 months I am running just about everyday. My running schedule is now 4 miles, 4 miles, 10 miles, day off, 4 miles, 4 miles 10 miles day off (etc)...Once you get to the technique that the author offers in this book you will see an amazing change. I used to have to listen to music when I ran.. now I enjoy NOT listening to music.. 'listening to my body' respond to changes in my running and clearing my head...I suggest this book to anyone who wants to run pain free and learn to enjoy running."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"A few months ago, I came across an article about Chi-running and got very intrigued by this new method as I just started my training for my first Marathon.

Even better, I had my personal pace record 8:15/mile.It definitely worked well for me. I am now addictive to distance running and getting myself ready for St. Louis marathon in 2007.

Don't be scared by the title \\"Chi Running\\" - there is nothing supernatural about these techniques - in fact it is as natural as it can be! However, we need to re-learn HOW to run (like we did when we were kids!) - in an effortless way, free of injuries. Danny Dreyer guides you through a system where you use the core (and core muscles) in a more effective way through a forward body lean. The idea of effective body movement through the use of core muscles is also found in Terry Laughlin: \\"Total immersion\\" - a guide on swimming.I won't go into more detail here - I will leave that to the author of \\"Chi Running\\"!The book is filled with additional information on running, but the instruction on the running posture is what makes it so special and worth studying. I try to put the instructions into practise, step by step, and I feel it's working. My speed has improved and I am much more aware of keeping a proper technique through the races, which makes running long distances more enjoyable.The instructor in my gym (professional sport instructor) borrowed the book and started running again after a long break - now he is free from previous injuries that prevented him from running.For those of us who don't have a Chi-running instructor nearby, the video instruction is necessary. It should be included with the book."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"On balace, this is a highly illiminating read even for someone like me who has participated in the sport for 30 years. His emphasis on relaxation, funtional forward lean from the ankle, and attention to posture in general are things that every beginning runner needs to hear and every veteran runner needs to hear again.If there are nits to pick, it's Danny's insitence on lumping Kenyans into one group of high achieving-never injured runners (which is not the case, many of the top Kenyan runners are injured, which is a reason why they only started two male runners instead of three at the Athens Olympics in 2004) and for mindless statements to the effect that Kenyan runners don't have big calves because they use ChiRunning principles. His big calf/small calf argument would have been better reasoned if he had included any research into genetic predisposition of the Kenyan running tribes."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Excelente.

I'd never run before so we joined a community running club. I was MISERABLE! Not only did Texas heat kick my butt, I was in constant pain - hips mostly. What could have potentially been a good time together improving our health turned into miserable dread. I felt there MUST be an easier way to run. I process things logically, so I began scouring the web for answers. Youtube had fabulous videos produced by ordinary people explaining the ChiRunning method. I watched the videos and then purchased the book. This book LITERALLY changed the way I ran and improved my running technique. Since owning the book, I've run injury free (no more hip issues, etc) and have run 2 half marathons, a 10K and a couple of 5Ks.

But since I live where there are four seasons, with harsh winters, I figured I'd try to add some running -- again -- for the months when biking is out. \\"Again\\" because about ten years ago I tried running. A trip to the running store led to a pair of heavily cushioned running shoes. Off I went, happily heel-striking and striding large. Shin splints and knee pain sent me to a podiatrist. \\"Stop running,\\" he said. \\"You're not built for it. Or limit it to twenty minutes per workout a few times a week.\\" I quit running. Giving it up was effortless. So, when, after the ten year hiatus I thought about giving it another shot, I sort of stumbled on this book and was put off by the title. I love tai chi but \\"Chi Running\\" sounded like some hippie freak's notion of skipping around and letting your chi flow purple and green. Well, don't judge a book by the title, I guess. After reading some reviews of it on line I bought it. It totally changed how I run. I hooked up with a certified Chi Running teacher and took a few lessons, then went to a workshop. Two years later I'm addicted to running. I'm too superstitious to say I no longer have shin splints or knee problems but I don't, and I ascribe that to what I learned from this book, which was augmented by personal instruction. So I endorse the method. And the book is really very clear. I do think you can learn the method just from the book. The DVD is less helpful but nice to have, but the book really is the best tool for learning this style of running. It covers hills, speed work, the long slow run, footwear, and of course the proper mechanics. I have also read The Pose Method, which is excellent as well. The key difference is that the Pose Method emphasizes landing on the balls of the feet. Chi Running emphasizes a midfoot landing. I've tried both and prefer the latter as it doesn't exhaust my calf muscles. Look, that podiatrist was right. I'm medium height, a former lifter whose stocky with thick short legs. But through this method I've fallen in love with running and now the bike comes out only maybe twice a week. In my view, this is the best book out there on running form. There are others, and many are worthwhile as well, but if I had to read only one book on good form I'd go with this one."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I received the book in excellent condition and good time frame.

I recommend anyone intereseted in running whether you are a beginner or have been running for years, read Chi running and try it.

What Dan does best is highlight the importance of posture & how to practice good posture, use the force of gravity to propel you when running by leaning forward slightly, make sure you stride is behind your hips not in front. If you are interested in alternative forms of running you may also want to look up immersion swimming.The Bad: If you are a visual learner it's easier to understand what Dan is saying by watching him on youtube videos or others videos on chi running. Really any type of running is easier to understand when seeing the act done verses hearing about it on an audio book. Not a good book to listen to while driving or otherwise because you'll be unable to be ready to practice specific stretches, & activities Dan prompts you to do.

This book introduces a person to being aware of your body mechanics while running. To me, many of the tips were common sense, such as keeping a straight posture and not swinging my arms wildly or crossing them in front of me. I probably wasn't leaning forward as much as I am now. I probably had more of an up and down stride, so that tip was helpful (although I'm still not any faster). The one tip that \\"did me in\\" was the tip to land mid-foot. I had always read and learned to land heel to toe. After about 2 months of landing mid-foot, I was puzzled and frustrated as to why I started to have extremely painful knees. Especially walking up and down stairs. I couldn't figure out why this was happening. It got to the point where I dreaded my run and every step I was saying ouch, ouch, ouch. Then I thought, I think I'll stride the way I used to stride and within 1 day the pain was gone. I am now back to a heel toe landing and wanted to warn other people who have read this book.

Ultramarathoners would benefit from this book too."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"The timing of the first publication of ChiRunning is important. Dr. Romanov, a Russian sports scientist and Olympic coach, published \\"Pose Running\\" in 2002 (he had been teaching the technique in clinics and on DVD's for years before that). Dreyer's 2004 \\"ChiRunning\\" technique is not far from being a dead ringer for the technique published two years earlier by Romanov. Hence, the claim that ChiRunning is a \\"ground breaking\\" technique is, quite simply, false (Romanov himself began by analyzing the techniques of world class runners, and so he doesn't boast of being a ground breaker). If a book begins with false claims, buyer beware. Dreyer has tweaked Romanov's technique in a couple of important ways. Romanov advocates landing on the ball of the foot, while Dreyer advocates landing on the midfoot. Dreyer doesn't, however, explain what the \\"midfoot\\" is. Is it the arch of the foot? If so, how does one land first on the arch of the foot? The toes, ball, or heel of the foot have a nasty habit of preventing an arch-first strike unless the runner lands on the outside of the foot (known as \\"supination\\") or the inside of the foot (\\"pronation\\"), which not even Dreyer recommends. Or when Dreyer refers to the midfoot, does he really just mean the ball of the foot? If so, he is once again plagiarizing Romanov. A \\"certified\\" ChiRunning instructor has an online video and tries to deal with this embarrassing ambiguity by explaining that landing on the midfoot is really just another way of describing landing on the \\"whole\\" foot simultaneously. If so, why didn't Dreyer just say so about something as important as how the foot strikes the ground while running? It wouldn't be the most efficient way to run, but at least there would be some clarity about what is being recommended in a 320 page book that is long on fluff and short on practical detail (an online video of Dreyer running in a race, as opposed to the carefully staged photos in the book, shows him landing heel first). ChiRunning also omits a critical element of the Romanov technique that is critical to learning to run in an efficient way (I tried Dreyer's method before happening upon Romanov's book and am hence speaking from personal experience). Romanov's book includes extensive, easy to understand and follow drills to learn how to run correctly. ChiRunning, on the other hand, devotes only a few pages to recommendations such as rotating your pelvis from your \\"pivot point;\\" i.e., the T12-L1 vertebral level of the spine. The T12-L1 vertebral level is not a Tai Chi concept. And try looking anywhere to find support from a doctor, physical therapist, professor of anatomy, or anyone other than Mr. Dreyer that the pelvis rotates from one particular part of the spine or that T12-L1 plays a unique and \\"pivotal\\" role in the spine, let alone pelvic rotation. Dreyer, a carpenter, doesn't provide any references for his claim. And even if such a pivot point existed, his recommendation would be useless. When spine surgeons perform surgery, they use X-rays to count the spinal vertebrae to make sure they are operating at the correct level. If a spine surgeon needs an X-ray to be confident of being at a particular spinal level even though the surgeon can look at an anesthetized patient's naked back and feel the vertebrae, what chance does an ordinary runner have of concentrating on one out of 17 thoracic and lumbar vertebral levels that the runner can't see or feel? If you are mistakenly concentrating on rotating your pelvis from one level above or below T12-L1, is that going to set you back because your mental gaze has missed the \\"pivot\\" point? Dreyer has another exercise in which you place fingers near your collarbone and on your lower back to \\"lengthen\\" your spine. If a spine could be lengthened so simply, there would be millions of kids aspiring to life in the NBA walking around with their fingers on their collarbones and lower backs trying to lengthen their spines. What Dreyer recommends is just a gimmick for adjusting a person's posture, and it has no practical value for running. If you doubt that, try running the same distance with and without \\"lengthening\\" your spine before you set out (not even Dreyer recommends the lengthening procedure while running) and compare your times and exertion levels. I mention these examples because they expose Dreyer's utter lack of expertise or even basic understanding regarding the anatomy and mechanics of the human body (he talks at one point about the medial meniscus tendon; he probably means the medial collateral ligament, because there is no medial meniscus tendon, but with Dreyer you never know). In 2002 Terry Laughlin, a swimming coach, published a fine book on swimming that includes several yoga concepts (Laughlin had been conducting clinics for years prior to that). Dreyer admits that he tried, in part, to pattern ChiRunning after Laughlin's approach. That included starting ChiRunning clinics and copying various words and phrases Laughlin uses in his book, such as \\"effortless\\" and using different \\"gears.\\" Is it possible that Dreyer read Romanov's highly technical, detailed Pose Running, read Laughlin's practical swimming book that includes yoga references, and decided that he could market Romanov's technique by sprinkling in some Tai Chi (if you want to learn Tai Chi, you will need to look elsewhere than ChiRunning) and claiming it as Dreyer's own revolutionary and ground breaking method? If so, it appears to have been a highly profitable marketing ploy and expropriation of another person's work. But buyer beware. And beware the many five star reviews. There are marketing companies that will write positive reviews for products. There are also a lot of \\"certified\\" ChiRunning instructors and this is, after all, big business, not a revolutionary new way of running."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Still sore from the Hood to Coast, I watched my ChiRunning video last night, skimmed the book, and decided to put the basics into action during my morning run. Wow! ChiRunning seems nothing less than a total paradigm shift - transforming running from a \\"lower body activity\\" to an \\"upper body sport.\\" A couple of analogies, to make sense of it: a tennis serve doesn't get its pace from the arm muscles, nor does a swimmer's power come from the arms.I switched back and forth on my run - between the old way, tensing my quads with each push off, and the new way, relaxing my legs, lifting my heels, trying to feel my core, and leaning. It is -such- a difference. For my first ChiRun, my time for five miles was on the slow end of normal, my HR was in the normal range, but the difference to my legs was off the charts. I can't say it too strongly: ChiRunning really is worth checking out. (Caveat: some of Danny's philosophies and ideas not directly related to the running mechanics ... I question.

I'm also a casual runner (a few runs of 3-5 miles each per week), and I have some minor issues with my back and hips. I've found the book very helpful in keeping my hips, pelvis, and back more steady and stable when I run. I was usually at the chiropractor every few months or so when something would slip a little out of whack, but after just a cursory read of this book and applying a few of the principles, I didn't go back to the doctor for several months. (Of course, consult with your own doctor.) I was also experiencing some burn-out, but this book has given me new focus, and now I'm considering trying a half-marathon just to see if I could finish.I think most runners, serious or not, will find new ways to think about posture and form in this book. The author is an ultra-marathoner and claims to have been injury-free for several years, so I had to see what that was about. I haven't been disappointed. Anyone participating in any sport should be thinking about correct form, and this book offers an excellent approach.

It made running a joyful workout instead of a fitness chore. I described some of the running techniques to my podiatrist and he was impressed enough with my results and the basic mechanics that he's now recommending this running technique to patients. Whenever I've noticed any pain returning, on refreshing my memory with Danny's techniques I've realized I was forgetting to do some things, and when returning to those practices my running has improved again. I simply cannot argue with these results.You don't have to be a New Age believer for these techniques to work. Set aside the occasionally pseudo-scientific basis for some of his statements and don't worry about it. These instructions are less descriptive of what you are -actually- doing than what it -feels like- you are doing, i.e. what you imagine you are doing. So much of running is about your mental state since after all, it's your brain that tells the rest of your body what to do! Remember that Danny's really coaching your mind. Apply the Eastern philosophy concepts as a mental construct, an alternative model if you will. It's far more important to learn to run pain free and injury free.Finally, don't let all the focuses overwhelm you. Just pick one or two at a time to work on at any given run."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"As the years go by I've found it harder and harder for me to motivate myself to run. Dreyer's book openned my eyes and helped me improve my body mechanics in running so that I'm now able to run more efficiently with less trauma to the knees and back than before. Also, running is less stressful to me now (both emotionally and physically. In fact, running is more enjoyable!I'm in the military, and I have to run twice a year for the APFT (Physical Fitness Test). One of the events is the 2-mile run, and by using Dreyer's techniques just this past couple of weeks, I was not only able to meet Army Fitness standards easily, but I was able to shave more than a minute from my previous finishing time! Furthermore, I was less discombobulated after the run than I usually am after the timed 2-mile run, and more importantly, I was less achey and sore afterwards.I've seen a lot of soldiers' knees get burned out from the 2-mile event, and I would highly recommend Dreyer's strategies to them. Also, I would highly recommend it to those who are struggling to meet the US Army 2-mile standards but just can't quite make it (I sympathize a lot with them).Now, if only Dreyer would write a book about Chi Push-ups and Chi Sit-ups . . . . ."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I am forty years old and ran my first half marathon in February of this year. After the race my body basically broke down. I had intense shin splints, knee pain, joint pain, etc. I could no longer even run a mile and a half without having to stop. I have been completely frustrated because running is one of my great joys and is something that I do to clear my head. A couple weeks ago my friend did an interview with Danny Dreyer and she was kind enough to let me borrow her copy of The Chi of Running and I read it right away. I was enthralled by the book and it gave me renewed hope and I have been incorporating the priniciples as much as possible. I must say it has been a bit of a struggle with the technique because I have always been a heavy foot plodder thus my injuries. But last week I went on a run and incorporated as much as I could and I ran eight miles and felt so strong at the end I couldn't believe it! I felt I could have easily ran a couple more miles. I still am experiencing pain wth my legs but I truly believe that if I follow the principles of the Chi of Running then one day I will be injury free!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I stumbled on this book by accident while researching Tai Chi books. I am so glad that I did! It's a well organized and fun to read book. It opened up a whole new realm of running to me. I ran for years and competed in small five and ten mile races and my longest event was a half marathon. I hurt my knee chasing my dog and was then reduced to walking and thought I wouldn't be able to run again. I missed running horribly, the world doesn't go by fast enough when you walk, if you are used to running. But the chi running book teaches a technique which utilizes different muscles, a different stance which is easier on the body and does not consist of pounding. The author has carefully enumerated an excellent technique to alleviate and prevent injury. Not only does it make sense to me as a long time runner, but it feels right when I do it and it's fun! The other day I was able to run 2.7 miles, it felt great and the next day I had no soreness, no knee pain, nothing but exhiliration and anticipation of my next wonderful run. I am slowly working back up to five mile runs. I would recommend this book to experienced runners who want to improve their techniques and spare their bodies injury, and I would recommend it to new runners who could start out with good form and minimize their lifetime chance of running injuries. I would also highly recommend it to injured runners like me and older runners (also like me.) You wouldn't think there could be anything new in running, I was pleasantly surprised, delighted even!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I learned about chi running about a year ago and feel it has really helped my running, from the point that a 10k was my max (and a somewhat stressful one at that) to where I can easily do a half marathon and am now aiming for full marathons. The basic idea really is that you avoid a striding form and relax most of your body except your core so that you move forward largely by leaning into your run and coming down on your mid-foot while falling forward. This description doesn't do the technique justice, but this type of running really is designed to be both efficient and low-impact. It works well for my 50-year old body (I used it to complete the Boston Marathon as a \\"non-qualified\\" runner raising funds for a Boston charity) and allows me to get through races feeling tired but not overlyl stressed or pained. I know some fast (2:30 marathoners) who say chi running has allowed them to maintain a fast pace without feeling beat up for days afterward.The first edition of this book laid out chi running in a pretty straightforward way, while the second edition adds about 50-60 pages. A good part of the earlier edition has been repeated, but the second edition has, I feel, really expanded on the first edition by offering more information and advice on the \\"how to\\" of chi running. There is a nice new central section appropriately called \\"How to Learn Chi Running\\" that takes you through a set of step-by-step lessons that are easy to follow and making it very clear what the components of techniques are and more important to integrate them. Reading this edition along side the first edition, I found that this one is easier to follow and leaves less uncertainty in how to run.The tone of the book remains informal and conversational, and it generally provides a complete guide to topics related to running, including training, injury prevention (a real plus of chi running is that it easier on the body than traditional running form), and nutrition.Chi running may not be for everyone but I feel it is worth checking out - I suspect even if you don't adopt the whole technique, parts of it may help your running. For example, the book suggests shin splits are caused by running with the feet splayed outward. As my introduction to chi running, I tried running with my feet parallel as suggested in the book and ran a 10K without trouble when previously even running a mile left my shins sore.I highly recommend this book and feel this edition adds to what was presented in the first edition.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book was loaned to me initially by a friend when I decided to try running again. I was about to start the c25k (couch to 5k) running program. ChiRunning techniques were a tremendous help and combined with the c25k running program, I completed my 5k training right on schedule. I've always had difficulty in pushing myself past the discomfort of running and ChiRunning helps teach focus points, relaxation, and so much more. I'm not into running for the speed or a competition race. My desire, at age 61, is just to be able to run the distance. I'm running my first 5k this weekend and I attribute ChiRunning a great deal for my success in getting this far. I was only 1/3 of the way through the borrowed book when I decided I HAD to buy my own so I could highlight and keep going back to the references!! If you're into running for the enjoyment and want to run injury free, I highly recommend the book. In past years when I tried to run, I'd always end up with shin splints and quit. No shin splints with ChiRunning!! Additionally, I ordered the book on Amazon and saved $5 from the book store price.. an my \\"used\\" copy... I couldn't even tell it had been used. It was in excellent condition. Quite a buy! It's a reference book I'll keep on my shelf and refer back to often."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I love the premise of ther book and have found it very helpful to me. I am still in the early stages but I have already noticed a big difference in my running. I find myself discussing the book quite often and I thnk it makes a great gift."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Good, common sense tips here regarding proper, low-impact running technique. The book advises the runner on mental focus and steers readers toward proper posture, foot placement and positioning. The basis of the book is similar to Romanov's Pose Method, also useful for reducing wear and tear.Pain in my hamstrings, knees and calves seems to be reduced using the tips found in Chi Running. Nothing earth-shattering, but worth the price for the frequent runner."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This is a great book that may change your running for ever for the better. Very well written and easy to understand. If you read about POSE running which has more scientific explanation about the correct form of running, essentially says the same as this book does. Forget about heel strike and lift off with your toes. Learn how to run with mid-foot strike under your body (not in front) and lean forward (which will work as your gas pedal as you are taking advantage of the gravity) without bending at your waist. It is like controlled fall. You will find you are spending less energy and your risk of injury is less as well."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"ChiRunning helped me look at my running in a whole new way. It has improved my technique, but probably more importantly it has stimulated my motivation, improved my entire running program, given me tools and techniques to use in other areas of my life. Thank you, Danny Dreyer, for an informative, entertaining book on ChiRunning and ChiLiving!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Run with gravity not against it. What a novel running concept that I found really works. After running countless painful marathons and 5k/10k's, I read \\"Chi Running.\\" I revamped my style as the author indicated. Then after a few practice runs I kinda felt a small feeling of chi... Then after a couple weeks, a slightly bigger dose of that chi feeling. All kidding aside, it was only after a month and a half of running and practicing with gradual increases in distance that I felt much more comfortable that I was on the right track. I know that that may seem like a long time for some of you, but, the increase in energy and more importantly the very noticeable decrease in effort was very dramatic for me. After a 5 mile run, I felt like it had been only 2. After 8 miles it felt like only 4-5. The most important thing was I had absolutely no aches or pains in my knees, back or legs. The pains were something that I had thought came with the territory.It's been over a year now and still perfecting the technique, but, I absolutely love this concept. The book is easy to read and combines a lot of philosophy within the book. The actual Chi technique can be highlighted in a couple of chapters, so it is not extremely complicated. But, putting it all together in a smooth fashion does take work, focus, and practice. Did I say patience as well. Once you have the technique down, you will truely love and appreciate the Chi running concept. (Someone I tried to teach once told me it did feel a lot like learning how to golf... Lot's of detailed instructions on what to do with different body parts. I learned later, not to teach much in the first lesson.. just like when you go out to practice. Focus on only a couple things at a time, adding something else piece by piece as you can absorb it.After several months of training with the Chi method, I dropped 15 minutes off my half marathon time, and almost 30 minutes off my marathon time. I did these times with much less training, but, more focus on the Chi technique and making it 'my own.' That pretty much says it all. So hope you all get that Chi feeling!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I am an asthmatic who has always wanted to run, but I never thought I would be able to run for over a few minutes. I read this book in it's first edition as a library book and it became such an integral part of my excercise program that I renewed it and then came back to the library the day after I finally had to return it so I could check it out again. I decided to buy it without delay. I love the new edition with the different organization and information. I am a beginning runner and started running with this program when I was 40 lbs overweight. Now, about two months later, I have lost 20 pounds and had no injuries. When I started I could barely run for 2 minutes. Now I can run for 20 minutes without to much fatigue. I have also gone off one of my asthma medications, and am hopeful that I will no longer need any medication as my distances and times increase. I am less stressed and more energized than I have ever ben in my life. The form taught in this book is mostly responsible for my success. I also have a history of back pain, and I had none because of the \\"leveled pelvis\\" and low impact taught in this book. Very easy to read, common-sense techniques that apply to the rest of your life as well. I am a Senior Vocal Performance Major in college, and the principals have also helped me greatly with my singing.

I'm not into the Tai' Chi philosophical part of the book, but I think there is some solid basis for many of the techniques described. I've been working on the technique for a week now, and it does seem to be of benefit. I haven't seen any huge leaps yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if I do as I get it down better.

My friends who ran 58 second 400s ran 5 minute miles. Why did I fall off a cliff in longer races? My running form was pure power running and my distance form sucked - total heel striker. I guarantee that if you are a heel striker, you will benefit from this book.Sure, the book is a bit foofy. Oh well. Also, the \\"junk scientist\\" (ma_brooks) who argues that there is no \\"power\\" generated by gravity misapprehends the physics of the form. The force of gravity on a body can be reduced to a point force at the center of gravity. The body is supported by the feet. If the feet are behind the center of gravity, a torque is created at the feet which causes the body to fall forward -- moving the feet translates this torque to horizontal movement and no need to use calf muscles to push you forward. You're not getting \\"free energy\\". The WORK (i.e., power over a time) of the running is done -- not by gravity in pulling you forward -- but by your core, and to some extent, your larger leg muscles. Force is not power is not work..."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I have now read both Danny Dreyer's Chi Running and Nicholas Romanov's POSE Method of Running several times and if you're thinking of picking one or the other I'd say you can learn a lot by reading bothPOSE is a little more mechanical, in its approach... chi a little more, well, Zen but the core messages are very similar and there are enough differences in approach to make them both worthwhile"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I guess I'm in the minority because I've had very mixed results. I took a chi running clinic in December and PR'd in a half marathon about five week later, by 18 minutes. I felt like I was having a running renaissance at age 44, but that only lasted another few weeks. Since then, I've been plagued by injuries. At this point, calf injuries have kept me from running for about 2.5 months, which makes no sense as the chi running books (and I have both of them) claim that you don't use your calf muscles with the method. That didn't make much sense to me when I read it, and it certainly doesn't now. So I guess my advice is not to expect a miracle cure and recognize that some of the advice and statements in these books make little sense from a medical standpoint--perhaps because the authors have no medical training. That said, I've been to plenty of sports docs and physical therapists over the years, and they weren't very helpful, either."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book is definately the best book for reference when learning how to run correctly.Its principles add mileage to your daily run.

As an endurance runner, you need to fuel yourself properly before, during, and after any run. I found Danny Dreyer's advice to be quite lacking and impractical.

Recently I made another attempt to run off-road and again the pains came back. I did some research about barefoot running and came across this book not that it is about barefoot running, but it uses the running style necessary for barefoot running. After reading this book and applying the Chi technique to my running using minimalist shoes on trails, my pains went away and have not reoccurred. After only a month, I just did 13 miles yesterday and feel great today. Finally thanks to Danny Dreyer and this book I'm able to enjoy running again.

I've since run 4 miles and several 3+ training runs with no pain or problems of any kind.It's all because of chi running technique. It just makes total sense, especially since children run this way naturally. It's so much easier on my whole body than landing on my heels like I did in the past. I've always been a &#34;form junkie&#34; in other sports such as cross-country skiing and sea kayaking. It seems to be a universal truth that when you come as close as you can to perfect form in any sport, it's not only easier on your body, it's easier period! And, speed increases as a side effect.Saving my joints and other body parts at this age is critical to me so I can stay active. I applaud the authors of this book in giving me and countless others (including people who thought they could no longer run) the gift of running in a safe, pain-free way.

I just figured I am slow to improve. Maybe running is not my thing. I was intrigued about the barefoot running concept so I picked up this book. After reading just a few chapters of ChiRunning, I went out for an easy run and tried out some of the strategies. First - I ran over 3 miles without an issue (this distance is tough for me) second - a whole minute per mile was shaved off my usual pace. Just like that. BOOM. An improvement that was once only attainable after months of dedicated training (suffering) was achieved instantly. I attribute it mostly to the advice on proper running form, however I like the way it is explained and the emphasis on mindfulness. I am into yoga/meditation and all that so I can connect well to this method."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"To give you some background I'm 32 years old and last year started running for the first time since I was in high school. Progressed quickly from just doing one mile and then doing three miles. The more I ran the faster I wanted my times to be. I quickly ran into IT Band pain in one of my knees and after a couple weeks went to a sports doctor who diagnosed me with poor stretchability, specifically in the hammies. He recommended physical therapy to learn better stretching routines/techniques.Well the stretching did help as well as running at a slower pace however I noticed towards the end of fall that I still ran into IT Band pain when pushing myself past six miles.Started back up running in March and in early April joined a running club. This time I started stretching properly and with everything I learned from the physical therapy right from the get go. Was running at very conservative pace not even coming close to what I did the previous year. However once I got up to eight mile runs I again started having IT Band pain. It got to the point where half of my run I was in pain but just went through it. Then the next couple days I could barely walk around the house.Somehow I got it in my head that maybe there is a more efficient way to run and that is when I came across this book. Week after week I noticed that I would have less and less pain and was pushing myself over ten miles on my long runs. I still wasn't doing the ChiRunning perfectly though and even had a little Achilles tendon flare up. I went back to the book and reread as much as possible and watched some of the videos and then finally had a break through where it all just came into place. Running felt more smooth, more productive, and more natural. The chapter on what do do with specific pain really helped as well telling me what I'm doing wrong to have IT Band pain or the Achilles tendon pain.I highly recommend this book to anyone having pain while running because it isn't a normal part of running. Running should be pain free and enjoyable. This past Saturday I ran fourteen miles (personal best) with ZERO IT Band Pain or Achilles pain. The recovery for this run was the least I've needed. Typically for a couple days after running the knee would be so tight it would hurt to bend. Not anymore. I can actually walk around after my runs without hobbling for a couple days. The best part is throughout the entire process of learning ChiRunning I never had to stray from my training program by taking a day off or doing less mileage, which I was really worried would happen right before I found this book. It had immediate effects."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"For Kate, who posted a little over a month ago, yes, the running technique in this book will eliminate your shin splints.

I MUST be doing something wrong!So, I Read the ChiRunning book, and my running life completely changed.I started from scratch, and followed the book to a \\"T\\".

There are lots of reviews throwing down a 5-star vote and making little comment on the book itself, so don't let the star power sway you too much.One of the hurdles I experienced with the book was Dreyer's charlatanesque pitchmanship. I would prefer if he put out his ideas and let us judge them. Instead, you will be bombarded with testimonials and self-praise from the author.Some of his \\"science\\" is just painful. Maybe he's trying to be funny when he says, \\"People admit that they intentionally taught themselves to breathe slowly so no one would know how out of shape they were they were; meanwhile they were killing zillions of brain cells to look good.\\" - Really, braindeath from altering your breathing rythm?There's a well-informed reviewer who cites Dreyer's confusion or at least lack of specificity when he talks about hip-flexors powering running. The kinetics of running are more complicated than that. Regardless of body lean and balance point, you're going to have to activate other muscles to keep your leg from collapsing.So the science isn't spot-on. Regrettably the discussion of Chi isn't terribly solid either, as other reviewers have noted.These complaints unfortunately overshadow what I think is some good theory on being mindful of your body and evaluating your running form. Mr. Dreyer has apparently experienced some success as a runner and his techniques appear to have helped quite a few people. I do resent that he tries to lump everything that isn't \\"Chi Running\\" as \\"Power Running\\".Ultimately, I feel that Dreyer's book is a preachy rehash of ideas that can be found better explained elsewhere. It feels like the eastern medicine is thrown in to sensationalize things a bit. I'm glad to have read it, but won't be keeping it in my running library."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Background: I used to get injured all the time, until I read Danny Dryer's book.

It teaches the form, the centering, and the posture needed to implement chi running. Everything else is metaphysical bullcrap. I am not sure if any of his methods are related to Chi of any kind, but implementing the forms REALLY helps."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book is the book I keep reading and re-reading and it has changed my running life and my life for the better.I am a 38 year old mom. As a devoted runner for almost 12 years, (averaging 30-40 miles/week) I was wondering if there really were any new dimensions to read about in running. (Of course many \\"power running\\" articles will promise you \\"results\\" if you follow their one-page recipe.). Well, this book has helped me add a new dimension to my running and my life and I am forever grateful. I keep this book by my bed-side and re-read it at night before falling off to sleep.My only wish is that Danny Dreyer would write another book on applying the chirunning principles to daily living (though he encourages us to that in his book). I have been working on this little-by-little, but would love to learn more!Since reading Chirunnning, and working on integrating the focuses into my running and my life, not only has my running improved, I am enjoying it even more than I did before. Running has always held deep meaning and importance for my life, but this book has impacted me far more positive ways than I could have ever imagined. It is transformative. This book is for people who hold running dear...or would...., who know that there is no \\"magic pill\\" or cookie-cutter workout to make them faster (or whatever). If you are looking for the \\"quick fix', you won't find it here, with good reason. Look deeply at those reasons, and the principles of chi-running.... you may find a joy you weren't quite expecting.If you want to take your running and your life to a higher level, read and study this book. Thank you Danny and Katherine Dreyer for publishing this book. It is a gem!!! Best wishes for continued success. I am going to read chi-walking next! (and please consider a book on chirunning principles for daily living.....)"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"If you run or want to run. If you worry about getting an injury or if you already have an injury but dont want to make it worse. This this book will more than likely be beneficial to you. It teaches you that running, if done correctly, maintaining the correct form and posture, will never cause an injury to your body. After reading the book I agree. I walk to work everday for around an hour, I used to suffer from shin splints, and acheing knees, but I thought this was normal, after reading this book and following its points, I can walk for much longer, I get less tired, I am less out of breath, I dont get shin splints and my knees no longer give me any trouble. Basically, my legs can take me much further with less effort. I have also taken up jogging/running and am very confident with the knowledge from this book. I know that as long as I stick to its points, I can continue running and walking for years with out any worry of an injury."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I bought this book because my wife does tai chi, and I'm a runner. For three years I've run 20 miles a week, with lots of knee pain, so that I always had to ice my knees after a run, and wore braces on each knee. I did all of the leg lifts and workouts to increase my strength. This helped, but not much. Then I read Chi Running, and now I have no more knee pain. I read the book in one sitting, and have reread several passages many times. I've changed my form, and presto, no more knee pain. I feel like a kid again.Getting confortable with the book's method of &quot;leaning&quot; while running takes some time. I still feel a little akward, now 10 days into this method. But believe me, this book has changed my running life. The text is clearly written, and the photographs are helpful."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Superb! Saved my marathon. 5 weeks into my training my legs were jello and was not sure I could complete the marathon.

I was smiling all the way to the top!Read this one now! And save your knees!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Dreyer has a compelling theory on running (and how to run) that upends our conventional thinking about what it means and what we have to suffer when we do run.He juxtaposes what he calls \\"power running\\" -- understandable, since we, as adults do rely on strength to pull our bodies through each running step -- to a natural, gravity-propelled, and indeed child-like style, based on tai-chi precepts of balance and body dynamics.Dreyer's book is a real shot of fresh air inshowing us how to minimize effort (and therefore injury) and maximize efficiency, speed and distance.Dreyer writes with an open, light style that's fun to read. But he's dead serious about running naturally and he's articulately encapsulated his theories in tangible ways.Dreyer's book shows us that no pain can result in measurable gain in running."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I am not through the book yet, but so far great changes ahead for me! the background in the beginning is dry to read, but worth the extra time."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book and running technique was recommended to me by someone during a casual conversation after I explained how I found running outdoors so much harder than running on a treadmill. He correctly diagnosed my problem as \\"power running\\" and told me about Chi running, and described one of the principles.So I checked out some Youtube videos and bought this book, used, $.99 plus $3.99 shipping.It works! I thought I knew how to run, but I was doing several things wrong. Using these principles or techniques of motion: body position, lean, striding behind you/not in front of you, landing on middle of foot, having your foot strike directly below your center of gravity instead of reaching your leg forward, faster cadence, really made a difference.I can go faster and farther now. My joints take less of a pounding (big factor since I'm middle aged) so I now have no joint pain towrds the end of a long run. Using Chi Running, I did my first half marathon without getting wiped out! My two previous half-marathons were killers.I no longer pronate/heel-strike.I actually bought an electronic metronome, like the author recommends, and use it with ear-buds to control my cadence, and it works too. The faster cadence, along with a shorter stride is mechanically more efficient, less tiring, and allows me to go longer before muscle fatigue sets in.By changing my foot-strike, I am working different foot muscles, so I have been using a small rubber ball, in between a golf ball and tennis ball in size, to massage the soles of my feet by rolling it between my foot and the floor.I'm so grateful to the author I think I'll either buy a new book or just send him a gift since authors don't make money off the sales of used books."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Very well written.

When I was younger I never had to worry about injuries. With age they became more frequent, which led to my interest in this book. While it is too early to tell whether applying the concepts will totally eliminate injuries, I can say that the concepts are sound. I can also say that now when I finish a run my legs feel fresh; while in the past they felt strained. With each day that I learn to more fully incorporate the principles of Chi running into my form I feel better and better both during and after the run.I nice ripple effect is that one can apply the principles of Chi running into other aspects of one's life: for example, the posture which the book describes should be practiced at all times: not just when running.This book is a must for anyone who likes to run or even walk."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Heard about this book from my running store and was skeptical about the benefits of running midfoot vs heel striking..wow......no more knee joint pain. and I truly look forward to running every day...."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"If you only read one book about running, let this be it.

The book is highly repetitive (the same amount of material might easily have been covered in 40 pages), it lacks organization, the author invents words which have no meaning (\\"instate\\" as a verb, anyone?), and the typeset is HORRIBLE.The author has some good ideas.

I stayed at their home in California while on a trip from where I live in Stamford, Connecticut, while they traveled. I am a long time runner and I still say I've never read a better book about running, but now it's the third review I've written and that too probably won't look good. However I feel obligated to straighten out the mess I created. I wrote the review from Katherine's computer...so it's showing up as her...a terrible mistake on my part. I've never done this before. I tried to cancel it, thought I had and wrote my second review minutes later from my own email thinking the first one was deleted.I mostly apologize to Katherine and Danny but also to everyone who thinks they've done something underhanded. I wrote because I think people should know about this book and this technique. Lousy with computers, I am an OK athlete and I was able to quickly pick up on Danny's suggestion and now I have less pain. Again, my apologies for making a mess of this.Seems I've created a problem that was not my intention."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"\\"ChiRunning\\" is not a new idea.

Buy this book."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"The author claims he runs 30 miles, effortlessly. I suppose that gives him some credentials. But I do not think he truly understands how muscles work, or physics, for that matter. The parts of the book that did make sense were repeated so many times, I was bored with it. Relax, good posture, core strength all sounded like common sense to me. I don't buy the idea of your core creating a coil for your tendons and ligaments to do the work. Muscles do the work and SHOULD! But I kept an open mind. What do I know? I'm just a certified personal trainer. He studied with a tai chi master: wow!The one suggestion that helped me was imagining the bungey cords pulling me forward.Still trying to keep an open mind, I tried his suggestion to relax the glutes and run hills sideways. As a result, I developed inflammation in both of my TFL's. Several weeks, massages,icing, and accupuntures later, I finally picked up my marathon training again. I lost precious time and came in 45 minutes slower than before. I guess I should have followed his \\"brilliant\\" suggestion, and not focus on my time. I agree that you should run at a manageable pace, but without focusing on time and distances, I lost a lot of speed and satisfaction. Back to tried and true and power running for me! I WILL train SAFELY for schedules and times. There are plenty of other books that teach how to train safely and effectively. And those books have the actual physics and science to back up their tips."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I enjoy reading on my Kindle, I would rather have all of my reading content on it. I like seeing new titles come out on it, so I was very pleased to see this book that I looked at availble.

They have no print set up or fees, no storage fees, no shipping fees and yet they are going to raise the price up for the same digital copy that they sent to the press? Did they somehow grab the music industry's winning PR notebook?While I want this book I am not supporting the publishing company's short-sighted and greedy take on what they think a digital copy should cost.

My first impression when she said the book described an approach to running grounded in Tai chi might be that it it would be some sort of philosophical approach to running rather than anything practical.I was wrong!The book (and the very good video) really lays out an easy-to-learn (though perhaps difficult to perfect) approach to running that basically reduces the energy and body stresses that the usual approach to running has. It is a beautifully simple concept where you basically lean into a run while coming down on one foot, letting gravity move you forward, while you with little effort then move the other foot from behind you in sequence. I read the book and practiced with someone who knew the technique and when things came together, it really clicked and running seemed a whole lot easier in terms of effort.My interest in chi running came in part because I have been bothered by shin splints on and off, in part because I am not that regular runner. I started with this book about a month ago, have done a couple of short runs (2-3 miles) and today ran my first half marathon. The amazing thing (for me) is that my time was good (little more than my 10 mile pace) and I had NO feeling of pain in the shins during or after the race (or blisters for that matter). This is when month ago, even a short run could lead to thobbing shins.I am definitely a huge fan of the chi approach and am going to keep working on it. It may seem complex, but just getting the basics down will go a ways to making your running easier on the body (and maybe speed it up to - my pace on some stretches of today's race included some of my best one-mile times)."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"One reviewer wrote, \\"There is a lot of 'fluff' in this book to make it as long as it is,\\" I totally agree, the book could be half as long, and still provide the great information on how to run pain free.I've had knee pain for the past five years playing volleyball and running to stay in shape.

It was easy to read and my running has been more enjoyable ever since. Running is presented as a meditation with many aspects of technique to focus the attention on. I was happy to find that the author's technique did not differ much from the technique I had already developed. I haven't read any other running books or had any formal running instruction, so I don't know if he advocates any controversial elements.

Katherine Dreyer is the authors wife and co-author.The two reviews from Stamford are phrased very similarly. The other CT reviewer mentioned the DVD which was released the same day as the review was written, so he/she had to get it from the author, watch it and practice it all in the same day. This does not all seem very &quot;chi&quot; to me.Good points:Very pleasant writing style, no-ego, peaceful approach to running and life. Good tips and exercises for technique.Points to improve:Contradictory information. The title says &quot;effortless... running&quot;, but then on page 55 he says, &quot;It doesn't mean there's NO effort, just no unnecessary effort&quot;. On page 16 he emphasizes using the psoas muscles (front of hip at the waist) to left up the feet, which actually lift up the thigh, but then later says to not pick up your knees (psoas work), and pick up the feet ( hamstring work). How do you not pick up the knees when ruuning? It's necessary to swing the lower leg through to the front. He borrows Lydiard's &quot;rope pulling you at the pelvis/sternum from a distance away&quot; without giving Lydiard credit. Some physiology would help instead of saying that metabolic wastes will fill your legs with cement. Cement? Is that what that is?

The approach is different: here Danny, the author, start from Tai Chi to get to a new running concept.Well done, interesting even for a convinced Cartesian as myself, always critical towards Oriental disciplines (notwithstanding my long residential experience in Far East).Other than paper edition, I would suggest DVD: ChiRunning videos you can recover from the network are not exaustive (not at all).Probably a stage with a Certified ChiRunning Instructor would be the best completion, but unfortunately courses seem to be available in US only."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book has been a life changer for me.

I read Chi Running over the next week while I was recuperating. 8 days after my layoff I ran 2 miles working on the focal points taught in the book. 12 days out I was up to 8 miles. On day 13 6.5 miles pain free (following an 8 mile day).31 days after I thought I was too old for a comeback I ran 22 miles. At mile 20 I thought to myself this is too good to be true.

I now run 4x a week, an hour or two each time. This is something I'd never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and I'd have to train on an elliptical afterwards. The knees are fine now.

I remember reading an article several years ago in Runners World magazine on Chirunning and it gave me the impression of being \\"Cultish\\" and I just didn't buy it. Having finished 2 marathons(walking or crawling due to injury) and with my latest injury, I read in Dean Karnazes latest book how he will often lean forward(or backwards) to use different muscles. I remembered Chirunning and how it says it will reduce injuries. being a skeptic and desperate, I tried the Chi. Perhaps because I already had a short stride and schuffle, I found instant results and found it natural. My quads which were recently hurting on long runs, were gone. I was feeling better after the runs than previously. Less recovery time. And the icing on the cake, all my different training runs were new PR's, without seemingly anymore effort. I took 7 minutes off my best 1/2 after only starting Chi for 2 1/2 weeks. Although my plantar fasciitis is sticking around(it does feel better) my body has never felt better, which is the most important thing. The speed is a nice bonus! Regarding the book, like many have said, it could be condensed, but I love the author's passion and highly recommend the book or at least give it a try. I went from being a very frustrated runner to a happy runner:)"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I have been a barefoot runner since 2005, at which time I re-learned how to correctly run using my awareness and the teachings of numerous sources. I have read Danny Dryer's ChiRunning book and watched his ChiRunning DVD. I have also studied The Pose Running Technique on DVD and the workbook. In addition, I have experience practicing Qi Gong (Chi Kung), meditation, and yoga. I have also studied anatomy, posture, The Alexander Technique, and Rolfing Structural Integration. My partner is also a Chinese Medicine professional and Acupuncturist. So basically, I know a thing or two in this field...In light of the acclaim that Danny Dryer is receiving for his ChiRunning technique, there are some critical errors and marketing misperceptions that I feel should be addressed. I base these insights on my own personal experience and my extensive research into natural running techniques and chi energy.1. This book does not at all use the chi (qi) energy for running. Dryer teaches a method of using gravity to encourage the body to move through space. After reading and watching Dryer's published material, it is clear to me that he uses the term \\"chi\\" as a marketing strategy. All things eastern - yoga, tai chi, etc - are hot selling points these days. Yes, Dryer states that he has practiced Qi Gong under a teacher. However, nowhere in the DVD or book does he teach about the movement of chi the body, its pathways or its functions. Dryer should have title his technique \\"Gravity Running\\" instead.2. Dryer combines a commonly misunderstood Pilates technique (tightening the core), claming it to be engaging the \\"hara\\" or \\"dan tien / tan tien\\". While the dan tien is the chi energy center below the navel, never are core muscles used when working with this center. Tightening any muscles will take a person's awareness away from the energy and into the muscular contraction sensation. Contracting muscles may create heat which is often believed to be chi by many beginners, however heat and chi are very different.In the original Pilates technique, as taught by Joseph Pilates, only the largest, deepest muscles of the core are \\"engaged\\" not tightened. This is more akin to placing the awareness in the core while using only the softest tension. Most people misunderstand Pilates and tighten the abdominal muscles which then causes improper posture. Watching the ChiRunning DVD and observing Danny Dryer's posture, it is clear that his posture is far from ideal. Improper core tension and running technique could possibly be the cause of this, however other causes could also exist.3. Dryer teaches to tighten the core muscle to tilt the pelvis. This lengthens the lower back, thus straightening the spine and removing the natural curve. By straightening the natural curve, the natural spring in the spine is removed leading to possible spine injury. Watching the DVD clearly shows the postural flaw caused by this unnatural movement. I am very suprised to see the noticably poor posture that Dryer and his students showed in this instructional video.Also, by tightening the core muscles, excess tension is created in the body that will interfere with the body's natural movement. By creating tension in the core, the entire body is adversely affected because the core is the body's center of gravity and the psoas muscles in the deep core extend into the legs and upper back and ribs. Tension in the core will also restrict the rig cage's ability to expand sufficiently to allow proper oxygen in the lungs.4. Landing on the middle of the foot works against the anatomy of the foot. The arch of the foot acts like a rubber band that allows the foot to spring forward when running on the ball and toes. Running with the middle of the foot first causes the ball and head to hit at the same time, causes jarring sensations in the foot, ankle, and leg.As seen in the photos in the book and in the DVD video, Dryer wears modern full cushion running shoes that elevate the heal. Ask any expert in anatomy and/or Olympic-level running will teach, these shoes are injuries waiting to happen. A person can only get an accurate anatomical running experience by learning to run barefoot. Barefoot running quickly shows us how to correctly run. We can then return to running in shoes in a safer, more natural and more energy efficient way.5. Danny Dryer encourages the runner to tilt the body forward, taking the work off of the muscles and letting gravity act as a source of propulsion. Yes, this does work. However this style of running does not make effective use of the muscles and creates a very awkward experience that does not feel natural. Observe the running style of the world's greatest Olympic athletes and you will see all long distance runners stand erect while landing on the ball and toes of the feet.--If you have read this far into my review, you may be left looking for a solution. My best recommendation is to read the book Running Fast and Injury Free by Gordon Pirie. Pirie has held many world records and Olympic medals. He is one of few runners who, in my opinion, has perfected the art of running. His principles are based upon a lifetime of learning from top Olympic runners and beating nearly all of them or their records. Since age 14, Pirie ran with Olympic record holders. In addition, Dr. Nicholas Romanov's Pose Method of Running contains value insights into the physiology of running.Above all else, since most of us grew up in shoes, we must re-teach ourselves to walk and run as the body's design intends. We must learn to move barefoot. Even if we choose to run every race in shoes, learning to run while barefoot is a necessary part of the process. So find a soft stretch of dirt, sand, grass, sidewalk or road and get started. Skip 99.9% of the theory and get back to the reality of running. Use your mind to observe your body and make corrections as you go. And above all else - have fun!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"What an interesting running book!

He deserves the much wider following he will get with this (his CD is great too).My story: I've been a runner for 45 years. I nearly gave up running at age 57. The pain in my knees and lower back made me seriously think of quitting. I literally saw an ad in the newspaper for Danny's class and took it as a last resort. He was at the time in his 50's and a nationally ranked ultramarathoner. I figured he ought to know something about efficient running.I learned his initial techniques in two hours. It took about five or six runs to feel comfortable with the changes in my stride, but from the first day, there was no back pain and such minimal knee pain at the end that I couldn't believe it. I've taken his advanced techniques workshops too (all in the book). The \\"sidewise\\" stride up steep hills is another brilliant technique that literally makes running hills fun.I went from struggling to run for 30 minutes at a time to 1.5 hour runs on steep hills without pain. I'm not a ranked runner. I run for fitness, for weight control, and for the sheer joy of it. I did finish third in my age group in a local race a year ago -- first medal I've ever won (I'm 62 now). But I got my running life back, and that's priceless. I plan to be running into my 80's now -- pain free!And for what it's worth, I have a doctorate and I'm trained in physics. Danny's techniques are scientifically valid. There's a spiritual side to his methods too. If you don't think running has a spiritual side, I feel sorry for you, but don't ignore his methods just because of that.Jerry L Fletcher"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"A decent book with some interesting ideas, but little to do with anything \\"Chi,\\" which was a little disappointing.The underlying emphasis throughout this book is on competition, even though usually unstated. It's all about technique. He advocates using as little leg muscle as possible. Specifically, one does not push off using the toes or propel the body using the leg muscles like a sprinter might do. Instead, the only muscle action of the legs is to pick themselves up. He uses a good illustration: stand straight and fall forward. Instinctively, one of your legs will swing forward to catch you. I you use ONLY this muscle action, you'll have the basis of this book's technique.In addition, he advises you engage your core muscles and maintain an erect, proper posture. (That's good advice because it keeps your body from getting sloppy.) His advice for deep, rhythmic breathing and for relaxing the body overall are sound. The arms swing loosely and to the rear which opens up the chest for better breating.It is important to focus on what our body and our breath are doing as we run (and not be distracted by our normal day-to-day thoughts). This makes running almost like meditating, which in my opinion is a good thing.I'm trying this technique in my regular runs and so far it seems \\"interesting,\\" but no final verdict yet.Some advice sounds a little dubious. For example, he advises pronaters (whose feet strike the ground not parallel to their path) to force their feet parallel to avoid injury. I'm certainly no expert, but seems to me that forcing a natural pronation to an unnatural angle might itself lead to injury. In any case, I'd certainly want to see some clinical studies before adopting this advice.Now for a few disappointments.I've run mostly for pleasure for almost 40 years, and while the book's premise sounds appealing, there are some seeming contradictions. It opens with an image of children running in a schoolyard with a description about how we should all seek to run naturally, free, and unfettered, for the sheer joy of running, just like those kids. It them proceeds through 200+ pages to lay out dozens upon dozens upon dozens (seemingly) of detailed rules about how we should run, including how we should hold our thumbs. It advises we carry a metronome so the that we run exactly X paces per second. Well, I doubt those kids studied any such list or carry pacers. Something just does not add up here.Implicit in this book is that we let our body tell us the style in which we run as well as how far and fast, but there's almost no follow through on this theme. Instead he presents a detailed, one-size-fits-all running style that (at least in my opinion) is not necessarily what our bodies might tell us to do. There's no room for different body types or running styles.This style may indeed benefit some runners who have certain physical situations. If you are one of those then his techiques are certainly worth a try. Hope they help. But I'm not convinced this style is for everyone.There's supposed to be a deep connection with Ti Chi, but apart from a few oblique references to the Chi energy, there is precious little actual discussion of this topic.And there's this Chi energy itself. I personally don't believe in it (although I would not disparage those who do). In any case, it has really nothing to do with what's taught in the book.Although this is certainly not the author's fault, this is one of those cases where the advice might best be presented in \\"20 pages or less.\\" But 20-page books don't sell for enough money to make any profit. And so they are padded with redundandent and generally useless information. Again, not his problem, but this makes the book a bit tedious to read.In summary, the specific technique he advocates is worth a try. Much of the advice is fine: that we run for the sheer joy and fun of it, that we constantly listen to our bodies and let them guide us to a relaxed and stress-free running style, that we angage our core muscles and maintain a nice posture, that we breath deeply and rhythmically, and that we relax everything we can. But in the end this is mostly a running-style book -- not having much to do with anything mystical, like Chi."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book has a lot of good information it - probably too much. Unless you are really going to focus on something, it's very hard to remember more than two or three core ideas. I am a casual runner - maybe two or three runs per week of three to five miles - and I really hoped this book would give me a couple areas of focus that would make my running safer, more comfortable and perhaps faster. Instead, I got overload. There is a single 2-page spread in this book that lists about 50 points to focus on in your running. Come again? That doesn't sound very Zen to me (I know it's a different Eastern philosophy, but you get the idea).Dreyer ackowledges the length of the list and suggests picking out two or three of these ideas to focus on for each run, but you still need to be pretty serious to do that. I don't want to consult a checklist before each run and I want to plug into my iPod and relax a little while I'm running.In addition, Dreyer gives a pre- and post-run routine that would add about an hour to any run you wanted to do - again, more than I'm able to commit to this portion of my life.If you are a very serious runner or want to become one, this is a great book (assuming you can handle a few funky mystical references). On the other hand, if you are looking for two or three areas of focus to make you a better casual runner, they're tough to pull from this book.Recommended for serious runners who are looking to avoid or recover from injuries."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"this book starts out with a great premise -- that by learning to run more efficiently you can avoid injury and run longer and faster. I am sure danny dreyer is good at teaching people how to do so in his courses but this book didnt get me there.the main problems with this book are its poor organization and poor presentation of ideas. its organized more like a set of notes than a manual, and despite its short length, contains a lot of long winded passages that don't impart much information. really the book should have been broken into a series of lessons and exercises in chapter format, but halfway through the book he just dumps the entire technique on you. this technique consists mostly of pointers about the alignment of various parts of your body, which isnt that useful unless you plan on video taping yourself.he also presents a one-size-fits-all explanation that doesn't take into account the fact that different people have very different bodies. for instance, his technique presupposes that you have an anteriorly-tilted pelvis. if, like me and many other people, you have a posteriorly-tilted pelvis (you tuck your tail instead of sticking your butt out), some of the advice in this book is counterproductive."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Listened to this on audiobook, and I feel like the whole thing could have been done in an hour. He repeats the same phrases over and over, and makes unnecessary belabored examples, as if trying to make the book as cliche as possible...Body, mind, spirit, balance, chi, energy, core...it sounds as if its designed to be an infomercial.Maybe this book is intended for new runners, but as a runner for over 30 years, it annoyed me to no end. Others have commented on this hypermarketing too. His advertisements for chi walking and chi living underscore his goal to make a brand. He uses the phrase \\"Chi running\\" at least 30 times in the first audiobook section, a phrase which essentially didnt exist until he created it, with no explaination of what it actually is until later. Long term runners beware."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"In ChiRunning (and its other marketing permutations, including workshops) Dreyer advocates a running technique that is used by many world-class runners. It has to do with particular physical postures while running such as a forward lean. Dreyer didn't develop the technique nor was he the first to write about it. But to his credit, he did recognize that the technique works and adopted it in his own running. However, Dreyer was undoubtedly confronted with a challenge when he sat down to write his first book - how does a woodworker (his vocation for 15 years) who began running ultra-marathons as an adult sell books and workshops on running in a culture that wants to know what your credentials are? The answer is add a pinch of Eastern mysticism (Tai Chi) and voila, ChiRunning! Understand that the running technique that Dreyer advocates did not arise out of Tai Chi. Rather, Dreyer resorts to referring to a Tai Chi master he bumped into while running as someone who is supportive of the running technique Dreyer advocates. Dreyer (and many others before him) already used the technique; this particular Tai Chi master has now also given his benediction. In fairness to Dreyer, he does use Tai Chi principles (such as \\"going with the flow\\" and \\"the path of least resistance\\") in his mental and spiritual approach to running. But these principles are separable from the running technique. You don't, for example, need to \\"tap into your Chi\\" to begin running with a forward lean. Not surprisingly, Dreyer's explanations for why the technique works are a hodge podge. Lacking a background in physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, or physics, his explanations of the mechanics of running movements are, at best, amateurish. As a result, the reader is confronted with absurd section headings such as \\"The stages of learning effortless, injury free running.\\" The most technically efficient runner in the world expends plenty of effort while running (and trains accordingly). And even Dreyer admits he took 3 and years to prepare for his first ultra-marathon. In these instances Eastern mysticism serves as a smokescreen for Dreyer's lack of expertise regarding the fundamental physical forces and principles at work while a person runs. The book is also woefully short on drills for implementing the changes most runners will have to make to implement the physical techniques Dreyer recommends. As anyone who has ever participated in a sport knows, learning even basic techniques requires concerted effort and practice. Dreyer's short list of drills includes such admonitions as concentrating on rotating your pelvis from the T12/L1 spinal column level (ever tried that one?) and to have someone shout at you to \\"Stop Running!\\" to make you mindful of how you move when you are trying to move fast but can't run. ChiRunning will introduce you to a more efficient technique for running. But if you want to have a substantially similar technique explained by someone who actually knows about the mechanics of running and has a more systematic program for incorporating recommended changes, I would recommend Dr. Nicholas Romanov's Pose Method of Running. Romanov is a Russian trained sports scientist who has coached Olympic athletes and has the sports and running expertise Dreyer lacks."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I'm giving this book a 4 because it's a great start, and there is a major glut of books on running technique (thousands on running, but most are about training regimens and that is something far less important than technique--or at least should come after, and not before). The book loses a star because it is off base on a few things.I have been running recreationally for over a decade and took up competitive running last year. I get top 10% in local foot races and recently got 9th in a 300+ person triathlon.I used to be a low-cadence heel striker. I'd tried all the solutions of shoes, muscle imbalance, excess weight, etc. but none solved my chondromalacia (knee cap cartilage wearing). I bought this book because I knew I needed a new technique and I knew that most good runners were either mid strike or forefoot strikers.I read this book and did my best to apply it but ultimately, things just did not \\"click\\". The author promotes a midfoot strike (landing \\"flat footed\\", though the lateral part of the foot will hit first). This is a tried-and-true method that a great many accomplished elite runners use. He also promotes a ~90 cadence, which almost all good running coaches agree on. He also promotes a minimalist shoe, which a lot of elites use and it makes perfect sense (have the body absorb impact, don't rely on a shoe, which doesn't even do a good job anyway) These are all spot-on. Something I could never get, though, was his insistance that calf muscles are not used much in midfoot striking. They are and in fact I continued to heel strike, no matter what I did, until I started pointing my toes a bit to flatten the foot, which requires calf pressure. I also found his sand technique (practicing keeping even pressure on front and back of the foot), frankly quite silly. I have watched dozens of videos of elite runners and you will not find a single competitive one who is not launching off the ball of their foot--it being the last point of contact with the ground). This final launch requires calf strength as well.Another fallacy I see promoted not just by the author, but my other coaches these days, is that the forward lean produces power. Of course it produces none whatsoever. Gravity does not assist with horizontal movement. If a person starts a run on a flat surface and their body never goes down in height, gravity has had no net control of it and therefore none of its force can be translated into a horitzonal force. Gravity does not provide running power, PERIOD. It merely gives the foot the ability to push without breaking from the ground (its coefficient of friction working with gravity's force)...it pushes away from the body (and using Newton's law the body then moves away from the foot). The body has no net vertical movement during a run (it bobs up and down and the lean goes forward and back in a tiny see-saw depending on leg position, but no net vertical movement) and since gravity is a vertical force, it produces no horizontal force. This is basic physics but I see a lot of people not understanding it. Apparently, many people are confused by the fact that when a person is standing up right and then leans forward, they do in fact move forward, but this significant vertical->lean activity is not repeated in a manner than can provide forward movement. With the body ahead of the foot at lift-off, the body will come towards the ground, but to prevent it from smashing into the ground after a few strides, a corrective force has to be applied, which is the foot going out in front of the body.It's impossible for a runner at constant speed to strike the ground only under or behind their center of gravity. I won't bother getting into why with much detail, but again, nobody here will be able to find an elite athlete (sprinter or long distance runner) at constant speed (excusing the acceleration of a sprinter, when they are able to strike always behind the center of gravity) striking only under or behind the center of gravity. If you don't believe me, find a vid and pause at the exact moment of contact. The foot is ahead of the gcm. Dreyer says as a person speeds up their stride should open behind them and not ahead of them. Impossible. Again, I refer to elite athletes. I've watched 10 second sprinters. All of them have an increased stride and it opens up behind and ahead. If a person applies some basic physics so the matter, it's very easy to understand why. The author also says that as a person increases in speed they should actually feel more relaxed. I again defy anybody to find a 4 minute miler who says they feel more relaxed after that than after their 6 minute miles.The book IS decent, it's just not entirely accurate or possible. Taking these exceptions above to heart, the rest of it is filled with generally good advice.I am currently forefoot running (my heel rarely, if ever touches the ground), based upon coaching techniques from other sources. My knee pain has greatly decreased and I recently broke my best mile time. I don't chirun not because I don't think it's valid (it mostly is, but there are a couple of aforementioned problems) but because the exercises recommended simply didn't work for me...I could never \\"get\\" it, but the greatest thing I was missing was the calf tension; when I finally started putting more effort in my calves and plantar flexing my foot (pointing my toes), things came and now I can forefoot run and midstrike run with ease, so anybody having problems may benefit from trying that.The book is a good start. I will not return to heel striking ever. I continue to spend a good bit of time researching running technique from various sources, which is why I take issue with some of the fallacies promoted about running and some of the physical impossiblities that people pretend are possible."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I have suffered from recurrent knee problems for the past several years and had eagerly taken every opportunity to look at new methodology that might alleviate the pain or discomfort associated with training. I quickly grew tired of the first three chapters telling me what was coming up in chapter four and how exciting that information was going to be. Get on with it - tell me darn it. Instead,the first three chapters are all about Master X and Master Y and their profound impact on Mr Dreyer. I respect practioners of the martial arts and the associated philosophies and powers they have developed. I consider body awareness esential to anyone who hopes to achieve their best, but I was so tired of Tai Chi by the time that I got to the meat of the book that I was beginning to have little faith in Mr Dreyer's coaching ability. The remainder of the book, past chapter four, is equally slow. I do appreciate the technique taught by Dreyer and it has, over the past month, lessened the impact and associated pain. I am glad that I didn't tire and put the book down but feel the information can be more succinctly presented."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Sorry, but I don't think Chi running is too terribly different from the older \\"pose\\" method of running described by Coach Alexander Romanov. A few important adjustments, but not a \\"revolutionary approach.\\" This might be a very good read for new runners or runners who have never considered their form.The author implies that Chi running is \\"effortless\\" and that you don't use your leg muscles to run which is simply absurd; if it was there would be no need to train. The idea that you use form, posture and stride to work with gravity is very helpful and spot on, but still, one does have to move and lift the legs."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I have been waiting for this book for years! I have low-level chronic knee and hip problems that have kept me from running for years. I was able to quickly integrate some of the suggestions in this book and got immediate results. When I fall beack in to old habits, I feel it instantly - my joints feel it, and my breathing becomes less efficient.I thoroughly recommend this book for everyone that enjoys running (or jogging), and especially for those who get aches and pains from poor form.Thank you, Danny Dreyer!"},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Full disclosure: I took the workshop with Danny before I read the book. So my comments probably have less to do with the written presentation than with the technique itself.I'm a casual runner - 4-6 miles, 3 days a week at most unless I'm training for a particular event. It's one of many things I do along with bicycling, aerobics, Pilates, strength training and kayaking. All my life I've been plagued with \\"overuse\\" (i.e. bad form) injuries - patellofemoral dysfunction, Achilles tendinitis, overpronation. With no other coaching than learning the Chi Running method, I no longer have to wear my patellofemoral straps and have no knee pain when I run. My Achilles are improving (more attention was required to my body mechanics in my other activities - but learning Chi Running helped me become aware of this as well). And I hope to someday wean myself off foot orthotics as other Chi Runners have done.More importantly, Chi Running has made running feel good to me. Before, running was always a painful and rather unpleasant component to my cross-training, that I did because it was a cardio workout I could take with me wherever I travel. Now, I actually enjoy running, and I even competed in a 5K recently (and did rather well for being a very casual runner - top 20% in my age group and top third overall).I think perhaps some of the critics are spending too much time thinking about the technique and not enough time feeling it in their body. I'm far from an accomplished Chi Runner, but it's really made a huge difference to me, and the more I refine my technique, the better it gets."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"I highly recommend this book. The techniques in the book really do work, no matter what one thinks about the philosophy behind it. I'm 23 and have been running regularly for about 12 years, though only semi-competitively for about a year. In my sophomore year in college, I was training for the possibility of going into OCS and ended up overtraining. I suffered a relatively serious stress fracture by doing the things that the author of this book warns against. I recently completed a marathon using the techniques in this book, and was amazed at the improvement in my time, and the way my body felt after the race. These techniques are solid, especially for experienced runners looking to improve their distances/times. The Eastern philosophy sprinkled throughout the book is entertaining and, as with all philosophy, good brain candy to chew on."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"What this book lacks in sophisticated, scientific presentation & execution, it makes up for with optimism and good nature. The author's good will and enthusiasm for running as an activity for people of all ages & fitness levels, is apparent throughout. Most experienced runners might not garner too much new information from this basic book, but it does have plenty of friendly reminders about form, technique and style and it's all presented in an extremely likeable fashion.As a multimarathoner, I did come away with a few good tips and \\"food for thought,\\" so it was certainly worth the time spent reading. I think, though, that it would be of greatest benefit with the companion DVD or a live class, for introducing newer runners to safe sporting."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"...just the first 4 chapters, where the author outlines the physiological and psychological differences between his Eastern-philosophy-based \\"chi running\\" versus the conventional Western \\"power running\\" model is worth the price of the book.Long before I read this book, I had already been leaning in the same direction as I continue my Zen meditation practice (going on 6 years now) and having recently gotten back into running several months ago. I was already striving to focus on mental as well as physical relaxation as my main objective in running, trying to keep my shoulders/traps down, head properly aligned, relaxed hands, running from my hara (\\"dan tien\\" in Chinese, = the chakra about 2 inches below the belly button), minimizing unnecessary strain/effort, and really FEELING the ground beneath my feet. With this sort if improvised \\"Zen\\" approach I already noticed the lack of shin splints and general sense of excruciating exertion that I used to experience while running in high school and college...running became relaxing rather than stressful and tedious!This book connects a lot of those dots, reinforcing but also expanding on many of those technique points, and mercifully does so with a relative economy of self-help psychobabble though there are the inevitable anecdotal testimonials here and there. I was just happy that this was not yet another corny motivational pep talk (\\"you can do it, just believe in yourself and train train train, rah rah rah!\\") type of book. There are plentiful photos which are mostly useful, and the format of the book is fairly easy to navigate through.I have not had a chance to actually try many of the body-awareness drills and exercises (am hoping to take one of his workshops to have them demonstrated to me in person) but still found most of the book very helpful and insightful. Might just get the DVD instead...*** FOR ALL NEW RUNNERS: along with this book I'd recommend going to a dedicated running shop (and I don't mean \\"Foot Locker\\" mall chains) to get your feet looked at and buy a really good pair of running shoes, which should go for 80-100 bucks. Later on you can order replacement shoes online and save a little money but the expertise of such a shop in choosing the right type and size of shoes is priceless. Also a pair of specialized running socks (8-15 bucks, Thorlo for example) is an excellent investment. I ran with the wrong type and size of shoes for years, and when I finally took a friend's advice to go to a running shop it really made a huge difference. (BTW, the running shop is also where I first saw this book!) Happy running..."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book will help runners of all experience levels to run farther and faster.

They were exampled clearly and the author also backs the reasoning up with information that makes sense. This book has opened my eyes to comfortable running which I did not know that was possible. Thank you to the author and would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"This book is the best book on the market that I have read. It is more than a book though as it takes you through a step by step process. It gives you the proper form and then gives you exercises that allow you to feel how your body should feel when you are running. A very, very, practical book! I have read other book on running and tried to incoporate the form into my running, but without success. With this book I have had very good success as well as gotten rid of my shin splints. The clincher in the book is the picture of the footprints left behind when you run properly which show no forward movement in them compared with regular running which shows a ton(see Tom Brown jr. books for info on reading tracks). I love this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in successfully learning how to run better and easier."},{"Title":"Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running","review":"Danny Dreyer's Chi Running: A Revolutionary Approach to Effortless, Injury-Free Running (New York: Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 2009) is now in its second edition. It has been acclaimed by many coaches, runners and medical professionals, as reflected in its testimonials.Runners suffer many injuries. As Dreyer states, \\"It is estimated that 65% of all runners incur at least one injury a a year that interrupts their training.\\" (p. 2) Although over-training can cause injury, Dreyer's lays most of the blame on bad form.Dreyer credits his initiation to a T'ai Chi master, Zhu Xilin. The Chinese character for \\"chi\\" can be interpreted as \\"internal energy\\" and \\"t'ai\\" as \\"extreme.\\" Many readers will be familiar with t'ai chi as a system of self-defense without weapons that includes a series of graceful exercises. I was apprehensive that Dreyer's reference to T'ai Chi might be just a marketing gimmick, but the author in fact does forge a compelling connection between his principles and those of T'ai Chi (and, more broadly, other martial arts). T'ai Chi, like the Japanese martial art of jiu jitsu, seeks instruction from the grace and power of animal movements.Dreyer incorporates several elements from T'ai Chi practice into his style. The first is meditation/relaxation. The second relates to posture. The third is mindfulness of the body.Meditation and relaxation can help to relax the body. It's a truism that competitive athletics is largely a mental game, and for an endurance sport like the marathon, it's even more so. Instead of stretching before a race, Dreyer recommends movements to loosen keys joints and relax the muscles.Pose is an important element of T'ai Chi practice. For distance running, Dreyer recommends a slightly forward posture, \\"to allow gravity to assist your forward strides.\\" I am not sure as a matter of physics that this notion of gravity assist actually makes sense. I'd rather think of the leaning posture as a more optimal angle for our muscles to transfer energy to the ground. T'ai Chi, like other Chinese martial arts, focuses particularly on strengthening and pivoting off of the dian tien, which could be translated as the Core. In this respect, Western programs such as Pilates, the Alexander Technique and classic ballet instruction parallel a much older Eastern tradition. According to Dreyer, \\"80% of all the runners I teach start off by standing with their hips too far forward and their legs sloped to the rear, their shoulders back, and their knees locked\\"; Dreyer coaches these runners to create a \\"column\\" of correct posture for running.\\"Mindfulness\\" runs against the doctrine, \\"No pain/no gain.\\" If your body is experiencing pain, listen to it and make adjustments. Master Zhu taught Dreyer to let the chi run through the body as \\"water runs through a pipe.\\" Adjustments, he stresses, should be incremental, using your \\"Body Sense.\\" Correct breathing is a central aspect of mindfulness.Dreyer recommends using minimal running shoes of the sort sort by Vibram. Because these shoes lack padding under the heals, they encourage you to strike your foot more as you would as a barefoot runner. Dreyer recommends a full strike of the foot against the surface, rather than the typical heel to ball movement of most people using conventional running shoes. He gives a simple test of good form. Run on sand. If your tracks show the full tread markings of your shoe, you've struck correctly. If you're digging wedges into the ground with your heels (see photo on p. 90), you're using a poor technique that puts unacceptable strain on your legs, including especially your knees. By the way, if your tracks are not parallel, that implies other problems that need correction. (I run in Vibrams but follow a ball-heel-ball striking pattern. I like the shock absorbing qualities of this striking pattern. But Dreyer is right that my way puts a lot of stress on the calves, and I'm going to try out his full strike technique. One more thing: Vibrams offer very little insulation against cold, so I would put them away if running on snow or ice. As an alternative to Vibrams, you might consider a light training show, less minimal than Vibrams, but with a weight of about 8-9 ounces; be sure the heel area is not pronounced, as that is the design Dreyer says encourages a bad striking pattern.)Dreyer finds that many injuries result from over-elongating the gait, while keeping too slow a \\"cadence.\\" Shorter steps with a faster cadence works better, he finds, to prevent injury. He recommends a steady cadence of about 80-85 strikes per minute. In effect, if you want to run slowly, decrease your stride, not your striking rate. There are some good examples of Dreyer's notion of \\"gearing\\" in his accompanying Chi Running DVD (sold separately).Dreyer has helpful advice about rotation of the pelvis along what he calls the PivotPoint, which requires twisting of the spine. Also important is getting your arm swing right--the elbow at a right angle and arms swinging parallel, not across. He cites Duke Ellington's riff: \\"It don't mean a thing/if it ain't got that swing.\\" (p. 102)By the way, Dreyer has just published a new book, called Chi Marathon (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, 2012). A posting by Deborah Kotz in the health blog of the Boston Globe discussed Dreyer's approach, which promises a \\"breakthrough natural running program for a pain-free half marathon and marathon.\\" . See Daily Dose, 3/26/2012. Whatever is true of running injuries in general goes double for marathons and ultra-marathons. Training injuries are almost the rule. He has also published a book and DVD on Chi Walking (New York: Fireside/Simon & Schuster, 2006).Mr. Dreyer manages three commercial websites related to these subjects: ChiWalking.com, ChiRunning.com and ChiLiving.com. The running Website usefully include training logs and programs.Dreyer Chi Running includes a series of photos of a female teacher or coach correcting a student's posture by \\"creating the column.\\" ( p.78) The photos reinforced my feeling that while reading a running book and watching a DVD are good things, having a knowledgeable coach (perhaps someone trained by Dreyer) giving hands on feedback would be even better. In this light, I note that Dreyer offers programs to become \\"Certified Instructors\\" in Chi Running and in Chi Walking: He also offers help on his Website on finding a Certified Instructor.(The author of this review, Andrew Szabo, is founder of MindBodyForce.com)"},{"Title":"World Pocket Bible","review":"Perfect take-anywhere bible.

However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother.

But Miller has written a history that is at once scholarly and full of the color and flavor of the age. His grasp of the large picture is combined with a knack for summing up that large picture in concrete, well-worded language, and he doesn't leave the reader in a fog of political theory. It's full of vivid accounts of Colonial and British action, peppered with quotes, and Miller's wry sense of humor evident throughout. For instance, \\"Nor was Colonel James forgotten by the mob...the patriots had the satisfaction of wrecking his furniture, burning his library, and drinking up his cellar. In fact, the only article saved from the ruin was a red curtain which the mob hoisted as a flag.\\" Footnotes are abundant, and Miller has largely used primary sources. Chapters are \\"The Economic Background\\", \\"The Political Background\\", \\"England and America on the Eve\\", \\"The Quest for Colonial Revenue: The Sugar Act\\", \\"The Quest for a Colonial Revenue: The Stamp Act\\", \\"The Stamp Act Crisis\\", \\"The Repeal of the Stamp Act\\", \\"The American Mind\\", \\"The English Mind\\", \\"The Townshend Duties\\", \\"The Growth of Colonial Opposition\\", \\"The Collapse of Colonial Opposition\\", \\"The Decline of the Revolutionary Movement\\", \\"Tea Revives the Dispute\\", \\"The Coercive Acts\\", \\"The Continental Congress\\", \\"Lexington and its Aftermath\\", \\"The Empire in the Balance\\", \\"The Movement Toward Independence\\", \\"The Declaration of Independence\\", and \\"The American Revolution as a Democratic Movement\\".

By awarding 5 stars to this book, the implication must be that they are stars of the purest gold. I have read some \\"5-star\\" novels and short story collections before, but little, in my experience, compares with this: the combination of an extraordinarily beautiful prose style, the seemingly effortless creation of literally hundreds if not thousands of alternately sympathetic and detestable (but always vividly memorable) characters, a profound insight into the psychology of the human mind to rival (and pretty easily surpass) that of any other writer alive, a recreation of atmosphere so real it clings, and a brilliant inventiveness when it comes to creating great story lines (and, often, superbly twisty [but never illogical] endings) places this collection among the very greatest of its kind. One measure of how deeply impressed I was with this book is that now, more than half a year since I finished it, I can look back through the table of contents and still remember not merely every story with tremendous vividness, but often where I was at the time I read it.Stated broadly, Trevor's stories seem to fall into two distinct types, English and Irish. The former tend to be (as do many of the earlier stories) sharp and edgy, whereas the latter tend to be quiet and pastoral. Although it is the Irish stories that appear to garner the greatest praise from the critics, I prefer the greater cynicism (often bordering on, but never quite reaching, downright misanthropy) of the English stories.Having to choose my favorites from among this potent collection is akin to separating gold coins that are 100% pure from those that are 99.975% pure (soft though they would be!), but three continue to haunt me just a little more than the others. \\"The Death of Peggy Meehan,\\" one of the Irish stories, and one of the collection's shortest, tells the tale of a young lad who is taken to his first movie during a summer vacation, and how the fantasies he draws after seeing that movie color (for better or worse) the rest of his life. \\"In at the Birth,\\" is, unusually for Trevor, a creepy ghost story that Rod Serling would have marveled over. In it, an elderly woman takes a baby-sitting job for a peculiar couple who turn out to be (and this is hardly among the most riveting revelations provided) childless. But rather than leave me frightened, it left me pondering the meaning of life, age, and human relationships. Finally, \\"The Hotel of the Idle Moon,\\" is what I described to a friend as \\"the greatest short story ever written.\\" Its title is especially evocative and, in its context, has a host (no pun intended!) of powerful resonances. The \\"set up\\" is baldly cliche: on a dark and stormy night a middle-aged couple stop in front of an estate, pretending that their car has broken down. Foul play, one can be sure, is bound to ensue. And so it does. But the play is much fouler and more upsetting than anything anyone can imagine (trust me, until you read this story you cannot imagine what happens). It is one of Trevor's gifts that such a story can't be adequately explained. It has to be read, felt, lived. Suffice it to say that by the end we realize that we have read nothing less than a parable of (very) contemporary times (I don't know when it was written) that manages, in a trice, to both limn and condemn humankind since the beginning of history.High marks also to \\"The Table,\\" which reads like a hilarious comedy of errors until the last line suddenly blackens everything that came before it with perfect (and perfectly uncanny) inevitability, \\"The Forty-Seventh Saturday,\\" as poignant a story of loneliness as I know, and \\"O Fat White Woman\\" (the title may be funny; the story is anything but), which spins a tale of the tragedy that follows passive resistance. (And when is the last time you read a story that dealt with that? Why does it seem that Trevor is our only contemporary writer who consistently confronts such common yet seemingly taboo foibles?). As is usual with Trevor, the tragedy occurs on many planes and is of an inestimable magnitude.Oh, heck, let me not forget \\"Nice Day at School,\\" an incredibly sensitive and piercing drama, and the superb and highly regarded \\"In Isfahan,\\" in which a married, middle-aged English man meets a married, youngish English woman on tour in Iran. They try to get close, but their chequered pasts prevent them. What we don't realize until the end, however, is that one of their pasts isn't real. Or is it? And what purpose does fantasy play in encroaching human relationships? Can it be used to repel as well as to lure? Or is it there to comfort? And, if so, comfort whom? Particularly rich stuff.Amidst a sea of great short story collections, this one by William Trevor will always have its place at the top. There's a word for books like this, and that word is \\"perfect.\\" May it never go out of print."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"This book sits perched in the backseat of my car, easily accessed for a quick William Trevor fix.

I recommend this book to anyone who loves language, wit and perfect storytelling."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"This is, perhaps,the finest of all books. With 85 magnificent stories, virtually every one a solid masterpiece,William Trevor stands at the ultimate heights of his genre. Each story is a compressed gem and,while I have to admit that not every one is the greatest thing ever written, when you are blown away by about 1100 pages of a 1261 page opus, it is worth it in the end. Even the lesser stories have their merits, beautiful writing and sincere exploration of character. This is a book that everyone should read. I understand that this is a bit of an ethusiastic cliche and it is not a statement I have made before. But the sometimes comedic, usually heartbreaking tales contained within this book are just about all anyone needs to learn the wide range of emotions suffered by humanity. Do not pass up this unique offer.

Witness 'Another Christmas' - in a dingy living room and armed with no one but an aging Irish couple, he brings home the Troubles in Ireland in epic, heartbreaking scope. And 'Torridge'...a girl said to me when this story first appeared in The New Yorker that it was like Beethoven's Fifth; you can't imagine it not having been around before. It's that good.Readers! You can do no better than to get to know what this man can do with a pen."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"It took me a couple of months to make my way through these 85 stories and it was definitely worth the time I spent with them. Trevor's prose is always simple and clear, yet his range of characters and plots is astonishing because of their superbly captured detail and variety. Most of these stories deal with Irish and English characters, and many swirl around the realities or possibilities of extramarital affairs. \\"In Isfahan,\\" one of Trevor's best stories, a married middle-aged man carries on an impromptu affair with a young woman he meets while in Iran; in \\"Lovers of Their Time,\\" another top-notch story, a married man carries on a long-term affair with a shop girl by meeting her in a hotel's second-floor public bathroom. Trevor is also quite adept of presenting the romantic yearnings of women. In \\"The Ballroom of Romance,\\" a country girl's dreams and consequences are highlighted in her trips to the local dance hall; in \\"Afternoon Dancing,\\" a middle-aged married woman dallies with the idea of an affair with her dance partner after the death of her close friend. Like Chekhov, to whom Trevor is often compared, this writer also has an admirable sense of comedy. \\"Mulvhill's Memorial\\" finds an unlikely pornographic set-up within an office; \\"The Trinity\\" has a couple booking a vacation to Venice and ending up in Switzerland. Accidents spiral out of control in \\"The Penthouse Apartment,\\" and in \\"A Complicated Nature,\\" a man is forced to help his upstairs neighbor when her suitor unexpectedly dies. Another one of the best stories of this collection is \\"Broken Homes,\\" where an elderly woman suffers the indignities of having her kitchen painted by a team of indifferent youths. Other first-rate stories include \\"The Smoke Trees of San Pietro,\\" where a boy's sickness propels his mother into an affair, and \\"Death in Jerusalem\\" where a mother dies while on vacation."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"I had given up reading for pleasure since my teen years and consumed only history, science and technology readings until the fateful Sunday, listening to NPR, heard William Trevor's, short story \\"Broken Homes\\", read by Meryl Strip.

No one weaves a tale as fine as William Trevor. His ability to place the reader into the hearts and souls of his characters is nothing short of remarkable. His stories do not focus on plot but rather on human emotion. They center on ordinary circumstances with extraordinary consequences. From the young schoolgirl with a crush on her teacher, to the betrayed wife, to the obese lonely man longing for love, Trevor covers a wide variety of people who are besieged with despair and striving for purpose.I'm amazed at how often I hear the reply, &quot;William Tevor? I've never heard of him,&quot; when I speak of my favorite short story writer. I can't help but to boast about this great man's talent. He packs incredible power into sparse words that leave an unforgettable impact on his audience. Perhaps some day whenMr. Trevor is no longer with us he will receive the recognition he deserves. In the meantime, his small legion of fans can relish his gift and treasure the fact that we are among the first to appreciate his eloquence and style."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"I had given up reading for pleasure since my teen years and consumed only history, science and technology readings until the fateful Sunday, listening to NPR, heard William Trevor's, short story \\"Broken Homes\\", read by Meryl Strip. I could not take myself from the car to shop, Meryl had not finished the reading!I then knew I would read more William Trevor and ordered this book straight away. Even since my life has changed! More than 8o stories with such an insight into human character, I wonder if Trevor is the modern Shackspeare?Death In Jeruselem is haunting and wonderful. Every story a joy to read. I spend my evenings now listening to light jazz and reading William Trevor. My life has reached a new peak and the Tele is being sold for junk."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"Just ordered this and awaiting it anxiously. I have just finished two later collections The Hill Bachelors and Cheating at Canasta (the title story in the latter is heartbreaking and just a perfect piece of writing). I also immediatley ran out and bought After Rain and A Bit on the Side. I had overlooked Trevor for years. I now fully acknowledge that in doing so; I deserve to be tried for crimes against humanity! Being from Ireland and living here, I also live with the constant knowledge that Trevor is a god and part of the literary furniture. Somehow, strangely, I just took him for granted and never read him. I had also wrongly assumed that Trevor belonged to that somewhat stuffy Irish \\"big house novel\\" literary tradition (if one can call it that). By chance, I picked up The Hill Bachelors and have found literary salvation! He is utterly brilliant and consistently so. 12 collections and counting. Nearly every collection consists of 12 stories, each about 20/22 pages long, divided in to 5 or 6 scenes. His structure is so simple and within it he performs miracles, over and over again. It is also wonderful how his stories alternate between a story set in Ireland and a story set in England, the country that he has lived in since his 30s. I adore short stories and all the great North American and Irish writers in the genre: Hemingway, Carver, Wolff, Munro, Joyce and McGahern. But I think Trevor is now my literary hero - plus he's a first rate gentleman (not always so with literary geniuses). Although now 80 let's hope for a new collection from the master in about 2010 and God help him, maybe more after that."},{"Title":"Resources for implementing inclusive education in Minnesota","review":"Mr. Trevor's stories are heartbreaking in their simplicity and clarity. Most often, he dissects the illusions which enable people to survive--and which are so very sad. After seven or eight Trevor stories, you begin to wonder if it is even possible to be honest with yourself. In this age where fiction so often is reduced to description, Mr. Trevor still believes in writing about love and death, honor and betrayal, duty and neglect. His physical world is narrow--usually limited to small-town or rural Ireland--but his emotional world is limitless. If you want to know how short stories should be written, read this."},{"Title":"Baseball pals","review":"This book was good dont get me wrong but most of the parts were soooo boring i could have fallin asleep right in the middle of reading it. Some of the scenes where the firneds were mad at each other were kinda interesting. We then got back to being friends again i was glad for them, but it seemed like just out of now where they all of a sudden just starting being frineds again so that didnt make much sence to me. But over all i rated the book a middle 3 because there were some parts of the book that needed to be worked on but some of them were also good enough to read again. I am a big fan of sports book and playing these sports but this book also just didnt seem like a baseball book. It should have just been titled Pals"},{"Title":"Baseball pals","review":"Baseball Pals is written by Matt Christopher and it is about 97 pages and it has short chapters. If you like baseball books and one were there is a kid that wants to play one spot and there is a kid that is a lot better than him at that spot and they are the best of friends. This book is one that you would like if you have a lower reading level.

It all starts out about a kid named Jimmie who was the manager of his baseball team. He though he could pitch, but really everyone knew that Paul was better and still didn't admit to it. So then Paul decides to pitch for another team. When the season starts Jimmie's team is really bad because there team has no pitchers. Paul and Jimmie are best friends so they never want to be on different teams, so there are many problems along the way.In this book it shows how sometimes when you're a kid you want to be the pitcher and want to be the best player but that isn't always the right thing. It will teach some kids not to be selfish all the time and know that they always aren't the best player. For the length of the book it had some really good action of sports. If you like sports this would be an awesome book to read. It is a really hard book to put down while reading it. I like the theme of this book and also the plot. That is why I put 4 out of 5 stars on it."},{"Title":"Baseball pals","review":"This book was a really good book. I especially like how it's a sports novel but also explains life lessons. The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends.

The main character in this story is Jimmie, in the story he was picked as the manager of his baseball team and he wanted to pitch, unfortunately so did his best friend Paul, but he wanted to pitch so Paul quit his team and went to another team. The plot was that Jimmie was being selfish and his friend quit the team, Jimmie also turned out not to be that good of a pitcher. The setting of the story is during present day, it takes place in a city, and the name was not named in the story.The theme of this amazing story is baseball. It also explains to not be selfish, because you can sometimes even lose your best friend. I liked this story that is why I rate it 5 stars; it was a very thorough and well written story. The author had a good beginning, middle and end. The story was about my favorite theme of baseball; also it had a good plot and was an overall good story."},{"Title":"Baseball pals","review":"Jimmie wants to be a pitcher but can't get the ball over the plate like Rudi Stine of the bad news bears who allowed 55 runs in 20 inings.

It is not an anecdotal book, and the writing style is more of what you would find in a textbook.There is some excellent advice on obtaining visas, and a good introduction to the various types of English teacher positions available, from the informal &quot;coffee shop school&quot; to the more formal JET program. The book gives a brief glimpse of Japanese history and culture, but that is not a majority focus.Fully half of &quot;Teaching English in Japan&quot; is focused on practical, specific English teaching skills. There is a good introduction to pronunciation mistakes common to Japanese learners, as well as a solid coverage of grammar and tenses that occur in English, but not Japanese. A chapter is devoted to creating lesson plans, and another chapter introduces various teaching styles and tools.If you want to teach English, but have never done so before, this book will give you a good idea of what will be expected of you. Don't expect to memorize every lesson in the book. It is a valuable reference to pack along to Japan, and pull out again and again."},{"Title":"Teaching English Japan: Finding Work, Teaching, and Living in Japan","review":"for anyone considering going to teach english in Japan this is THE BOOK to start you on your journey. very practical resource which takes you through all the steps involved, from how to get a job, info on cultural issues, plus a whole section devoted to lesson planning for the novice teacher.

Seems a bit outdated too, at least my 1992 edition does. A lot of time spent covering things you could easily look up on the web. If you are going to Japan through JET, you will have heard a lot of this stuff by the time you get to Japan. Definitely check this out in a bookstore before buying, probably give it a pass."},{"Title":"Teaching English Japan: Finding Work, Teaching, and Living in Japan","review":"For starters it is no way near worth $200 as listed in January 2011, unless you are family and there is some special reason for needing the book for such a fee. Secondly it is 15 years old now and the language industry in Japan is quite new now. NOVA and GEOS the two biggest schools filed for bankruptcy in the past couple of years and tenure positions at universities are impossible to consider (with a rare exception) without a PhD.When I started teaching in Japan, 1997, you could make $2500 a month as a salary and get $500-$1500 as a monthly bonus when business was good in the language schools and you have a lot of students sign up for contracts under your name. Again - these schools are bust now. Not sure if it was a trend or the bad mismanagement of the schools as they became too money hungry while forgetting about the students.To make a long story short - if you are going to Japan to teach TESOL it makes sense to have this book, a used $2 copy only. If you are researching the ESL industry in Japan this may shine a light on some aspect. With the internet as it is and Dave's ESL Caf&eacute; , books like this have become redundant - unless you are old-fashioned like me and enjoy holding a book, after all I own it : )"},{"Title":"Critical Essays on Lord Byron (Critical Essays on British Literature)","review":"it was the worst book i ever bought it wasnt worth the mone"},{"Title":"Howl-O-Ween","review":"I read a lot of horror fiction --- and I mean a LOT of horror fiction, so when I say I like something, I'm comparing it to all the other things I've read.HOWL-O-WEEN is better than anything I've read by Stephen King (except, maybe, The Stand). It has characters you care about, become involved with, and want to throttle sometimes for their stupidity. The plot is smooth and flawless, edge of the seat stuff that makes it tough to put down. I'm usually forced to read a book through several sittings because of my schedule. HOWL-O-WEEN I was able to get through much more quickly.The Baron Samedi shaman was a marvelous, though understated villain. His minions struck just the right balance between subservience and suspicion, never quite getting out of hand. The villain's motivation was refreshingly well defined. He wanted to live.That the protagonist really had no idea what was going on through most of the book was an excellent plot device. The werewolf device was not overdone, another good judgment.If you want to read a werewolf novel in the Lon Chaney vein, this is it."},{"Title":"Howl-O-Ween","review":"I loved this book, I love the fantasy worlds, werewolves, magic, the supernatural, is all great.

You meet the Dark Man and learn from the very beginning he's a witch and very powerful and cruel. And you wonder a bit about the mysterious Bryan.Cyrus is likeable from the get go, Kyna is annoying, Bryan is shadey, and the Dark Man is pure evil. As the story unfolds, about 70 pages in it starts taking more shape. You follow Cyrus and Kyna's travels around North America and Canada and watch their love affair take shape. There is a lot of sex in this book, but tasteful sex. Not too mushy and graphic.Upon Cyrus' encounter with the wolf it becomes clear what he is. But this isn't your typical werewolf story, he's not a mindless killing machine. Excatly the oppostie. This is enjoyed very much in this book.As the book progresses Kyna begins to grow on the reader and turns out she's not all she was made to be at the start. All in all, this book started slow, picked up speed and the closer Halloween gets the faster you turn the pages. I was impressed with the book, not overly so. But it was a worthy werewolf tale. And by no means did I find the book scarey. Reading it won't make me look in the shadows at night expecting an evil witchdoctor to pop out."},{"Title":"Howl-O-Ween","review":"Being a avid werewolf fan I also bought this book cause of the cool cover.

The Letters on Aesthetic Education offer an interpretation of the development of the individual and the parallel development of Western civilization. These interpretations focus on the conditions that allow for mental health in a human individual and society, and especially demonstrate (as the title indicates) the crucial role of artistic experience in healthy human development. This is a great work, and a great introduction to the other German philosophers of the 19th Century (Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, et al). This edition is very good: the translation is good, and it has a facing German text. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On the aesthetic education of man,","review":"Friedrich Schiller composed in a series of 'letters' a profound, stimulating and important reflection on the relevance of our aesthetic experience. He was influenced by his contemporary Immanuel Kant and goes on to explore the implications that emerge from our understanding of the sublime in relation to culture, society and our own edification. His short and erudite expositions reflect his response to the tumultuous times that existed at the end of the 18th Century. His 'letters' are insightful of a man who wants his readers to make a difference to the ennoblement of life rather than descend to the easy pursuit of the superficialities that are just as obvious in our lives today."},{"Title":"On the aesthetic education of man,","review":"Ok here's a little pop culture bit to sweeten the mighty load of Friedrich Schiller: The intellectuals of this period, inspired and defined by Goethe's seminal teen-angst classic The Sorrows of Young Werther. Werther's style is still seen today in the goth subculture- moopy, depressed, poetic, etc. Basically that's a combination of Anglo Byronic romanticism and German romanticism. One of the main symbols of the Werther/Schiller era of German Romanticism is the blue flower of Novalis. (Wiki)I see Schiller as being the actual embodiment of the Werther character, particularly after finishing the Aesthetic Educations of Man, a book I've now read three different times (undergraduate, law school, last month.) That's probably because I see this book as kind of the birth of Romantic Pop Culture. Basically, Schiller took Kantian idealism and crossed it with a popular format (i.e. they're written as \\"letters\\") Unlike Kant, you can actually read Schiller, since this book is only 140 pages long.The reason this book is still relevant is that Kantian idealism underlays most popular manifestations of Romanticism, but most people who consider themselves \\"Romantics\\" literally have no idea what Kantian idealism means. Myself included. Thus, by reading this one 140 page book, you can kind of get a handle on the relationship, and gain a better understanding of artists who are influenced by this time period. Like Depeche Mode... or, for a more hipster specific reference, Dr. Octagon's classic Blue Flowers. Cue lyrics:Look at the land... Blue Flowers!Drawing by the purple pond, in the purple pastures Blue Flowers!Drawing by the purple pond, yellow ink that flows Blue FlowersRomanticism runs strong and deep in all of the Western nations. It is, in fact, the primary ideology for people dissatisfied with reality Just think about the prevalence of the \\"lonely hero.\\" It's also the primary posture of artists of all stripes. The more \\"popular\\" the art, the more romantic it is likely to be.Romanticism is both current and 400+ years old. Thus, contemporary artists can manipulate the audience by being more aware of the symbols and modes of thought of something like Romanticism, since the listener WILL respond: Think of all the people wearing Depeche Mode T-Shirts with Blue Flowers and Tour Dates printed on the back. That's pure, unadulterated, 18th century German Romanticism. The modern artist is inevitably an interpreter/re-interpreter of symbols with long-standing cultural resonance."},{"Title":"The Soviet Space Race with Apollo","review":"For anyone who has an interest in the space race, or the Soviet space program, this book is a must read. It covers the Mishin years as chief designer, and chronicles the downfall of the soviet manned lunar orbital, and lunar landing programs, which were cancelled after the fourth failure of the N1 super booster in 1974. It also covers the Glushko era, and the formation of NPO Energia in the late 1970's.My only critisizm of the book is that it can be heavy going in places, typical of any official NASA history text. All the known facts are recorded in print, no matter how mundane they may be. However, many of these facts are the details that serious space buffs have thirsted for, for many years. This book adds flesh to the bones of Soviet space history, and shines light into previously shady areas. Topics of particular interest are: the failure of Soyuz 1, the death of Gagarin, the crushing affects of Apollo 8, and the long and continuous string of Proton and N1 launch failures that caused the demise of the Soviet lunar program.The Soviets eventually turned to their military Almaz program for salvation; which spawned the Salyut space station. This too turned to disater when the first occupants died aboard their Soyuz 11 re-entry vehicle. Some of the books best moments are the eye witness accounts of pivotal events in the program, reproduced from the diaries of General Nikolay Kamanin and the touching story of the N1 booster, which was so close to success before it was ultimately cancelled, dismantled, and completely destoyed by Glushko.The book is illustrated with small black and white images, but for better photographs, of the N1 and other soviet equipment of this era, I recommend &quot;Rocket and Space Corporation Energia: The Legacy of S. P. Korolev&quot;."},{"Title":"The Soviet Space Race with Apollo","review":"You think you have job stress? This book,written from Russian source material by a PhD candidate commisioned by NASA, details the huge difficulties Russian engineers had trying to accomplish what they did in the chaotic and Byzantine world of the Soviet space program. Their technical decisions are well described and their personal issues and rivalries dealt with fairly and objectively. I came away with a deep respect for the achievments of the Russians. Their technology base was thin and weak compared to that of the U.S. and they developed many innovative ways to overcome it. The two most interesting aspects to me were the way in which German missile technology was incorporated and then surpassed to start the Russian program and the coverage of the ill-fated but fascinating N1/L1 Moon program. Do be warned - this is a dense, heavily researched, and highly detailed book - not a light read !"},{"Title":"The Soviet Space Race with Apollo","review":"This is an excellent and extraordinarily thorough analysis of how the Soviet space program went from the highs of Sputnik and Vostok (covered in the author's first book) to the disappointments of the failed attempts to launch a circumlunar mission or an actual manned lunar landing. If the book is a perhaps excessively detailed and not a light read, I think that's fine, because it also answers the many questions I always had of what REALLY happened during these tense years of the Soviet/American space race. The Soviet efforts were for so long shrouded in mystery and even when revelations came they seemed incomplete. I think this author's strong emphasis on original source material and exhaustive research have been well rewarded. If you want the complete story, this is a must have."},{"Title":"The Soviet Space Race with Apollo","review":"For the amateur space enthusiast, Siddiqi's book represents a highly informative, throughly-researched reference on the Soviet/Russian space program. By focusing on the efforts to land cosmonauts on the moon in competition with Apollo, Siddiqi carefully documents the people and reasons why this effort ultimately did not succeed.It is indeed not a light read in some spots, but reader patience is rewarded. The scope and magnitude of his research is astounding and one comes away with a much better sense of the impact the Soviet space efforts had on the \\"space race.\\"There are lots of interesting pieces of information related to the Soyuz 1 and 11 tragedies, the N1/L3 program that are not readily included in other works. The final chapter best summarizes the content of Siddiqi's work and the appendices and tables provide exhaustive information that the space enthusiast would appreciate.It is indeed a \\"must have/must read\\" and belongs in the collection of any space enthusiast!"},{"Title":"The Soviet Space Race with Apollo","review":"I had been looking for a book like this one for a long time and this one fills the bill.

I am used to reading technical histories and I think the facts are all here. But compared to the best of the genre, this one could have used better editing for a more sensible and engaging story.

This book is the longest in my collection but it is the least informative. The first 100 pages or so deride the current efforts of public schools, yet offer little advice except &quot;turn off the television&quot; and &quot;read to your children&quot;. The most interesting and helpful information in the book was taken directly from the Core Curriculum Series, which is a useful resource for parents who want to ensure that their child is receiving a good education. This book is preachy and redundant."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in the education movement. However, after such reports as &quot;Why Johnny can't read&quot; and a plethora of other well documented works, many have come to the conclusion that the public schools are not working and are beyond help; therefore, a work of this nature is wasted upon that system. This book's value lies in providing the objective research that supports a structured curriculum based educational system for those who have jetisoned the public schools as a failed and irrepairable system and now or in the future will home school thier children. However, within the home school movement there is a very small but vocal group that call themselves &quot;unschoolers&quot;. They adhere to the philosophy that the child will learn whatever he needs just by allowing the child to select his own curriculum content. Bennett, in this work, lays the coup de grace at the root of that theory, and I hope for ever more settles the issue of whether the &quot;unschooling&quot; mindset is a viable alternative to a curriculum directed home school."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"Received in ok time.

A few marks on the cover but they did wipe off."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book is subversive in today's American culture. It teaches the traditional knowledge and values of Western Civilization. If you read this book and use it with your children, they will be immune to the propaganda of the usual American public school education and will have many problems with their teachers in school - at best they will only be bored, at worst they will end up diagnosed ADHD, on Ritalin and in special education classes at which time they will be throwaway students. Public school education today is all about ecology, multiculturalism and one world government. The 3 R's and individuality are not emphasized in government schools. Be prepared to homeschool your kids all the way thru school if you teach them anything from this book."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"'Parental involvement' is the core of Bennett et al.'s proposed solution to the problems arising from the neosocialist take-over of education which has focused teachers' attention obsessively on minorities. With a remorseless insistence that only 664 pages can supply, the authors set out a programme of parental activism so daunting that no ambitious parent could complain that the authors' inspiration ever failed. No advice for parents and children is too trite to be abjured by the authors:&quot;Every morning you must send him off to school with a good night's sleep, a decent breakfast and a positive attitude towards learning.&quot; &quot;Good penmanship requires discipline. . .we urge you to work on neatness and legibility with your child at home.&quot; &quot;Call out vocabulary words, spelling words, or math facts to your child.&quot;Children and their teachers must be constantly monitored, hectored, rewarded and punished - the children by TV-deprivation and school principals by protests and demonstrations from angry parents. Repeatedly, ambitious parents are advised to 'spend a few minutes each day' reading to their child, listening to their child, talking with their child, improving diction, visiting public libraries, mastering computing, going out on the Net, revising drafts of the child's homework, sitting in on classes, harrying teachers, writing to the school principal or organizing parent groups. Altogether, the book offers some 1,000 advices to anxious parents as to how to fill gaps in their days, and some 500 ways of detecting failures in their children's schools. The &quot;minutes&quot; add up to a massive investment: apparently not a single day can develop under its own logic or with much input from the child.'The Educated Child' offers a plausible, if undocumented critique of America's educational problems; and plenty of improving ideas which will look reasonable so long as the parent does not move from the armchair to attempt to implement more than one or two of them. What is missing is any hard core of realism, and in particular any mention of IQ. By all means, the authors occasionally favour matching education to children's &quot;abilities&quot; so as to supply sufficient challenge and encouragement to all; and they correctly dismiss as hooey the unsubstantiated opinion of Harvard University's Howard Gardner that there are lots of different types of intelligence (a dogma allowing teachers to maintain a febrile optimism that every child is a genius at something). Yet school tracking is buried among endless tips for what worried parents should do around the house; and Bennett et al. cannot bring themselves to mention human psychology's best-known and most researched variable which alone might provide a fair and sensible way of assigning children to different school tracks."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book is advocating an elitist and pointless view of education. Bennett, has missed the core issues of what it means to be an educated person, especially in our every widening (global) society. Bennett advocates a people who are full of facts and \\"trivia\\" knowledge rather than pushing students to be critical thinkers who can solve problems, read with intelligence, and interact with the world from a stance of tolerance and intelligence. There is no \\"yard stick\\" that can measure intelligence. What rubbish. This book is designed to shame parents rather then educate anyone.

Bennett, et al,Free Press, New York, 1999The book is full of credible statements, but will make no difference.In at least one area, the authors have compounded an omission into a recipe.To summarize the last statement of their list to reform schools: Expect more get more. This will work for a small portion of students only!The authors omitted a consideration of what learners think. In the 1960's Benjamin Bloom stated that schools ask little which young people are incapable of doing. To do well in them, students who are consistent and meticulous in doing homework will almost always pass. But, the others! A study of any student body will discover four genre of young people: those who can and do (quick-willing), those who can and won't (quick-unwilling); those who can't and try (slow-willing); and those who can't and don't (slow-unwilling). The students who are unwilling are youngsters at risk. They have their own attitude and behavior codes, which include making a joke of the institution which denigrates them. Interpretation of National Assessment of Educational Progress reports will show that over half our teens seriously fall in this group. The willing will always pass state criteria. The unwilling will seldom pass state criteria. They will not work for the highest possible mark. Failing will not be a threat to them. Remediation will have little effect on them.With higher standards, this failing group will become more alienated and its numbers are likely to grow. Our states with highly structured state demands are usually in mid SAT performance, in spite of the extra money they spend per pupil. Curiously, each educator from those states believes that his or her school is above average or believes in some rationalization on why it is not!Raising our national average literacy will include appropriately addressing the issue of at-risk students. It is they who resist literacy; they who resist becoming a part of culture; they who are at odds with home, school, society, and clergy. They come from all environments; not necessarily from non-caring parents. They follow their group codes rather than those pf parents, teachers, or clergy. As the numbers of this group lessen, the numbers who are functionally literate will increase.We have the capacity to identify our at-risk youngsters by Grade Two and salvage them by Grade Eight. But not by using criteria from this book."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"As a mother of three -- one in public school, one in private and one home-schooled -- I am deeply concerned about my children's education. I've lost count of the number of books I've read in the past 16 years on educating children. Some books were worth my time, many were not. Mr. Bennett's book is standing tall at the top of my list of &quot;best reads&quot;. I'm sure we all have horror stories coming out of our kids' education (i.e., the huge amount of wasted time in the classroom, the lack of control in the class, the political correctness of revisionist history), but this book really can help. Mr. Bennett begins by explaining the importance of a solid education that engages a child's imagination by first making sure that child can read well. He builds on that by reminding parents that the main responsibility for educating our kids rests on our shoulders, not the school's. The book goes into detail about more than the Three R's, but covers those subjects extremely well, also. He reminds us that as parents it's up to us to speak up and go to bat for our kids throughout their education thus insuring they get the help they need. Throughout the book are checklists, questions to ask your child's teachers, book lists for you to insure that your child reads what is truly worthy of his time, and tips for incorporating the arts into your child's life. This book is like having a one-on-one conversation with a great educator who will give you the confidence you need to take control of your child's education. Help your child succeed by reading this book and then putting it into practice!"},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"Bennett, Finn &amp; Cribb provide for all parents what parents of special needs children have had for a long time - an individualized education plan, a guide for what their children need to learn and a yardstick to measure the school's performance. Since my children are in 3rd and 5th grade, I immediately went to those sections to see how we were doing in our tiny four school district, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that we do well here, but could do better. I found their treatment of issues such as learning disabilty, ADHD and giftedness to be even handed and practical. By using this text as a guide parents (and hopefully school boards and principals) will be less inclined to jump on the latest educational bandwagon, and will instead stay focused on what needs to be done. The chapter on &quot;Temptation and Troubles&quot;, dealing with the influences of TV, internet and sexual education is excellent, and the advice here will certainly be distributed in my practice as a child Psychologist.

In prose free of academic rhetoric, the authors state: &quot;[I]f your school is inflicting a mediocre education on your child, the sooner you know about it the better.&quot; They then present a &quot;yardstick&quot; by which to judge the academic quality of any school (public or private). A model core curriculum organized by grade level--primary (K-3), intermediate (4-6), and junior high (7 and 8)--presents the material clearly and logically, and helps readers assess whether a child is getting a thorough dose of English, history and geography, the arts, math and science. While blunt in their criticism of decaying academic standards (evident in grade inflation, lowered expectations for students and terrible international rankings), the authors are unequivocal in their support of dedicated educators and all those willing to hold children to the highest possible standard. Parents may question some of the model curriculum's expectations (e.g., that second graders dramatize the death of Socrates), but the authors are quick to reassure readers that the book's purpose is not to serve as a list of must-haves but rather as &quot;inspiration and general guidance&quot; in gaining a sense of &quot;the knowledge and skills that should lie at the heart of a solid elementary education.&quot; Bennett is a controversial figure because of his passionate cultural conservatism. But this book, despite a brief word in favor of school vouchers, is about padagogy, not politics. It's an ambitious and commonsensical guide that will inspire both parents and educators. 100,000 first printing; 25-city radio satellite tour. (Nov.)

Even though I consider myself somewhat experienced in the first three to four years of school (due to the volume of children I have), I found that this book provided me with new insight and reinforced my desire to help my children develop a love for learning.

I am a teacher and a parent, and am highly recommending it to every person I come in contact with. It outlines what each grade level's expectations should be, and how to spot good education, spotty education and poor education. This man is a breath of fresh air to the education world. I wish I could take all of this information and place it in each parent's head.One thing I particularly admire about Dr. Bennett's writing is that it is easy to read and reference. He speaks plainly and simply while making huge statements (ex. &quot;There is right and wrong and it is our job to teach children to choose right&quot;--what a concept lacking in our schools!)Another thing I admire about this book is that it is not politically motivated. He does have some opinions in the last chapter of this book, but over all, he points out that we are to raise and teach moral, virtuous children that sometimes &quot;make their brain sweat&quot; while working out problems. (My daughter really likes to tell me her brain is sweating, so she must be doing a great job).Another thing I admire about this book is that it is his feeling that if children were taught pride in themselves as Americans, we would see children turning away from drugs, because to support drug dealers is to support enemies of the United States.If you have a child in your family or are a teacher or student teacher, I cannot rate this book high enough.

To conclude, there are several chapters that deal with problems that one may encounter such as difficulties with homework or teachers and some ideas on how to solve them.

It provides a how-to-do-it guide for getting your children successfully through the current U.S. educational system, properly prepared for high school and beyond. What greater gift can a parent offer ! You'll discover what a &quot;well educated&quot; child should know, what our responsibilities as parents are, and covers the major current issues in our education system. It not only covers academics, but also all of the other factors that can affect a child's ability to learn. Mr. Bennett even gives us a yardstick to judge the quality of education provided by any school. His purpose is to help parents get a good education for their children from early childhood through the 8th grade. I believe that he truly achieves that goal. He points out what we as parents should stand for in the school system and what we should not stand for. The author points out that the parent is the child's most important teacher, and the problems with delegating educational responsibilities to others. The parent must instill the highest ideals in their children, and a strong sense of responsibilty to really succeed in school and in life. He provides us with the rules for us to establish for our children, to help them gain the most from their schooling, and how to direct them so they know how to properly conduct themselves. Mr. Bennett emphasizes that elementary school has a far greater impact on our children, than higher education, and notes that &quot;we ask elementary schools to help shape our students' first and lasting ideas about themselves, their country, and the world.&quot; He notes that &quot;reading is the heart and soul of elementary education.&quot; He feels that educators today tend to emphasize that students need to &quot;learn how to learn,&quot; and remain vague about what they should learn. The unruly atmosphere of our schools is addressed. He also covers the issues of teachers feeling that they work with very little help from parents. The basics of what makes good students and good schools is clearly spelled out for parents, and presents his &quot;Ten Principles For Parents Of Educated Children.&quot; This books is a MUST READ, if you really want to help your children succeed, not just with lip service, but it provides all the facts you'll need, if you just expend a little effort.

This book has been very helpful in allowing our family to gage where our 2 1/2 year old is developmentally. My daughter has known her primary colors and ABC's since she was 18 months old. As a parent, I want to understand what a solid based curriculum should 'look like'. We do not want our children to be 'bored' in school and Bennett provides a wonderful checklist of what a preschooler should know. He also outlines what we as parents can do with our children to foster their growth.Our primary role as parents should be to nurture and teach our children. Too many parents today want their children to be taught by strangers and they want as 'little' involvement in their education as possible. Shame on them! The greatest gift in life is having children --- Our main purpose as parents is to foster their love of learning and teach them to be moral and upright citizens.In our home, we have NEVER pushed our daughter to 'learn' her ABC's or 'learn' her colors. As an infant, I read to her and drew the letters on a Magna Doodle. After a few months of this, she was able to recognize her letters and colors.Learning can be fun and creative.

She is attending second grade in a public school now, and this book serves as reference to what she should be familiar with by now. I like the separation of Social Studies into History and Geography, which this book does. And I am a stickler to the idea of a solid traditional education foundation. Since we do not have the means to send her to a private school and ruled out homeschooling as an option, the next best thing was in-home academic enrichment or \\"after-schooling\\". This book would actually work for both home- and after-schooling parents.The book gives book lists for each grade level and shows what your child should be able to do academically as well in reading, writing, math, science, etc. It is the academic version of \\"What to expect when you (are expecting, have a toddler, preschooler, etc)\\" book series by Heidi Murkoff , where certain milestones are written down in order to compare your child's progress with them.I also like the fact that this book emphasizes teaching values as well as academics.At the time when our children are trained rather than taught at schools, when a lot of educational fads and bureaucracy has plagued our schools, this book serves as checklist to make sure your child gains timeless knowledge that will give him a solid start to a lifetime of true learning and a broad worldview.

I read it cover to cover and found this depressing rather than empowering. If you are not aware of the problems of public schools then this is a good book to read to learn of the issues. I wish all parents who utilize the public school system were concerned enough about their children's education to read a book about the subject.This book is intended to fill parents in on what the authors think kids today should be learning in public school. Then there is a comparison and complaint as to what is really going on. There is not much in the current state of the American public education system these authors like. Poor SAT scores and other standardized tests are cited as proof of a failing system. There is no negative discussion of the pitfalls and problems with standardized tests despite there being lots of information on this subject in other places-standardized tests are held in high esteem by these authors as proof that learning has taken place.This book fully outlines all the things the authors feel are problems in the schools, from what they call \\"bad teachers\\" to what make up \\"bad schools\\" and their opinions about bad methods of teaching and curriculum. The author's conservative views and anti-multiculturalism views are very clear. The authors want to go back to basics and feel that rote memorization and drill are not only vital to a good education but character building. One thing that I am still wondering after reading this book is, back in \\"the good old days\\" of learning the basics by rote memorization and drill, do we have any statistics such as test scores or graduation rates to prove those methods actually work? I believe the answer is that standardized tests were not being done \`back then' and that we know graduation rates from high school were very low although that is never discussed in this book. They don't compare apples to apples here in that regard. They are quick to cite research where it fits their agenda, such as trying to prove \\"the new math\\" has resulted in lower math standardized test scores. They never translate for us parents what \\"the new math\\" is or when it came into existence. They reference bad curriculum such as \`discovery' methods of teaching math and science but don't get into enough detail so we can form our own opinions. This is very much about the author's opinions and directly trying to impose their views on the parent. It is not about offering options or remaining neutral with regard to opinion and letting the reader come to their own conclusions.The authors prod and prod the parents to monitor what is going on in the schools, to go to the classrooms to see what is going on. They urge parents to \\"get involved\\". They say parents should investigate teachers and make sure their child gets in the classroom of the \\"good teachers\\". When they are done saying parents should harangue the administrators, later contradict themselves and say to not prod the administrators too much to change classes, etc. and to not cause the administrators too much trouble. They also acknowledge that if all the kids were with the \\"good\\" teachers no one would be with the \\"bad\\" teachers. How about that for depressing? Also they take teachers out of some of the blame game when they say that poor discipline due to lack of good parenting is the cause of some of the problems in school. As you may have guessed this book does a lot of finger pointing and plays the blame game.Something else the authors seem to neglect mentioning is that what goes on in one class vs. another class in same grade of same school can be very different. Right now I know of classes where one teacher is using drill and another is using puppets and songs to teach the letters of the alphabet, both Kindergarten classes in the same school. How can we label what is a \\"bad school\\" when there is so much inconsistency? Furthermore, they like to label \\"bad school\\"---tell me this, if the grade is \\"bad\\" in reading but \\"good\\" in math, does that make a good school or a bad school? If one grade is \\"good\\" but another \\"bad\\" how do we label that school?The authors give a skimming of what should be covered in each grade. This is not original material, it is acknowledged as being from the books of E.D. Hirsh, the core curriculum books \\"What Your X Grader Should Know\\". They say over and over to go to those references for more detailed and complete outlines of what each child should learn in each grade. Then what bothers me is they say there is a 3-year leeway there, that what is recommended for 3rd grade may be covered in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. How is a parent to keep up with every grade that Hirsh recommends with this 3-year leeway? I also have a personal problem of so much labeling of opinion of what every person should know. There is no room left for the child to spend more time in their own studies. For example they feel all 1st grades should know Aesop's Fables but what about if the child is a dinosaur buff and is read adult level books on dinosaurs? The authors complain of a lack of teaching history in chronological order and ask the parents to somehow add in this curriculum at home. Seems like overkill to me, to do an entire chronological history at home plus do different segments of history and social studies at school.And if the school is a \\"bad school\\" they say to either use their \\"free choice\\" to change schools. There is no voucher system in America! There is no free choice to select the public school of choice! They recommend private schools but caution that not all of them are good plus they seem not to realize that many people can't afford private schools. They suggest moving as an option to get into a different public school."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book helps us parents to make sure our children know what they need to know.

The ideas are proven, common sense, and based on firm empirical research. I didn't find them rigid at all. Compare the learning experience in your children's schools to what you read in this book. Hopefully, your childen are experiencing a quality educational experience.Luckily, the portrait of a good school vividly describes the elementary school my seven-year old child attends Cedar Ridge).

The earliest years of life are the most important. That's when you need to work on vocabulary, thinking, reading, learning, etc.Despite the fact that William Bennett is a social conservative, I found nothing obviously conservative about this book. The materials in the book are well respected, practical, and accurate. Use these guidelines to make sure your children learn what they should.Some activist types might consider some of the study topics liberal or conservative, such as civil rights and the classics, respectively. But I see them as simply what our children need to know. I really don't see anything political about this book. I suspect that the meat of this book really comes from the work of other education experts, with Bennett the visionary to bring this core knowledge to the public through mass publication. After all, he was the Secretary of Education, a position of leadership.I praise Mr. Bennett and his colleague for putting together an outstanding book grounded in excellent education fundamentals.I also recommend the excellent books by E.

I like to see large crowds at school board meetings. This book is a valuable guide for parents of children up to 8th grade. Bennett stresses parental involvement. Parents should get to know their childrens' teachers and inquire about the content of the curriculum. Much of the book sets forth what children should learn in each subject area in each grade level. I found the chapter on social studies particularly interesting because that is the subject area where &quot;multiculturalism&quot; and revisionism can most water down the curriculum. Clearly, we should not white wash warts in our past, but we should teach history in a positive manner, while recognizing that no culture, including ours, has a perfect past. We should teach our commonality as citizens without over empahsizing our differences. Parents should know what is being taught in schools and, where children are not being taught what children should know, the parents should be active in correcting the matter.Bennett points out that the home, as well as the school, should be a center of learning. He gives examples of activities that parents can do with children to increase their learning. He also discusses dealing with difficulties that may arise in schools, such as disciplinary problems, etc. This book also discusses innovative and controversial issues such as charter schools, home schooling, how religion should be addressed in our schools, etc. I highly recommend this book and hope that it will spur parents on to close involvemet with their children's education."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"I particularly like the checklists of what subjects are appropriate and customary at the various grade levels.

If you are interested in your kids' education then you should be interested in this book."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book provides a good overview of what children should learn year by year, subject by subject, and how parents can help them achieve their educational goals. One reviewer complained that the authors overemphasized the importance of limiting T.V., and reading to kids, but I am a teacher and can tell you that many parents don't bother to take those basic but crucial steps with their kids. The authors offer a good analysis of the problems with public education today (which both parents and schools can contribute to), but their main solution to the problems of the educational system is standardized testing. As a teacher in Texas, where high-stakes testing rules the public school system, I have learned that placing such overwhelming emphasis on an annual test does not raise the standards of students' educations; it has actually caused too many schools to teach to the test, cheat, and neglect the needs of gifted students in order to prep the slower ones for the tests."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"Mr. Bennett and company provide parents with practical ways for parents to be involved with their child's education. They advocate that parents actually take a close look at our children's schools and assess what is being taught. Stress is placed on classical education and the benefits it entails. They provide CORE curriculm examples of what children should be learning grade by grade beginning with Kindergarten and up to Grade 8. There is also an excellent chapter devoted to preschoolers. An excellent reference."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This awsome, well written book is helping me learn how to fill in the gaps concerning my Son's &quot;easy as pie&quot; ciriculum his school offers. I am very worried that he is in a school that lets kids slide through elementary then when high school time gets here reality will hit. Instead of &quot;rocking the boat&quot; so to speak I have decided to suplement his education at home using this book as the essential tool. I am so happy that it goes into depth for preschoolers too since I am also a mom of a one year old daughter. You get so much for your money with this book, it is huge! The reading lists alone are worth the price of admission, you will never be guessing about what your children need to know at what age! Every educational topic for children preschool-eight grade is covered!"},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book is so good I can't do it justice! As a teacher, I wish all my students' parents had read this. As a parent, I feel confident about the decisions I've made and will make, knowing I have informed, sound advice from such a worthy author. So many problems in education would be solved by teachers and parents reading and implementing what the authors recommend. This book helps parents understand what they should do and why to insure their child has the opportunity to get an excellent education. Money, or the lack thereof, is no excuse for ignorance. This is America and every child is offered a decent education until they are 18, unlike most countries. It is the responsibility of the child to work and earn an education and the parents to monitor them. Among other things, there are great suggestions about TV, not overwhelming your child with toys, specific books for your child, extensive resources for a wide variety of parenting needs, including homeschool, and even tips to help evaluate \\"expert opinions\\" and school curriculum. Parents should teach manners at home, self-esteem comes from accomplishing something worthwhile, and if schools spend time teaching those, it takes away time that should be spent teaching academic subjects. These ideas seem like common sense, but popular culture has introduced some bizarre and counterproductive ideas on child-rearing and education in the past 20 years. The tone of the book is empowering, not judgmental, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is involved in educating a child."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"The authors make the case for parent involvement by providing a clear picture of America's public school system. Without providing a blanket criticism of all schools and teachers, parents are reminded that only they can make sure their children receive the education they need to become successful citizens. By listing curriculum objectives by grade level they empower parents to ask questions about what their child is learning. Suggestions for working within the system - and within the family to supplement the system - are provided. Every parent should be this involved."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"This book is an outstanding treatise on what is so often lacking in today's classrooms. I especially like that Bennett emphasizes the role parents play in ensuring a good education for their children, not only in working with the teachers, principals, and school boards, but in supplementing their children's school lessons at home. My only criticism is that this book only goes throught eighth grade - I would like one through twelfth grade."},{"Title":"The Educated Child : A Parents Guide From Preschool Through Eighth Grade","review":"My child is only in kindergarten, but I am already using this book faithfully. The Educated Child helps you determine where your child is versus where he or she needs to be in terms of his/her education. The book offers advice on books that children in certain age groups should read-- I like this especially-- and characters he or she should be familiar with. The Educated Child breaks down what children should be learning in the lower, middle, and upper grades in English, Math, Science, even Arts and Music. It even has a pre-school section. It is a great resource for parents."},{"Title":"With Cochrane the Dauntless","review":"A reasonable read. Good story line although I expected it to be about captain cochrane himself. Worth a look at."},{"Title":"With Cochrane the Dauntless","review":"Historically, this novel was reasonably accurate. A little double checking satisfied me that it was so. The jingo was a little stilted, but this is late 19th century literature. Otherwise, the story line and character development are just fine. Henty is obviously not a Conrad, Maugham, or Dickens, but whether you slot him in two or three pegs below those guys, or lower, even, he's still a decent read and for zero dollars. I've read my 4th Henty, and I'd say the same about each.Ciao----->dv"},{"Title":"CORN-FARM BOY","review":"This is a wonderful book about farm life in the 1950's, written from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, called here Dick. He does all the things farm kids did in those days. He fakes sickness so he can be home when the new tractor drives in the lane, rides the cows, makes pets of everything, falls in the creek. His dad farms on the contour and the neighbors think he is crazy. Lois was in the habit of visiting the homes of children in whatever part of the country she wrote about, got to know the kids by staying with them a spell, and then wrote about them. I highly recommend all the Lois Lenski regional books."},{"Title":"CORN-FARM BOY","review":"I have always enjoyed reading any book by Lois Lenski and this one was no exception. Although they do not depict life in this age, they are realistic in the day they were written. So, if you want to know how life was in the 50's this book is real to that life."},{"Title":"Using Paradox 7 for Windows 95 (Special Edition Using)","review":"After several months of searching, as this book was already out of print, I finally located a used copy and it turned into the best buy for me in a long time. With an extensive index and related subject references at the end of each chapter, navigating the book is easy. It's size is enough to make most readers weak in the knees, but if it's treated more as a reference book to be used as the situation arises, you'll soon reserve a place of honor on the desk for easy reach. Most of the instructions are easy to understand, even for beginners like myself. There are some areas I've avoided for when I feel more comfortable, but that is a very small portion of the book. I do sometimes wish the examples were a little less basic to help take the reader beyond the very simplest concepts of database management. But, then again that's what really makes this book so helpful in the first place. After two years of regular use, I still refer to it for a refresher."},{"Title":"Joey Runs away","review":"A Scholastic Video, \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\", introduced us to Joey and his mom and we liked the story so much that we decided that we must have the book.We searched for it on Amazon but have found that it is not currently in print.

Briefly, it deals with the efforts the last humans and their alien allies to rebuild human civilization after its destruction in 1973 by the detonation of a thorium bomb. This bomb destroyed all human, and most animal life, on the planet. The only reason that Denis Grafton and his friends survived was that they were abducted by the alien Vulcanoids prior to the accidental extermination. They were returned to the Earth to serve as test animals to see if the atmosphere was still capable of supporting life.This story takes place after the defeat of the Vulcanoids. In 1980 a new threat appears in the form of the runaway, previously invisible, planet of Varang-Varang. The earth men and their Virian and Nagani friends must contend with both the legendary Beast Men as well as the mysterious Wise Ones. The story has some original aspects dealing with the mysteries of space-time and takes a somewhat metaphysical turn by the end.The style of the book is that of a journal kept by the chief character- somewhat along the lines of Robinson Crusoe."},{"Title":"Wynken, Blynken and Nod and Other Nursery Rhymes (A Hale Giant Book)","review":"I was so thrilled to find this children's poem still available.

She follows behind some of the great romance writers, such as Donna Hill and Francis Ray who have embarked on the arena of mainstream fiction.Brenda seems to have choosen something that is quite fitting for her, and that is a book about &quot;Family&quot;. Yes, this debut book called A Family Reunion revolves around The Bennett Family. I think most of us who have ever attended a family reunion or more or less apart of a family period will be able to relate to this book. You know in any given family there always seems to be secrets and revelations that occur during family crises. Well this book does not fall short of that, it has all those components and even a few surprises and moments of tears too!In any book you read there are major characters to a story, well this one is no different: There's Poppa Ethan, the grandfather, and four cousins who of course grew up together, Taye, Michael, Alexia and Rae'jean. Now there are many supporting characters that add to this story which of course makes it an outstanding book to read.After many years from Grandma Bennett passing, Poppa Ethan wants to have this family reunion, which he allows his cousin to plan and get it all together. Now, Poppa Ethan is close to 90 years old but his memory is definetly in tack and he is not short on his stern words either!! What I found so enjoying about this book, I could relate to it and actually recognized some of my own family members. So is this a book you can relate to? Yes. Is this a book that is an easy read that will keep you up all night? Yes. Do I recommend this a book to read? Yes!!! Does it have sizzling love scenes? Oh, my, my...yes it does!!!Now, some may think that it is quite a transition for an author who has written 8 romance novels and single stories for 3 novellas. No, it seems it has not been a hard task for Brenda Jackson. Actually she seems to demonstrate in her writing of this book that she is able to be like a master chef. She has managed to mix and blend both fiction and romance in this debut book and come out with a tasty treat. Oh yeah, to Brenda Jackson's most loyal followers of her romance books, she has not disappointed you by no means. This book, although it is her first women's fiction has all the components of sizzling love scenes. Actually I think they are hotter in this book than her romance books. Now figure that one out??Again, to my namesake and friend...you done good girl! And by the way, I am very proud of you!!

She seemed to pour love, adoration, and respect into this family. Now here she comes with her debut Mainstream book A FAMILY REUNION. They call the book mainstream, but I really didn't seem to see a big difference except this book was longer. Ms. Jackson just continues to prove to the world that she is a wonderful writer. She tells a story so true to life that we can't help but relate with her characters and put actual faces to them. This book drew me in and I didn't want to put the book down until I was done. I started reading this book with the expectation that it was going to be a good book. Why? Because it is written by Brenda Jackson of course.A FAMILY REUNION is a not a tale, but reality. It speaks on families and how the people in them relate to each other. While reading, I couldn't help but reflect on situations within my own family. The way the grandfather knew the children so well. The four cousins who are the focus of this story remind me so much of myself and several of my own cousins. Rae'jean, Taye, Alexia and Michael were all wonderful characters. Grandpa Ethan was the bomb! He reminded me of my own grandfather. I loved the way Alexia gave her grandparents the praise they deserved when she won her award. They were the driving force for her to keep singing. I no longer have any grandparents, I lost my last grandmother in March of this year. I will never forget all those lessons taught to me by her and my other grandparents. I also believe that scripture that states &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it.If you have not purchased this book, please do so, you will not be disappointed. I am not sure what my favorite Brenda Jackson book is because I love them all. I will say: Eternally Yours, Cupids Bow (A Valentine Kiss Anthology) are right at the top.Great Job Ms. Brenda!!!"},{"Title":"A Family Reunion","review":"Brenda Jackson must dream in color. This book is a must read. I simply did not want to put it down. It is in paperback and the price is low, but the quality of her story telling skills is priceless. I was transported to a time in my own life by being able to relate to her very vivid way of setting the stage. Ms. Jackson has an excellent eye for details and illustrations. I felt as if I were there with the Bennett family.I personally enjoy a book with characters that I can relate to. I think most readers will be able to put himself in the shoes of either Taye, Michael, Alexia, Raejean, Idella or Poppa Ethan...OR know someone else who fits their shoes. Ms. Jackson really knows how to turn up the heat on the steamy love scenes. She knows TRUE PASSION and ROMANCE.Can you imagine a family reunion where the relatives have not all been together in fifteen years? Well that within itself makes for a lot of adventure. All families have secrets, rivalries, love/hate relationships, success, failure, tears, laughter, faith and hope. The Bennetts are no different as you will see once you purchase this awesome book. It is an easy read. You will laugh and cry. But most of all you will never forget this incredible family.

As I read this book, I thought of my famiy and wished I have such close relatives. Being an only child and having a small family I was able to identify with Rae'jean and Alexia. However I also wished that I had a grandfather like Grandpa Ethans and/or Uncle Henry. I really enjoy sitting around elderly people. so much wisdom from the heart is usually given in a loving manner.Everything seems so real and touchable with the way the scenes are painted in each chapter. Its not reading a book, it living the reunion in your mind and are apart of this family reuion. The people potrayed in Mrs Jacksons' books always has a sense of family and pride with love stirred in and this book is no different.It was so wonderful to see the cousins (Rae'jean, Alexia and Taye) reunited, but most importantly see Brandy become a family oriented cousin.I enjoyed the way Michael was man enough to know what he wanted and willing to fight to the end for what he deserved. I commend you Michael. There is a Victor Sr, Victor Jr, Otha Mae, Sophie, and Valerie in every family. But you know what? Without the people in the family to keep things going, we wouldnt have the livihood in one's famiy..... LOL LOL ... I have them in my family.I could not and have not been without this book in my possession since purchasing it. Mrs Jackson, you have done an excellent job again..Much love to you and your family for sharing you with your fans.God Bless"},{"Title":"A Family Reunion","review":"Brenda Jackson has captured a real Family. Grandma Idella and Grandpa Ethan have instilled in the Young Bennett clan some sound morals and ethics. You have to be strong to be a Bennett. Even though everyone has to feel some pain, be it a bad marriage or not knowing who your father is or maybe you are Victor Jr, who is a womanizer and a cheat, but hey some things are genetic and we don't choose what genes we get. Alexia is a ugly duckling as a child, but grows into a swan as a woman and no one can deny her that, but the bruises inflicted as a child have a way of leaving a scar that is carried into adulthood. Taye is the smart one with an overprotected &quot;BIBLE-TOTING&quot; mother, but watch out when the bird leaves the nest, uh oh some lessons learned in adulthood can be a tough lesson to learn for mother as well as daughter. (Mothers remember, apple doesn't fall too far from the tree). Rae'Jean what is the fascination with Dr. Grady?? The Bennett Family is not thrilled to see Rae'jean engaged to a white man, even if he is a doctor,(african americans trip also, when one of their own starts messing outside the culture). Michael is a Bennett, but at 18 finds out some devastating news, he leaves and marries, and has been estranged from the family for many years, but now a widow raising a 13 year old daughter and no love in his life, it is time for him to rekindle his relationship with his family and his suppressed feelings for a innocent love he had as a child. Grandpa Henry and Grandpa Ethan, make all the difference in this family and everyone respects and need them in their lives. Every character in this book has a significant role and you will know them all, the men are just that men, and you either love them or hate them. The women are just that women, you know how old cuzin is or Auntie and you deal with them. Your cuzin who thought she was better than you, at least as children that is what you thought. OH wait, what about the (secrets) oh yaeh, every family has skeletons and the Bennetts are no different. You will love this story, because you will be able to relate to it, even if you have a small family. You will also be able to relate to the relationships in the family, the wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, mistresses, the whole clan. Oh and one last thing, its a little of this and a little of that to keep you turning the page. When Brandi joins forces with her cousins on her wedding day, she definitely secures her future, and I wanted to show up at the wedding and handle Mr. Lorenzo myself and Oh Jolene didn't know her acrobatics would be viewed by all to see...

I loved reading about all the family members' personalities, some of which were very familiar. My favorite part was the reunion itself, when all the main characters were together. There was more fun stuff going on at the end, at the wedding of a cousin; plus a big surprise at a family meeting. After the reunion the story turns to resolving the personal crises of the cousins in romance-novel fashion, with some overly long, somewhat repetitive love scenes. But the general theme running throughout the story is a strong sense of family that can bring tears to one's eyes. It's all about love."},{"Title":"A Family Reunion","review":"This book was food to the heart and soul. It captured the true meaning of family.

Ms. Jackson, I've read ALL of your books and I've enjoyed them, especially reading about the tall, handsome Madaris brothers, but, you really did it with this one. I could'nt put it down because I did'nt want to. I still read certain chapters of the book, it was soooo good. I lost my grandparents almost 20 years ago, and I miss them so much, so I can really relate to Tae, Rae'Jean, and the others the way they missed their grandmother Idella...

Was Brenda writing about my family? So mnay times as I was reading this book, I had to stop and ask my self, is she talking about Cousin So-n-so or Uncle What's-his-name? :)This is a wonderful story of the true love that still exisits in African-American families. The bonds of true love and families are sometimes broken but Mrs. Jackson tells a story of how they can be mended together, to be stronger than ever. I could relate to a good bit that was going on in the book, for I've personally lived it. From Taye, to Alexia, to Rae.......I've been there. I laughed and yes, I cried as well.If you grew up in a loving family, especially with loving grandparents, as I did, this will be a trip down memory lane. Once that you'll truly enjoy. If you haven't gotten the book yet, don't hesitate. BUY IT! NOW! You will not be sorry. I just wish there were more African-American families like the Bennets today.

Can you believe the identity was not discussed for so many years.It was agreed no one was to tell, that is until that night Uncle Victor was caught with his pants down.Was it blackmail or was it just time to tell.

The only question I have is where do you find men like those in Family Reunion? (excluding Victor Senior and Victor Junior). The love scenes I could actually picture as if they were really happening, such an exquisite imagination to be wrote on paper.

MacIntyre provides a new introduction that critically reviews what he sees as the strength and weaknesses of the book. The book itself, however, is unchanged from the 1964 text.Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through. MacIntyre presumes the reader has a basic understanding of the ideas and philosophers he discusses.But for those with adequate background this is a wonderful book, full of many insights. Be warned, though, this book is not a neutral review of the subject matter. In this book MacIntyre lays the groundwork for his own particular version of ethics (developed most fully in After Virtue).Much of the book is dense and part of it is, arguably, poorly written. But it is worth the work needed to get through it."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"I was always in a certain kind of doubt when it was asked of me to recommend one or the other of numerous histories of philosophy. They are not your ordinary texts, which you can browse about in your leasure time. They often require some thinking to really grasp what author had in mind and where does he stand at all. After all history of philosophy is elusive subject even to profficient ones. Looking back, in something less than seven thousand years of culture as we know it (it began with emergence of Summerian epos - Gilgamesh), one finds himself before wast ammount of data, to put it that way. When faced with them, one feels compelled to escape in any direction avaliable to him.But neverthelles, something drives you to continue your studies, to learn and feed upon knowledge of others, to live in times long forgotten and to think an re-think thought again and again. But without that initial spark which puts great flames in motion all would be in vain. MacIntyre book is one that feeds that flame, helping it to grow.If one really wants to understand key questions of ethics and how, at the first place they came to be, one should start with MacIntyre. You won't find your asnwers listed here, rather contrary, MacIntyre, in his almost positivistic scepticism, states many pro et contra arguments for theories presented in his book, that reader finds himself confused on many occasions. But precisely that kind of expose is what drives one to continue searching and to complete questions posed by MAcIntyre. A task that takes whole lifetime and more.In the end I have to mention that ethics described here concernes itself mostly with western ethics and ethical thought. East is left out. For which purpose, I'll let you find for yourself."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"I wonder if the other reviewers who panned this book stuff their own shirts or send them out. I suspect that rather than disliking the book they dislike the message. MacIntyre uses this book to drop the bread crumbs to lead moderns back to the foundation of Western Civilization, which curiously enough takes us back to the beginning. \\"You shall not cease from exploration; and the end of your exploring will be to arrive where you started and to know the place for the first time.\\" MacIntyre is one of those philosophers who holds that there is a real world, that there are right and wrong choices for human beings, that we have screwed up our language and philosophical discourse to the point where they mean nothing and the only answer is to rectify our basic understanding, to recalibrate our thought to reality. I find the author to be difficult because his thought is so loaded with content and one must follow him carefully. DON'T BUY THE KINDLE EDITION YET. THE GREEK TERMS ARE DISTORED BY POOR SCANNING AND THERE ARE NUMBEROUS TYPOS (LIKE LEAVING OUT THE WORD \\"NOT\\" IN A SENTENCE)."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"Alasdair MacIntyre's \\"A Short History of Ethics\\" is an uneven attempt at examining the history of Western culture through the development of ethics. It is quite clear that MacIntyre aims to advance his thesis of the decline of morality and ethical philosophy in the modern era with this short history of ethics. MacIntyre is generally skeptical and critical of most ethical theories, and offers a succinct criticism of most theories immediately after introducing them. While some chapters, like those on Homeric and pre-classical and Hellenistic Greek Philosophy, Christianity, New Values, and Modern Moral philosophy, offer engaging insights, others are redundant and seemingly irrelevant to the advancement of his general thesis. MacIntyre admits in the preface that this book suffers from too many aims. This problem is most troubling when MacIntyre attempts to offer a ~20-page summary of Plato or Aristotle which can neither be expected to inform the advanced reader or to introduce these seminal philosophers to beginning students of philosophy. While there are surely better \\"History of Philosophy\\" and \\"History of Ethics\\" books available, MacIntyre's \\"Short History of Ethics\\" occasionally surprises the reader with insightful criticisms and arguments which make it an uneven if mildly engaging little book on Ethics."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"This is a fine discussion of (western) moral theory and its history up to the early twentieth century. It may not be the best short introduction to the history of ethics, but it is perceptive and serviceable.One reviewer on Amazon comments that MacIntyre's writing is not clear. I found his diction at times quite lucid; however, his style is learned in the early to mid twentieth-century British (Scottish) way. This book is not always an easy read, but it is an informative one. It is good for someone who is interested in the subject, who is looking for an historical introduction, and who is willing to pay careful attention.Part of the reason why it is not an always easy read is related to MacIntyre's rebuttal to A. J. Ayer. MacIntyre, contra Ayer, believes that right understanding of the history of moral theory is not just descriptive rehearsal of what various people thought but involves the participant in the philosophical enterprise itself. Therefore, MacIntyre's history contains philosophical argumentation. It not only reproduces the reasoning process of historical persons but also demonstrates MacIntyre's own evaluation of moral theories.I initially read the first edition, which is essentially identical to the second edition except that the latter contains an updated preface. Otherwise the two editions are the same. The preface in the second edition is essential reading and not to be skipped over. In it MacIntyre addresses weaknesses in four chapters: on Christianity, on the British Eighteenth-Century, on Kant, and on modern moral philosophy.Perhaps most lamentable in the book is that MacIntyre did not correct more thoroughly in his second edition these acknowledged errata (especially that involving Christian ethics) or omissions (such as lack of Jewish and Islamic ethics and more basically ethics of the medieval period). The faulty readings and lacunae appear in both editions. It would have been more helpful to readers if he had made in the text the emendations that he notes in the preface to the second edition.Particularly noteworthy in the book's historical narrative is the keen sensitivity that MacIntyre shows to the bearing of social and community life on ethics. This first appears in his discussion of Greek ethics but extends to his final reflections. Throughout the history of moral theory has been a tension between the embeddedness of ethics within a particular way of life and the tendency to individual choice. This may be viewed as the distinction between our living with, and adopting, a moral vocabulary and framework of ends, rules, virtues, and commitments given to us by the social fabric that we inhabit, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, our choosing \\"both with whom we wish to be morally bound and by what ends, rules, and virtues we wish to be guided\\" (p. 268). The former is focused on the community; the latter, on the individual.MacIntyre does not discuss in depth in this book that the one approach to ethics tends less toward social fragmentation than the other. That is left for his later works."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"MacIntyre has an acute mind and a broad familiarity with the history of moral philosophy. This short volume is an extremely valuable contribution to the field. As someone who has spent much more time on contemporary ethics than the history of ethics, I benefited greatly from his analysis. It has changed the way I see contemporary ethics. I strongly recommend this book to any serious student of ethics.However, I do not recommend this book for beginners or dabblers. If MacIntyre's history, while short, is no introduction to the subject. He expects familiarity with many of the philosophers and much of the terminology mentioned. The value in this short history is not so much in the presentation of each individual philosopher, but in the overall sketch MacIntyre gives us of the changes and developments in ethics over the past 2500 years. MacIntyre makes no pretense of giving us an objective history. It is his bias that makes this book worth reading. I find it persuasive.The major problem with this book, as with all of MacIntyre's books, is that the writing is bad. He's not always very clear; the sentences are sometimes awkward; and, at least in the first edition, mistakes are not uncommon. In short, it's no page-turner, and you have to work to get at the meaning and arguments sometimes. Nevertheless, the depth of the insights far outweighs the weakness of the writing. If you're pretty familiar with the history of ethics and interested in learning more, read this book."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"Professor Alasdair MacIntyre in \\"A Short History of Ethics\\" produced an interesting book covering the long history of moral philosophy. The author provides a historical background and perspective for studying the selected texts on moral philosophy.The book first provides the reader with an account of Greek thought and the philosophical basis of their thinking. The author then proceeds to discuss the history of philosophy to the present day. The reader is then able to appreciate the discussion of moral philosophy in the appropriate historical context.I enjoyed reading the book, although I would not classify it among the best books on the subject. The author seems to assume that the reader has some understanding of philosophy which would make it difficult for those without some understanding of the subject to follow his arguments. However, the book should be of value to people with an interest in moral philosophy."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"The title of the book is misleading. It gives one the impression that AM will gives us a survey of the history of ethical positions. While he does do this to a degree, that is not the point of the book. AM's argument is that key terms in ethics change meaning with the change in language and/or social custom (269). Secondly, key moves in philosophy and social theory change ethical foundations.AM begins with Greek ethics and gives a thorough review of it. Interestingly, AM wrote this book before he endorsed Aristotelian ethics as the way out of the modern morass. He is more critical of Aristotle here than he is in After Virtue.The next key move is Christianity. This section is weak for a number of reasons. AM had not yet converted to Christianity and as a result he depended on much out-of-date and long-refuted German scholarship on Christianity. Secondly, ten pages on Christianity? He tried to summarize Augustine and Aquinas in two paragraphs! That being said, his summary, while too brief, was accurate. Augustine and Aquinas reinterpreted key sections of Plato and Aristotle, respectively, into explicitly Christian categories.But something changed in the history of Christianity. Luther arose. Luther introduced a character that had been absent in ethical discussions: the individual. Luther also introduced new rules for social ethics. Luther bifurcated morality by positing absolute and unconditional ethical commands on the one hand (God says so) with the self-justifying rules of market and state on the other (124). This paved the way for autonomy and secularism.The rest of Western ethics can be seen as a footnote or an outworking to this. With the idea of contract introduced, social ethics now revolved around the tenuous idea of \\"natural rights.\\" Western thinkers could not (still can't!) reconcile an authoritarian state with limits to the state's power. Locke tried and came very close to doing this.Evaluation:The Good: the reader has a good understanding after reading AM. This book's argument is much tighter than that of After Virtue. Also, AM does a superb job in showing (hinting, rather) the inevitability of interpreting ethical norms from within a community. He perfects this move in After Virtue.The Bad: The writing style could be improved. It is like watching an elephant run. I forgot how man times the author used the word \\"just\\" (and not in the sense of justice). Secondly, as he notes in his preface, his section on Christianity is weak. Thirdly, he spends too much time on analysis and too little on exposition. This is okay if the reader already understands the thinker in question. It is annoying if he doesn't.My title might have given the impression of a negative review of the book. Far from it. Alasdair MacIntyre is the most important ethicist I have read, and I heartily commend all of his works."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"A classic of MacIntyre, written from his Aristotelian point of view."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"Professor MacIntyre's book is in some respects fine, in other respects terrible. The good thing is that he offers valuable insights and arguments for an historical approach to the analysis of moral judgments. He covers a large area, and has at times pointly summaries. The bad thing is that his text is poorly structured, and at times has a poor content. He frequently announces arguments that he does not work out, and he sets out lines that end in the mist. This fact is the more irritating, because, apart from a the chapter division, the lay-out completely lacks structure. Moreover, he seems rather biassed against (protestant) christian ethics, and tries to understand it apart from a notion so fundamental as creation. As a result, he misses the opportunity to understand both the revelational aspects of creation and the rational aspects of revelation. Not surprisingly, he cannot bridge the gap between rationality and revelation, and he ends up soon with an evaluation that is coloured by words like 'irrational', and 'arbitrary', leaving the reader with a seriously flawed picture of a important factor in contemporary ethics."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"This is a deceptive book.*It promises an outline of the history of Ethics \\"from the Homeric age to the Twentieth Century\\", that is, with a perspective wider than the one usually limited to great \\"canonical\\" philosophers and oriented to a narrow readership.But the result is definitely disappointing.*I really disliked this book, and cannot recommend it.*Before posting this comment, I took time to read observations of other readers, to check if my impression was shared.Most of them complain about very poor style (\\"the book is poorly written\\" - Panjack), \\"poor structure\\" and \\"poor content\\" (J. de Lijster - \\"patchy historical survey\\" - Fiske), excessive focusing (\\"Beginners will find this a difficult book to work through\\" - Panjack), abuse of modern perspective to judge (and not to present in a impartial way) very different attitudes (\\"He frequently announces arguments that he does not work out, and he sets out lines that end in the mist\\" - J. de Lijster) and in the end excessive brevity (\\"He tries to cover too much ground too quickly\\" - Fiske) resulting in approximation and confusion.Given these remarks, it is amazing the average vote is still so high, even taking account of the fame and respect that professor MacIntyre can command by the fame of his other works.*This essay is flawed under all the aspects under which you can look at.*If the style is gray and dull, and certainly not welcoming the reader, the argument has been developed very poorly.I'm still perplexed at how could professor MacIntyre truly believed to be able to reduce about 3.000 years of history of Ethics in about 250 pages!*The most annoying feature is the deceptiveness of the title: the historical and sociological framework is used only when it suits the author, and in a most conventional way.After being presented with a very ordinary opposition between an Homeric aristocratic attitude and the new more \\"democratic\\" posture of the V century b.C, the method is almost totally dropped to return to a dull diachronic presentation of great philosophers (great philosophers and not, alas, relevant themes).*For an introduction to the history of Ethics, as a reader I'd expect to receive at least a definition of the relevant terms: religion, morality, positive morality, negative morality, ethos, ethics, politics and ethics.But Mr. MacIntyre possibly believes that definition is a waste of time in a historical survey with ensuing confusion.*If definition is not produced, likewise no attempt is done to explain why Ethics emerged for the first time in Greece as a distinct field of philosophical enquiry.*We are spared as well the - historically relevant - analysis of the relationship (and conflict) between religion (Abraham who is required by his God to kill his only son with no apparent reason), aristocratic ethos (the role of feud and honor), negative morality (\\"You shall not...\\" in the Bible), positive morality (\\"Love thy neighbor\\" in the Gospel), politics as a kind of ethics (Plato and Aristotle, but also Socrates who submits to the unjust law that put him to death), political justice vs. religion in relevant moral issues (a theme developed in the Greek classical tragedy - specially in the Oresteia, but also in the Oedipus), the individual and social dimension in ethics (look at the debate on death penalty, for example - or the second amendment of the Constitution), the role of free will (the debate inside Christianity) and the role of man as moral agent and of man as man capable of deciding to act rightly - or to rebel authority.*All these themes are best suited to be expounded with an historical perspective.But in this essay you cannot find anything of this.I finished reading the book with immense melancholy for what it could have been and is not.*Besides, in a academic survey it could be interesting if the author could have taken account of relationship between ethics and other fields: the role of ancient skepticism in the rise of a new conscienze (and interestingly in the new science), Ethics and Logics, but also lesser known fields, like Mathematics and Geometry - the fascination for the geometric method in XVII Century (Hobbes reading Euclid, Spinoza's \\"Ethica more geometrico demonstrata\\", Leibniz's moral calculus, up to Franklin's aborted \\"Art of Virtue\\").*Some remarks of the writer appear surprising - if not ridiculous.The so called notion of the \\"mean\\" in Aristotle was in fact a deep rooted theme in Greek culture and religiosity - and not just \\"the single most difficult concept in the Ethics\\" (pag.65).*In the end this book is a complete bore.It could give testimony of the all-human attempt to investigate on the themes of how to live a meaningful life, how to act responsibly and in the end learn how to confront the idea of death. Ethics, after all, is also the Promethean attempt of man to disenfranchise from oracles, soothsayers and miracles; to reconsider human action in a pervasive all-human logical framework, and, in the end, to vindicate the importance of human dignity.But this book is a patchy collection of second hand ideas, scattered here and there in the usual chronological order.*I prefer posting positive remarks, but in this case it would not be fair to other fellow readers.*I'm used to recommend books I appreciated about the argument I'm reviewing.In this case it is compulsory to mention:- \\"Morality\\" by Bernard Gert, that is until now the best introduction to the argument I had the chance to read.*You are truly welcome if you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!*Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"A Short History of Ethics: A History of Moral Philosophy from the Homeric Age to the Twentieth Century","review":"The book arrived in a VERY timely fashion!!

It's so bad I actually knocked half a point off the book's final rating. DAW, who usually came up with top-notch artists to do Moorcock covers, really dropped the ball in the Runestaff series, and this is the nadir. Cover it, school-textbook style, before reading.That said, the book itself is top-notch, one of the better novels in the whole Eternal Champion cycle. Dorian Hawkmoon, reluctant servant of the Runestaff and another incarnation of the Eternal Champion, is off on the quest to find the last piece of the puzzle he needs to strike back at the Granbretanian army, an artifact called the Sword of the Dawn. Needless to say, getting his hands on it will not be easy...The same cast of characters from the first two novels returns, along with some throwaway characters, a new villain or two, and all the adventure one could possibly want. As well, The Sword of the Dawn is set on a new continent in the purview of the Eternal Champion, Amarehk (yes, it is what you think it is), and Moorcock's descriptions of the city of Nawlin (yes, it's at the delta of the big river) are perhaps the most detailed urban descriptions in the whole series.The novel could probably stand on its own without too much of the ongoing plot being lost, but aspiring Moorcock readers are encouraged to read the whole series (preferably after those of Elric, Corum, and Erekose, at least). ****"},{"Title":"The Sword of Dawn","review":"Michael Moorcock created a whole mess of heroic characters, the most indisputably famous being that moody albino, Elric of Melnibon&eacute;. But there were also Corum and Michael Kane and Jerry Cornelius and a host of others. But above all of them, it was Dorian Hawkmoon von K&ouml;ln whom I liked best. And it's not because he's more heroic or better or whatever. Maybe it boils down to something as simple as that Dorian Hawkmoon isn't as tragic or alienated a creature as the other Eternal Champions. Hawkmoon is just the easiest to like.Hawkmoon's exploits are chronicled in The History of the Runestaff and the Chronicles of Castle Brass, seven books in total. The world he inhabits is a post-apocalyptic Earth set in the far flung future, sometime after the Tragic Millennium. In Hawkmoon's time, depraved sorcery and mad science are at work. Europe is brittle, fragmented into warring kingdoms. The detritus of England has evolved into the island kingdom of Granbretan. Called the Dark Empire, Granbretan, ruled by a foul immortal being, has set its eyes on global conquest. It's making it look easy.In the tiny, faraway province of Kamarg, Count Brass doesn't concern himself much with the insatiable encroachments of the Dark Empire. That is, until he receives a visit from Baron Meliadus, a treacherous emissary from Granbretan. Seeking to worm into Count Brass's good graces and coveting his beautiful daughter Yisselda, the Baron oversteps himself and is unceremoniously ejected from Kamarg. The incensed Meliadus, skulking away, vows bloody vengeance. And he swears this oath on the Runestaff. O crapdiddle.It must be understood that when one makes a vow on the Runestaff - that ancient artifact said to guard all the secrets of destiny - one then sets strange forces into motion. And so, in the course of time, the unwitting players of Meliadus' revenge play are swept away into a terrifying future, signified by blood and death and hellish war and by foulest black magic and twisted technologies. And the young Duke of K&ouml;ln, Dorian Hawkmoon, bedeviled by a black jewel on his skull, and who once rebelled against the Dark Empire, will play a central role.In the 1960s Michael Moorcock became the clear successor to E.R. Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. Moorcock is, honestly, somewhere near the top of my list as a master craftsman of sword and sorcery adventures. In the Runestaff novels, the Englishman's imagination is predictably outlandish and inventive, and his pacing is such on overdrive that you might not even notice that character development hardly ever darkens these pages. Crack these books open and feast your eyes on passages of pure escapism. Moorcock writes some wild images; the landscapes are peopled with marvelously exotic and freakish creatures; the evil empire, with its sinister science and sorcery, seems truly malevolent. And then there are the ghosts and the alternate dimensions. Hawkmoon ends up enduring some really harrowing stuff. Thru the course of four novels, he'll embark on one quest after another, seeking to unearth several peculiar talismans. The Red Amulet. The Sword of the Dawn. And, finally, the destiny-shaping Runestaff itself.So, yeah, crack these books open and see how Hawkmoon's strange cloak of apathy is pierced. Then see Hawkmoon meet his boon companion, Oladahn the tiny giant. See him also cross paths with the enigmatic Warrior in Jet and Gold and the renegade Frenchman Huillam d'Averc, and also see him soar to the skies on the back of a flamingo (although, hmm, that last one does sound a bit foofoo). The Duke of K&ouml;ln's fight against the Dark Empire is chronicled in THE JEWEL IN THE SKULL, THE MAD GOD'S AMULET, THE SWORD OF THE DAWN, and THE RUNESTAFF, and these are the four books which constitute The History of the Runestaff. They're absolute must-reads if you're a fan of sword & sorcery epics, although when I mention \\"epic,\\" I don't mean to imply that these books run at 500 pages each. Back in the day, brevity was the habit and the writer was able to tell a rousing story before your page-flippin' fingers formed calluses. I pretty much hold Stephen King responsible for the likes of Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind.But blood and thunder, I think, sum up the Hawkmoon chronicles. Actually sums up most of Michael Moorcock's works, come to think of it. The biggest difference is that Dorian Hawkmoon comes off as a likable and comparably uncomplicated guy, his baggage not as crippling as Moorcock's other heroes. Sometimes, the sheer angst gets to me. Really, would it hurt Elric or Corum to smile once in a while?"},{"Title":"The Sword of Dawn","review":"Not a lot here to really make this book shine, and a few things that let it down.Very lazy plotting - we just get thrown about here and there. That could be part of the fun, and there is something of the D & D silly campaign where a hundred unlikely events are meant to happen to our intrepid adventurers. Still it gets a bit too silly for me, and I'm getting to not really care that much about the Warrior in Jet and Gold who can just turn up magically along with any era shaping magical item. Same with the deadly foe - far too lazy in just saying, \\"Oh, sure, they all got routed and defeated, um, and a million of them got killed ... but, ah, NOW there's, um TWO MILLION, and the bad guy didn't really die, and they're back!\\". I mean, who cares? Either something magical suddenly shows up that will defeat them all, or, even if you do, suddenly they'll just somehow regroup to be back to threaten again in the next sequel. The heroes are embarrassingly standard in the way they can fight all day hugely outnumbered with dwindling remains of their army being cut down around them, but, of course, not suffer a scratch and have nothing more than a bit of fatigue. Yisselda as heroine becomes utterly clich&eacute;d: here, let me just stand to one side being feminine and either helpless or emotionally/sexually supportive. Oh, and Hawkmoon starts getting all broody - save me from broody heroes! Ugh.I was just about never \`in' the story, I was always outside looking in, and frequently shaking my head at the level of guff.The casual background of atrocities gets a bit sickening after a while, and also feels lazy and contrived, \\"Oh, yeah, THIS guy was so bad, he, um, got people's babies and killed them. (Hang on, I've done that one). And then he ate them! (Oh, done that one too). In front of the mother!!! (Yeah, that'll do).\\" This gets offensive pretty quick, especially when I think it's meant to be, you know, hard core - Moorcock saying his bad guys are, well, really bad - it's spotty nerds who've never punched someone in their life trying to impress each other with fight scenes. The author feels nothing for these throwaway victims, we're not really meant to either, they're just a bit of local colour (cf. the similarly blithe use of comic atrocity in Goodkind's second rate Wizard's First Rule). Thus D'Averc can simply flip from villain to hero because all those people he blithely killed were, remember, only MINOR characters.It's all pretty bleak: I could maybe cope with the lazy plotting if we were having some fun on the way (as Fafard and the Grey Mouser at times do without this oppressive background), but the only hope of the book is the action. It's hard to care about the action when we know the author can and will just randomly pull out something from nowhere with no reference to a wider world (oh, hey, here's an ancient civilisation with vastly superior technological weapons we've stumbled onto. Phew, that was lucky).So, after giving The Jewel in the Skull a bit of a rap I'm not so keen to move onto volume 3 (except to work out whether I should just clear this stuff from my bookshelves altogether).2*"},{"Title":"The Sword of Dawn","review":"Michael Moorcock, The Mad God's Amulet (DAW, 1968)The adventures of Dorian Hawmoon, last duke of Koln, continue in The Mad God's Amulet, the second novel in the Chronicle of the Runestaff. Hawkmoon, with the immediate dangers of the first novel neutralized, wants nothing more than to return to the Kamarg and his friends. Of course, this is fantasy literature, where nothing is simple. He gets sidetracked a couple of times, we spend some more time in the company of the mysterious Warrior in Jet and Gold, things blow up, old enemies return, new enemies crop up, and then there's the Mad God of the title. All of which, of course, happens at the same time that the full might of Granbretan's army marches on the Kamarg, the last European outpost of independence against the depraved King-Emperor Huon.Fun stuff. Very easy reading. All the womderful things I said about the first book still apply. Unfortunately, so do the pervasive typographical errors in the DAW editions.

Lynn Woolley takes the political lingo out and replaces it with everyday words that the average person can read. I think every conservative should read this book.

This book will inspire you to stand up for what is right morally."},{"Title":"Clear Moral Objectives: Perspectives of a Texas Talk Host","review":"Lynn Woolley is a skillfully perceptive writer and talk show host. So it was with confidence that I purchased \\"Clear Moral Objectives.\\" The book does not disappoint. In fact, Woolley has taught me a great deal about the psychobabble of diversity, the manipulation of ethnicity for political advantage, and the abject fear liberals have of moral judgment.America is entering a brave new world where the Internet and talk radio are replacing the often deceitful elite media. And why not? The public will always gravitate to where the talent is.With books like this, we are sure to hear more from Mr. Woolley, perhaps as a syndicated radio host, author, or common sense professional and honest broker of the facts. Without clear moral objectives, how will we as a people know how to teach our children the difference between right and wrong? How will we know how to honor the awesome sacrifices of brave American soldiers past and present? How will we know how to carry the legacy of the Founding Fathers into the future? How will we know how to effectively defend our faith in God?It all comes down to integrity and character. Lynn Woolley has it and tells us how in this awesome book. A must read!"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I would like to touch on a different aspect of this prolific book. Sadly we have been bombarded by the film carrying the same name but which fails to carry the struggle to the viewer. Readers focus on this rebelious, should we baptise it as 'Dionysiac' approach, this mysterious dream we call life, however one should proceed a little bit further. What is not mentioned or hinted in the film is the philosophical approach of the Boss (i.e. Kazantzakis), this the point of the enormous struggle of the spirit against the sensual, to honour the great Cavafy, tendencies of the body. &quot;You think too much&quot; Zorba tells him so often, but who can remove the Bhuddhistic poems from the Boss and expect him to carry on breathing? How can one alter the path of self emancipation when the path is already set, how, is an interesting though long question... &quot;It was too late, too late to change my life...&quot; Kazantzakis reflects, but this is where the truth is somewhat relatively shadowed, who would believe that such a brilliance par excellance was struck by the apparition of a Zorba at such late a time, no, no his path was set, this one may see when he refers to the Great Martyr (Nietzsche) in his Report to Greco; how different their opinions but what respect and emotion for the philosopher, why? For they both represent the same flame in some different manifestation. His love, attraction and withdrawal from Zorba (think of his relationship to the Eagle, Sikelianos) is the bond to the opposite edge, the respect and disguised love for the true enemy.Dedicate time and thoughts to it, as always the Teacher will take you afar..."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Perhaps the finest spiritual book in print, Kazantzakis' _Zorba_the_Greek_ simultaneously praises the spirit and the body, affirming human existence like no other tale around.Alexis Zorba is a hero the likes of which haven't been seen since Odysseus or Sinbad the Sailor. He combines gruff physicality with love of life without falling into the selfish hedonism one might expect. Zorba is indulgent, but never in such a way that his character is destroyed.Zorba incarnates the soul, both for himself and for the reader. The &quot;Zorbatic&quot; theology provides for the world a God and a belief in that God that refuses to deny life, never turning against what it is to live."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"The narrator of this novel is a deep & philosophical thinker much drawn towards Buddhist teachings. He is cerebral and completely intellectual in contrast to his subordinate Zorba. Zorba is a man without much education but he is a man who has touched life in its raw form with an earthly outlook towards life. Zorba has seen wars, been in love with many women, married many times, plays the Santuri and loves to dance. Zorba goes through pain, suffering, hapiness and joy with a hedonistic attitude and exhibits a great love for life. His old age is no detterent to his enjoyment of life. Above all Zorba has an opinion of everything ranging from women, relationships, business, religion, nationalism and politics. All his views are from his own bitter and sweet experiences and some of his views on women & religion can put off many. Zorba does not give importance to morals but he exhibits his compassion in his relationship with the old whore, the widow and workers in the mine. His views on the dangers of nationalism, war and religion are intresting. Overall an excellent book with deep insights, reflection and loads of philosophical discourses. This book is a masterpiece. I wonder why Kazantzakis was never given the Noble Prize. When Albert Camus won the Noble prize by one vote more than Kazantzakis he mentioned that Kazantzakis deserved the honour 'a hundred times more' than himself."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This book is a great introduction to a fantastic author that is often overlooked by American readers. \\"Zorba\\" is fascinating, deep, and hilarious, all at once, and it's short and playful enough such that it won't turn off more casual readers. I recommend this title as a starting point for people who want to read Nikos Kazantzakis for his philosophical insights or for his moving stories."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"My cousin, a hard-boiled attorney in Athens, once told me, \\"You want a good Greek book? Read Zorbas. It says everything, everything.I bought the book and ended every day of my season in Greece by devouring a dozen pages. My cousin was right. This book explores a zillion aspects of human nature, from its best to its worst. Kazantzakis knew that he'd met a live one when he met the real Zorbas (yep, the guy really existed!). And, he was duty-bound to record the life of this odd, passionate guy, whose zest for life and for keeping it real seem uniquely Greek (read the last chapter in Kazantzakis' \\"Report to Greco\\" for more on the real Zorba and why K. was compelled to write about him).Some comments on this page suggest that the reviewers might know very little of the context in which this book was written; the contexts of Kazantzakis, of Crete, of village life in Greece, of Greece's history, of Orthodoxy and nationalism in Greece, of a million things without which this book seems strange, flat, or even cruel. It helps to know Greece, but it isn't necessary to savor this book, which is really a mirror on the best and worst of humankind. Also, it's good to read this book before or during an extended stay in Greece. You'll want to read more Kazantzakis, for he's one of the best ones to have captured the pulse of Hellas."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I read this book with great expectation. I first came across Zorba from Osho. I must say the book does not disappoint. The message of the book is quite clear &quot;be a bit crazy, don't take life too seriously&quot;, And I agree with that completely. Drink, eat and be merry. But the problem with this approach start getting clear as you read, and it is here I think the book or the thought behind the book lacks.How long one can avoid I the question of his own existence, his identity. In this regards I like Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse which I think is an extension of Zorba.Be like Zorba, but be aware the life demands more than.Just add enlightenment to Zorba and you will get what Osho once called &quot;Zorba the Buddha&quot;. That could be the best possible synthesis of a human being. Remember Mr. Zorba we need to have a heart towards other as well. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"There really isn't much of a consensus worldwide about the artistry of Nikos Kazantzakis. It seems that half of the scholarly world finds him to be a genius and the other half a failed genius not worthy of really being remembered. Zorba the Greek was my first time to read anything by him, and for me, he didn't really quite fall into either category. I did find the work brilliant with some excellent writing and a lot to think about, but I have a few drawbacks to buying whole-heartedly into Kazantzakis's philosophy.Zorba the Greek is told by a narrator (Kazantzakis) who does not find satisfying answers to the questions of life in Western thought. He sets out to actually live life while running a mine in Crete. He hires Zorba, and the exuberant Zorba becomes the focus of the story as he teaches the narrator what he knows about life.Zorba the Greek is certainly entertaining, and there are so many wonderful lines and insights. The book teaches to live life as if it were the first day of your life and as if it were the last day of your life. It says that the greatest goal in life would be to attain a Sacred Awe of all life. Of course, the way promoted by Zorba is a type of God-less hedonism which strikes me as pathetically shallow. But considering the whole novel, I would recommend it; I do not have to agree with everything a book says to learn from it. Zorba the Greek is a good work with some simply beautiful and insightful episodes."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"In this beautiful novel, who was later turned into an also beautiful film by Elia Kazan with Anthony Quinn, the narrator is a young, wealthy man who is a shy and sedentary intellectual. Eager to experience some action and practical life, he rents a lignite mine in the island of Crete (around 1914). Before boarding the ship, he meets and older man, a strong and experienced guy who convinces the man to hire him as a cook and foreman. Zorba becomes the manager of the mine and the right hand of the young guy. Soon his personality and manners impress him, his opposite. Zorba lives fully in the present: whatever he does, he gives himself completely to the task at hand, thinking of nothing else. Zorba savours everything that comes his way, be it joy or sorrow, he is not afraid of ridicule or embarrassed at expressing his feelings. All this is revealed to us not through theories or explanations, but little by little as Zorba acts. When they arrive to the small town near the mine, they stay for a few days at an inn-brothel run by an old courtesan, who falls head over heels before the constant and melous courting of the old Greek. The (unnamed) young man is shocked: Zorba is capable of taking to bed and old, wrinkled, and teethless woman!. What's more, Zorba is actually capable of having sex at his advanced age! Zorba plays an ancient string instrument and dances in a frenzy frequently. But he's also a hard worker and comes up with an idea for an additional business to which he dedicates much energy and time. After a few days they move to their shared small cabin, and together they go through many adventures, some funny, some sad, and they face moments of joy, uncertainty, sorrow, and even horror. They come to learn from and love each other, and their friendship becomes solid-rock.Zorba is an unforgettable character, a great literary creation. His spirit is contagious and revealing of our own cowardness and pettiness. But he's much more than a simple Dyonisus. Zorba bears the burden of a deep sorrow, and is haunted by all the people he killed in the Balkan Wars. Even so, he understands it is not worth it to live engaged in sad memories, and that is necessary to live to the fullest, as each person defines it. A great novel."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"One wants to put Zorba in the pantheon of great literary characters, but it's not needed, Zorba has already strode there by himself with giant steps that no one book can contain, joining Huck Finn, Captain Ahab, Don Quixote, Scrooge, Sherlock Holmes and all characters that live beyond the writing. In a wharfside cafe Zorba on first sight asks the bookish narrator, who's trying to crawl out beyond the written page and open a lignite mine, where he's going. The narrator answers \\"Crete\\". Zorba asks \\"taking me with you\\". \\"Why what can I do with you\\", says the narrator. Zorba replies \\"Why!Why! Can't a man do anything without a why? Just like that because he wants to?\\"That's the narrator and reader's introduction to Zorba. Words of brash honesty that define Zorba. A sixty year old wiith the enthusiasm and eyes of a child. He is not full of life, he is life itself, a dynamo full of contradictions, gulping in every breath. In the narrator's words \\"A living heart, a large voracious mouth, a great brute soul, not yet severed from the earth.\\"Every experience and every day is lived as new by Zorba. Drinking wine, Zorba suddenly asks \\"--whatever is this red water--. You drink the red juice and lo and behold your soul grows too big for your carcass, it challanges god to a fight.\\"Zorba lives on after the book is finished, shaming hesitant half steps, as he strides through the mind."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This truly is a wonderful book.

Women in particular may find this book offensive. The three women I know who've tried to read the book have all abandoned it halfway through because they found Zorba so distasteful a character.The narrating \\"Boss\\" is a bookish Englishman who impulsively hires the older Zorba to be his chef, traveling companion, and foreman in a offhanded coal mining venture on Crete. The Macedonian Zorba bursts with life, and is a total hedonist, denying himself no pleasures when they are available, and scorning the existence of a God who would punish him for enjoying life. On the other hand the Boss prefers to experience life through observing the experiences of others such as Zorba. There is something of the voyeur about him, and his past friendships bear hints of homosexuality within them, The mining venture is clearly meant to represent the Boss' desire to tangibly connect with the physical world (as opposed to the world of books, where he feels comfortable), but notably, it is Zorba who really engaged with the mining operation-mirroring his connection to the physical senses and possibilities of life.For a book which at times seems to be a Socratic dialogue on whether to live a free-spirited life or an introspective one, the debate is too one-sided to be truly provoking. Yes, the elderly Zorba does have a lust for life anyone would wish for (one can almost imagine the \\"Carpe Diem\\" tattooed across his broad chest), but his actions leave something to be desired. He admits to having killed and tortured Muslim men in the past (something he is ashamed of), and of abandoning his family. In the course of the book he incites an angry young man to try and burn down a monastery so that none of the monks could escape. He uses the Boss' money to finance a brief spree with a young woman, even though it would bring ruin to the mining operation. Most notable of course is his misogyny. For Zorba, women exist for momentary carnal appreciation and pleasure, and outside of that, solely as subjects for scorn (\\"women are stupid\\" and \\"women are greedy\\" are two sentiments that are often repeated). His attitude toward women may be rooted in time and culture, but that does not make it any more palatable. Indeed, before one gets all giddy about Zorba as model for living, one should consider that much of his pleasure comes at the cost of using other people. The Boss may not lead the most exciting life, but neither does he leave a swath of destruction and broken hearts behind him either."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"perhaps one of the least read and most underrated novels which remains as one of the all time greats in our era.

I never reread the last chapter...it's too agonizingly painful.Zorba and his boss tell some earthshattering tales throughout the book. My favorites include:1) The state Jesus found Zeus in when he usurped the throne of God.2) Zorba's grandfather's tale of how God created woman(Eve) after the Devil snatched Adam's rib from his hand.3) Zorba's explanation of why he loves to hear Madame Hortense's parrot scream the name \\"Canavarro!\\"4) Zorba's tale of his assassination of a Bulgar priest who killed Greeks at night and came back at dawn to conduct morning mass.5) The monk's tale of the chapel named, \\"Our Lady of Revenge\\"6) The boss's story of how he tried to help a butterfly emerge from it's cocoonThese are just a few gems...there are countless more in this sacred work of literature.

This is Kazantzakis."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Zorba, the ever loveable Greek, one cannot help but love and wish they themselves more closely resembled. At least i do. Nikos Kazantzakis, strongly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche--parallels are all over in the text--wrote this novel all about living in the moment and finding happiness in the present. The main character finds himself troubled and confused, strongly &quot;puritan&quot; and &quot;western&quot; in his moral code. And, upon encountering Zorba the Greek, a spontaneous, life-affirming passionate man, learns to love life and find happiness.Zorba is a complete womanizer, loves his food, song, and drink. Zorba believes he is destined for &quot;hell&quot; not for any sin--not for killing, or swindling, lying, or cheating--but Zorba believes he is bound for the eternal flame because one night earlier in his life, a woman waited for him in her bed and he did not go. Some of my favorite quotes in all of literature lie in this novel.Zorba teaches the main character, and the reader along with him, to live life in the moment and never to pass up a moment. The book is a great, infectiously life affirming tale. The book will not only entertain you through its pages, but change how you see the world.I've been more spontaneous ever since."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"'Zorba the Greek' is a highly philosophical novel with very little plot. The narrative voice is that of an unnamed, bookish man of 35, and it is mainly engaged in contrasting his contemplative and introspective inner life with the worldview of his older friend Alexis Zorba. Zorba's motto could very well be the Latin dictum 'carpe diem' (seize the day) with a strong hedonistic component, but it goes beyond that because he is also concerned about ultimate causes and the nature of God and the presence of evil in the world. As a result of the contrasting views, the novel has a meditative and somewhat slow rhythym to it, but at the same time it is engaging and enjoyable.Certainly since Kazantzakis wrote 'Zorba the Greek' many attitudes have changed, and some readers might find the novel out of date and even reactionary in some regards. This is especially true of how women are portrayed in the novel. However, there is also the element of cultural gaps that are not easily bridged. Greek culture has always had a strong patriarchal component, and most probably Kazantzakis was trying to provide as accurate a picture as possible of a simple man with a lust for life within the context of that culture. What in the end emerges is a very Greek novel that captures interesting cultural and societal nuances at the beginning of the Twentieth Century.I don't know any Greek, but it seems to me that Carl Wildman's translation of the novel flows effortlessly and doesn't seem contrived. Wildman also provides footnotes in certain occasions, thus clarifying terms that might be obscure to Western readers."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Other than his ponderous and perhaps party fictionalized actual autobiography (\\"Report to Greco\\"), this is Kazantzakis' most autobiographical novel, with an intellectual narrator modeled after himself. The real title can be translated as \\"The Life and Times of Alexis Zorbas\\", and the standard English title is a nod to the successful film by Michalis Cacoyannis. Anthony Quinn's portrayal of the book's eponymous main character, though good for an Irish-Mexican-American, has warped the whole world's understanding of Greece and \\"Greek dancing\\" (there were times when I was almost driven to violence against drunken British idiots stumbling about with arms in the air doing the \\"Zorba\\"), but that's for another review.A few sentences for context would not be amiss. Kazantzakis is constantly discovered by Greek teenagers, loved to distraction, then abandoned. Why? Because he himself discovered Buddha, Marx and Nietsche at a formative age, and his writings reflect an uneasy mix of different \\"struggles\\": to attain serenity and self-understanding, to be one with all of humanity, and to transced human limitations through heroic struggle aggainst impossible odds. Nietsche, however, usually wins out in the end. All Kazantzakis' heroes are rebels against conventional morality and worldly opinion, and set themselves the task of transcendence, often reluctantly. In \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" (a novel that caused a huge furore among conservative Christians when it was made into a film by Martin Scorcese), Jesus is a sinner that is driven against every fiber of his will, mind and body to be the Chosen one, until he undergoes the Last Temptation on the cross (read the book or see the movie if you want to know the outcome). In \\"God's Pauper,\\" a novel about St Francis of Assisi, the superhuman struggle is one of renunciation of all that is worldly or easy, even the hope of heaven and fear of hell (that did not endear the author to conservative Christians either).So what is Nietschean or superhuman about Zorbas? He is a laborer, folk musician, barely educated philosopher, bon vivant and womanizer, larger than life and totally indifferent to piety, organized religion, social convention or wealth. He is a rebel: not the ascetic kind but the kind that grabs the world with both hands, elbows, armpits, thighs and everything else. Of course, being a sensualist and scoffer at convention does not make Alexis Zorbas amoral, cruel or indifferent: on the contrary, his compassion and sense of justice for the downtrodden are proportionally magnified. As Kazantzakis' St Francis would say, Zorbas does the right thing without hope for or fear of the afterlife; instead he does it for pleasure, defiance and a sense of what's right.I won't summarize the plot of the book; it's not particularly relevant. Neither are the comments by readers who were shocked by the story's occasional savagery and misogyny. Crete was a violent place, where sheep-stealing was a matter of pride, family honor was defended with murder and blood feuds lasted for generations; all this is still not unknown in some mountainous areas, and Cretans have a huge rate of (illegal) gun ownership. The position of women has definitely improved in 90 years; judging a dead author for setting down the (exaggerated) reality of another age is not fair. Let me just end by saying that most Greeks still have a soft spot in their hearts for Zorbas the character well after they have outgrown their teenage fascination with other, less fun-loving and life-affirming Nietschean rebel heroes created by Kazantzakis. And if you subscribe to the conservative Christian view that it's only the fear of hell and promise of heaven that keep us from savagery, than either stay away from Kazantzakis or prepare to have your faith tested. Kazantzakis' characters reflect the views of most Greeks on this matter, and last I checked the crime rate in Greece was minuscule."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"\\"Zorba the Greek\\" is simply a great novel. Kazantzakis is brilliant in his dialogue, story-telling, and word pictures. I have read Zorba over and over again, particularly when I want to feel the vibrant life of Greek culture. Many find themselves in opposition to Kazantzakis' philosophies, but this book should be savored for its pure celebration of life, brilliantly embodied in Zorba and his intellectual friend, a young British Greek.Sexist, yes. Anti-religious, yes. A great read, nonetheless!Reviewed by David Lundberg, author ofOlympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This is one of my most favorite and treasured books. It is an incredible read. It is beautifully written with honest, flowing dialogue. This is the book that made me a fan of Nikos Kazantzakis. It was my first read by him some four years ago and it stays with me still today. I reccommend this book to everyone, especially to actors, writers, and philosophers. I think that it is a very interesting adventure and study for poeple believers in all we all are capable of everything, emotionally, spiritually. But we just express it differently.I find this book to be both simple and profound. Entertaining as well as thoughtful. Zorba is one of the most compelling characters that has ever come to life through through the pages of a novel. This book brings to life the spirit and drama of life and humanity. Kazantzakis writes like no other. A deepfully, thoughtful, spiritual and simple writer. If you have already read this Kazantzakis gem I recommend that you delve into The last Temptation of Christ which I find to be another of Kazantzakis' great Gems."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Alexis Zorba is one of the few characters in a novel I would meet in real life. I would love to go out drinking with him and meet women. The book, all 311 pages of it, is not a book, but a living thing that weeps, laughs and dances.Although Zorba the Greek is the title of the book; the novel is in first person by a narrator, who influenced by Buddhism (what I would call the narrator's misreading of Buddhism) wishes to live an ascetic, pure life as a worker in lignite mine, free from worldly desires. The narrator wants to start a commune-like society. However, the narrator meets Zorba, who says that making love with women, for all the pains the pursuit of women and love causes, is \\"the key to paradise.\\" Now it might be easy to think that Zorba is a misogynist swine who uses women for simple pleasure. And perhaps \\"Zorba the Greek\\" does appeal to men more than it might to a woman; but I'd look at the whole Zorba's character, an uneducated genius whose philosophy (in my opinion) is a more complete version of Nietzsche's. Zorba is not a philosophy; he is a philosophy as a body in a man. The narrator slowly becomes enchanted by Zorba's zest for life. Zorba is noble and suffering and exalting in his joy. The narrator begins to realize he has wasted his life, searching for a purity he may never achieve, as wishes to study in \\"the school of Zorba.\\" He had never been brazen enough to fall in love, to dance or to risk happiness.I don't dispute Holden Caulfield in Salinger's novel to be a unreliable narrator, but Holden did say something very insightful about the reading great books, that after reading a wonderful book one wants to call up the author and be their friend. Actually, when I read \\"Zorba the Greek\\" I did not want to call up Nikos Kazantzakis; I wanted to be Zorba's friend for life, and not because the author is dead, but I have never read a play, poem or novel with the depth of character in Zorba.Life is beautiful."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Really, this is a wonderful novel. The only reason why I give it three stars is that the translation is awful.

A picture of post war Crete, and a snapshot of unusual customs, beliefs and actions from another time.

I knew of the reference, but having never read the book did not understand its implications. I recommend this book not because I subsequently found the comparison to be flattering (I did), but rather because Kazantzakis is able to grab hold of grand romantic themes - youth, idealism, nationality, tradition - and really give them a solid drubbing. Similarly I would recommend &#34;A Hero For Our Time&#34;, by Mikhail Lermontov. Good, earthy, bookworm-bashing timepieces, both."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Zorba and the other characters in the book personify individual freedom with a prose that will make you want todance in the aislesAnd yes see the movie with AnthonyQuinn, a fabulous Zorba"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Zorba the Greek is a must read about living, loving, and laughing. One can celebrate no matter what's going on."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"this novel celebrates life as only a cretan can express. kazantzakis creates a character who rejects patriotism, religion, marriage, family, education, and reason. but zorba does not reject wine, women, song, and travel. zorba is saved through the sacrifices of his heart, not his mind. a must read."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Human life is really quite complex in definition, but is additionally brief and concise. Nikos Kazantzakis demonstrates relative constructs through two main characters in Zorba the Greek: The first-person narrator, and Alexis Zorba. The latter is the basis of the whole tale, and is based off Kazantzakis' affiliation with close friend George Zorbas, and their time together. Zorba the Greek isn't autobiographical, but is a fictional summation of Kazantzakis' \\"perfect\\" philosophy: an existentialist philosophy without harboring angst, and indulging in the lavishness of being alive, along with strife, love, happiness, hardship, and sex.Though, this cluster of nouns doesn't do the novel justice, I'm afraid. Zorba the Greek isn't about \\"making the reader feel good;\\" it's about assenting with the consternation and formidability of life's inequities. But to delight the reader of this review with my own analysis likewise does not do the novel justice, because the interpretations of Zorba the Greek are, as they should be, left abroad. The book isn't a difficult read, but a delightful one, because the contexts flow together seamlessly. As the narrator, a disciplined scholar, struggles with his unperpetuable life, Zorba, upon meeting the former, sparks intrigue with panache.Both characters exert much expression throughout the novel, and Kazantzakis' analogies, dialogue, and emotional understanding grant wide accessibility. But it's not perfect. Character progression isn't as consistent as one might expect, and I found there to be a lack of closure. Zorba is eccentric, and the narrator lacks any real sense of himself. This contrast allows a greatly fluctuating, and oftentimes laughable, pair, providing an always lighthearted foundation within the novel. In this regard, some may find the novel, and especially Zorba, childish and lacking any sense of reality. To this I think Kazantzakis was prepared, because such protesters against Zorba define the author, the narrator, Zorba, and their inexplicable simultaneity.I think we know who has had the last laugh."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Ah!

It is full of life, warm heated exploits of a 65 year old Macedonian Greek who meets a bookish man, \\"Boss\\", from Britain. The writer has come to Crete to take up business as part of his inheritance. It is a lignite mine. Zorba is a man of many skills and succeeds in persuading the Boss to hire him to cook and supervise the work in the mine. A friendship begins where the different look towards life, philosophy, religion, women, humans as seen by the Greek Zorba and the English born Boss follows. Sprinkling of Buddhism is well placed to challenge the prevalent beliefs of Christians and their claims over God and world. While Zorba represents the zest of life, sunny spirit of warm weather countries the Boss represents the logical, cold weather view. Zorba wins. He shows that Christianity and the claims of West Europeans are often not what God would want for his children, the humans. The descriptions of the land, the beauty, the smells of orange blossoms by Kazantzakis come to life in the readers. Savagery and brute behavior of Greeks is also depicted as in the murder of a woman by a mob. Zorba despite his past horrors and views of women comes to her defense risking his life. In this the writer has raised the character of Zorba beyond the claims that he is a womanizer and out to satisfy his sensual urges only. He challenges the religious views of Christians, monks and ridicules their fanaticism. God and Devil are the one and same for him and change their place. For this perhaps Kazantzakis earned the wrath of religious Christians. Any-way if you are a deeply religious Christian or feminist this book may be offensive and please do not read it. But if you are inclined towards humanistic look at man kind and are willing to look beyond and see that God created all life including humans free from guilt, to live and be happy without being offensive then this book is a must read.

The conflict is between the earthy hedonism of Zorba and the metaphysical philosophizing of the narrator. Zorba converts him to his way of thinking. We are invited to admire Zorba. Yet Zorba's actions have included killing and torturing men who have a different religion (&quot;Turks&quot; although Cretan Moslems were indigenous Greek speakers).

The unnamed narrator is an intellectual who is searching for a better way to live: \\"I sought a pretext for abandoning my papers and flinging myself into a life of action . ... I had rented on the coast of Crete, facing Libya, a disused lignite mine, and I was going now to live with simple men, work-men and peasants, far from the race of bookworms!\\" Before he can leave for Crete, he meets Zorba, a simple but formidable man who practically demands that the narrator employ him as his foreman.Zorba is an existentialist, and his wealth of experiences makes him wise and vital despite his lack of education: \\"That man has not been to school, I thought, and his brains have not been perverted. He has had all manner of experiences; his mind is open and his heart has grown bigger, without his losing one ounce of his primitive boldness.\\"The narrator, on the other hand, lives in a kind of shadow world that lacks reality: \\"I had fallen so low that, if I had had to choose between falling in love with a woman and reading a book about love, I would have chosen the book.\\"Zorba shows his employer how to embrace life more fully and uncritically, and the author's native Crete provides a rich backdrop of human dignity and folly, courage, violence, sex, and greed. And of course, nature: to the narrator's credit, he experiences nature unsentimentally: \\"The stars were multiplying in the heavens, and they were all hard, fierce, scornful, and pitiless toward man.\\" Later, one of Zorba's mistresses dies and the narrator sees that \\"From the nearby gardens came the blow flies and laid their eggs in her nostrils, round her eyes, and in the corners of her lips.\\"The book is a nice piece of philosophy, but it is not always a great read.

It decribes the adventures of the narrator (an intellectual) and Zorbas who is an utterly uneintellectual man, apparently original a Macedonian, Zorbas background is very modest, somewhat working class or peasant. Zorbas is a quite fascinating figure and becomes quite much alive. Zorbas has travelled around the Balkans living from day to day, from the hand to the mouth. He has seen many things, (and in the Balkans around the beginning of the 20th century - there was also bad things to see!) so Zorbas very well knows that life is not perfect. Yet a cardinal trait of Zorbas character is that he seems to rest in life and apparently he finds it worthwile. Zorbas seemingly is \\"home\\" in life. There execudes from the novel a Joie de vivre, it's like the characters often simply are in a state where life is ok. There is a feeling in the novel which reminded me a bit about the novel \\"Mister God, This Is Anna\\" by Fynn (Sydney Hopkins). It's this thing about that despite life is terrible imperfect then you can live in a place where you are \\"home\\" and it's ok.Zorba the Greek also offers a substantial critique on religion, which are impersonated by various monks and church people which Zorba and the narrator encounters.

Despite being an older novel, it remains a classic for the very reason that it's entertaining, engaging, and has a theme and philosophy still relevant to new and old readers alike.The book is read from the view of the main character, whose name is never revealed and his experiences on Crete with his hired hand, Alexis Zorba. From the beginning to the end of the novel, the narrator learns from and about Zorba's paradigm of life. Zorba is a Nietzschian-like character who is spontaneous and wills to experience life with absolute enthusiasm. He teaches the narrator how to value aspects of life that are usually taken for granite, like food, women, the ocean, stories, music, etc. He is the adult with the child-like appreciation for life and all that it provides for the human experience. The young narrator is commonly regarded as a bookworm and an academic. He represents order and rationality, but immediately appreciates Zorba perspective on life. The discussion and life between the two characters produces a story where the reader can learn and appreciate how each character develops.It's a solid and heartwarming book that represents a discussion and exploration of the excitements of life; a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I respectfully note other reviewers (including the one who identified his or herself as '1/4 Greek', whatever that means -- as if humans were nationalist recipes) who found this book uneven. Fair enough.Me? I loved it.First, the translation -- which is stupendously crafted, bringing out wonderfully archaic speech patterns and anachronisms to represent the Cretan dialect -- deserves high praise. My one complaint is the very unfortunate title: \\"Zorba the Greek\\", which is an invention. The original title really should be rendered, \\"The Life and Works of Alexi Zorba.\\" Zorba, emphatically is not 'Greek'. As a Macedonian, in fact, his national subjectivity is constantly questioned and subverted depending on his context. In the last series of letters he writes to the unnamed narrator, he changes his last name to mimic the surname of the country he's in: Zorbescu, Zorbic, etc.Because Zorba, ultimately, represents the Nietzschean will to self-independence, a Dionysian revelry against the methodology of 'art' that the Apollonian narrator represents. But such philosophical categories are precisely the modal habit of thought that Zorba strives against. As a character study, Zorba represents the great 'non serviam' of S. Dedalus or Milton's Satan. If you're looking for a politically correct hero, you won't find him. In every way, he represents the prejudices and chauvinism of his time. (For that matter, Kazantzakis is harshly critical of Cretan provincialism, despite his admiration for its cultural longevity. The climactic massacre scenes makes quite clear the critique of misogyny in this text. Judith Butler won't be impressed, but I think for it's time it makes a strong indictment against mustachioed violence.)The novel itself, largely anecdotal, mostly acts as an observation not just on 'human' friendships, but of the possibility of 'friendship' with God. Kazantzakis's debt to Buddhism and Bergson occur on every other page. Some of the most enchanting meditations concern whether or not religion satisfies a spiritual hunger, an innate desire for the mystical, or an overbearing artistry that conjures up the sublime as a counterpart to the ego.But for me the most probing question focusses on culture and nation: the boundaries, definitions, and traditions which become a composite sketch of the collective. Why do people cheer and go mad watching a squad of eleven men chase a pig's bladder around an empty field (Euro 2008)? Why wear a flag pin on your lapel? Why mourn the loss of folklore? Whose folk is it, anyway? So much of this work represents Kazantzakis's love/hate relationship with the historicity of Greece, its ancient shadows and its 20th century ideological reformations. As Zorba wished for his tombstone, \\"Here lies a Greek who hates the Greeks.\\"Because this novel is, after all, a love song for islands. Kazantzakis's landscape tones shimmer on every page, delighting in a cartographic imagination -- the contours, gulfs, chasms, coasts, and tidal pools of the Aegean. Bits of near-Neruda like elemental majesty eddy around in long passages offered up the glory of nature. But where do people fit in with all of these indifferent tides? That's the unpresuming, and unanswerable question, of the book.The 'santouri', or hammered dulcimer like instrument, first ingratiates the author to Zorba.

I think perhaps this book is too dated toget the feel of present day Greece, at least for those areas where I will be going, but that was not the big problem. The book is about a self-absorbed lecherous hedonist (am I being redundant here?) that for the most part is utterly boring. One of Zorba's oft repeated ideas is that, while he didn't believe in God, if such an entity did exist the only reason why he would condemn a man to hell was if the man did not bed all the womenwho wanted bedding. And of course, there was the assumption (repeated ad nauseum) that woman's primary source of joy andsolace is to be bedded. I don't know about God, but this woman would be more likely to condemn a man to hell if he didn't help out around the house. Self-proclaimed &quot;God's gifts to women&quot; are nearly as boring in literature as they are in real life. The advantage ofthe literary type is that you can get rid of them in a moment's notice by just closing the book.The reason for the 2nd star is for the fact that the author doeshave some literary talent."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"In approximately 1914, before World War I, the narrator, a young cerebral writer who wants to become rooted in the earth and physical labor, rents a lignite mine on the beautiful island of Crete. As he is about to depart, he meets a much older, experienced, and very earthy Alexis Zorba, whom he hires to be his foreman and cook. What he learns, and we through him, may change your life. First, a warning: to appreciate this amazing book, one must be able to look past the misogyny and sexism of life on Crete in 1914, and focus on the love and relationship of two men. Zorba plays the santuri, has had a family and many lovers, has fought in the Balkan Wars, has lived and loved-his knowledge is rooted in love, suffering, sweat, and blood. He is a simple but deep man who lives life without shame, bares himself, has no guile or guise, and lives every moment fully--not only his joy, but his tears, his compassion, his anger, his hunger, his thoughts and his questions. His character is perceptively portrayed by the first person narrator who is a contemplative who gradually comes to see the poverty of a life always filtered through philosophical, religious, or cultural judgments. He immediately appreciates Zorba's wonder at life, Zorba's music and dance, and the way Zorba sees the same old things every day as if new. Zorba is life itself, a fleeting moment with a discrete beginning and final end. The narrator especially learns that by holding on to his safety and security he has sacrificed much by failing to live to the fullest like Zorba. The book is absolutely beautifully written, makes you cry at the beauty and wonder of being alive, makes you ache for loved ones who are gone, and cry at our ultimate fate, death, in the face of which we must live with ever more Zorba-like zest."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I read the Arabic translation of this book, and I love it. I don't want to recite the novel here but rather would like to share what I grasped from it. It's a true exploration of life in multiple perspectives, through Zorba, the narrator, and the other characters. Regardless of the fact whether they are right or wrong but rather how they perceive, experienced, and live life, and the peace they feel with themselves due to their understanding in the domain of their thinking. For example the monk who shared his views of life and was waiting to know how the narrator feels about them. I believe that Kazantzaki wants the reader to draw his own conclusions about the meaning of life not through the actions and believes of Zorba alone but rather through a spectrum of beliefs. I felt that clearly in chapter 20 when Zorba himself explained that he have more to learn of life. Whenever he get lost clearing things up in his mind he mumbles, then he erases and start seeing things again for the first time. Zorba like any regular person lives in contradictions, and the writer clearly doesn't want to portray him as a perfect human. The reader of this book should try to go beyond the little things and get to the wisdom. A truly great book that explores the answers to the big questions of \\"What life really is?\\" \\"How you want to live it?\\"The writing of Kazantzaki is spectacular, breathtaking, and truly marvelous. This a true master piece that philosophically teaches us to live life to the fullest by thinking simply, observing timelessly and dancing to the tones of nature endlessly."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"The classic movie starring Anthony Quinn was based upon this book.As the story goes, Alexis Zorba is an old Greek workman who accompanies the narrator, a bookish philosopher, to Crete to exploit a mine he owns there. Zorba is a figure created on a huge scale: his years have not dimmed the flame by which he lives, the gusto with which he responds to all that life offers him, whether he is organizing the work at the mine, coping with mad monks in a mountain monastery, embellishing the endless tale of his past adventures, or making love to Dame Hortense.Nikos Kazantzakis is one of the most distinguished and individual of modern Greek writers, and in Zorba the Greek he has written a book that lives by a vitality and rhythm that seems to owe little or nothing to the contemporary traditions of the Western novel. It is bursting with wit, fantasy, and enjoyment of life, and at the same time has a continual undertone of serious philosophical reflection. Zorba the Greek is Rabelaisian, a Don Quixote in which the role of the knight and Sancho Panza are reversed, plus a distinct Arabian Nights touch.About the AuthorNikos Kazantzakis was born in Crete in 1885. He studied at the University of Athens where he received his Doctor of Laws degree, later in Paris under the philosopher Henri Bergson, and completed his studies in literature and art during four other years spent in Germany and Italy. Also author of The Last Temptation of Christ and Saint Francis, not to mention one of the best spiritual autobiographies I have ever read, Report to Greco."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Although this is a review to the book it is also a response to the review of besario. Kazanzakis as I mentioned in my review to &quot;Report to Greco&quot; spend all his life trying to understand the role of humans on this earth and our struggle with spirituality. Zorbas comes in as a character that is the complete opposite to the character of Kazantzakis in &quot;Report to Greco&quot;. He is the portrayal of a man that is morally accountable to no-one but himself. This is along the lines of existentialism (as in &quot;Caligula&quot; by Albert Camus). It is up to the reader to understand what Kazantzakis wants to convey in this book, but the reader must be familiar with the author and also to have the ability to think beyond the surface. Our behavior depends on whether we believe that at the end we will have to account for our actions or just disappear. This is a choice that centers on idividual humans as we are the sole judges. We can either follow Kazantzakis' character in &quot;Report to Greco&quot; or his character in &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; or just a happy medium. Zorba the Greek is not a celebration of the Greek spirit and it is not how the majority of Greeks are. The books is not meant to be a travel guide to Greece but rather an outline of human behavior when it has no moral boundaries. This book is not light reading, as you have to be the judge of Zorbas' actions and it is for an audience that is capable of higher level thought."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"In approximately 1914, before World War I, the narrator, a young cerebral writer who wants to become rooted in the earth and physical labor, rents a lignite mine on the beautiful island of Crete.

First, as a masterful charcter sketch of an aging man who refuses to let time get the better of him. Zorba is a complex character who, frankly, is not always in the right. Initially he appears as the macho, almost stereotypical male. He is a womanizer (widows only) who does not think women are capable of any complex thought or understanding what is means to be a man. Despite this, Zorba is unable to destroy the fragile emotions of a local widow and becomes engaged to her. He feigns disinterest when she later dies, but is privately disconsolate. Zorba was a good soldier who now has developed a disdain for killing and defends the weak. He voices his distrust of organized religion, yet thanks God when fortunate things happen. Kazantzakis, like Thomas Hardy in his later novels, does not allow the reader to completely like or understand a character - they are dynamic and constantly revealing new traits.Second, this is a novel of self discovery and developing inner strength. Through the living side-by-side with Zorba, the narrator discovers that he has, in essence, wasted his life - he has not yet lived. By changing his views and adopting Zorba's philospohy of living for the experiences of life, the narrator is forced to admit he is wrong and has been wrong for many years. He learns the life is meant to be lived, not idled away. People learn by experiencing things, one is not able to life vicariously through superficial possessions or relationships. We must live optimistically and look forward to the future.This is an excellent novel that has a sensual, lyric translation. Kazantzakis weaves his philopshical beliefs seamlessly into his narrative -&quot;. . . it is a mortal sin to violate the great loves of nature. We should not hurry, we should not be impatient, but we should confidently obey the eternal rhythm.&quot;"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I truely enjoyed reading Kazantzakis' \\"Zorba the Greek\\".Our reserved Narrator (I don't recall the author ever naming him, so I'm using the capitol \\"N\\"--Zorba simply calles him \\"boss\\") meets the lanky Alexis Zorba in a Piraeus cafe, and being charmed by his wit, spirit, and the honesty of his emotion, hires him on as his foreman in a coal mining venture. The fact that Zorba can play the santuri and knows stories and songs for the journey doesn't hurt, either!On Crete, we meet the inhabitants of a traditional village, from the cafe proprieter and patrons to the aged yet still attractive matron of the local \\"house of ill-repute\\". The characters are uniquely portrayed, the scenery vivid. I almost felt I was standing among them as I read. There is no hiding of emotion here, whether jelousy, fear, or exhuberant joy.Zorba rejected self-denial long ago, and of all the characters here, seems to be the most accepting and least judgemental of any. He takes joy in becoming the lover of Dame Hortense, a retired prostitute of respectible years. He is protective of the miners he supervises, and sets a good example. And when a jealous mob of villagers gathers to run down and murder the defenseless village Widow, it is Zorba alone who stand up for her. For all his flippant and off-handed comments about women, the truth is that Alexis Zorba recognizes women's needs as he recognizes his own, and treats the women he has known--and those he hasn't--with respect. Zorba is mischevious but true, comforting and counseling a mad monk who has dreamed of turning his Hypocritical monastary into an inferno as a cleansing act. There are so many things happening here!Zorba has thrown off the manufactured constraints of society and bends to them only when he wishes to. He is true to his heart, and a true friend and brother to the Narrator. Through observing and experiencing Zorba, the Narrator learns to experience life, not just watch it from the outside. He abandons the Buddhist wheel of self-denial under which he had pinned himself. These men remain brothers of sorts, in the end separated by miles and borders, but not by heart and spirit. One of my favorite passages, spoken by Zorba after the Narrator asks him about being accountable to God for his life reads thus:\\" 'God enjoys himself, kills, commits injustice, makes love, works, likes impossible things, just the same as I do. He eats when he pleases; takes the woman he chooses. If you see a lovely woman going by, as fresh as clear water, your heart leaps at the sight. Suddenly the ground opens and she disappears. Where does she go? If she's a good woman, they say: 'The devil's carried her off.' But, boss, I've said so before and I say it again, God and the devil are one and the same thing!' \\" (page 263)I came to re-appreciate the simple joys of everyday life in reading this book. Zorba is an active participant in life, not simply as our Narrator seems to be at the beginning, a passive observer. If you enjoy living literature, I would strongly recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Zorba is a wonderful teacher. His lessons revolve around the appreciation of all things basic and good, the pleasures of simplicity, and falling in love with life. Great book to read if you feel that your life is in a rut and you want to reconnect with the world around you."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Alexis Zorba is the kind of guy you always hope to meet at some time in your life--an ebullient, enterprising, inventive, indefatigable man who has a million stories to tell and is willing to go anywhere and do anything, but with the wisdom and discretion that come with age. In Nikos Kazantzakis's \\"Zorba the Greek,\\" he becomes the close friend of the nameless narrator, who is lucky enough to make his acquaintance and hires him to be a foreman in his lignite mine in Crete. Zorba is in his sixties but still spry, lean, and tall, a jack-of-all-trades who has traveled extensively throughout the Balkans and western Asia, and an indulgent lover of wine, women, and song. He works hard and he plays hard, if you'll pardon the cliche.As the narrator (whom Zorba simply calls \\"boss\\") and Zorba develop a working relationship as the mine becomes operational with the aid of Zorba's organizational and managerial skills, the notion emerges that the two men are complementary halves of the same personality. The narrator is a book-learned and deeply spiritual man devoted to both Dante and Buddha; the former representing his contemplation of death and the afterlife, the latter his efforts to relinquish his sexual and material lusts in his discontentment with the earthly life. Zorba, on the other hand, irreligious and lacking formal education, learns solely from his experiences and his adventures and believes in living as though as every minute were his last, not that he is reckless or self-destructive or mindlessly hedonistic. The narrator is concerned with the metaphysical whereas Zorba is immersed only in the pleasures of the physical world.Although much about Zorba's character is defined by private pains in his past, he functions primarily as a social animal who leaves a strong impression on just about everyone he meets. He plays at seducing an elderly French lady named Dame Hortense, a former cabaret singer whose legendary beauty has been ravaged by time and who is sadly deluded into thinking he plans to marry her. An unsavory incident at a corrupt monastery exposes him as the craftiest of opportunists, yet he displays heroism when he tries to protect a dishonored widow from being murdered by outraged villagers. Far from the geriatric stereotype of being set in his ways, he is as many different kinds of men as he wants or needs to be as the situation requires. \\"I think I must have five or six demons inside me!\\" he excitedly tells his boss, who agrees that we all do.This very nicely written novel abounds with rhetoric about the Meaning of Life, which Zorba and the narrator presume to discuss without knowing the answers, but language and metaphor are more important here than the ontological content. The narrator is constantly seeing signs of God and symbols of life in the delicacy and mutability of nature, from butterflies to birds to flowers to the color of the sea; Zorba has taught him to learn by observing the world around him in addition to just reading the words of others. So uniquely spirited and inspiriting is this book that it would sing and dance like Zorba if it could."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I see a lot of very heady, cerebral reviews here and that's all fine and dandy, but to those of us who don't have doctorates in Eastern Philosophy from Yalevard or PrinctreDame, don't be put off reading the wonderful tale of Zorba.It's uplifting, it's heartbreaking, it's funny, it's easy to read and Zorba is, quite simply, the bomb."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This book is about taking life by the horns.

It says everything.\\"I bought the book and ended every day of my season in Greece by devouring a dozen pages. My cousin was right. This book explores a zillion aspects of human nature, from its best to its worst. Kazantzakis knew that he'd met a live one when he met the real Zorbas (yep, the guy really existed). And, he was duty-bound to record the life of this odd, passionate man, whose zest for life and for keeping it real seem uniquely Greek. (Read the last chapter in Kazantzakis' \\"Report to Greco\\" for more on the real Zorba and why K. felt compelled to write about him.)Some comments on this page suggest that the reviewers might know very little of the contexts in which this book was written; the contexts of Kazantzakis, of Crete, of village life in Greece, of Greece's history, of Orthodoxy and Greek nationalism, of a million things without which this book seems strange, flat, or even cruel. It helps to know these factors, but it isn't necessary to savor this story, which is really a mirror on humankind. Try reading Zorba before or during an extended stay in Greece. Surely you'll read it when you've come home. And, you'll want to read more Kazantzakis, for he's one of the best writers to have captured the pulse of Hellas, and of all of us."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This book is about life and its extremes. It describes the battle between free-spiritedness and conservatism. It makes any reader analyze the way he/she lives. I suggest that everyone read this book to gain essential insight into the perfect way of life. It is, without a doubt, a secular bible for living."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Much like the the emotions of the characters themselves, I found this book's overall effect uneven. The story relates the strange friendship between the protagonist, a logic oriented bookworm, and Zorba, a Greek everyman. The content itself is very life-affirming, and in this respect Kazantzakis does well. In a world overflowing with heady criticism, Zorba's unequivocating personality is refreshing, and his sensual nature flows wonderfully into those around him.I was bothered, however, by the style of the writing itself. Granted that the protagonist is naturally introspective, we are audience to a number of unabashed reflections on man, to the point where it feels didactic. It was a bit too easy to parody Zorba's whimsicalness, and I felt Kazantzakis cheated a bit in the narrative style- at times he left the first person narrative and jumped directly into that of another character. Other instances, such as the dancing between Zorba and the narrator (the purpose of which was to explain that which could not be explained in words) was undone when the narrator decided to explain to us what he thought Zorba was expressing with his dance.Nonetheless, as a character Zorba is very balancing for those who find themselves more in line with the narrator, and the commentary on humanity as a whole is worth reflection"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"This novel by Nikos Kazantzakis is about a Greek peasant named Zorbawho encounters an Englishman who is the antithesis of himself in every way. Zorba is impulsive,he does not think of tommorrow or the future and he seems incapable of too much contemplation or pondering. Which may be his strength or advantage.Rather he lives life fully without much thought and with a spontaneous spirit that should be the envy of those who have burdened themselves with too much pondering on the nature of existence,the universe,god and whatever else we spend time meditating on.What I especially found intriguing and admirable about Zorba is the fact that even as a grown man he can still display a child-like fascination or interest in the world around him.Probably because he is largely uneducated for it seems in the story that he had never attended a college or university.He may not have been illiterate but the impression in the novel is that he hadn't spent much time reading a great many books.For those interested in foriegn countries and the lives of people there this provides a good description or illustration of greek peasant life in a small village.The narrow-mindedness and intolerance of the villagers is manifested in that unforgettable scene where the widow is murdered by a mob of villagers. Their crassness and greed is really displayed when an old courtesan in the village dies.The minute after she is dead they come like a hoard of vultures and strip her house and belongings clean. One of them even carries away the door to her house.Besides this novel I would also reccomend the movie that was made starring Anthony Quinn. He was the right actor for the part and did a fine job portraying Zorba with all his peasant manners and spontaneous spirit.When I think of Zorba I think of Anthony Quinn as Zorba.I may not want to be like Zorba all the time but sometimes as a matter of relief like a vacation,I do want to be him and live like him. Then go back to being my rational and less spontaneous self."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"Zorba the greek is a novel that has inspired me since I was a child. Alexis is a man that has this atomic reactor in his body that he cannot control. The coal mine owner, his boss, starts to realize little by little what Zorba is all about. Despite that his worker is not educated he learns a lot about life from him. This kind of novel is the one you do not forget and in my case is present for many situations. Zorba is never let down by failure or tragedy, take your shoes off and dance to the rhytm of life !!"},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I have just finished an independent study project on one of the significant themes of this book: the concepts of reason and passion. It was a most torturous research process. But i really enjoyed the book. It was very interesting, although at times the flowery language left me clueless and confused. I really love the book, because maybe it spoke to the depths of my heart. Personally, i feel that i am very much like ZOrba, or at least, i try to be like him: to live life to the fullest. Basically, my point of view is that reason and passion are inseparable. There is an element of each in everybody. And both reason and passion should be balanced out. Too much of either easily marks the route one takes in life: boring &lt;-&gt; too much a handful. Well, i encourage anybody who likes challenges and enjoys a thinking book to go right ahead and purchase this book. To some, it may be boring. But do not reject this offer before first previewing it.

His personality it juxtaposed with Zorba who does not have time for books, as he is inunduated with the sensual pleasures of life.Zorba is in direct contrast to the Pauline teachings of the western soteriology, and in particular the Roamn Catholic Church. As Zorba encourages a Catholic Priest to embrace \\"his devils\\" and burn down the monastary, the reader starts to see how the novel is a statement against the establishment of the Pauline church.

However, upon visiting Amazon, I found major plot elements spoiled in the Editorial Review. Way to go, Amazon."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"The whole book is a dialogue between Zorba: an incidentally found Greek friend and the Englishman.Zorba tries to explain what life means to him and howmuch different is this from what his friend understands from life.His message is clear:life is short and fragile and paradoxically this tragically short time, contributes to its beauty.If life was indefinite the meaning of everything would be different to us.We have to do our best for there is no other chance to live once again.The Englishman is somehow overly serious on everything and does not consider the fact that nothing in life deserves such seriousness.Zorba teaches him some important lessons which can not be found in any book.He shows to him how to enjoy genuine aspects of life like love,music and eating.Zorba is in fact reflecting the mentality of Greek people. This mentality is in sharp contrast with the rest of Europe, specially England: where his friend comes from."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"While I greatly enjoyed reading ZORBA and loved its title character, I could not help but think that its author is in some way twisted in his thinking. The villagers' treatment of Madame Hortense and of the widow is shocking in both the book and the excellent movie by Cacoyannis. If Kazantzakis is himself a Cretan like the villagers, why does he present them as so vile?The author is also markedly anti-clerical. Zorba's dealings with the monastery above the village are nothing less than aiding and abetting in the crime of arson: He works on an addled monk to burn down the monastery, and provides him with paraffin to make the flames burn more intensely.While I am on this negative train of thought, I found the author's treatment of his women characters uncomfortably misogynistic. Curiously, Zorba is much more open-minded than Kazantzakis appears to be.On the other hand, Zorba is a vital character whose every word and act makes for excitement on the printed page. I could easily have read another 500 pages in the same vein, but such is not to be.The pictures I have seen of Kazantzakis show him to be a rather forbidding looking individual. I wonder how it is that the strange mixture of attraction and meanness could appear in the same face, and yet it does."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I happen to think this is an awful book. Zorba is irritatingly larger than life, yet one-dimensional. The narrator is shallow and immature. I did not think the structure and writing to be very good either.However, looking at some of the reviews, many higher ratings went coincided with admiration of a zest for life, unbound enthusiasm, empathy for indulgence in food, music and sex, and a readiness to forgive blatant sexism, quasi-philosophy, and Taliban-style clan justice. Lower ratings were not as easy to connect, but many less positive reviewers had a more jaded look on life, did not suffer fools gladly, and would not spend a lot of time with either Zorba, the narrator, or the murderers of a suspect widow.In the interest of disclosure, I am a 62 year old hetero European male, and I would find spending time with the narrator cruel and unusual punishment, but I could possibly get to like Zorba, on condition he'd shut up, and play the santuri."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless."},{"Title":"Zorba the Greek","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful."},{"Title":"Pondoro: Last of the Ivory Hunters","review":"I was delighted to get a copy at last.It started of fairly well,getting realy hard to read toward the end.Being such a long time hunter in the African bush I wondered why he could not fill the book with his exciting experiences.Which I am hoping he must have plenty.

I like exciting stories about dangerous game and majority of chapters in this book deal with the \\"Big Five\\". John Taylor recalls nearly three decades of hunting, mostly poaching in what used to be British east African colonies, in early to mid twentieth century. The book is full of exciting and interesting hunting stories about Elephant, Rhino, Buffalo, Lion and Leopard. One of the best African Safari books."},{"Title":"Pondoro: Last of the Ivory Hunters","review":"This book is an autobiographical account of a man who made his own way in life and generally positive mark (considered assumption) on those whom he connected with within his era, whilst having scant regard for the rules/laws/conventions and exported implementation of class systems derived from various colonial powers. I enjoyed this book on the basis that there is the demonstration of the diminishing freedoms that are being incessantly eroded to the modern hunter. That is: developing an intimate knowledge/understanding and respect of/for your quarry and it's place in the 'picture', coupled with an appreciation of the skill inherent in those who have demonstratable knowledge of the game hunted."},{"Title":"Pondoro: Last of the Ivory Hunters","review":"this book was read by myself time and again as a youth.

Grant","review":"This book covers Grant's life from when he was young all the way though to his death. The book showed us what a complex and interesting person Grant was. I truly enjoyed reading this book and found it very hard to put down. The book draws you into Grant's life and lets you experience his life's triumphs and tribulations. Anybody who likes good historical fiction will enjoy this book. My brother also read this book and really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant","review":"When I first bought this book, I thought I was taking a chance. But from page one, Robert Skimin takes you on a wonderous journey of one of the most interesting men in US History. It starts out with a few stories from U.S. Grant's early childhood and moves to his years at Westpoint, to the Mexican War, to his life during peacetime. Obviously the main part of the book is dedicated to the Civil War, but that is to be expected. Skimin takes you to Fort Henry, Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg, and the Wilderness Campaign. You have Lee surrendering to Grant and the Grant's life after the Civil War, including his scandal-torn presidency. Skimin keeps the book interesting as you follow the life of Ulysses S. Grant. This book is a must read if the Civil War or this point of history is even of slight interest."},{"Title":"Ulysses S. Grant","review":"Ulysses S. Grant was a complex, fascinating personality who led a dramatic, multi-faceted rollercoaster of a life. Why hasn't anyone been able to write a decent novel about the guy? &quot;Ulysses&quot; accomplishes a near-impossible feat: It succeeds in making Grant look dull. His life is presented as a series of brief, disconnected, uninvolving scenes, the personalities are as flat as my computer monitor, and Skimin's idea of plot and character development is to get Grant drunk on every other page, even at moments when not even his hostile biographers accuse him of getting plastered. Poor Ulys deserves better. Calling all talented dramatists--here is your next project!"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"Although about half of the events in this book took place at the flower farm on the central California coast, much of it followed the travels of Mary Madigan and &quot;Rotten Rick&quot; as they wound their way west from Oklahoma to the coast. The reader knows that a connection will be made but not exactly how.I was glad to revisit the women of Bad Girl Creek and catch up on their lives. Poor Phoebe is dealing (and not very well) with a personal disaster while Beryl has moved to Alaska with Earl.Mapson must have great relationships with some really great girlfriends because she has wonderful insight into women's friendships and how women provide unquestioned support for each other.I love reading and getting lost in this author's stories. As one reviewer said, &quot;you don't just read her books, you take up residence in them.&quot; This is so true....... I always feel like I am there, participating in the lives of the well-developed characters, feeling their joy and their pain.A great read that I hated to finish!"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"In Along Came Mary, Mapson brings us back once again to the girls of Bad Girl Creek and their delightful flower farm. The girls are all back, and the sense of sisterhood that Mapson captured in Bad Girl Creek is just as strong. The girls will go through some more ups and downs, but their friendships will help them prevail.Along Came Mary also introduces us to two new characters Mary Madigan &amp; Rotten Rick. The only disappointment I felt while reading Along Came Mary was that the majority of the book seemed to focus on Maddy &amp; Rick, instead of the girls at the flower farm. I enjoyed Bad Girl Creek a little more for this reason, as I loved the focus of Nance, Phoebe, Ness &amp; Beryl that Bad Girl Creek had. Despite this, Mapson still maintains her gift for writing, and has you feeling all of the joys and pains that her characters go through, as if they were actually happening to you or your closest friend. I can't wait for the next book, so I can return to these women who have become friends~"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"I am a huge Mapson fan and was looking forward to her new book. What ended up happening with this one, like all the others, was that I couldn't put it down until I finished. The bad girls are back and better than ever, and surprisingly, &quot;Rotten Rick&quot; is also back! The setting, the problems (and resolutions) these women have, and the story of Rick and Maddy was just so well-written, it felt real to me. What I found the most interesting was the points of view it was written from--in &quot;Bad Girl Creek,&quot; it alternated between the points of view of all the women; in this book, it took a different twist and alternated between Phoebe, Beryl, Rick, and Maddy. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about brave, feisty women and one man who eventually shows that he's not rotten. Definite two-plus thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"You don't read a Jo-Ann Mapson novel. You take up residence in it, as if it were the comfortable home of a good friend. When it ends, dumping you rudely into reality, you want to move back in and claim squatter's rights. This was never more true than with Bad Girl Creek, the first book in this trilogy, so now I'm thrilled (and relieved) to find that you really can go home again. The Bad Girls are all back, and there's an intriguing addition--Maddy, a honky tonk angel who's gritty, heart-breaking and real. She's from Oklahoma and her life becomes entwined with the flower farm gang of four in a simple twist of fate that only Mapson could dream up and pull off. One of my favorite things about her writing, as in all her previous books, is the way she weaves the separate strands of her characters' lives together with deliciously fascinating details on various subjects, like flowers and music, pulling all the threads into a tapestry world so compelling and involving you want to wrap it around yourself and settle in for the duration."},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"What a novel! An exhilarating read about friendship, love and the way paths intersect, even far from the flower farm. All the glorious women from &quot;Bad Girl Creek&quot; are back, Mary, Phoebe, Beryl, Nance and Ness--old friends with new secrets--and we also have the delicious Rotten Rick. What is so wonderful here is the way Mapson understands, appreciates, and shows us female friendships, how she knows a heart can be torn to shreds, but it can also heal. Written in prose as crystalline as a mountain stream, Mapson breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and she does it brilliantly. I can't wait for the next book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"I just wrote a review for another of Joann's books called A Bad Girl Creek Novel, this Book and Good-bye Earl are a set of 3 books that go hand in hand with one another.

Mapson's quirky, multi-dimensional characters from her previous novel are little more than minor supporting players in &quot;Along Came Mary&quot;. Touted as a sequel, it's mainly the back story of Rotten Rick, who was briefly mentioned in BGC as Nance's loathsome ex, and Mary Madigan, a talented but underacheiving drifter mourning the loss of her twin sister in the Oklahoma City bombing several years earlier. The two meet after Rick loses his dead end job at a music magazine and Mary Madigan (Maddy) ditches her loser boyfriend. They team up as road trip partners, as Rick pursues a career as a journalist, and Maddy tries to make a living singing on the open mike bar circuit, and form an odd relationship as lovers, but not quite friends. Exploring the dynamics of this unlikely pairing might have made for a good story if either Rick or Maddy were interesting or likeable characters. However, Rick was dull and Maddy was irritating (I was ready to throw the book across the room the next time she said the word &quot;feck&quot;) and I never grew to like either one of them enough to care about what became of their relationship.In sharp contrast to the Rick/Maddy storyline were the chapters (sadly, very few) written from original Bad Girl Phoebe's point of view. My heart broke for Phoebe's loss of her first and only love, Juan. Her grief and her anger towards their unborn child were painfully realistic, but tempered by the love of the other Bad Girls as they rallied around to support her. It is in these few chapters, and a few journal entries written by Beryl, that we glimpse the spirit of the original book. However, the lack of any real focus on the other Girls (a subplot about about Nance's eating disorder is reduced to a few pages here and there, and there is virtually nothing of Ness) keeps this from being a true follow up to their story.Maddy and Rick are briefly brought together with the Girls through a chance meeting with Beryl. The unlikely friendship that sparks between them leads to Beryl urging Maddy to head out to Bad Girl Creek. Aha, one thinks, so Maddy will become the new Bad Girl. Nope! The new roommate hinted at in BGC doesn't appear until the very end. She, like the original four, promises to be a fascinating, multi-layered character - unfortunately, we don't see much of her before the focus jumps back to the tired Rick and Maddy saga.The chapters focusing on Phoebe give us a tantalizing hint of what a real sequel to BGC could have been, and earns the book the two stars of my rating. Stars are lost by the sheer disappointment caused by the near abandonment of my beloved Girls in favor of the boring Rick and Maddy. Here's hoping the third installment, &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, will return to true Bad Girl form."},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"Jo-Ann Mapson introduces another \\"Bad Girl\\" with a lot of personality and fire.

(I absolutely hated the way this began. What a shocker.) The characters are still as wonderfully flawed and we have added a new main character, Mary.

I can't put them down! You won't be able to either! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"Bad Girl Creek, is a novel that consists on women managing a flower farm in California. The novel mostly focuses on Mary Madigan and the boy she meets in Oklahoma. This is a great novel to show the power of women and how they stay strong. This book is mostly a &quot;chick&quot; novel and many people will be able to relate to this novel. The feeling of this novel is very touching it is a book that makes you want to keep reading until the end and when its over you want more and more of it. During the climax you want to jump up and continue reading it because it is very interesting and suspenseful. This novel is a sequel and many say that sequels are never better then the original but this is a great sequel. I recommend this book to people that enjoy &quot;chick&quot; movies or novels. People that enjoy romance, adventure, and drama should defiantly read this novel. Although I do not know too much about the author, Jo-Ann Mapson seems to be a person with interesting thoughts. She really gives a good description of the girls and it makes you feel as if you know the girls and you are part of their life. If you are the type of people who are into mysterious, Scary, and non-dramatic novels you will most likely not like the novel. Overall I enjoyed this novel because I have never been into farming or knowing about girls farming and the trouble they go through, but I found this book interesting and I realized novels like these leave you wanting for more."},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"I think Jo-ann Mapson is one of the most under-rated writers around today.

I can't wait for the next one. I lay awake at nights wondering about them. Will Phoebs find another love, someone to share her life with, and will Ness continue to be well? Is Beryl going to stay in Alaska? Ms Mapson writes so well that I even devoured the acknowledgements at the back of the book, and I was not surprised to see mentioned Judi Hendricks and Jodi Picoult, two more fine writers.

I loved Bad Girl Creek and thought it was the best &quot;chick&quot; book of the year. I was really hoping that Along Came Mary would pick up right where that one left off...and it did, but not in the way that I expected.This story focuses mainly on a new character, Mary Madigan, and Rick Heinrich. He was in mentioned in the first book, and is Nance's ex-boyfriend. The story follows them and has chapters in between that focus on the original Bad Girls. The story entertwines them all together at some point, but you learn the most about Maddy and Rick in this book.It was a good read, but I wanted MORE about my Bad Girls. This one had a little more darkness to it and sadness. It was definitely good, but not as good as the original."},{"Title":"Along Came Mary : A Bad Girl Creek Novel","review":"A year has passed since Phoebe, Ness, Nance, and Beryl moved in together on Phoebe's California flower farm to help each other overcome or at least deal with health problems and bad relationships (see BAD GIRL CREEK). Phoebe is pregnant, but the father died in a car crash on their wedding day. Ness has been diagnosed as HIV positive. Nance is heading to the altar, as she will marry Phoebe's brother though she believes she still loves music reporter Rick. Beryl still recovers from accidentally killing her spouse, spending time in jail, and what seems to her is unrequited love for Earl.Maddy leaves Nebraska, ditching her singing partner boyfriend who is drunk one time to many, to visit Oklahoma City, where her twin sister died in the Bombing. She meets Rick and they make love before traveling together to Santa Fe. At a performance in Santa Fe Maddy meets Beryl and Earl. Together everyone goes to Bad Girl Creek for the wedding.In spite of the major flaws of the key nine characters that make up this baseball team, the cast is a sweet bunch struggling to overcome their problems through this loose association. The story line is fun and easy to read, but keep score because the changing points of view and the hard to distinguish much of the protagonists make for a difficult time remember who has what. Somewhat soap opera in nature, the middle tale of Jo-Ann Mapson's trilogy will delight her fans and those who desire a cautionary tale brimming with muted optimism.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cherokee Bows and Arrows: How to Make and Shoot Primitive Bows and Arrows","review":"Al Herrin is a living Cherokee national treasure, based on his knowledge of the Cherokee bow, its use and construction.

I felt that I could visualize the process described quite clearly. I have not yet made a bow, but I could certainly give it a try now, with this book's guidelines and the tools that I have on hand. I purchased the book because I am interested in archery and have Osage Orange trees growing in my yard. According to this book and many other sources, Osage orange wood is considered to be best suited in North America (and perhaps the world)for making wooden bows. The author went into great detail on how to select trees and prepare the wood and went all the way through the process of arrow and bow string making. There was quite a bit of neatly explained mathematics and calculation in getting bows to have the right dimensions and pull. The author effectively combined old-lore with personal experience, and scholarly detail.

Cherokee Bows and Arrows is a valuable addition to my collection.I requested this book for Christmas because I am particularly interested in making bows in the style made by the American Indians rather than English longbows or any of the other styles of so called \\"primitive\\" bows. In particular, I am interested in the Cherokee because they used to control their lands in the Southeast United States where I live. I learned everything I needed from this book, including a lot of additional information that I did not learn from my other books.Some of the new information I learned was the technique for \\"chasing a ring\\" in shaping a bow, rules of thumb for bow dimensions, tips and tricks for tillering, and string making, including how to make a rawhide bowstring from squirrel skins, how to use the \\"pinch grip\\", and information on instinctive shooting.Actually, I already know how to make a Dacron bowstring the way Herring describes, but Herrin offered a suggestion for reinforcing the loops that I had not seen anywhere else. Also a great (simple and cheap)design for a serving jig.Al Herrin is from Oklahoma, where the Cherokee were relocated during \\"The Trail of Tears\\" period. He uses primarily Osage Orange for his bows, which was readily available in Oklahoma but was not readily available in the original Cherokee lands. His techniques apply to Black Locust (preferred by the Eastern Cherokee) or Hickory or any other suitable bow wood.This book is only 158 pages long, but those pages are packed full of all of the information needed to successfully learn to make and shoot bows and arrows in the Cherokee style."},{"Title":"Cherokee Bows and Arrows: How to Make and Shoot Primitive Bows and Arrows","review":"If you're into self reliance then this book is for you.

So it is a shock even to her that she fell in love with the Reverend Thomas Fairchild. Her feelings are genuine and deep for the man. She leaves the sophistication of her beloved New York City to settle with him in the backwater town of Aleford. Initially, Faith was bored with her relocation, but after opening her own catering business, the town began to grow on her. Also helping her keep the ennui away is the fact that she always seems to keep stumbling over corpses and spending much of her time on solving how the victims died despite the vociferous protests from the police and her husband to mind her own business.An independent woman, Faith goes her own way so it is not surprising that when a rash of ugly incidents, culminating in arson and murder, happens, she is in the forefront trying to discover who the culprit is. Once again, Faith stumbles over a corpse in an isolated area. After a few more days of sleuthing without any progress, Faith decides to use herself as bait in order to catch the guilty party. Her plan backfires when she becomes caught in the murderer's web with no one but herself nearby to help her.Like the previous six Faith Fairchild novels, THE BODY IN THE BOG, is a classic cozy that showcases the pros and cons of living in a small New England town where everyone knows everyone else's most intimate secrets. Katherine Hall Page makes her characters and the town come alive, leaving the reader feel as if they are visiting with old friends. This is a very special and charming mystery series that entertains and educates at the same time. It is strongly advises to read all the books in this series for an extraordinary experience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Body in the Bog: A Faith Fairchild Mystery","review":"Lora Deane appeals to Tom and Faith Fairchild for help when she begins receiving threatening phone calls. She figures that it must be either her ex-boyfriend or a relative, Joey Madsen who is threatening her because she refuses to contribute to his new housing project at Beecher's Bog. The controversy becomes broader when the town becomes divided over the new project and those who oppose it begin to receive poison pen letters. A brick through Lora's window and the destruction of a piece of heavy equipment at the construction site deepen the community's concern. Soon there are two dead bodies and an attempted poisoning. Faith, as always, feels that her investigative powers are superior to the police, so she sets up a trap for the person she suspects is the murderer. Instead, Faith herself is trapped in a dangerous situation. This is another good &quot;cozy&quot; from a reliable author who also includes delicious recipes from her heroine at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Body in the Bog: A Faith Fairchild Mystery","review":"In the 7th book in the Faith Fairchild Mystery series, a group of environmentalists have the town of Aleford, Mass divided.

When her child's preschool teacher starts receiving threatening phone calls, and a house in the new development burns to the ground (with a body inside), Faith feels things have gone too far. But when Faith stumbles upon a body in the bog, she is determined to call out the killer.After reading \\"The Body in the Big Apple\\" on a whim, I decided to continue with this series due to the likeable character of Faith.

Read this one by his long-time good friend and consultant. Howells wrote this book in 1910, the year Clemens died. It is a fond recollection of the 44 years he had known the author. Clemens was a complicated man and Howells admits that he did not always understand him. But Howells, a great writer himself, comes close to describing the multi-faceted person that Clemens was. Yes, he was Mark Twain, but that was just one part of a man who surely must be one of the most interesting Americans who ever stood in the spotlight of the world. He was a superstar before radio, TV, and movies. This is certainly not an unbiased account of his life. Howells was clearly in awe of Clemens, a man who was unlike himself in so many ways. He was fascinated by Clemens and drawn to him. How lucky we are that we have this insightful and personal biography, beautifully written by someone who obviously wanted to get it right. Howells put Clemens at the top of the list: \\"Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, Holmes - I knew them all and all the rest of our sages, poets, seers, critics, humorists; they were like one another and like other literary men; but Clemens was sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.\\""},{"Title":"My Mark Twain","review":"this is a must book for anyone really interested in mark twain... thank you for publishing it..."},{"Title":"Silver and gold","review":"Gorgeous illustrations!!!!!!! This book is a true fashion history treasure! Hartnell was truly one of the great designers of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Silver and gold","review":"Norman Hartnell left Cambridge without a degree, intent on becoming a fashion designer. With the financial assistance of his father, and the practical assistance of his sister, he established his own house, and ultimately became dressmaker to Queen Elizabeth II, among other royal and noble ladies.It's popular to sneer at Hartnell, to call his clothes \\"dowdy\\" and \\"frumpish\\", but that's really wrong. Much of his work, particularly his evening wear, could, to the contrary, be called \\"over-the-top\\", with embellishments of jewels, fur and heavy embroidery. Indeed, he is quoted as saying, \\"For me, simplicity is the death of the soul.\\" While his daywear for the Queen has been deemed \\"matronly\\", one must not forget that, when she was young, it was common for young, married women to dress in an older style. And Hartnell also talks about the various constraints that exist when designing for royalty: the use of pale colors to stand out in a sea of people wearing darker colors, a design that allows for the wearing of Orders, the need to \\"set an example\\" (as with wartime restrictions). As he puts it in describing the choice of colors for Queen Mary's visits to bombed sites, \\"Black does not appear in the rainbow of hope.\\"In many ways, Hartnell put English fashion design on the map. Most people would be hard-pressed to name an English fashion designer before Hartnell. There is, of course, Charles Worth, but he made his name in Paris. After Hartnell, the names keep coming: Mary Quant, Zandra Rhodes, Vivienne Westwood and so on.This memoir is a must for anyone interested in fashion history, whatever their opinions of Hartnell's designs."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I can't resist stopping by to review this because it is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read.

It is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is an uncanny display of how Lewis writes from a female perspective--and succeeds most excellently (see all the ecstatic reviews?). Lewis was a master thinker, observer, writer, and story-teller. Till We Have Faces awes me, for Lewis artfully writes from a very Other perspective. He does this so very well in That Hideous Strength, as well (third in his sci-fi trilogy). Enjoyable! Wah-hoo!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"There is something about classic stories retold that totally changes the way I feel about the story. The change of perspective and point of view has the power to evoke new emotions and responses. This is the effect that Til We Have Faces, by C.S. Lewis, has on the myth of Cupid and Psyche. By telling the story from the sister's point of view the story changes completely. When seen through her eyes her actions make more sense. What was accepted for fact in the original story becomes a misunderstanding. It all goes back to hearing both sides of a story. When only one side is told the reader is conditioned to think one way. But when the other side is told the whole picture comes into focus. There are so many points of view from which this story could be told. By choosing Psyche's sister, Orual, C.S. Lewis changed her from a jealous, plotting, sinister sister into one that loved Psyche so much but made a horrible mistake and suffered for it the rest of her life. With this change in perspective the story transforms into an in-depth tale of the joys and struggles inherent with loving someone too much. The joy that is a part of Orual's life with Psyche is so great that she suffers unceasing torment when Psyche is no longer with her. This is really very different from the original. Yet this change in perspective makes it into a very different tale. Lewis took an old tale and made a new one that is wonderful to read. From Orual's perspective it becomes apparent that there is nothing of jealousy in her for Psyche's beauty and her own lack thereof. Orual has a sisterly love for Psyche that supersedes everything else in her life. Nothing that Orual does in life means more to her than what she does to Psyche. In fact her life revolves around Psyche. Without Psyche's company Orual ceases to be herself and becomes something not quite human. Soon after Psyche left for good she changed into something called The Queen, whom even she didn't really know or understand. The real Orual lies deep within this new being and comes to the surface only to feel deep pain and remorse. All the struggles that Orual goes through really bring the reader into the book. It is easier to relate to someone who has problems and feels pain than someone who is perfect. That is the essence of the whole book - dealing with pain and loss. Orual is a very complex character. First she is ugly, which she accepts, then she hides her face and out comes the inner beauty which everyone else sees but she has a very hard time accepting. It's as if she can accept the bad about herself but never the good. When she does something right she doesn't really believe its her doing it. It's either The Queen that does it or one of her advisors. She won't take credit for it. This really makes me feel for her. She has a very low self esteem that is the result of her circumstances. She is an easy character to get close to because of her weaknesses and faults. Since she isn't perfect it is only natural to relate to her and her feelings. Lewis does an excellent job of making Orual a real, living character. Her experiences, while bizarre, really brought me into the story. Her sufferings reached out to me and cried for help. This book was very easy to read and hard to put down. I really enjoyed seeing this other side to the classic myth. By having Orual tell the story it was easy to relate to her. The reader knows everything that she is thinking and feeling. Which is wonderful when it comes to really being able to understand a character's point of view. Through all of her joys and pains Orual truly develops into a wonderful person."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I, by no means, wish to criticize C. S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces, but forgive me if I did not enjoy the book. This, I understand, is a result of my own preferences and tastes. The novel is well written and exciting. Lewis is able to retell the myth of Cupid and Psyche very well. Perhaps Lewis crafted the characters and told the story in a way that made me pity them to the point that I could not enjoy the book because I could not stand to see them suffer. Perhaps I did not enjoy the book because it deals with gods and dreams and tells such a fanciful tale that I personally lose interest, on account of my dislike for such fantasies. I maintain, however, that the novel was beautifully crafted, and I would readily recommend it to others.C. S. Lewis uses words in a beautiful and skillful manner in Till We Have Faces. He is able to convey the emotions and sorrows and anguish of the narrator, Orual, in such a manner as to move the reader with pity and sympathy for the horrible life that Orual was forced to lead. The words and phrases themselves draw the reader in, enticing the reader into reading further, into turning page after page and forgetting the bed that awaits him or her, forgetting the other pressing matters of the day. Indeed, the craftiness of the novel sucks the reader almost into another world, a world that the reader can well imagine, due to the descriptions and imagery that Lewis uses. As Orual walked, so did I, and as Orual suffered, so did I. Several times I wanted to put the book down, only to free myself from the horrible sufferings that I, through Orual, had to endure, but kept reading only to find what the words would reveal on the pages between my fingers. Perhaps my involvement in the novel was the reason I disliked it. Perhaps it was that I wanted to rest the book when I could no longer stand to read of the life of Orual because I suffered with her. Lewis tells the myth of Cupid and Psyche through the viewpoint of Psyche's sister, Orual. The book tells of Orual's fierce love for her sister, of Orual's possessiveness of her sister. Orual blames the gods for her suffering and for Psyche's suffering, and, indeed, for any suffering endured by anyone at all. In trying to save her sister from false happiness, she becomes the reason her sister must suffer. By the end of the novel, the reader has come to understand what the god meant when he said, &quot;You also shall be Psyche.&quot; Orual takes on her sister's suffering, who then is able to perform her tasks happily, as Orual suffers for her.The book is almost depressing. The parts that I most enjoyed were parts that avoided the issue of Psyche, when Orual's suffering was not quite so evident. When her father died and she ruled the kingdom, I loved to hear of how she governed and of all the reformations she brought to her kingdom. I loved to hear of her relationships with those who worked closely to her: with Arnom, Bardia and the Fox. I enjoyed also hearing of how she got to know the nobles in her kingdom. I was pleased by her popularity. Though Orual was not truly happy during these times, though she admits that her happier times were with the Fox and Psyche years before, I enjoyed these times most. Orual came to be loved by others and that pleased me (indeed, I believe it pleased me more than it apparently pleased her). Perhaps I enjoyed reading about these times because she did not dwell so heavily on her sufferings.If I truly did not enjoy the book, then on what grounds can I recommend it? What would move me to tell a friend, &quot;You should read this book.&quot; I fear, though I am not certain, that I did not enjoy the book because it was not happy, because it moved me to pity, to anger, to sorrow. How masochistic would it be for me to say, with a smile on my face, &quot;Oh, yes, this was a good book, a very good book&quot;? The book makes you think, but at what cost?At what cost, indeed? The book did make me think, unlike the happy pap that perhaps I am more inclined to enjoy. The story and the suffering of the narrator make me feel. They make me think, not only about the novel and the decisions, reactions and sorrows of Orual, but also of my own life, decisions, reactions and sorrows. I am inclined, after reading this novel, to evaluate my own life, motivations and irrational thoughts, feelings and fears. If this reaction will be mimicked in any reader of the book, then I will not hesitate to recommend it to others. I cannot, in good conscience, withhold the feelings that this book may stir in others just because the feelings are not happy. I cannot discourage others from having the opportunity of reading this book just because they may suffer as Orual. The book made me think, however uncomfortable or unhappy the thoughts were. I also was Orual."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is for me C.S.Lewis's greatest work. But I've known others who have read it and found little to appreciate in it. If you can relate to the psychology of the characters in this book, and to the religious context in which the tale is set, it will be a book read many times. If you can not, it will be at best no more than a charming but rather obscure tale set in a distant land.It is a book that tells a tale completely divorced from the self, while being (if it captures one) intimately about the self. It sets rhyme against reason; love against hate; beauty against ugliness; the Gods against humanity; doubt against conviction; the priesthood against the state; the profound against the profain; dark superstition and blood sacrifice against the devine and sacred; what is real against what is illusionary; and culminates with exploring the issue of how life itself can through all of these conflicts be discovered to be not what it always seemed while lived.It is ultimately a character study in how we may each live a lifetime oblivious to who we really were; how we can blame anything but ourselves for all our own perceived misfortunes; and only discover at our end that nothing was quite what it till then seemed. It is in that moment when we find our faces (see ourselves as we really were) that we know both the damnation of all that we have till then been and the salvation of finding all our accusations against the Gods finally answered.The book sugar coats these (and many other) deep philosophical and spiritual issues in a story that is fast paced, gripping, absorbing, and once read ever remembered as a haunting tale about a quaint land and time not ones own brought to life through C.S.Lewis's wonderful skill at painting memorable pictures with words. This is a tale that stretches from the cradle to the grave, and then if one believes such things beyond.Personally I take huge exception to the number of Christians here who claim that this is somehow a \\"Christian\\" tale, in some sort of attempt to claim this book as their own. It is nothing of the sort. Indeed my personal experience has been that Christians tend not to like this book, because it is set in a religious context more druid than christian, and deliberately so for I think that C.S.Lewis wanted to throw away the trappings of his own religion the better to explore the nature of religion itself.The tale is of a greek myth retold in an even more pagan setting, set in an ancient time, perhaps 200 or 300 BC. It is a philosophical and intellectual exploration of that pagan myth, and as such this book would be as accessible to a muslim, an atheist, a buddist and/or and a jew. This story is not one intended to teach the reader what to believe but rather one designed to speak to the whole issue of belief itself, and to challenge ones own beliefs in subtle and not so subtle ways no matter what they are."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"\\"Till We Have Faces\\" may come as a surprise to those readers who come expecting a heavy-handed allegory, such as you find in The Chronicles of Narnia. Some Christian readers may even take offense at Lewis' use of \\"pagan mythology\\" as the basis for his story, referring to \\"the gods,\\" such as \\"Ungit (aka Aphrodite),\\" who demand sacrifices, sometimes even human, and the pagan priest who is actually one of the characters who utters truths that go beyond simple logic (although these truths are mixed with humanity's imperfect understanding and sometimes vindictiveness). This book is far more subtle, and Lewis takes pains to bring forth deep truths about humanity and the spiritual world. Reason and truth, divine and human love often take separate ways in this book, and the inferiority and selfishness of the human love to that which is divine is carefully unfolded. The complexity of the human heart and mind, and the way we interact with the spiritual world, often making the spiritual world fit our own understanding or even wishes, is illustrated in a brilliant way.The story itself is compelling, emotional, and a FANTASTIC read, bringing life, humanity, and reality to a well known myth. But anyone who is willing to plumb the depths with Lewis will not be disappointed. It may grip you, convict you of viewing God and spirituality through either humanistic or even spiritually dogmatic eyes, and leave you in awe of the greatness, holiness, and \\"other-ness\\" of even the POSSIBILITY of One who will ultimately judge our thoughts and actions! Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I first read this book 20 years ago, and I loved it! It was my then-boyfriend's favorite book and I remember so many wonderful discussions we had about the themes in the book--beauty, jealousy, love, immanence, everything.Then, we broke up. It was the usual disastrous college-sweetheart breakup, and for 20 years, I couldn't look at this book without thinking of him.For some reason, for the hell of it, I guess, I picked this novel to teach in my intro to lit class, remembering only how much I'd loved it when I was their age. And oh. Oh my. After 20 years this book still has so much to say to me. Different things, I think, than it did then. When I was young it was an intellectual thing; reading it this time, with marriage and life and love, and false-loves behind me, I think I *feel* the novel more than before.You will want a pen in hand when you read this book, to underline all of the brilliant, insightful lines Lewis throws at you with almost careless ease. And though in my bookstore I found it in the Christian section, I don't think it really belongs there. It's not of any one religion, though Lewis was an ardent Christian. Bottling him up, in this text or with Narnia, as solely 'for Christians' does a real disservice. True wisdom, true spirit, true beauty and insight belongs to no one religion. This book is magnificent and wise no matter what religion the reader brings to it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis dives into the depths of the human psyche in this novel. As one reviewer has already noted, the tale has some undercurrent of the ancient myth of \\"Cupid and Psyche\\", but you don't need to be familiar with the myth to read the book.The story centers around a central character Orual, and the meanderings of her life and mind as she deals with the realities of her tough world. Her father was ruthless king, an alcoholic and abusive upon young princess Orual. Her tutor, and old man considered the \\"Greek\\", schools her in the philosophy of essential naturalism and Greek classics, and tries to offer her advice along those lines. The main religion of the day in Orual's kingdom involves ritual sacrifice and praise to a god named Ungit, whom she wonders much about, as he seems not to care or intervene but merely requires bloody sacrifice. At one point in the story, her sister, born beautiful and captivating and much loved by Orual, is taken by force and sacrificed by the elders of the community to an unknown \\"god of the mountain\\" to try to stave off a plague of raining arrows. Orual seems to become hardened more and more as the story goes on because of these sorrowful events.Through the story, we follow Orual from a first person perspective. We can see into her heart and mind as she considers what all of these events and people mean, and who really is \\"god of the mountain\\" or \\"Cupid\\" or whoever it is that took beautiful Psyche away from her. Who has subjected her to such a tough and loveless life of suffering, and why won't they speak to her? The answer, as it turns out, is not what one immediately thinks.In order to grasp the significance of this novel, you cannot read bits and pieces nor can you merely read the ending and hope to understand. But, if you read it in its entirety, you may need to read the final chapter several times to understand what the story means. It certainly was the case for me. In a monumental instance of indirection, CS Lewis invites us into a personal \\"leap\\" in which we consider who we really are and why god is silent.On a personal note, anyone who is an adult child of abuse, or who is sick of ritual religion, or who is unsatisfied with various natural philosophies, should seriously consider this work. I could not recommend it more for a person seriously interested in the meaning of life.Would that we all knew who we really are!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Wow, this book strongly affected me in a positive way. The first 50 pages were okay, because period pieces are not always my favorite. I hung in there since C.S. Lewis is my favorite author. I'm so glad I did because I got hooked.

This deep, strange, profoundly Christian book changed my life when, as a young agnostic attorney, I read it in 1985 and realized I was reading an allegory about, of all things, a religion (Christianity) which until then I'd dismissed as shallow myth. Till We Have Faces woke me up. Since then I've learned it's I who am shallow. I can't see His depth because I lack eyes. I can't see His face because I don't have a face. Christ's purpose is to help us shape our divine face if only we're willing. As Hamlet realized: &quot;The readiness is all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I've always liked C.S. Lewis's allegories and writings on faith, but I never thought that he would produce such a beautiful and subtle work of fiction. This was actually assigned as a summer reading project in English, and I was also surprised at myself when I not only enjoyed it, but liked it better when I had to map out all its themes and parallels. The novel takes place in the times of ancient Greece, when myths are still being made, and it is interesting just to see the myth of Cupid and Psyche from another's point of view, Psyche's older sister Orual --especially the angry shock when she finds out how much the &quot;true&quot; story has been altered by the tellers of tales. It is also interesting to see how the gods themselves -- in this case, Aphrodite -- exist in all cultures but have different forms, and the beautiful goddess of the Greeks can be the vengeful hag of Orual's people. The myth structure is used to explore a number of themes: the nature of love, the nature of the gods, and the personal journey every person must make.Besides all this, though, there are two things that surprised me most of all: the main character, Orual, is multi-dimensional, and very female (even though her circumstances are different from most women). Whether you like her actions or not, you understand them, and you find yourself sympathizing with her even when she is being greedy or selfish. The other characters are interesting, too. The other thing is the way that Lewis masterfully combines the elements of myth and the ancient, polytheistic religion, and brings them to very Christian revelations. But if whether you are a Christian or not, you will still be moved by Orual's discoveries at the strangely satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I first read this book in my high school sophomore English class. I sort of enjoyed it and saw some value in it but, for the most part, it was obtuse.A year or so after high school, I saw it in a bookstore and, since I'm an avid C. S. Lewis fan, thought that I should read it again. I'm so glad I did! It instantly became my favorite book, and defends its place up to this day.I've talked to other people about it, who seem to come at it as if it were an allegory. If you read it that way, you will be disappointed! There is an intriguing depth to it, but as the priest says, \\"holy wisdom is not clear and thin like water, but thick and dark like blood.\\" This book will give you a glimpse into the depths of reality, but not in the same way \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" does.I'm rereading it for probably the fourth time, and my love for it continues to deepen. You have to learn to take the story the way it is and let your understanding of it grow before you can enjoy the marvel and mystery of this book. Yes, it has a deep allegorical element in it, but it's because of what the story is, and not the other way around.I can see why C. S. Lewis thought this was his best novel. It was also his last, and has a very personal nature to it. It is a masterpiece of modern fiction, but it seems like few see it that way. But if you love George MacDonald, J. R. R. Tolkien, or Charles Williams, you should really give this book a fair chance."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"As there exists a wealth of [mostly] helpful reviews, I will try to add to the current body rather than restate it all.Till We Have Faces is known, by now, to be an allegory using the myth of Cupid and Psyche. For those who want a primer, Lewis has Apuleius' version of the myth summarized at the end of the work, which is helpful for keeping the allegory in mind, rather than trying to figure out what is going on with the plot.By far, my impression is that Lewis' strength in this work is his stunning use of characterization. He makes both Orual and Psyche, as well as the King and Fox, so incredibly consistent-consistencies that required \`tweaking' of the myth itself in order to implement-and consistencies that are required in order to make them seem more real. The result of such piercing characterizations is the ability to find pieces of ourselves in the characters, which adds to the meaningfulness of the allegory and the satisfaction from the story.Here I wish to warn the reader: the climax and denouement are gentler in this story than they are in The Last Battle, The Space Trilogy-I should just say, gentler than Lewis' normal style. It is no less impacting, and no less worthy, but a careless read will cause the reader to miss it. Unfortunately, many (not all, of course) readers tend to speed up near the end, where things \`get good'. I would advise against this: for those readers who know they tend toward this, tread carefully in Part Two.I also cannot declare that it is Lewis' best fiction: maybe such a thing differs depending on which of his works personally speak to which readers. However, it is certainly worth the time and energy, and there are many benefits to the way he chooses to retell the myth. I personally do not find that it detracts from the myth in any way, but that each can be savored separately.Enjoy!--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis' book Till we Have Faces is a fantastic literary achievement that shows how important point of view actually is. We are all familiar, I'm sure, of the Greek myth of Psyche and Cupid. The myth in a nutshell says that Psyche was married to Cupid, but she could never know to who it was she was married. Psyche was extremely happy, although she never saw her husbands' face. She lived in a big palace, and was pretty much set for life. Psyche's sisters, however, came to visit her one day and saw her big home and her happiness, and they became extremely jealous. They decided to ruin Psyche because that is what all good sisters do. They convince Psyche to turn on the lights that night to see who her husband is. She does and becomes doomed to wander the Earth aimlessly. She later is forced to do impossible labors for Cupid's mother, who is jealous of her beauty. Eventually Psyche becomes reconciled with Cupid and she becomes deified. Then they live happily ever after. C.S. Lewis version of this story casts a very different light on the story when it told from Orual's, one of Psyche's sisters, perspective. This is why this book is so interesting. In C.S. Lewis version we learn that Orual's intentions are really quite pure, and that she inadvertently brings about Psyche's downfall. She then blames herself for years for bringing such misery upon the sister she loved so dearly. So by simply changing the point of view of the story, Lewis creates a character who is sympathetic rather than spiteful. It is this message of looking at things from different perspectives that is one of the main themes in this story.The other theme of this story is that beauty, true beauty, is found on the inside. I have wondered why Lewis chose to name this book Till we Have Faces, and I am still not sure of the significance of it. It is possible that the whole theme of beauty is what this title suggests. When we are beautiful on the inside, then it shows in our countenance and our faces. Our faces then reflect what we are, and people see us in that way. It is interesting that until Orual veils her face, she is considered ugly, but once she does veil it, she is considered to be very beautiful because she then allows her true, beautiful self to take over. In this way, people really don't see her true face until she veils her ugly one.This book is a great read. It is full of symbolic elements that are interesting to try and interpret. Lewis is a great author, and this book lived up to all of my expectations for it. If you do plan on reading it, plan a huge block of time when you can read the entire thing, because once you start it, you won't want to put it down. I really enjoyed it because it made me think. C.S. Lewis is a terrific author, and he does not disappoint with this book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I have a confession to make...I am not a big fan of Lewis. I think as far as intelligent & clear-headed thinking - especially on difficult faith issues - he certainly had a gift. However, I think he makes (made) things too black & white without a real, first-hand understanding of the strength of emotion, disillusionment, and difficult experiences when dealing with faith. This is true at least until the end of his life when was \\"defeated\\" in theological debates by a female atheist, he married a divorced woman (something he had earlier condemned), and then he lost his wife tragically. (The movie Shadowlands explores this marriage and its effects on him.)These events rattled Lewis to the core, and for awhile he lost all confidence in his former theological proclaimations (except that God is good). It is my understanding that Lewis wrote \\"Till We Have Faces\\" after this huge shake-up in his life. This book represents an understanding he came to after almost all of his faith foundation had been smashed and he had to rebuild it. And, I think, this new level of depth really manifests in this work. While I'm not a fan of Lewis in general, I think this book is absolutely phenomenal.What Lewis has done, as many reviewers have mentioned, is to retell the story of Cupid & Psyche. And he chooses to tell it from the perspective of Psyche's older (and supposedly evil) sister Orual. For the entire first part of the book (labelled Part I), Lewis takes you through a fantastic, confusing, emotional, biting story. Unlike his simplistic themes in the Chronicals of Narnia, Lewis relates a very twisted account of love & jealousy through complex characters, relationships, and landscapes. And as he does so, he allows the reader to become fully sympathetic to Orual and her position...even though she instigates some unfortunate situations.However, while it is tempting with Lewis to draw trite lessons and observations, I encourage you to not do so. I encourage you to let yourself be confused and wonder at the purpose at Part I. For, in Part II he brings it all together very powerfully. Not only does his explain the story, but I think he delivers one of the most disabling blows I've ever read in a novel. I don't want to give away the ending, but Orual's own gasping revelation as she tries to justify her bitterness was simply phenomenal. And, when considering Lewis' likely similar bitterness regarding his short-lived marriage, I feel that this all came directly from his heart.A one-of-a-kind title that I would recommend to anyone willing to grasp with faith and potentially ugly revelations about ourslves."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I went into this book not knowing what to expect; I'd never even heard of it before. The first time I read it, it blew my mind. The second time, it struck me in different ways, all just as powerful and intriguing. I can safely say that this is one of my favorite books of all time.The story follows the \\"ugly sister\\" of the Eros/Psyche myth -- the one who seeks to destroy Psyche's happiness in the original fairytale. Here, the myth gains new life as it is stripped of its fairytale trappings and set into a realistic world. In short, it explains why the myth is the way it is, and at the same time it is an engaging tale of the true nature of \\"love.\\"Just thinking about what Lewis manages here is amazing enough. I don't think I've ever read a book that so effortlessly entwines 1) an engaging story, 2) a strong allegory, 3) a philosophical treatise, 4) beautiful character development (beautiful characterization all 'round!), and best of all, 5) pure entertainment. Most incredibly, Till We Have Faces effortlessly \\"instructed\\" me -- one of those rare books that left me looking at my own character and my relationships with other people. Anyone 13 and up can enjoy it -- the writing style is sharp and concise, communicates much with very few words, delivers some wonderful turns of phrase, and in general is very earthy and strong and rich. In my mind, Lewis is easily a master of the genre.This is not a \\"perfect\\" retelling of the Eros/Psyche myth and takes some liberties by focusing only on the ugly sister, but it only serves to emphasize the meaning behind the myth. In fact, I find the story far more engaging because of its altered focus. Don't be fooled... the Psyche myth is here, and it's absolutely integral; this book is all about the myth and how it reflects Orual's life. It's running inbetween the lines if one would care to look for it. In fact, I much preferred reading about the far more complex and interesting character of Orual (the ugly sister) than her sweet and perfect sister Psyche who, in my opinion, was annoying.There are only two reasons I can think of that would turn off the potential reader. Firstly, it may be boring if you dislike reading about somebody's daily life. If such exposition is painful for you, you'll probably hate this book. That said, the way Lewis described the daily life of these ancient people brought the entire culture alive for me. The second way you might find it painful is if you dislike having thick philosophy stirred in -- and the allegory/philosophy comes to a head near the end of the book in such a way that will spin an unprepared reader's head. The first time I read this I had to read it about three times and I still didn't get it. The second time it was much clearer, but obviously Lewis was an excellent philosopher, which I am not.One can enjoy this book on its superficial level and come away feeling oddly relaxed and good at the end, even without completely understanding why. And if you dare to dig deeply, you will get more than you know what to do with. Lewis found it important to really know what one was saying -- to say what one really meant, one should get at the foundation of a word. If you want to get some extra oomph out of your reading, if you want to expand your mind and your understanding about the integral concept of \\"love,\\" this is the book for you. If you want an entertaining ride, the book is this, too.I do not understand why it doesn't have any more critical acclaim; perhaps its Christian allegory is part of this, in which case it is a shame. This book manages what most \\"artsy\\" books can almost never claim: it is entertaining at the same time that it is thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is, I think, Lewis' best fantasy novel, written close to the end of his life. Many elements that annoyed me about his earlier works (such as his occasional flashes of misogyny) are refreshingly absent here, in a story very much focussed on strong female characters.This is usually sold as religious fiction (which it is, in a roundabout way). But it has plenty of the usual fantasy trappings (a cool warrior queen, swordfights, weird pagan gods, human sacrifice, battles and other fun political intrigue among ancient kingdoms, etc). It is no more religiously-inspired (though arguably no less so) than his Space Trilogy, or his Narnia series, which you often see shelved in the fantasy sections of bookstores, and is in some ways better than any of them. Lewis is a compelling read, and the pages just fly by. On the other hand, it is no doubt far too introspective for someone looking for the latest Dungeons & Dragons style action adventure.Anyway, if you like intelligent fantasy, but find the title a little off-putting, may I suggest you just pick it up from the shelf in your bookstore and read a few pages. If you are intrigued by the beginning, I doubt you will be disappointed by the remainder.ADDENDUM 4/23/2006: A more recent post has inspired me to add a few comments. They are as follows:(1) Since this forum is not set up for debate, it might be best if reviewers stick to reviewing the book rather than reviewing eachother's reviews.(2) I stand by my review and my choice of words. There are obviously many ways a character can be \\"strong\\". I trust the reader will understand what I mean (and what I do not mean) after he reads the book. It would make no sense to give away half the plot with an extensive discussion of the issue.(3) I was intrigued by Lewis' treatment of the middle sister, which does not neatly compare to any other character in Lewis' fiction. I can see, however, how she might be misunderstood by a very inattentive reader. To say more would be a spoiler.(4) Because I really liked this book, I hoped to convince others to read it. My review is mainly addressed to those who to some extent enjoyed Lewis' other sci-fi/fantasy fiction, but who might not have considered trying this title. I trust no-one will be misled into believing this is a radical feminist tract."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"To my mind, this is perhaps the finest piece Mr. Lewis ever produced: an allegorical re-telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. It is neither bogged down by excessive detail and fatuous elements that go seemingly nowhere, nor does it seem too spare...in a word, this flows...and does it beautifully...almost mirroring Alan Paton in terms of sheer smoothness and comfort of read. While spare, the prose does not seem to lack for anything...Lewis constructs his story well, patiently, building us slowly to climax.This is, as mentioned earlier, a re-telling of a myth. It is also an exploration of love, false love, attachment, jealousy, envy, pride, limitation of human understanding, and, above all, the power of grace to redeem even the least lovely and least desirable among us. This is a lovely piece, giving a marvelous message of both hope and comfort. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The widely beloved author C. S. Lewis has a devoted following of readers, especially in regard to his works The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, etc. but many have never even approached his fourth and final novel, Till We Have Faces. This is unfortunate because Till We Have Faces simply has more substance as a novel than the Space Trilogy (excepting Perelandra) in the ways of the human soul in conflict. The novel is modeled after epic, in the true meaning of the term, mythology that retells Apuleius'erotic version of the marriage of Cupid and Psyche as included in his The Metamorphoses. Lewis structures his novel as a narrative presented from the point of view of the elder of the wicked sisters of Psyche. Lewis has this sister, Orual is her name, deliver her story as an accusation to the gods for having stolen Psyche from her. In this work Lewis quite often, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, gives tribute to the many classical influences that shaped his life and writings. Knowledge of Dante's Purgatorio may not be critical to understanding the major conflict of the story, but it certainly helps.Anyway, without revealing too much as well as for the sake of brevity, Lewis has created one of the most powerful and heart wrenching sagas yet written that attempts to tackle the questions concerning perverted love, inadequate love, and sacred love and the difference between the sacred and profane. Lewis presents arguments between the thesis of paganism(blood, sacrifice, mystery), the antithesis of intellectual paganism(rationalism), and finally the synthesis, Christianity. It begins rather confusing to most but if you stick with it, the novel has a very rewarding conclusion and an interesting \\"twist\\" ending that Lewis himself attributed to his conversion to Christianity.As high-brow as this may sound, this book is targeted to a wide audience and is very accessible ,yet can be read repeatedly with new insight, new depth, discovered by even the most discerning of readers. Fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings as well as of Lewis should definitely try this mythology and find out why the gods refuse to answer until we have faces."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I struggled with this book from the very beginning. I look at all the 5 star reviews and wonder what is wrong with me but the book was boring and never went anywhere. I found myself wading through a lot of unnecessary verbiage that only made it all go that much slower. And the story itself didn't grab me as being worth the read. Maybe I'm too impatient and want the writer to get to the point and have a little excitement, but I didn't find it as one of Lewis' better books even though it is touted as that. I'm not a great fan of Greek mythology and often struggle with Lewis' writing so the combination of these two did me in from the beginning. His writing didn't help me \\"see\\" what was happening, nor why. I guess I don't appreciate what the world calls \\"great\\" writing."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Probably one of the best books that I've ever read.

I'd love to have it in hardcover; my paperbacks keep wearing out from reading and loaning and reading and loaning..."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"As a passionate student of Grecian Mythology, I have read many interpretations on the classic tale of Cupid and Psyche, but never with such depth. C.S. Lewis cast upon this book a brilliancy that is reflected in each theme he uses in this book. It is in the view of Psyche's older sister, and a bit like the story of Ever After(the movie), if the movie were in the view of the chubby sister. I am not as gifted as Mr. Lewis to put into words the magic of this book, but, when one has familiarized oneself with the classic tale of Cupid and Psyche, one shall feel, after reading this book, as though they knew nothing at all of the story, before reading the book!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"&quot;Are the gods not just, then?&quot; &quot;Oh, no. What would become of us if they were?&quot;Orual lashes out at the gods for the things that have come to pass in her life. She demands proof of their existence, and then later, a meeting; a hearing of sorts, face to face, where she can present her case and accuse them. Why did they take all she cherished away from her? Are they really there, or is it all just a cruel trick? Why are they silent? In this story that so deftly reveals our prides and passions, Lewis shows that when we encounter Diety, we've come across something so far beyond us that our thoughts and imaginings are undone. Some of us will surrender into Diety's keeping with joy, others reel back in hatred. It's not allegorical. It's sweeter, more subtle, and more powerful than that. The telling of the tale through the lens of Greek myth shows the stoke of the master artist at work. Holding on; letting go; pride; surrender. I've seen no other work that so aptly plays out the fabric of our lives torn between Heaven and earth, between love and pride, between the sacred and the profane."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Upon my first reading of this book as a rather fundamentalist Christian teenager, I was disappointed with its seeming lack of an &quot;overt&quot; Christian message. During my second reading (and following a conversion to Roman Catholicism) approximately 15 years later, I was moved tremendously by protagonist Orual's tendency to clothe herself in defensive strength rather than yielding to faith. The book suddenly seemed very &quot;modern&quot; to me. I smiled as I wondered what Lewis would think if he were able to see (and indeed, hopefully he is) how accurately the book he wrote some 30 years ago reflects the struggle of women in the '90s. There is something deep lurking in this spare and somber prose for female AND male readers. If you have ever longed to plunge into mystery, to learn to balance your ultra-rational side with the faith-filled portion of your soul, then I strongly recommend this book to you. (By Lori Pike, on a friend's E-Mail)"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"For anyone who enjoys reading tales of the classic greek gods, goddeses and heroes of ancient Greece and Rome then this book is a must. An excellent adaptation of the classic story of Cupid and Psyche, C.S. Lewis retells the story beautifully. His rendition of the story is extraordinary and the book tells the story in such a vivid and fascinating way. For anyone at all who enjoys Greek Mythology this book is a must. Not only is it a great read but it is a book worthy of being called a classic. :)"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is an amazing, wonderful book. I love Lewis's style; at once thought-provoking, half-humourous, and deep. The characters are so clear and precise, there is no mistaking who they are. In fact, I have ceased to view them as 'characters', but now I think of them as people.The story itself is so intricate and deep that you feel as though you can never quite comprehend it entirely. I have read the book three times, and I still stumble across new things that I have never seen before. Just like the Chronicles of Narnia, this book bears the marks of a true classic.I highly recommend this book. However, don't read it if you don't want to have to think too hard. At times, the reality of the story can be disturbing."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"To be sure Till We Have Faces is written poignantly, eloquently and descriptively in the style our parent's and grandparent's generation came to expect from C.S. Lewis. Lewis is at his core a master story teller. Like his popular work (Chronicles of Narnia) this one flows along, captivating the reader and often delivering the unexpected. However, a good exists reason why Till We Have Faces never reached the popularity and acclaim of C.S. Lewis' other works.In his retelling of the Latin novel Metamorphoses (the story of Cupid and Psyche) Lewis rewrites the story with a more ambivalent motive and a different character for the heroine. The story remains mostly faithful to the original but many odd and unbelievable passages exist in the book; contradictions that cannot be overlooked. First, we are led to believe that young Orual (central character) is magnificently endowed with the powers of persuasion, natural authority, god-like bravery and ruthless discipline when she is suddenly made Queen. For the first portion of the novel Lewis paints Orual as a kind if homely, playful if brave, emotional and sentimental character. We are given no indication that such a fantastic transformation of her character would seem possible so quickly (even after her grueling pilgrimage up a mountain). Furthermore Lewis would have us believe that the King, who had a palace soldier castrated for secretly courting his other daughter, would run a household whereby Orual could merely slip away for two days without being noticed by the King's servants and confidants. The Queenly, warrior-like personality shift that Orual undergoes as her father dies is sudden, awkward and the reader is unlikely to believe the transformation. Once Lewis commits this transgression the rest of the novel takes on an unbelievable tone. Meek Orual, now Queen, slaughters men in battle, wages war and rules with an iron fist.Many other passages exist in the novel that are puzzling. For example, the King is consistently portrayed as a brute that beats and insults his daughter, and executes, punishes and humiliates men arbitrarily. And yet one of the novel's most noble and trusted characters, Bardia, states \\"....he's no bad master to soldiers, shepherds, huntsmen and the like.\\" Likewise, the castrated soldier reappears towards the end of the novel. The eunuch has somehow survived his disgrace and sentence of hard labor, miraculously reintroducing himself as an ambassador to a powerful King from a far away land. Unbelievable? Till We Have faces is peppered and ultimately drained by these sorts of small but ultimately damaging contradictions and flaws.For all of his beautiful writing and occasionally triumphant literary sequences, C.S. Lewis delivered an inconsistent, disjointed work with Till We Have Faces. His more notable works show a thoughtfulness and a maturity that Till We Have Faces simply never achieved."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"My book came quickly with no problems.

It is one of Lewis' best! I can't say much about it because everyone who has reviewed this has already said all that is to be said."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The book &quot;Till we have faces&quot; is a retold myth by C. S. Lewis. The original myth was found in one of the few still known Latin novels, the Metamorphoses of Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, who lived around 125 A.D. The story talks about two princesses, one unattractive and the other one beautiful. The older one, who is also the unattractive one, was named Orual. She wrote the story in her older age, because then she did not have any fear anymore. It is written from her point of view. In the beginning of her story she explains, in her own words, the reason of writing the story down: &quot;I will accuse the gods, especially the god who lives on the Grey Mountain. I will tell all he has done to me from the very beginning, as if I were making my complaint of him before a judge.&quot; (page 3; Chapter 1) The story begins with Orual getting a new sister named Istra or Psyche who was the beautiful princess. Her mom, Orual's stepmother, died while giving birth. The king, and father of the sisters, was very angry of having another girl instead of finally having a son. Because of that Orual raised and loved Psyche like her own child. They both had a wonderful and loving relationship. One day a fever came to their city. It was Psyche who nursed the Fox, their teacher. After his recovery, Batta -- their nanny-- spread the story of &quot;how the beautiful princess could cure the fever by her touch; soon, that her touch was the only thing that could cure it.&quot; (page 30; Chapter 3) Psyche went out and tried to touch sick people to make them believe she could save them. Unfortunately, many people were not healed and suddenly a brute was also seen coming down from the Mountain. Because of these events the people said that Psyche was the source, &quot;the accursed one&quot;. The belief was that things like that could only be cured with a human sacrifice. That sacrifice had to be special. Ungit, the God, did not only want just any human, but rather the most perfect human. The people's choice fell on Psyche. She was sacrificed and so Orual lost her beloved sister. When Orual went to the place of the sacrifice, thinking that she would find at least a few body parts of Psyche she found her near alive and well. She could not see what Psyche saw. She was shocked about the rule Psyche had to live by; every night after dark her husband came and spend the night with her, but she was not allowed to see him. Orual, who thought that was strange, convinced her sister to light the oil lamp and to look at him while he was sleeping. As she did what she was told a drop of hot oil woke him up. He got very angry with her and punished her and made her suffer. Since then Orual had to live with her knowledge of being guilty for her sister's sufferings. She would always hear Psyche's wining voice wherever she went. Whatever she tried her life changed dramatically. For me from this point of the book on it got more interesting. The rest of the book helps us to understand why the book is called &quot;Till we have faces&quot; . . . even the most unattractive person could look really beautiful. Reading the book one has many opportunities to think about certain points and views in one's life."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This exploration of a Greek myth in ancient Near East setting has nice parts but ultimately the tempo sags. It is not as insightful as Ransom trilogy."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces may have had a message to share but I am afraid I never gave the deeper points of the novel enough time to penetrated my young, ADD mind. I'll admit honestly that I enjoyed this book mostly for it's sparce, but well written, action scenes. I loved the swordfighting. I think C.S. Lewis paints a convincing picture of a dark and dramatic fuedal kingdom, complete with heavy-handed tyrants, oportunist nobles, superstitious peasants, eerie priests, and discontented princesses both beatiful and loathsome. From the very beginning, the book seems to be preparing for a really big adventure, but I spent the whole novel waiting without ever having my thirst for action completely satisfied. Obviously the author had something else in mind. The truly dramatic moments were few and far between, but when they did come they were vivid and believable. Though the philisophical and historical efforts of the author were, for the most part, wasted on me, though I did like the way he portrayed the helenistic lifestyle. When we studied greek mythology in high school english, I thought it was ridiculous that any group of people would have actually believed in the moody and promiscuous Greek gods or their Roman counterparts. I imagined the people back then probably chuckled through their togas as they wrote about Zues, Aphrodite or Apollo. However, C.S. Lewis effectively presents people that do believe in their gods, at least enough to kill for them. Till We Have Faces, a tale told through the eyes of a no-nonsense girl, makes a good case for believing in the unseen. Near the end of the book there is a switch from reality into a vision, or metaphorical dreamland I am not sure what. I feel embarrassed that I got lost near the end. I think a more careful reader might gain some important insights from the abstract portions at the end of the book. As for me, I just had to think too hard.

It loses its power, however, when Lewis falls prey to his tendency to preach.

Lewis fails to bring the magic of his other fiction writing to this novel. Lewis fails to create characters whose feelings and actions ring true; in particular, the main character, Orual, is not very believable. Throughout the novel her obsessive actions don't seem appropriate for the character-her development is too shallow. Lewis fails to capture the female perspective for his characters, and this gives the story less impact on the reader. The truest moment comes toward the end, in a twist on the little developed character of Redival . . . if only all of the characters could have had so insightful a background.This could be a fun quick read if you like mythology, but don't expect classic literature."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"'Till We Have Faces' is not the retelling of Cupid and Psyche, it is the story of the troubled sister watching from a distance.

In the classic myth, a beautiful princess becomes the bride of an mysterious, nocturnal suitor who forbids her to see his face. Goaded by her two ugly, jealous sisters, Psyche disobeys her husband and lights a lamp to look at his face while he sleeps. As luck would have it, her husband, the god Cupid, awakens and abandons her. Heartbroken, Psyche wanders the land looking for him until they are at last reunited, and she is made a goddess. Lewis tweaks the myth in his retelling, choosing one of the \\"ugly\\" sisters--here named Orual--to tell a different version of the tale. In Till We Have Faces, Orual is the doting older sister who adores and cares for her much younger half-sister, Psyche, after her stepmother dies in childbirth. But when Psyche finds love in the arms of a enigmatic lover, Orual feels betrayed. She tries to sabotage the relationship not from jealousy of her sister's good fortune, as the myth claims, but out of jealousy for Psyche.

Orual has to face the sad truth that she is not Psyche's all.The second part of this book is Orual's reckoning and reconciling.This book is good on so many levels."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Oh, wow. C.S.Lewis, How do you DO it? He took a simple myth, gave it life and history and plausibility... and beyond that, made it a passionate description of our innermost struggle with pride and acceptance. Simple enough for anyone to read, the story hooks you in, the truth hits you deep."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is a high point in the writings of C S Lewis. Truly one of his best. Lewis wrote on a number of levels from children's works through to some pretty heavy going university lectures. While the cover of this book may suggest otherwise, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is actually an easy enough read when considering the depth and complexity of the subject matter.Also worth noting: this paperback is a nice edition with larger format and type and a quality feel. A masterpiece from the master."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Read this with my 12y-o-daughter. We loved it!! We used the study guide/commentary offered by Veritas Press in their Omnibus curriculum which greatly facilitated our discussion and deepened our understanding of this excellent work by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This novel is timeless. I read it every year and see new nuances I hadn't picked up on the years before. It's a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from a different point of view. It lacks the strong Christian themes of his other works, but if that turned you off from his other works, this might be right up your alley."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This beautifully written novel by C. S. Lewis is not only an unusual and creative retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, but is also a novel that explores with great understanding and depth the nature of love.The protagonist of the story is surprisingly not Psyche, but Orual, her sister. The novel is written in the first person with Orual stating her case against the gods who have wronged her by putting out a false version of Psyche's tale to the mortal world - the story of Psyche and her jealous sisters. Orual thus sets out the past and the reasons behind her actions to prove to the gods that her actions were based on love. We the readers are, therefore, members of the jury, and in this function we cannot avoid engaging in a personal soul-searching as well.The poignant message of the novel is that love - at least mortal love - is seldom selfless. Orual, in the course of her narration, comes to realize this fact and reconciles with the gods.This novel is bound to have a deep impact on the reader as it makes one evaluate one's relationships with others, and realize the inevitable truth that love is always selfish. Lewis also conveys the message that letting go of what one loves (something extremely difficult to do) is love in all its selflessness.A must-read for all."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"My favorite book of all time.

Thank you!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is challenging but also a life changer. There are so many levels of depth within the story. Orual's story is all of our story as we learn to put selfishness aside and love freely.

I never even knew this book existed until one of my favorite bands released a cd with that same name. I figured I needed to check out what it meant in order to better understand the band's intent.

It is an unusual telling, and the narrator's voice is strong."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a journey - arduous, provocative, and beautiful. Lewis offers a glimpse into the darkness and light of the human heart as we struggle with the requirements of the gods."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This story is beautiful and haunting. It is so very human and so much more adult than the Narnia series, yet still has something childlike in its portrayal of love, family, and heartbreak.The myth of Cupid and Psyche is somewhat well known. C.S. Lewis mixes classical Greek elements drawn directly from the myth with an almost tribal sense of spirituality and a fairy-tale setting to tell a wonderfully unique and thought-provoking story from the point of view of Psyche's sister.We feel firsthand the heartbreak and intensity of first love, family love, betrayal, and loneliness. This story draws fewer allegories than Lewis' other fiction (Narnia, Out of Silent Planet trilogy, Screwtape) and instead is a powerful story from a wonderful storyteller which is much more subtle in its morals and questions of life. A must read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Having heard much about this book from a Wheaton professor, I finally read it with an expectation of receiving great insight. For that, I will have to re-read, I think. There are hints of truths, some of which I know I missed, since I am accustomed to didactic presentations. Didn't quite realize until the end that it is indeed a retelling of an old myth. At any rate, it is an interesting read, even if taken only superficially."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I thought I had read everything by C.S.Lewis, and was pleasantly surprised when a friend recommended Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. I downloaded it to my Kindle while experiencing a rainy autumn week-end in Northern Michigan. Within this excellent read the sun came out, even though the rain was still giving me a great reason to curl up in a chair and enjoy the genius of Mr. Lewis. Needless to say, I spent a very enjoyable week-end because of this wonderful novel. I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I had a friend of a friend hand this book to me, obviously excited about it.

I could not put this book down. This book is a must read!!!!!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Ok, well maybe not speechless enough to keep myself from writing a review. This book was one of the best I've ever read. I can hardly wait to read it a second time. C.S. Lewis does a fine job of illustrating his characters. He makes them totally believable, and his writing style sucks you into the plot line before you know what's happened to you. He explores the differences between sacred and profane love through Orual and her sister Psyche's relationship. The book is based off of the original Mythological tale of Cupid and Psyche. His rendition and interpretation of it is absolutely captivating. This book is a good one to read whether you are a Christian or not. If you are, C.S. Lewis will help you to become a stronger believer. I would encourage anyone to read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is the best work of fiction by an engaging master of English prose. Like all of Lewis's fiction it mixes mythologies and suffers for it, but Lewis here has kept this peculiarity of his style restrained."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Quite possibly one of the best books ever written. The first time I read this book I was incredibly sick and promised myself (at about 7 pm) that I would read just 1 or 2 chapters and get to bed. At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept. This book is surreal, empowering and cathartic all at the same time. It brings mythical characters who often feel cold and drab in mere textbook descriptions to life as utterly human, modern characters with a depth of feeling and thought beyond the scope of that captured in most novels."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"In his re-telling of the Greek Myth of Cupid and Psyche, CS Lewis communicates more of his understand of man's relationship to God than in any other work. Some of my Christian friends have asked me how a &quot;Christian Writer&quot; could write about &quot;gods&quot; other than the true God. My reply is Mr. Lewis' own (paraphrased), that all stories of gods are about man's faulty knowledge of the God. This is not a book of theology, it is a story of the persistence with which a loving God pursues each of us, without shame or hesitation, and most certainly without end. Mr. Lewis has combined his considerable talent as a story teller, and his personal knowledge of God, gained through reason and through experience, to convey to us a tale of both the misery and the mystery, the fear and the joy, the anger and the forgiveness, all both given and received, of really knowing God. The book contains it's own best summary in the statement &quot;How can we see Him face to face, till we have faces?&quot;"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"A Lewisian telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's sisters, drawn as a very sympathetic character. As always, Lewis writes well, with insight into the depths and heights of human psychology, and with subtle allegory and a taste for grand and weighty endings. It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth the time.Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian. It hasn't happened yet, though! Perhaps, having been brought up on the Narnia books, I've developed some immunity..."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"a friend told me that \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is to \\"The Four Loves\\" as \\"Perelandra\\" is to \\"The Abolition of Man.\\" In other words, sometimes Lewis' fiction explains his theology more readily than his theology books do.My friend was right. This book is about love. About sacrifice, bearing one another's burdens, false love...what is it when a mother or a sister or a friend loves the other so much that it becomes selfish and keeping the loved one to oneself becomes more important to the lover than what is best for the beloved?It is a retelling of the Greek myth of Psyche and Eros, from the viewpoint of the ugly sister, and it is very well written. However, if you are looking for a simple retelling of the myth, with all the details of that story, don't look here. This is not about Psyche, but about Orous, the sister.Lewis drew me in from the first sentence, and kept me enthralled until THE END. He develops all the characters very well, but especially the first person, the narrator. I knew how she felt; I felt with her. How a man, a classic scholar and a fusty English gentleman was able to delve so deeply into the feminine heart and mind, I don't know. Lewis was a genius, and that is no lie."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Of all the fictional work by C. S. Lewis, this is the most mature in that he took time to craft the novel more than in previous works. It is a beautiful picture of Christianity. Just as Christians have a \\"husband\\" (God) that cannot be seen, He still is taking care of them and loving them. Although young readers can enjoy the novel on a story level, it will take a mature reader to see the symbolism and appreciate the various emotional levels of the book. It should be read and re-read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces puts a new twist on the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. C. S. Lewis spices it up with making Psyche's castle invisible to the sister, changing the setting and the characters and adding characters. Lewis places the story in a fantastical land that believes in their own goddess named Ungit (the Greek Aphrodite). As in the original the king has three daughters, of which the youngest is the most beautiful. Her name is Istra, but her older sister Orual calls her Psyche because of the stories she has heard of the Greek myth. I really enjoyed how Lewis unfolds the whole story and how he tells it from Orual's perspective. It really seems to come more realistic from her viewpoint. Orual reacts to things in much the same way as the rest of us, whereas Psyche seems almost god-like from the beginning. I really delighted in the religious allusions that Lewis always manages to include in his writings. The similarities between Jesus Christ and Psyche are amazing. Everything that she did and went through could compared to His life in some way or another. Orual's growth of understanding and knowledge progressed throughout the story, which helped me relate to her a lot more. As I go through life I learn from the experiences and come to understand that although I don't understand everything that is going on, there is a purpose for it. Other of Lewis' new ideas such as making the castle invisible helped me to understand how hard it would have been to believe that Psyche was married to a god. If I saw it, I don't think it would be as hard to fathom as if I didn't. That kind of alludes the basis of faith. Seeing is not always believing. Lewis has an amazing ability to write and is able to get his message across very well. His twist on the old Greek myth brings in the more modern thoughts of Christianity."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Most fortunate was the day I stumbled across this book while rummaging through my mother's library. Of all the books I have read thus far, I believe \\"Till We Have Faces\\" the most poignant and the most profound. C.S. Lewis uses the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche as a basis for his tale of two sisters, one guiltless and beautiful, the other good but ugly of face. He employs their lives as an allegory of the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ to answer the timeless question of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.Superficially, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a grave and at times grim fairytale of the sister princesses Orual and Istra in the dark primeval kingdom of Glome. The book is constructed as the complaint of the homely Orual (who comes to represent a virtuous, but flawed mankind) against the gods for the sorrows of her life.Through the embittered Orual coming to see her own selfishness of heart and how futile it is to try to fathom the designs of the divine with mere mortal reasoning, Lewis does not belittle human sorrow or suffering in comparison to the greatness of God, but rather attempts to represent salvation as a power to heal the deepest wounds and the greatest sorrows."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Orual,the least beautiful of the princesses in the kingdom seems as if she uses the Golden Rule throughout the book. The Golden Rule states to treat people the way you want them to treat you. Orual treats everyone with love because she wants to be loved in return."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"You may find this book slow-going at first, but stay with it. As Orual begins to &quot;find her niche&quot; she develops into a fascinating character and a strong protagonist. I thought this novel was extremely moving and highly enjoyable. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys C.S. Lewis, mythology, or a story featuring a strong and likable female protagonist."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This was one of those all nighter's for me.It's an incredible myth woven beautifully. Lewis nevers ceases to amaze me. Using the old tale of Cupid and Psyche he has written a haunting novel. Written as a testament against the gods, it's the story of Queen Orual, she gives a careful account of her life and of her greivances with the gods.It's a little slow going at first, but trust me, it's well worth the wait."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis was endowed with a natural ability to tell tales. Whether they were fictitious or true, he was always able to convey his ideas clearly, through characters and ideas, such as in Till We Have Faces. Throughout the story, we are introduced to multiple characters which, when analyzed, are seen to have a foil of some form or another in the story. Lewis cleverly wove these characters to represent the opposing ideas and concepts of the main character, Oural. One such example of this were the characters of the Fox, and Bardia. The Fox was in fact an intellectual Greek who was sold to the King of Gloam, and raised Oural from childhood through adolescence. While rearing her, he consistently invited her to not only to questioning everything, but to analyze life's occurrences, and search for some logical explanation as to their purpose or makeup. The Fox not only created, but represented the logical portion of Oural's thinking, while Bardia was the exact opposite. Bardia was a warrior and a devout follower of his heart. He believed that supernatural forces did exist, and that there were some things in this world that were never intended to be explained. Both of these extremes would come to play a critical role when Oural convinced Psyche, her younger sister, to confirm the identity of her new found husband. The logical portion of Oural told her that her sister was in fact married to a thief who was using her for her &quot;natural attributes,&quot; while her emotional portion told her that her, from the back recesses of her mind, that Psyche was in fact wed to a god. Once Oural discovered that Psyche had been married to a god all along, it is her emotional portion that kept her strong, when her logic failed. The use of the external characters to not only explain how Oural attained her qualities, but as examples of such was pure genius on the part of Lewis. Oural's struggle as to how to deal with the situation only became more evident in her sidestepping and/or outright lying to the Fox and Bardia as to what truly happened on the mountain that fateful evening.Lewis also created a simply brilliant contrast as to what beauty truly is. Psyche was, as described by the story, to be among the most enchanting and beautiful creatures to ever grace the Earth. She was even so radiant that the public of Gloam even began to worship her as a goddess. Her outward beauty was unmatched save only her inner beauty. While in sharp contrast, Oural was in fact quite an ugly individual. The King even told her on one occasion, that to strike her in the face would only be an improvement. Oural, because of this &quot;curse,&quot; was never given much if any love as a child. Oddly enough, once she veiled herself, after Psyche disappeared on the mountain, and proved herself to be a noble queen the people began to see her as beautiful. The citizens of Gloam even believed that she was so beautiful beneath her veil, that to show anyone, would place all others in a distant second. Lewis purposely created Psyche to be so perfect, that we, as readers, would naturally withdraw ever so slightly from her as she represented that which is unattainable for mortals - perfection. While he created Oural with realistic qualities (the opposing physical traits), illustrating that true beauty does emanate from within, and that even physical shortcomings can be muted by dedication, love, and a pleasant demeanor. It is this contrast of beauty and representation of personalities that made this work so enjoyable to me, and will hopefully for you as well."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S.

It was a book that once started could not be put down until I had finished - I actually read the entire book in two days. It is set in mythological times, and tells the story of Cupid and Psyche from a different perspective. I enjoyed the book for many reasons. The first was for the exciting storyline and great action - this was the main reason I couldn't put it down. I was completely caught up in the adventurous life of Orual, and those surrounding her. There was never a dull moment - new issues and episodes would always arise to keep my interest. The book is definitely successful in keeping the reader interested. The second, and the more important reason this book was good is because many lessons can be learned from the message it puts forth. Even though the setting is not in our times, many parts of the book can be applied to life today. Throughout the book the characters were very easy to relate with. This was the main reason applications to life could be drawn from the story. Orual, the main character, went through the most amount of change. Changing characters are the easiest to relate to because our lives and perspectives are constantly changing. As the book progresses from start to finish, we see different parts of Orual's character revealed. Her relationship with the Fox, Physhe, Bardia, and her father are all revealing to her character. The Fox helps her learn many lessons, and causes Orual to grow. He was captured from Greece and forced to become a slave in her fathers house. He was assigned to be Orual and Redevil's tutor. As the story progresses the Fox and Orual grow closer and become great friends. They even work together after her father dies. Orual learns to trust from this relationship. From her relationship with Phyche, Orual learns other important lessons. Phyche is the child of one of her father's wives. When it is found out that she is a girl, her father doesn't want anything to do with her Orual takes her under her wing and learns to love in an almost motherly way. It even gets to the point that she loves Phyche too much - she was willing to do anything for her. Her love for this child, her half sister, shape most of her life. In the story Bardia is the king's best helper. As the story progresses Orual comes to be in contact with him more and more. They grow to be great friends and they work together a majority of the time. She is forced to learn the bounds of this relationship, and in the end hurts much because of this. Orual never marries, and her relationship with Bardia is the closest she gets to experiencing this. Orual's father was king of the land. He was busy all the time with important matters, and he had a violent temper. Growing up, Orual knew that her father didn't love her. He made it plain to her that she was ugly and that he didn't think anything would come of her life. This helped Orual in more ways than it hurt her. She pushed away from him, turned to the Fox, and made something of her life just to spite him. The relationship helped her grow even though it wasn't a very healthy one. There were many other things that influenced Orual and caused her to change but these were just a few. Her relationships with others did most of the revealing. It made me think of how I relate to others, what I learn from them, and how I change. It provided a new perspective and I was very glad I had the opportunity to read the book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is one of the more difficult books by C.S.

It was wonderful, like all of the other works of Lewis that I have been able to read. I found myself thinking, even as I was reading it, that it would deserve a second visit. The story itself is very intriguing, but Lewis intends to communicate a lot about how we can know truth.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, &quot;I could not put it down.&quot; This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This truly is a &quot;Myth Retold&quot; as the subtitle indicates.Lewis uses the greek myths addressed as a beginning and acontext for the story line of _Till We Have Faces_.I found Lewis' early shortstories to be compelling, butlacking the polish of his Christian allegories and apologetics.In _Till We Have Faces_, he brings together the inventiveskill he shows in his shorter works and the refinement of hisbest work.The story is a wonderful look into identity and reality.It is one of the few works of fiction I have read that havecrawled inside my head and changed the way I see the world.Unlike most of his other works, this book only brieflyalludes to Jesus Christ. In fact many conservative ortraditional Christians might object to the slight mentionof it in a story about gods and goddesses, fate and theeternal soul."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"'Till We Have Faces' is a retelling of the Cupid / Psyche story from Greek mythology. Wikipedia gives a nice run-down on the myth, but it's a bit long...Super short version: A king sacrifices his youngest and most beautiful daughter, Psyche, to the gods by leaving her chained to a tree high on a mountain. She is rescued by the gods and becomes the wife of Cupid, Venus' son, although Psyche doesn't know at the beginning who her new husband is. She only sees him at night and is forbidden to look at him. Her sisters come to see her in her new home and convince Psyche that because she is forbidden to see him, there must be something wrong with her husband. They give Psyche a lamp, and tell her to light it one night while he is sleeping. She does this and sees that she is indeed married to a god, but because she has broken her pact with him, he abandons her. Psyche then is forced to undergo all kinds of trials before she is allowed to become a goddess herself and be reunited with Cupid.I just finished listening to this in audio-book form. The C.S. Lewis version of the myth is told from the point of view of Psyche's older sister, the one who gave Psyche the lamp. I almost gave this a 4 star rating, because as a story it has a lot of strengths -- Lewis always has been able to paint other places and people vividly, which is what I love about his writing. He creates some really interesting characters in this story, and there is a wonderful vagueness at times over whether the things Psyche has experienced are supernatural or not (yes, they are). It was interesting to look at the events through the somewhat skeptical eyes of Psyche's possessively protective older sister, Orual. The whole book is centered around Orual's growth as a person, and her realization that her urge to protect Psyche did not come from love, but from jealousy and selfishness. When Psyche is abandoned by Cupid, the god appears to Orual and tells her, \\"You are both Psyche.\\" At the end of the book we see that while Psyche has been set with many difficult challenges, she has been able to face these challenges with a light heart, because Orual has held the weight of sorrow for the two of them. I thought that was a really creative twist. What disappoints me is that we really don't get to see Psyche's side of the story, except briefly in Orual's dreams. While Orual is a character with a lot of depth, the sadness of her personal life makes the story drag at times. If indeed she and her sister are the same, it would be nice to experience some of Psyche's challenges as well -- If only to experience a little less melancholy and a little more action."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis' tale is a reworking of the Psyche and Cupid mythology. I'm not familiar with that myth so reading this novel was a fresh experience. Psyche in NOT the main character in this tale. Instead Lewis has made Orual, the eldest of the three princesses of Glome, the heroine. I think this is a sensible choice because Orual certainly made a more sympathetic, accessible heroine than Psyche who seems too perfect. Psyche is extremely beautiful and graceful, a virtuous woman, and superior in almost every way than most women, including Orual. Orual is a rational, thinking woman who happens to be rather ugly. She is called a goblin by her brutish father, the King of Glome.Orual is educated by a Greek slave named \\"the Fox.\\" The Fox has immense influence on Orual and gives her fire to make her case or accusation against the gods. Orual's most joyous times were when her beloved Psyche, the Fox, and herself were together learning, studying, and observing nature. Those times were soon cut short.Because of her undesirable face, Orual is fated to remain a virgin throughout her life. But she wouldn't complain all that much about that cruelty if it weren't for losing Psyche. The goddess Ungit (Venus), jealous of Psyche's beauty, demands that Psyche be sacrificed to the brute. Orual is in total despair over her beloved Psyche, whom she considers as a daughter. Orual is driven to do things that end up making life worse for Psyche. This drives her to writing this accusation against the gods.Bardia, a captain of the guards, teaches Orual fighting and riding skills. Soon enough, Orual finds herself in love with the already-married Bardia. Orual decides to veil her face at all times after losing Psyche, and she finds that this veiling grants her more respect and a sort of power over people.The fighting skills she has learned come in handy later when her father becomes incapacitated, and the throne is turned over to Orual. She quickly becomes the renowned, veiled Warrior Queen, deadly in combat and strategy. Her improvements to the kingdom are numerous, as she is wise and depends on loyal and faithful counselors, mainly the Fox and Bardia.The ending is a bit bizarre, what with the visions Orual has and her accusation against the gods finally being heard by the assembly. However, the ending does tie up some loose-ends and gives the story the mythical quality of the original tale.Lewis does an excellent job of portraying this story through the eyes of the sad but not pathetic Orual. She comes into her own in a big way, despite her aesthetic shortcomings, by becoming the \\"most wise, just, valiant, fortunate, and merciful\\" ruler of Glome."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I recently read Till We Have Faces again, having read it with disappointment over a decade ago when I was still in high school. After my first reading I sold or gave away my copy of the book, thinking I would never desire to read it again. I'm glad I changed my mind and gave it a second shot. It is a gripping tale which probes deep into the soul as it explores the destructive fruits of self-centered love and the need for reality in facing the deformities in our own souls. I couldn't put it down and plan to read it again in the future. Needless to say, I will hang on to this copy . . ."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Masterfully written, by a man who knew how to write and keep the attention of his readers. This myth retold, created by C.S. Lewis, has both the sensitivity and power to give the reader a true sense of all that's taking place in the story, pulling them into the plot and giving them both an internal, and external view of all that goes on. In the beginning, a woman begins her story of growth, renewal, worship, confusion, and eventual success in finding whom she, and those around her truly are. The setting is a barbarous land, where the people worship various gods, and offer sacrifices to them, devoting their lives and themselves to images and ideas they truly don't understand. But, Lewis is able to put a twist into the tale, helping it to come around in such a way that many of the more endearing qualities and characteristics favored by the Christian world are brought into play by the various characters. Orual, a princess, and the teller of the tale stands at center stage, guiding us through the thickening plot as we journey into a different land and time. With a masterful hand Lewis uses his descriptive language, and the very actions of the people around Orual to help give the reader and understanding of who she is and at what age she is, so they can then gain an understanding of what it is that is truly going in the tale. Small details, used in unison with general understandings help bring vivid images to the mind of the reader, showing them all that is taking place. One of my favorite things about the tale is the very manner Lewis uses his words to bring out emotion in his characters. All of us have experienced the same ranges of emotion he depicts in Orual, her beautiful sister Psyche, her tyrannous father, and all the rest. Precision of word and use of language help to paint a clear picture of Orual as she grows, gaining experience in all the aspects of life she will need as she later becomes the Queen and ruler of her kingdom. We are told of beggars and peasants coming to the gates of the castle, begging for the princess Psyche to come out and touch them, believing she is a goddess and can heal them of their sicknesses because of her unimaginable beauty; the human offering that must be made to the god of the grey mountain to end the drought that has plagued the land; and the powerful god who falls in love with the beautiful Psyche, building for her a heavenly mansion that her loving sister cannot see. Of the greatest qualities of the tale is its ability to help the reader see how confusing the thoughts and feelings of man can be, and how easy it is for anyone to avoid the truths in their lives as they pad the pain they have felt with excuses and scapegoats. We are shown the very deepest of thoughts and feelings come into play through the decisions and actions of those in the tale, and we are also shown the truth that compels those thoughts and feelings. Till We Have Faces is a literary accomplishment, written by a man who has had many. The power of the tale he tells, and the deep perspectives he shares about the very essence of who we are is very much worth the time invested to read it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"There are few books in the world that make you pause, which leave you breathless and strangely still. This retelling of the famous Greek myth explores the deeper layers beneath our daily masks to the darker underbellies of ourselves that we dare not share even with ourselves. I have read hundreds of books over my lifetime and this book by far is the greatest book I have ever read not only for its simple eloquence and poetic prose but also the quiet journey of the human soul it gently leads the reader on."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"In the past I have had a difficult time reading CS Lewis writings. I have never been a huge reader. It has to pull me in early on or I lose interest. When I purchased this book I started to read and got distracted pretty quickly.We came to the beach and I needed something to read so I pulled it out again. Once I began to read I was totally pulled in. Could not put it down. There were so many things that spoke to me about my own spiritual journey. There a few typos in the kindle version but I got past those pretty easily.Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Two books in one. Till We Have Faces is divided into two \\"books\\" representing the protagonist Orual's movement from the logic of Greece to the metaphysical realm of the gods. Based on the myth of Psyche, the first Book outlines Orual's journey from ugly sister to righteous queen in Lewis's own doggerel medieval English. Book Two recounts Orual's visions and her quest for a true face, written in a profoundly metaphorical yet almost tactile description of mystical experience. Two books for two sisters, two states of being, two kinds of love. What makes Lewis so special is the way he persistently locates and beautifully depicts a kind of overlap, a special domain free of the duality that structures his novel and haunts the West. Allegory is the calculus of his special unified field, especially the extended allegory that is book two, in which Lewis describes the metaphysical and physical as one inseparable reality. It's breathtaking--almost worth slogging through the 250 pages of leaden prose better known as Book One. Maybe this is further proof that sacrifice is necessary for salvation. Or maybe Lewis just writes better allegorical fantasy than historical fiction."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is truly one of the most moving and epic stories I have ever read. Orual and Psyche can come to represent any one of us in our everyday lives. A journey of moral development, coping with jealousy, and sibling love and rivalry. This is possibly the greatest of Lewis's works. Anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia is sure to love Till We Have Faces"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Save for the science fiction trilogy, this was Lewis's only venture into adult fiction, and he considered it his best work. Unfortunately, reviews at the time were tepid, and, daunted, he did not try again. This is a shame, as the novel is a brilliant read, and should acquire classic status. The story is told by Orual, Psyche's ugly sister, and it is her voice, at once erudite and lucid, that lends the novel its charm and power. Lewis made one mistake: he added a section at the end tying the novel closer to the myth. The first section forms a perfect whole. My advice: read the second section once, but discard it on subsequent readings."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I have now read this book about ten times. If you are intrested in greek myth, or the human mind, or in a great story, then read this book. Lewis at his best."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book was recommended by a friend. Having read the story of Psyche in Greek mythology, the grittiness of this version surprised and delighted me. I preferred it very much. M.

This was a bit different, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Not what I expected but still a good read. Unlike some of Lewis's other works, this book does not have such obvious links to Christian theology since it is based on Greek polytheism. However, the book does deal with the theme of how our limited knowledge of God and ourselves means we cannot often understand why difficult events in our lives happen from a theological perspective. If Lewis's Narnia books are a fable version of \\"Mere Christianity\\" then \\"Till we Have Faces\\" is loosely a fable version of \\"The Problem of Pain\\"."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Considering that at the time I'm writing this review, it's had over 150 five-star reviews, I hesitate to add another little voice to the huge chorus, but here it is.

Whenever I meet someone I like a lot - I give them a copy of TILL WE HAVE FACES..."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The first time I read Till We Have Faces, upon finishing the last page I immediately returned to the first page and began reading it again, something I have felt compelled to do only one other time in my life. It was Lewis's last work of fiction and, in spite of being written in first person from the viewpoint of ancient queen in a largely mythical past, his most personal. His deepest thoughts on God and faith are entwined throughout the story, though it is certainly not an allegory, even in the less formal modern sense which encompasses the Chronicles of Narnia. Certainly metaphors and symbols abound (readers familiar with Lewis's life will see a certain level of autobiography in the tension between the Old Fox and the priests of Ungit) but they often flow along complicated currents. Lewis once said that life is like a tree that branches out as it reaches towards perfection, not a pool that gathers towards unity. Till We Have Faces represents the highest branches, arrived at in the last chapter of the author's life."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This was nothing short of amazing. I have yet to read anything by Lewis that did not amaze me. For some strange reason I've been looking for this, and BOOM! I ran into it, and I had to pick it up. The title doesn't really give too much away as of what to expect. Then I read the back cover, (uh-huh, 2 sisters, and one is ugly, and it is set in the backdrop of Glome. OK! Cupid also plays a role in this) and not really knowing that much about myths, I basically cracked the first page and uttered to myself, \\"Here goes!\\" I knew that this had to be something good: I just had to find out what it might be. You talk about the old saying, \\"More than meets the eye...\\" Uh, YEAH!So Orual is embittered because Psyche is loved by a great lover. Sounds simple, maybe a little too simple, but it isn't all that simple! Some may call Orual jealous, maybe even self-possessed when it comes to Psyche. What the heck is Lewis trying to say here? He always paints a picture, but what did he bring to the canvas this time? Take a closer look, a good look, and you'll be looking in the mirror. What? Yeah, I felt like putting it down a few times. But I know I would've missed something very revealing. How obsessed are we with ourselves? We are strange creatures! This time it is beyond special, and a favorite work of C.S. Lewis. One of his personal favorites!Nothing will really prepare you for what is to come. A king, a knight, maybe even a servant or two? That doesn't even crack the surface! Being a myth retold (as the title suggests), you might even say that the gods come into play. In short, I found this to be some heavy stuff. I believe I found it heavy because Lewis never offers the easiest of answers. Yeah, leave this alone if you seek an easy popcorn read. This is meant to get into the head a little. It's also meant to prick the heart just a little bit more!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I'm not a big C.S. Lewis fan. He writes well, but I dont really care for his overall stories. However, TWHF is a book that even readers who dont like Lewis' normal over-the-top christian themes can enjoy. I know I did."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. The protagonist is angry at the gods for the problems in her life. She questions their existence and condemns them for their arbitrary nature due to the difficulties that she faces.As I read this work I could see many of less desirable traits I possess in the protagonist. I, like many people I suppose have bemoaned &quot;why me&quot; and &quot;when oh Lord is it my turn&quot;. Reading this book provides a mirror of such emotions.I highly recommend this work for anyone but especially for someone who might wish to indict the Gods."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"To put into words how I feel about Till We Have Faces is an impossible task. It would be easier to put into words abstract feelings, than describe to you the pure genius of this book. C.S. Lewis is truly a master storyteller, and his magically gripping ability to involve the reader from the very first page is truly unparalleled. If you have ever want to read a book that can relate to your life this book is it. Till We Have Faces is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read. The story of Orual is a story of extremes. The book at points takes on many aspects of a psychological thriller in much the same fashion as Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Orual is constantly being pulled by different characters that represent the extremes of her own mind. The internal strife of having to deal with issues surrounding her sister Pschye, propels Orual on a voyage of self-discovery, that in the end shows her the true nature of life, happiness, beauty, and self-worth. Lewis employs some great techniques to get his points across to the reader. On the surface and the obvious level, Lewis gives the reader a great story about an ugly sister, great love for her goddess like beautiful sister. The story contains sword fights, wars, famines, death, sacrifice, gods, goddesses, and natural disasters. All the ingredients necessary to make a great page turning novel. However, just beneath the story lies Lewis attempt to make a statement. That statement being: Self Worth is not measured by beauty but actions and the person themselves. The book in the interpretive sense is very much a story about the trial and tribulations one must endure on this earth, and why they must be endured. Lewis will always be a great author. Generations from now his stories will be considered classics. Stories such as the Chronicles of Narnia will always be considered Lewis's greatest works. I feel that Till We Have Faces could easily join the ranks of Lewis's greatest books. Not only that it is a must read for anybody. The book itself is easy to follow and comprehend. The youngest of children could pick up on the moral that Lewis is presenting to us in this book, yet the wisest of adults could find deep and meaning insights into life and love also. The book truly contains something for everyone, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I personally sat down and didn't get back up until I had read the entire novel."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Look, forget any praises of the book you have heard because it \\"has strong female characters\\" or because it's not \\"in-your-face Christian apologism.\\" There are lots of things to praise about this book, but those two praises are entirely misplaced.For one thing, as long as we're discussing Lewis's improved!female characters - so far as I'm concerned, Orual is Lewis's typical example of any soul that is still prideful, in all of its grubbly and idiotic self-will (but she can use a sword well, so that will be enough for some). Psyche is someone who has conquered that self-will, but most would see her as a goody two-shoes saint. Asnit is a wife and widow - and that's about all. Redival is a typical Lewisian villain, almost absurdly sneaky and two-faced, with the added femmy element of being boy-crazy. And a magnificent fighting queen farther north is mentioned - once. I'm not saying I have anything against it on these grounds. But it's absurd to come to \\"Till We Have Faces\\" looking for a feminist book.As for the idea that this book has less overt Christianity for the non-Christian reader to swallow - well, superficially, the gods in this book are all pagan. But there are large whacks of this book I imagine I would have found very boring before my conversion - boring, melodramatic, and vague. In fact, Christian point of view aside, the two conversations between Orual and Psyche in the Shadowbrute's valley could have used an editor's red pen. The views of the Fox and Bardia (who are both good, loving men nevertheless) are examples of the ways believers can be fuddled and led astray. And towards the very end Orual is using blatantly Christian verbage: \\"I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?\\"Of course, anyone could read it, and many enjoy it. For example, the \\"worldly\\" parts of the book are very interesting from any viewpoint - life under the temperamental petty king (who, seemingly, would have found in Henry VIII a kindred spirit), the purchase of the Greek captive Fox, who becomes the girls' tutor, the skirmishes between the King and the Priest of Ungit, veiled Orual learning to fence and challenging a king in combat (with Fox saying that its \\"foolish and, what's more, unseemly\\"!), and the details of the Queen's busy and shrewd reign. And we've all been trained to appreciate Greek pagan aesthetics, so that's another element to the book anyone will like - Lewis is rich (perhaps overrich) and pretty in his symbols and pictures and visions for Orual.But this is a morality to Orual's eventual, mature judgment of herself that not everyone is going to share. For example, not everyone would have thought it shameful to admit that she (at one point!) appreciated and even encouraged Prince Trunia's flirtacious banter. For those who do, of course, it's a rich dimension to the book.The details of life in Glome are well-envisioned and enjoyable.So why did I give this three stars? I love Lewis's nonfiction works, but I've yet to read one of his fictional ones that didn't leave something to be desired (mind, I haven't yet read Perelandra). Perhaps because he is sometimes trying to be too allegorical, his characterizations usually suffer. Several in \\"Till We Have Faces\\" are maddeningly flat. This is the best fictional work of Lewis's I've ever read. But it's far from the best fictional work I've ever read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I wanted to finish the book since so much more reading is piling up. As it is I stay up late doing my Bible reading by flashlight. So I just finished the book. I read the last half in about 2 days. I should know better than to do that. Reading deep stuff so quickly always makes me cry.I found myself crying at the end, because it was my story, my prayer. The whole story, as I guess Lewis intended, and Orual's final prayer. \\"Long did I hate you, long did I fear you,\\" she says at the very end. Oh God, that was so me! Now, 10+ years after reading this the first time, I understand. I understand so clearly. It moves me to tears. How could I have been so blind for so many years?I had always thought of Ungit as somehow good. Gods have to be good, right? I never saw that she was a metaphor for all that was ugly and sinful in us - a profane love that was not really love.It is odd to read this book through new eyes. We are Psyche. What that means I do not know. But reading this book a second time I see many of the layers I missed the first time. This is not like the Narnia series where the metaphors are often easy. This is a hard, deep book, meant for adults. I see many Christian metaphors I missed the first time because my head was with HER instead of Him. It's like how I used to read the Bible and it never made sense. Then, after I became a Christian, it became the most wonderful book and I began to study it with new eyes, and saw many things I'd overlooked before.And still I feel I've missed so many nuances in the book. Many things, I think, have double meanings. Lewis was a master with words. Something will have a meaning in the book, and another, deeper, Christian meaning.All of this went over my head the first time. I didn't understand a tenth of what Lewis was trying to convey. I guess I did not have a face then; I was not ready to listen to the truth, both the truth about me, and the truth about God (there's that double meaning again!).I could go on forever. There's not time nor space enough to write everything Lewis wove into this story. All I know is I thank God for showing me my life in these pages. The girl who was first handed the book was Orual, not able to hear the truth, not yet ready for the answer that would unmake her, change her. I know I'm not perfect. I won't truly have a face until the day I die and stand before God. But every day I die a little and become more the woman God wants me to be. \\"Long did I hate you, long did I fear you.\\" But no more. No more."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This could be Lewis' fiction masterpiece.So many themes converge in this work - it's like a cut jewel in a bright light: look at it from a slightly different angle, and a new facet will sparkle before your eyes.There's the theme of redemption. The backdrop of the Cupid and Psyche myth. The 13th chapter of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. Gender. Jealousy. Power. The fragility and brokenness of human nature. Pride. The variation of St. Augustine on the last page: \\"Long did I hate you.\\"For me, this is perfect story-telling, intertwined with powerful Christian teaching - yet it's all done so delicately, with such a light touch.If you're new to C.S. Lewis, I don't know that I would make this the first book of his I'd read. Not that it's difficult, but it's so much richer - you'll see many more facets of the jewel - if you've read Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Problem of Pain, The Four Loves, or Miracles. At least re-read this one after you've read some of them."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I first picked this book up as a child. My mom had read it in a course on C. S. Lewis in college, and remembered it as good, although she told me it was very confusing. Now, years later, after having read this fine novel a number of times, I would describe it not so much confusing as so multi-layered that the reader can get lost at first among them. This is not a failing, however, but a great strength that has made this novel very well received among critics and those who have read it. Unfortunately, relatively few people, including fans of Lewis' other works, have ever even heard of Till We Have Faces, much less read it.Why is this? Maybe some think it looks boring; just one more retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth, with perhaps a few twists, but essentially the tale we all learned in high school Greek mythology. This is far from the truth. C. S. Lewis uses the myth as a basis for exploring history, and issues ranging from God to family interactions to faith, and ultimately redemption. The story builds slowly throughout, and eventually gains so much emotional momentum that you feel simultaneously drained and uplifted when you finish the final page. If you want a novel that makes you think about more than superficial topics, and is in actuality highly original, then I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a magnificently textured work, a tale of self-discovery and epiphany. The central character, Orual, is the ugly and seemingly unlovable daughter of a cruel monarch (her father hits her for sport and calls her 'goblin daughter'). She is loved, however, by a spiritual-emotional triumvirate: Psyche's compassion, the Fox's conscience, Bardia's courage. It's interesting that Lewis retells the Psyche myth from the point of view of the stepsister. Orual's perspective allows the reader to experience and question the things she does on an intimate level. Her journey matches that of many people who feel a sense of inadequacy and spiritual longing. Fox is her tutor and voice of reason, a captured Greek fond of quoting philosophy and giving lip service to the gods. He's the agnostic of Orual's life. Bardia, the captain of the guard, provides Orual with the skills to defend herself, allowing her to go from shrinking violet to warrior queen. Psyche is the true believer. She has seen the gods, but finds that convincing Orual is futile. Orual longs to be with the beautiful, but fears what she will find. Her belief is a forced one, a faith through fear, and therefore she can't see clearly what Psyche sees. It is not until the end of her life that she sees clearly: &quot;I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?&quot; This evokes the words of St. John, &quot;we know that, when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him just as He is.&quot;Lewis uses language the way it was meant. He eschews flowery prose; rather he conveys the complexity of emotions in a simple yet not simplistic fashion. He provides profundity and clarity both, not merely one to the exclusion of the other. The mysteries of the spiritual are always seen more deeply and clearly in great works of literature. Till We Have Faces is one of those works."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"When you pick up this book and begin reading, you might labor at first, trying to get through the beginning chapters, but then the story begins to grow on you and the more you read the more involved you become in what is unfolding. Lewis has a style that is patient, not premature as to move too quickly to the climax, but savoring all the details in order to develop, in the long run, a wonderfully elaborate and captivating tale.This book is a retelling of an all too famous mythological tale of love (between Cupid and Psyche). While Lewis adds his own spices, the story essentially remains the same. It is a tale of love, sadness, fascination of beauty, betrayal, regret, shame, depravity, and finally triumph. The story centers around two sisters, the older very ugly, and the younger, half-sister, very beautiful. Their father, a king, demonstrates his impatience at not having an heir (a son) and he (the father) torments his daughters for being just what they are, daughters. However, the eldest daughter, Orual, is very ugly in appearance, while the youngest daughter, Psyche, is the most beautiful in the whole region, and the story mainly centers around these two characters and what evolves into a tragedy and at the same time a triumph of decisions, emotions, thoughts, and actions (I don't want to give too much of the story away).Even though this is a story that has already been told, Lewis adds his own dimensions to it and gives it a refreshing type of life and vigor. If you are a fan of Lewis' writings then you will certainly enjoy this work. However, even if you have never read Lewis, you will still enjoy this masterful piece. Unfortunately, this piece from Lewis, has not received the attention and status as a great piece of literature that it deserves. This is an intense and very eloquent novel which is, I believe, one of the greatest of this century."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I've only read this book once. I devoured it, and now I am just waiting for some time in my crazy schedule to sit down, pick it up again, and let it seep into my soul.Lewis subtly carves the most blunt, honest questions of the human soul into the woodwork of this masterfully-retold Greek myth. On the first read, the plot will keep your attention. On the second, the text will veritably explode with parallels galore to the Christian life...indeed, to life itself. Not meant to be an all-encompassing theological expos&eacute;--just a long, gritty, detailed look into the human psyche and its relation to God.If you have ever questioned God; ever doubted his goodness; ever raged against him; ever endured Job-like terrors that he seems to do nothing about, this book is for you. If you wonder why he utters no answer, why he hints and hovers and never shows himself clearly--here is your commiseration. I hope you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I bought Till We Have Faces based only on a familiarity with the Narnia chronicals that I read as a kid. Knowing nothing of the &quot;classic myth of Cupid and Psyche&quot;, I let this book sit on my bookshelf for months before I opened it one rainy day. What a mistake! I was drawn in by Lewis' elegant, simple story of two sisters and how their relationship colors their lives. The plot and characterization are accessible to the casual reader, but the allegorical relationship to the ancient myth gives it deeper meaning. This is one of the rare novels which nourishes your soul while providing pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces was a fascinating and well-written book which explored the darker side of love. Telling the story of Psyche from the perspective of her sister Orual, the book plunges into the exploration of a jealousy caused not by hate, but by love. The author crafts his story skillfully, and in a gripping manner, leads the reader through a journey within to discover that it is often love, not hate, that is the most dangerous enemy of all to the human soul. In the classic story of Psyche, Psyche's two sisters ruin her life with the wind god because they are jealous of her beautiful palace and riches. It is the most obvious form of jealousy and that to which much that goes on in this world is attributed. Lewis uses this typical background story with typical motivations to expose a deeper, more complex motivation where the other is thought to be. Rather than jealous of Psyche because she is luckier than her sisters, Lewis shows Orual to be jealous for Psyche because of her great, undying love. In one sense, Orual is jealous not of Psyche, but of her husband, the wind god, because he has taken from her the one person she loved the most. The idea of jealousy when a loved one is taken away is common in literature. Yet typically, this jealousy arises from a more selfish standpoint in which it is not pure love only which causes the jealousy, but loved mixed with something else, such as dependency in the case of a lost parent, or lust in the case of a lover. Orual's love, on the other hand, is unaffected by such circumstances as these, and the jealousy that arises cannot justly be attributed to them. It is likely that Lewis chose to characterize her emotions thus in order to portray that it is not merely love combined with other emotions that can be dangerous, but that the purest, simplest form of love itself can be a deadly weapon of demise. It is because of Orual's deep rooted love for Psyche that she convinces her to betray her husband. Psyche's other sister Redival is jealous of her in the traditional sense - envious of her beauty and wonderful luck - but Lewis dismisses the power of this harmless, surface jealousy by leaving Redival out of the picture when Orual goes to visit Psyche in her new home. The most that Redival and the townspeople can to to hurt Psyche is to offer her up to the dark, mysterious goddess of the earth Ungit, as a sacrifice. While they do this with somewhat dubious intentions, the action, lacking the dangerous force of love, merely ends up benefitting Psyche, sending her to a higher plane of life with the gods. In contrast, Orual's pure love brings only misery and causes Psyche to fall from her life of ease and happiness with the god of wind. Psyche as a result loses her husband and is condemned to wander the earth for a period of time. Because of her love, Orual is the only one who has this power over Psyche, as she discovers near the end of the book. It is Orual, Psyche's best friend and biggest fan, who places the biggest roadblocks in her path to happiness and diety. Thus Lewis creates a picture in which the roles of hatred and love are reversed so that hatred brings Psyche closer to life with the gods while love draws her away from it. This picture exposes a very revealing attitude about the gods. Lewis, though Christian, creates a powerful and fascinating characterization of the polytheistic gods of the time of Greek and Roman myths. The gods Lewis uses in this story represent the different sides of human nature. Ungit, the main goddess whose influence is felt the most by the people of the kingdom, is characterized not by light, truth and goodness, but by darkness, formlessness, and hatred. She consumes rather than gives, and is jealous and greedy rather than altruistic and sacrificing. While the wind god and others draw kinder pictures of humanity, it is Ungit, representative of mankinds evil or dark side, that predominates. It is she, too, that demands the sacrifice of Psyche. However, it is because of this demand that Psyche is able to marry the god of the wind, and later to achieve the rank of a goddess herself. Thus evil propels Psyche higher and higher, while the wind god, representative of joy and love, serves to propel Psyche downward, ejecting her from his palace and forcing her to roam the earth in agony. However, a provision is made for Psyche's agony. Rather than falling on the innocent Psyche, Psyche's agonies are placed on the back of Orual, who feels the real pain in every instance. Thus the real danger of Orual's love is not to the one she loves, but to herself as she suffers vicariously every ill that befalls Psyche.Till We Have Faces is a complex book with many interpretations and levels of meaning. It is a book which requires a great deal of thought to delve into the inner motivations and intentions of the author. However, it is well worth the effort it requires. The story is gripping and I found myself within the first twenty pages unable to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a creative, fascinating, and deeply moving novel. It is one of the best books I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It tricks the reader into sympathizing with the supposed oppressed. Then it rips out your heart as it shows that the oppressed is truly the oppressor. The real sting of it all is that it reveals the oppressor within each of us. Each of us is wrapped within the confines of our own experience. Each of us, like Lewis' Orual, tends to see only our own challenges. Each of us tends to most hurt the ones we love. Are we alert enough, focused enough on other's needs to live the truly &quot;good life?&quot;The greatness of Till We Have Faces is not that it hits us with a self-convicting surprise. Its greatness is in showing how prevalent the problem is. Even those of us with the greatest of intentions are infected by self-interest and sin. Read Till We Have Faces--it is a life-changing book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis seems to be giving the same message of Christian love in all of his literature, but he does it far more powerfully in 'Till We Have Faces' than in any of his other novels, essays, or poetry. 'Faces' is particularly effective because of its wide accessibility.The story is essentially a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, although no familiarity with the original story is required to enjoy the novel. Orual is the oldest--and by far the ugliest--of three princesses. Istra, or Psyche, is the youngest and most fair and pure. When Istra is married to the invisible and enigmatic God of the Mountain, son of Ungit, a powerful and jealous goddess, Orual finds herself unable to accept Istra's complacency with a life filled with comforts that are invisible and undetectable to anyone but Istra and her husband. She plots to destroy Istra's happiness, masking her true intentions behind a veil of sisterly concern much like she later veils her ugly face from the world.Orual is at once a remarkably unique character and an \\"everywoman.\\" She personifies the universal weaknesses of pride and possessiveness while tempering her negative qualities with a strong sense of justice, a confidence born of her veiled ugliness, and all the other attributes one would expect to find in a great queen. Orual's narrative is full of excuses, and all but the most hardened readers will be sorely tempted to listen to them. After all, this warrior queen is torn between the world of reason presented to her by her beloved Greek tutor and the dark, bloodthirsty religion of her pagan upbringing. It's hard to blame her for her uncertainty and manipulation of the innocent Istra. She rails against the gluttonous, possessive goddess Ungit while, at the same time, becoming Ungit herself as her jealousy and confusion over her sister's good fortune and happiness combines with her growing power to turn her into a minor goddess in her own right.The story is essentially about a convert to Christianity (Istra) who has found joy in something that simply doesn't seem to real to non-believers. Orual, who lacks her sister's faith, can not understand Istra's dedication to her invisible god. Eventually, Orual comes to see herself unveiled and naked at last. It is only then, as Istra sacrifices all to bring Orual the greatest possible gift, that the old queen understands the futility of her possessive love.This book is a beautiful and sometimes painful examination of what it means to truly love another person. Many readers will find themselves feeling ashamed after reading the book, yet longing to read in again at the same time. Lewis' oft repeated message rings so true (ironically in a story that takes place in a pre-Christian setting) in the pages of this, his greatest novel, that everyone, Christian or not, can appreciate its power."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C. S. Lewis has created a masterpiece in Till We Have Faces, the retelling of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. The first time I read it, I thought it was amazing but did not understand it. The second time I read it I thought it was perhaps the best book I had ever read because I did understand it. Lewis takes 1 Corinthians 13:12, \\" For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known,\\" and makes this his theme, masterfully weaving this theme into the story of Cupid and Psyche. Orual is the protagonist, the ugly sister of Psyche who is vilified in the traditional telling of the story. Lewis retells the story from her perspective, and through her questions about the justice of the gods are raised. In this book, Lewis rewrites in fiction what he wrote in the Problem of Pain, and in a much more eloquent mannor. Through Orual he asks the questions raised against Christianity and by Christians: why do bad things happen to me, where are the gods, why are the gods punishing me, etc. It is so well written that it is a great read even if you do not understand what Lewis is saying. It is all the better if you do.A good number of previous reviewers have glorified the fact that this is not as openly Christian as Lewis' Narnian Chronicles. I fail to see why this makes it so much of a better book. The reason that this book is better is not that it is not as Christian, but that it goes so much deeper into the questions of Christianity than his other books tend to (with some exceptions). It is not that he leaves off talking about Christianity, he simply approaches it from a different angle in this book. Most of what is said of the \\"gods\\" can be looked at as talking about \\"God.\\" He simply set his story in a polytheistic setting, so talk of the gods was necessary, and it would hardly do to have openly Christian conversations when the setting is way before the life of Christ.Lewis said that he deemed this to be his greatest work. I am very inclined to agree with him.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I find myself recommending this work more than any other of Lewis' fiction. It is a painting of general revelation, where Lewis builds on the ideas within The Last Battle, where a character who has always worshipped the demon god Tash finds that he so loved Tash with true love, that he was actually worshipping Aslan, whom he never personally met. In Till We Have Faces, Lewis looks at how someone could come to Christ who lived at the time of the Israeli kings, far to the North, in a country where the protagonist, Orual, could not possibly know anything of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It is two love stories in one, building on the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, to explore how Jesus woos us to love Him with all that we are- each in different ways, in a personal relationship.The book is mythic in style, and the beginning has a feel of timelessness and legend. Orual and her sister, Psyche, grow up together, learning about the ways that men objectify and treat women based on their appearance- for a woman, appearance is everything in the eyes of their society. (Somewhat familiar.) And then Psyche finds a mysterious man, that Orual knows nothing of.Through the wooing of the mysterious stranger, Orual and her sister Psyche learn to more fully love others. And because of the focus on female characters, this is some of Lewis' most feminist work- strong female characters who think and develop and become complete, and completely heroic."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is an excellent, exciting book. It is an interesting story with a much bigger underlying message waiting for you at the end.

To anyone who enjoys Lewis' works or this fantasy type of story, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I read Till We Have Faces for a book report in high school.

I just finished it and I don't have words to describe the power Lewis' symbolism has. His language, word choice and the message are amazing. Read it...you'll love it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C. S. Lewis' novel Till We Have Faces is highly thought provoking. It is a remake of the Greek myth about Psyche and Cupid. The tale is told from the perspecitve of Orual, the sister of Psyche. It involves her inner struggles over love and loss. Orual is pitifully ugly. She is told so from the day that she understands what the word means. In contrast, her younger sisters, Redival and Psyche, are beautiful. She must deal with the daily comparisons that are made between them. She tries to distance herself from jealousy, but the reader can see how close to the line she actually treads. On the surface, her actions seem to portray unconditional love for Psyche. Yet as the story progresses, the reader becomes puzzled by the strange love that Orual shows Psyche. Orual is near homicide in her love. For example, Orual goes to search out Psyche on the mountain (an act of love), yet when she finds her and realizes her happiness she can't control herself (jealousy). She seems to be upset that Psyche, who once worshipped her, was now subject to a new &quot;lord.&quot; Orual cannot stand the competition for Psyche's love. Unconditional love would place Orual is ecstasy that her Psyche is so happy. That leaves the reader with the question &quot;Is pure love peaceful or stormy?&quot; The story also shows Orual's struggles to reach perfection. She constantly compares herself to people that she deems perfect and imperfect. This tempest that is beating in Orual's mind adds the question, &quot;What is perfection, and how does one achieve it?&quot; As the tale progresses and she gets older, Orual realizes that perfection has nothing to do with outer beauty, but rather inner beauty and the works that a person performs during his or her life. She discovers that all her life she has been searching for something that has always been inside her. The story is easy to read, but the symbolism is hard to decipher. The second book is also quite confusing. It is in this book that the psychological aspects of the tale are brought out. The whole story is rounded off in this section. I liked the book and would recommend it, but with a warning. It is easy reading, but if one is trying to analyze the text in depth, he or she must do just that. The reader must dig down deep in the heart of the story to understand it completely. I don't think that it is a normal work for C. S. Lewis. The meaning in it is different than that of the Chronicles of Narnia. I don't think that this book was specifically written for children, as was the Chronicles of Narnia. I found the book powerful and inspirational. If we could all realize in the beginning of our lives what it took Orual an entire lifetime to realize, we would lead happier and more productive lives. We would be satisfied with our talents and ourselves. In this way, the world would hopefully become a better place in which to live."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"probably one of the most incredible books that I've ever read. Read most of his works, but this one is incisive and piercing every time I revisit the agony of reality it presents. &quot;Lekhem panim&quot; in hebrew refers to the bread of G-d's presence, but literally translated is &quot;bread of faces&quot; and resides in the Holy Place. Something that we need for the nourishment of our souls, and CS Lewis is definitely the consumate baker."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of the most amazing writers of our time. He tells this story with haunting descriptions and a raw honestly. No aspect of a charecter is hidden. This is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I had read many C. S. Lewis books before this one, so I was expecting it to be a pretty good book. I was surprised, though, with how much his writing style had changed from his other books. I felt like I wasn't reading a book at all, but rather was being told the story. It was more of a tale, than a novel.The difference for me between a good book and a nice story is what happens after you put the book down. After reading a nice story, we immediately go about other business. A good book will make you think all the way through it, and even after you've put it down. A good book will help you discover things about yourself that you didn't know, or hadn't realized. That is what Till We Have Faces did for me. I found as I was reading, that I had acted in the past more like Orual than I wanted to. I struggled with her character because it was such an accurate reflection of the way that I had seen things. I have changed since then, but it was amazing how C. S. Lewis was able to portray a character that was so well-thought out and so accurate.The book is neither easy reading, nor hard reading. It is somewhere in between. At first glance, the book seems like it would be as easy to read as a child's book, but with all of the description, imagery, thoughts, feelings, and emotion that Lewis put into it, you can't help but slow down. There is so much more going on than the story alone would denote. There is the conflict with Orual and others, the conflict between Orual and herself, and finally- and you only get this in good books-the conflict between Orual and the reader. I don't often find myself making vocal comments to fictional characters, but I did several times during the course of the book. With every little nuance of character that Lewis puts in this novel, you'll want to do yourself a favor and allow time for reflection.Maybe the greatest part about this book-and this can be said of all great literary works-is that every time you are going to get something different out of it. It addresses so many topics that you could probably spend a whole college course just identifying and talking about what each one says. You might barely scratch the surface even then. This time I was focused on Orual's jealousy at losing what she felt was her rightful possession, the next time it may not be.The approach that Lewis decided to take with the story was an interesting one. In the original myth of Psyche and Cupid, Psyche's sisters (Orual and Redival) see their sister's happiness and the life that she lives, and they want to destroy it all because they don't want her to be better than them. It is simply a matter of pride. Lewis takes a different route, though. In Till We Have Faces, Redival isn't even really part of the story and Orual's jealousy of Psyche's happiness is not motivated by hate, but by love. Orual raised Psyche almost as her own daughter and loved her with all her heart. But, she can't stand the idea of Psyche being loving anyone but herself. Throughout almost the entire book, Orual justifies her selfishness by placing herself as the victim. This was an interesting choice by Lewis because we, as humans, often do the same. Orual is so convinced that anything good for her is good for Psyche, that she practically destroys all happiness that Psyche has. Selfish motivations blind her into believing that she is doing Psyche a favor by destroying her marriage to the god on the Grey mountain. Orual uses every kind of manipulative technique throughout the book to get what she wants. She not only destroys Psyche's life, but everyone who surrounds her, including herself. Orual commits the biggest sin when she lies to herself, telling herself that she's doing all of this for her sister, that her sister could be making the biggest mistake of her life, and that Psyche's happiness is foolish. Orual is dripping with the &quot;if only she could see things the way I do, the right way&quot; attitude. It makes me sick, but mostly because as I stated above, it hits so close to home. Any book that can bring emotions out of you as strongly as it did to me is either a literary masterpiece or a piece of trash. I promise you that this book is the former, and not the latter.I can't say I was pleased with the whole book, though. It is broken up into two parts. The first takes up about 9/10 of the book, and the second only 1/10. In the second part, Orual pretty much redeems herself for all the evil and sinful deeds she's done throughout the previous 250 pages. To me, this ending was completely unsatisfactory. It turns Orual into a hero, sets everything right. I didn't buy it for too reasons. One, it was way too easy. Orual's penance in no way made up for the horrible things she'd done. And two, it was a little to abstract for me. It didn't match the first section of the book, but was all dreams and visions. The second part let me down. I would have liked an ending based a little more in reality. I just couldn't relate to the second part.The second part notwithstanding, it was a great book. A good investment of time for anyone I would say. It's not perfect, but it doesn't pretend to be. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a very thought-provoking good book. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This books is amazing. It offers faith to the sceptic and traces Lewis' own path of belief.

The story really draws you in and you feel you are really living in the harsh olden-times in which this book is set. The book finishes in typical C.S.Lewis fashion with a 'happy-ever-after' Christian theme. There is a strong Christian thread in the 2nd-half of the book, but it is more like an historical myth in the first half. There is a magic and a wonder about the story which shows Lewis at his best. The heroine of the book is made to see her motives for what they really were and herself as she really is, but everything works out well at the very end!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I love this book even though the ending confused the heck out of me.

Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"It is generally agreed among students of Lewis's works that, while _Perelandra_ is preferable on an emotional favorite (and Lewis's personal favorite), _Till We Have Faces_ is his masterpiece, and that the author himself thought so. There is a clear development in style, symbolism, and thought from _The Pilgrim's Regress_, Lewis's first book after his conversion, to _Till We Have Faces_, his last work of fiction (with the exception of a novel fragment and a few short stories). It demonstrates the deep influence of his wife, Joy Davidman, and the deep understanding of love which Lewis gained from their relationship. He always said that he wrote stories based on &quot;pictures&quot; he saw in his head, and books on Lewis report that he said the pictures stopped coming after Joy's death. The book is deeply psychological, and the three sisters in the story are representative of Plato's Tripartite Soul: Orual, the narrator, is the _Logos_ or the reason; Psyche is the _Thumos_, or the passions; and Redival is the _Bios_ or the animalistic passions. There is some historical reference to Henry VIII and Elizabeth I (Lewis's professional speciality was the Renaissance, and he wrote a text on _Sixteenth Century English Literature, Excluding Drama_). The book is based upon Apuleius' _Metamorphoses_, but adds a Christian level to the story. Like _The Space Trilogy_, it illustrates Lewis's belief, taken from St. Augustine's _City of God_, that the gods (small &quot;g&quot; is important) are not supreme beings, and are not incompatible with the God of monotheism. They are equivalent to angels and demons. So, in _Till We Have Faces_, the kingdom worships one major goddess, Aphrodite (standing for God the Father), her Son, Cupid (representing Christ), and a third figure embodied by the Wind (the Holy Spirit). The tree on which Psyche is sacrificed (&quot;the Blessed must be the Accursed&quot; -- the most holy person takes on the sins of the people). The other characters represent various influences: the King is the masculine stereotype"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retoldis the most novelistic of the many books by C. S. Lewis. But don't expect it to satisfy on that level. All of Lewis' fiction is an allegorical exploration of man's relationship to God. Till We Have Faces deals particularly with the question of why God seems so distant.The story is a carefully crafted version of the Greek myth of Psyche, a mortal woman who has a difficult romance with the god Eros. The point of view is that of a homely sister, Orual, who is consumed by unrecognized jealously at being ignored (as she supposes) by the gods. Over time, experience develops in her an independent spirit - a \\"face\\" of her own - that qualifies her to converse with God.I enjoyed this book much more 30 years ago, when the pleasant narrative and the dream-fantasy sequences were enough to carry the allegory. But in my latest reading, the relatively weak characterization and the lack of real challenge in the protagonist's life detracts from the effect.I respect C. S. Lewis highly as a clear-minded Christian theologian. But like princess Orual, his life experience was hardly rich enough to support the weight of his message."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The book we ordered was in good condition and I would purchase from this vender again."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I was assigned to read this book for an intensive wrinting course at brigham young university.

It seemed like high school all over again, and besides, i was still trying to finish &quot;King Lear&quot; by shakespeare. and i'm still struggling to finish it. But anyways, &quot;Till we have faces&quot; was a great book. I'm sure you don't want me to ruin the book for you, but i'll tell you that it was a great story, taken from the greek myth about psyche and cupid (if you haven't read the greek myth, you're still okay, and you won't get lost in the story). But the novel is about two sisters (they have a third, but she isn't important). One of the sisters is really ugly, and the other is beautiful. the town has a plague, and the beautiful daughter is to be the sacrifice for the plague to go away. so they decided to sacrifice her. Lots of things happen after that regarding the beautiful sister (psyche) and the ugly sister (orual). Orual eventually becomes the queen of the land and she's a good queen, does lots of wonderful things, but eventually she decides to write down her life story when she's very old. so she does. but eventually Lewis has to end the book (maybe he was tired) so orual dies, and the story's over. If you want to know the details of the book, you're just gonna have to read it yourself, because i don't want to ruin it by telling to much, because i'm afraid i already have, although i hope i haven't really.

Without even going into its ability to sum up one of the toughest questions of Chistianity, I would say Lewis wrote an imaginitive book that parrallells nothing I've read yet. His main character Orual, who is neither the protagonist nor antagonist, searches for the answer to why her god can allow evil into her world of ancient Rome. Lewis created such a realistic character in Orual that in the first section you sympathize with her adversities, but when you get to the second part you realize along with Orual that she and perhaps yourself have have been looking out an opaque glass at both yourself and the world around you. This in affect makes you question yourself and asks the supreme question of whether or not you truly have a face. Not only does this book so magically entertwine the subjects I have only touched the tip of the iceberg for, but C.S. Lewis also reaches out with all of his imaginative powers to grasp his readers in a lock they can't resist until they've finished his book.

Lewis allows the reader to taste unconditionally the unfathomable riches of the grace and mercies of God. George MacDonald's &quot;Phantastes&quot; is the only other novel that I've read that has moved me as deeply. My wife has also read this book and it has been something of substance to discuss, to try and understand it's deeper meaning in our lives, as this unique work of clarity and wisdom inspires one to do. I recall reading somewhere that Joy Davidman, Lewis's wife considered this his best ever work. I can't recommend this book enough as a rejuvenating experience for the spiritually disillusioned."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is a phenomenal book. It explores the themes of how we delude ourselves into believing that we are acting for another's good, while in fact we are acting only for our own. The plot begins relatively fast paced and engaging but by 1/3 of the way through the book, it slows remarkably and themes begin to be explored through more mundane encounters between the characters. About 2/3 of the way through the book, part II starts, which is more mundane encounters and everyday activities but the themes begin to change. Love that was seen as self-sacrificing is revealed to be self-serving and the reader experiences Lewis' invitation to step into deeper relational love. Truly an amazing, convicting book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis has said that he never wrote anything that he did not refer to something that George MacDonald wrote, or quote from him. The title in this book is the reference. In MacDonald's Lilith, there was a couple who were skeletons, stripped of the flesh, to learn how to depend on each other. Later, there was a sanctuary which had crumbled, stripped of it's building material, and left as a shell of roses, (the spirit of the sanctuary), which had covered the building. Into this shell, came dancers who were fully clothed and also fully clothed in flesh, except for their heads, which were fleshless bone, a gibbeous cranium, a faceless skull. These were the people who were learning how to be who they were, in death, the couple who didn't yet have enough humanity to have flesh, and the dancers, who had learned to be human, but who did not yet know or have thier individual identities, their faces. Read this book while first understanding Lewis's reference."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis' novel from 1956 is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, that painful allegory about love and passion and control and all of those conflicting human strivings that plague us all. It is the story of a king and his three daughters, one ugly, one normal and the youngest quite beautiful. It is the story too of the struggle of pure beauty against crude ugliness in the soul, as manifested in the outward appearances.It is the allegory of bodily love versus spiritual love. Such is the beauty of the youngest daughter that she becomes a goddess, worshipped and adored, but yet cursed by the jealousies of others. She is sacrificed to the dark powers of an underworld mentality on the altars of vain ambitions. As with any fine myth, this one surrounds itself with all the furniture of the human condition as it gives us the palace of life in which the main character, Orual, is separated by the base instinct of consuming love and blinding obsession to do right. When a plague hits the kingdom, the jealous gods and priesthood demands the sacrifice of their best, and their best is beautiful Istra. This is the kingdom of Glome (gloom) where Greek wisdom is peppered nonetheless with rumors of beasts and superstitions, as in real life. Psyche (Istra) disappears into the fringe land of legend after her sacrifice, but possessive sister Orual (also called Maia) pursues her ghost to the Mountains. Psyche tells her she has another love, something unseen by Orual, in a land also unseen. This separation of two close sisters is like a divorce of the two characteristics of human nature, love and hate.Ascending her father's throne, Queen Orual straightens up her kingdom but cannot straighten up herself. Even with the teachings of Fox and the swordsmanship of Bardia, she is helpless against her own dark drives. She finally brings her life grievance against the gods themselves, only to discover that her question of the unfairness of their ways is in reality the blindness of her own passions.Lewis is a master of allegory. It is also uncanny how he has narrated this story from the perspective of a woman who has lived almost exclusively in the realm of men. Orual watches as male priests try to expiate sin by oblations to the vague images of the stone goddess Ungit; then, as Queen, she sees one priest try setting up a beautiful statue of a Greek goddess with human likeness in place of the faceless one. A face has been given to the faceless mystery of sin. Thinking it an improvement, Orual reasons \\"I think I felt that an image of this sort would be somehow a defeat for the old, hungry, faceless Ungit whose terror had been over me in childhood.\\" But putting a face on her fears does not cure them.Like other great mythologies, he has woven a tale of combative elements which twist and turn within our own lives. It is difficult if not impossible to avoid the comparison here of a Christian life against a secular world. The illusive image of Psyche is a type of Christ, drawing us from the darkness of humanity towards the need for the redemption of deity. The voice of the gods is the voice of the Christ, and until we have put on our real face we cannot hear it or approach it. What we are tempted to accuse deity of is what we are most guilty of ourselves."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I received this book within a week of placing my order. The book was new, as promised, and looked wonderful. My daughter was so thrilled to receive it - she has been looking for this book for a long time! Thanks so much for the smile and thrilled look on Christmas morning!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Greek mythology has always had a place in my heart. I love to read the stories of the gods and goddesses and their interactions with the humans. I knew the story of Cupid and Psyche well. Or.... at least I thought I did until I read C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces.I am a big fan of Lewis and have read many of his works. This one took me by surprise. In fact, this does not follow the tradition of most of his writing, or does it?This is not just a story of Cupid and Psyche that many of us know so well. It is barely a story about them. It is more a story of those around the lovers. It is a soul-searching book of Psyche's jealous sister, Orual. Through her eyes and through her heart, we see the struggles of a woman who tries to find her own place in this world while feeling that all is given to her sister on a silver platter and she received a few crumbs. Her actions are so reflective of those that any man, woman, or child might do in a similar situation.Orual loves her sister with all her heart while hating the blessings that fall upon her at every turn. She longs to taste a little of that blessed life but realizes that it might be easier for Psyche to taste a little of hers. Realizing that Cupid is madly in love with Psyche pushes Orual over the edge. She gives Psyche that taste of her life and watches as her perfect world falls apart.Surprisingly, Orual finds herself not satisfied as she thought she would feel. Instead she battles with a guilt that leads her down a life-journey of the soul. Only then does she discover the truth.A wonderful read. It's not a light read for a lazy summer day. This is a read that will have you hooked and looking into your own soul before you finish the first chapter."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Glorious CS Lewis. Gripping fable of the story of Psyche. The most powerful psychological/spiritual message. A must read for Lewis fans, lovers of fiction, those on a serious spiritual journey, admirers of exquisite writing and story telling."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is my favorite book written by C.S. Lewis by far. This is, by far, the finest literary piece of work as well as the most mature insight in spirituality."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"A neat twist looking at it from the older sister's point of view. She truly believes she loves her sister. Her love like many of our loves is conditional and fear based. It isn't until she is compelled to write her story that the process of self-awareness takes hold and she goes through the myth herself. As she does this her true love for Psyche and all the others including herself grow as well."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I have read C.S.Lewis's many book but this is by far his best.Lewis weaves a tale of the Greek characters, Cupid and Psyche, through the eyes of Orual, Psyche's older half-sister.Orual is not attractive. Psyche is beautiful. Orual becomes Pysche's surrogate mother when Psyche's mother dies. Orual's love for Pyche, at first, seems beautiful and selfless. Slowly through the telling of her story, the reader begins to see that Orual's love for Psyche is ugly and selfish. Orual is obsessed with the need to love. She is obsessed with the need to be Pysche's all. It is this self-pitying, selfish love that C.S. Lewis carefully and fully extracts from Orual until we are finally face to face with her ugly reality.Til We Have Faces is Orual's bitter quest to get answers from the gods for unjustly taking Psyche from her and giving Psyche to the God of the Mountain. Orual comes face to face with the truth that Psyche is happy and content to be sacrificed to the God of the Mountain. Orual has to face the sad truth that she is not Psyche's all.The second part of this book is Orual's reckoning and reconciling.This book is good on so many levels."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Yet another classic book from THE classic Christian author. A beautifully told story with a beautiful, and eternally timely, moral."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"If the purpose of the author's pen is to immerse you into the experiences of the characters in a book, C.S. Lewis exceedingly succeeds. I for one love the way that Lewis uses the English language to twist, stretch, and connect unused and unthought of analogies. I quite often found myself repeating phrases that deserved more than a cursory scan. This is Lewis' most mature foray into allegorical literature and is an attestation to his humility and brilliance."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This has been called the best work of fiction by C.S. Lewis and I pretty agree with that assessment (my weakness for science fiction makes me rank his Space Trilogy higher than this work.) The characters are well-developed and memorable. What I think makes this work the best of Lewis' fiction is although he is writing to answer a spiritual question that he has, namely the problem of evil, he is more subtle in this work compared with the Narnia series (though that series' defense one must remember that they are children's books.) There is a lot of food for thought in this book, making it an excellent read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold is truly an inspired work. C.S. Lewis admits this himself, taking little credit for the masterpiece it is. It all began as he read Eros and Psyche, the original myth. While reading, he felt the inspiration that led to this work, the idea &quot;forced itself upon&quot; him. This idea worked its way into his mind allowing him to capture the beauty and power of the original myth, while intertwining the deeper theme of love.Till We Have Faces illustrates the contrast between a divine, unconditional love, and the frail thing we too often consider to be love. Three princesses live in the kingdom of Glome: Orual, Redival, and Pysche. C.S. Lewis stylistically portrays each daughter with varying degrees of love. Redival has a self-centered attitude that gives her the need to feel loved by others. Orual, is slightly less self-centered, needing others to feel her love and to be loved by them in return. Pysche has a true, divine love for others with little thought for herself. Throughout the piece, C.S. Lewis shows us the strengths and trials that each face, and their relative outcomes.Redival changes drastically through the work. As it begins, she is young and beautiful, but also self-centered. She seeks the attention and love of others, but doesn't receive it from her father or sisters, finding it only from young men. Throughout the play, there is a progression, until the end where she has lost her beautiful figure and become a respectable woman. She learns not to focus as much on herself; allow her love to develop towards others.Orual's love is a jealous love. She shows love to others for the purpose of feeling it in return. What she believes is love, in many instances is jealousy. The contrast between the jealous love of Orual and Pysche's pure love is obvious to the reader throughout the work, yet hidden to Orual. She even goes to the extreme of threatening to kill Pysche, all in the name of her supposed love. She doesn't realize that what she supposes to be love is mere jealousy. It isn't until she is able to see things from another point of view, as an observer of what she has done, that she begins to realize the frailty and weakness of her love.Pysche begins in the work as a beautiful young girl that takes little thought of herself. She struggles to be of service to others, desiring to help them out. But in return for her devotion and pure love for everyone, they turn against her. Their jealousy of her beauty and kindness, lead them to sacrifice her, rejoicing in her imminent death. This contrast and inconsistency in what we call love is beautifully displayed. It's difficult for us to recognize our weaknesses, especially when it comes to love. C.S. Lewis allows us to do just what Orual did, to look at life from an objective point of view, to take a step away from our narrow vision and see life from a new perspective. As we do so, it helps us understand how we can improve and develop a pure, true love the type of love that Psyche demonstrates.Few books have left me pondering so deeply; Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold is one of them. Just like Orual, I found how superficial my love for others truly is. Through his inspired piece, C.S. Lewis has given us objective means to measure our love, giving us an understanding of how we can improve the lives of others and our own through this pure love."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I must admit that the first time I read &quot;Till We Hae Faces,&quot; I could not comprehend it. It was only until I re-read it years later that I discovered the grandeur and the genius of Lewis' story. I guess it had to wait for me to read other books, including the friend of C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, whose hand is clearly seen in it.Orual sees herself as the victim in most of the book, until at the end she finds that she was the true opressor, not the gods that she accuses. &quot;You also are Psyche.&quot; says the god when she does her act of spite against her sister, thinking that she is only acting for her good.It reminds me of an epitaph Lewis once wrote:Erected by her sorrowing brothersIn memory of Martha Clay.Here lies one who lived for others;Now she has peace. And so have they. (Poems, p. 134)This has to be one of Lewis' best books, well worth reading. Orual does find her face in the end, in a stunning twist."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"&quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; lacks some of the traits which make us love Lewis' other works - it's un-English, un-donnish, it lacks his quirky sense of humour, it is not edifiying; yet there are a kind of coherence, a unity of tone and majestic pathos which make the novel impressive in a unique way. Above all, Lewis handles myth - the subtitle is &quot;A Myth retold&quot; - with a respect of which he alone among 20th century writers seems to be capable. There is no demythologizing, and yet the reader understands the implications, the power, and the tragedy of the myth of Psyche and Cupid in a completely new way.The story is told by Orual, Psyche's older sister; she is such an impressive and strong female character than one is surprised an utterly conservative man like Lewis could have created her. She rebels against the gods and the people who won't leave her beloved beautiful sister Psyche alone. - Telling more about what happens might spoil the reader's enjoyment of the book, so I won't do it. - Read this book and get to know a C.S. Lewis you have not met before; but above all you will enjoy a supremely crafted work of fiction."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The first time I read this novel, maybe twenty years ago, I was a bit disappointed. From Lewis, I expected Christian fantasy or philosophy. Who was this pagan god of the mountain who came to love Psyche? What was going on in the confusing dream-like sequences towards the end? Where is God in all of this?Now I love it. I've pushed it on other people, and found most &quot;got it&quot; faster than I. Some of my best Japanese students have read it in my first-year English reading class, and those who have, liked it. (I recommmend it to them partly because of the brilliant way Lewis depicts ancient Greek and tribal cultures and thought.) Some appreciate the insight and sensitivity with which Lewis depicted his female leading character. (Thanks, maybe, to his love at the time of writing for a woman of a similarly realistic and strong temperament.) One noted that &quot;This story will tell you how not just Orual but every mortal has an ugly soul.&quot; She told me that she'd been reading a bit about Greek philosophy, and the book was interesting for that reason, too. Another said she liked the single combat, admitting, &quot;I know it isn't the most important scene, but I just like it.&quot; A relative, to whom I gave a copy of the book, told me she read the whole thing (it's not that short) in one sitting.So I think there's a good chance you'll like the book, too. As for God, while He is hidden in this story, (as He often is in life) that hiddenness is another layer within the depth within depths that is this novel. I now tend to think Lewis deserved a Nobel Prize for writing it.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Be careful of the somewhat slow beginning because I almost didn't get into this book... and I am so glad I did.The story of Orual, the ugly sister and Psyche, the beautiful sister sneaks up on you. As the reader, you become more and more drawn into identification with Orual. Then CSLewis artfully reveals Orual's limits, slowly but surely, as Orual forces Psyche to go against everything Psyche understands. It takes an excellent story teller AND theologian to show the error of Orual's thinking and actions as inexorably as he does, and it is poignant to experience it as the reader, since you can't help but urge Orual to re-evaluate her position.Are Aslan and Chronicles of Narnia CSLewis' best representation of his theology? After reading Til We Have Faces, I'm no longer sure.One review I read before I decided to buy this book said that there were Christian overtones in a pagan setting. I would say that the Christian message is delivered loud and clear through Orual's life of struggle with her sister, father, and queenship.A great book, and you do not have to know the story of Psyche to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is a genius; I cannot say this emphatically enough.Till We Have Faces retells the traditional story of Cupid and Psyche. It does not mess with the storyline, but builds on it and makes it real and true, with live characters and so much detail. I would suggest being familiar with the original myth before reading it (it is written in the very back of the book) because I didn't understand just what was happening the first time I read the book through.The story is...beautiful. Amazing. It draws you heavily into the atmosphere of the time, into Orural's obsessive love of her sister, Istra (Psyche), hatred of her father the king, learning of philosophy through Fox, the Greek prisoner, and the fear of Ungit (Venus).Till We Have Faces offers so much insight - into holiness and love, among other subjects. It is interesting to see Lewis's work not directly relating to Christianity but through pagan mythology instead. I do not think I could compare the book to C.S. Lewis's other fiction; they are so entirely different in spirit. I will say that it is worth the read - worth many, many reads, for I notice new truths in Lewis's writing every time."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"that I have read Till We Have Faces. What an amazing book. Lewis had an uncanny knack for reaching in and grabbing hold. I must admit I started reading this book and couldn't stop. It made me feel a little bit like I was drowning, but I think it was wonderful excercise for my mind. I have so long been reading what is passing for Christian fiction that my brain had become numb. What a wonderful way to brush away the cobwebs and really dig in to something substantial. It made me uncomfortable to a degree, like something that hits just a little to close to home. Greedy, all-consuming, self-centered love at the expense of others, or worse at the expense of those you are supposed to love best. Ouch. I am a Lewis fan now and ever more."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"CS Lewis has created a wonderful unique view of the Eros and Psyche myth and transported his ideas into an awesome creative story just for all of us! The original plot of the myth has always appeared very didactic to me, especially for women who need to find the strength inside themselves to conquer the seemingly undaunting tasks which are necessary for a joyous reunion with their heart's truest desires. I believe this story takes this one step further and makes the focus of the myth about the unveiling of one's soul into a new light. The story's three main women (Ungit included) all hold some piece of the vieled soul (i.e. the ugly and shameful elements) inside and the unconscious quest that Lewis puts them on in this story is to have these women uncover these shadows within themselves and bring them to light. That's what I got out of this book anyway. It's all there on the higher plane. I was very impressed with this intricate, subtle, beautifully crafted &quot;double myth&quot;. That's what I'm calling it. You get the Eros and Psyche amazing story plus this wonderful new myth about wanting to find your true face. It's under there hidden with the dark and musty viel of fear-based thinking and belief systems. This book knocked my socks off...It's one of my favorites! Like the Fox says &quot;How can they (the gods) meet us face to face till we have faces?&quot; This means we need to uncover all our dusty negative agreements that sit in our soul and bring them out in the open. We need a cleansed face (soul) one that embraces clarity and balance, calmness and beauty. No zits, hopefully! CS Lewis has said this is his favorite piece he ever wrote...I totally agree. This book will give the reader a lot to think about if you really want it to, one needs to be patient and let it speak to the parts of you that are hidden. Open your dusty souls and READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is definitely a book I would recommend reading. One of the reasons it captured me was because C.S. Lewis, who is a man, was able to portray the life of a woman so perfectly. In this novel, we are pulled through the thoughts and events of a woman who is raised to believe that she is ugly--ugly enough to hide her face behind a veil for nearly all of her life. Through everything she endures; her father being a deadbeat king, her youngest sister adored and worshipped as a godess by many, and her own ugliness, she finds strength through her love for the people around her. She is a heroine. She is smart, she is powerful, and she can fight with a sword. She takes over her father's kingdom and makes it ten times better than he could have made it. If she had been gorgeous, we would find ourselves drowning in yet another boring novel where the beautiful maiden is swept into la-la land by a handsome god. Of course she is not perfect. It is her love that drives her to make a decision that will send her sister, who she has raised like her own child, on a painful journey. But she is sent on a journey of her own. She must find what truly lies beneath her veil and overcome the painful belief that she is the horrible person she makes herself out to be.I think this novel is making a comment on faith, as well as showing how beauty is found within, not without. If you look into the story carefully, you can find subtle hints of C.S. Lewis's view on faith and Christianity through the characters of the Fox who is always questioning the gods, and the the house of Ungit, which is wrapped up in mystery and &quot;holiness&quot; to the people around it.Another thing that is remarkable about this story is that it has unexpected turns. C.S. Lewis has taken an ordinary myth and transformed it into a fascinating story. You will be absorbed by the emotions that it brings out in you."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Without one mention of Christ in this book, C. S. Lewis was able to open my eyes to Christianity. In the way that Orual bears Psyche's pain because she loves her and by then equating Orual with Ungit, I was able to realize that one of the major points in Christianity is that love is greater than justice. And furthermore, as Orual bore Psyche's pain, Christ suffered to bear our pain. This book's message is an analogy for Christianity."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. It is everything a novel should be: compelling characters, beautiful writing, well plotted. Lewis has written his novel from the point of view of a minor character (the jealous step-sister) in the well known myth of Cupid and Psyche. In this, Lewis prefigured an approach to novel writing that later writers have adopted (e.g., Wicked, Wide Sargasso Sea, etc.)\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is not, as some reviewers have suggested, \\"just a fairy tale,\\" although it is hard to imagine that Lewis would have rejected that appellation, given that other great writer of fairy tales, George MacDonald. Also, it is very much a work with a Christian viewpoint and themes. The fact that so many reviewers have said otherwise should indicate that it not didactic or entirely unsubtle. The characters are pagans, but the theme is undeniably Christian. It is almost an allegory, but that would imply that the meaning is buried beneath a layer of representation, which it is not. In any event, the Christian theme is easy to understand if one recrognizes that Cupid is the God of love, and there is only one true God."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I first read this book when I was in my early teens, and I just reread it for the fourth time, now that I'm in my early fifties. It still has the power to move me, to engage my mind, to make me stop and think about myself. I was choking back a sob as I read the last words.I think it is C.S. Lewis's fiction that gets his messages across (although his non-fiction is incredible as well). Not to sound trite, but this has always been one of my favorite books. I could analyze/compare/critique, but that has all been done. All I can say is, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is the most amazing book that I have ever read. It illuminates ultimate truths and truth in a way that I though impossible. Through a life of pain and the process of redemption outlined within we see our own sufferings and the possibility of our own redemption and healing."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is so good at mixing faith with stories. Maybe that's why his stories are the most gripping. This retelling of Psyche and Eros is unpredictable and very moving. If Narnia is for children then &quot;Faces&quot; is a teaching fable for all adults."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a great novel. Lewis' character Orual is one that I hope will stay with me throughout my lifetime. I can relate to her more than any other character I've been introduced to. The discoveries she makes have opened my eyes so that I see myself, my life, and my relationship to God in a new light."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till we have faces by C.S. Lewis not only retold a myth from another point of view, but also gave an insightful look into to a battered life. He cleverly took the story of Cupid and Psyche, originally told from Psyche's view point, and flipped it to a different dimension. The whole basis of his story is the struggle that Orual, the oldest sister, faces because of her love for Psyche. King of Glome has three daughters. The oldest, Orual, is extremely ugly. The second daughter is beautiful, but is surpassed when Psyche is born. Psyche's mother dies at birth. This is important because Orual becomes her surrogate mother. Orual, who also lacks a mother and attention from her father, channels all her love and attention onto Psyche. Her somewhat happy life is shattered when the townspeople turn on Psyche and demand she be sacrificed to the Gods. Here C.S. Lewis pulls the reader into the novel. I sat on the edge of my seat as I watched the events unfold. Although the events were nerve wrecking, the pain the Orual faces caught my interest. Lewis brings the reader alive as he unfolds her emotions. At first the reaction is to dismiss her duty of love and believe that it is exaggerated, but after a moment I realized that such love does exist. Our parents are living examples. We know that they would willing give their lives for us and would do all in their power to protect us. Christ is the ultimate example because he did give his life for us. Orual seems to act irrational but her intent is to only protect Psyche. I enjoyed watching the thought process of Orual as she struggles to accept the divine qualities in herself. That paralleled my emotions. Since I strive for perfection, I always look for fault. I fail to see that beneath my mistakes there is also good. Orual strives to purge herself from ungodliness and doesn't see her attainment until someone tells her. Later when I was discussing the book, someone brought up the question if having a man write the book effected the portrayal of the woman. I reflected that it had, because I could relate more with Orual than with her others sisters. Orual was more mannish then her younger sisters. She also seemed more realistic because of that. The other sisters were distant from me because they floated in aa world of beauty where everyone worshiped them. Orual had plenty of rejection. Her own father for one rejected her. This made her seem as if life had a grasp on her. This book explored the faithful love of Orual. This love was blinding at times even causing her to bring more pain onto her sister. It also blinded her so she could not see the beauty within herself. All the other character achieve the purpose of helping to expand and test Orual's character. This was successfully done so at the end we feel that we know who she truly is."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is nothing short of a true work of art. Lewis captures human struggle with a depth of insight unmatched in anything I've ever read, with the exception of the Bible. He does this through the most unorthodox of vehicles one would expect a devout Christian to employ; a woman protagonist, and overt pagan mysticism. His use of these elements, in the analysis of his message and final product, is nothing short of genius. Lewis entraps you with his smooth flowing story line, and then grabs you suddenly by sculpting it into something entirely different than what one was expecting. While this story does retain some allegorical elements, they wrap inside of each other like entraping vines, beckoning the reader to discern their path. If the path is discovered (it took me 3 days of contemplation to discover what Lewis had done to my consciousness with his words, and ultimately what the meaning of this story was) one not only has a serene sense of accomplishment but is left with an awe for this writer's incredible mystic wisdom"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I have never read a book with such power to haunt, to inspire. Till We Have Faces held me spellbound the first time I read it, and it's power has done nothing but increase with each re-reading. There are thoughts expressed here, thoughts that perhaps each of us have known on the flickering edge of our consciousness, but have never known to put into words. This book is incredible in the way that it matches gritty realism with a soaring myth, and make the myth so much more powerful because it becomes real. Reading this powerful book will change you."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It was less important that it was well written, and what was written about, than the character behind it. Orual's character is explained in great detail through her actions and how she analyzes herself for the first part of the book. She tells a fascinating story of a woman who has lost everything and blames the gods. She is ugly and will never be loved; her sister she adores she destroys out of love; the kindest treatment she receives is from those who look at her as a man. The results are a hardened and bitter woman. She has reigned as a great queen but lost her humanity. She has no life or love to look back upon, and all is a cruel joke. She has been wronged horribly. She finishes with a denunciation of the gods. But as Orual starts in with the second part of the book, her entire manner has changed. Other people have become more open to her, offered her new perspectives. Her younger sister she thought despised her was lonely. The man she loved she worked to death because she was blind to his own needs. Although it is not pleasant, she begins to see how selfish and blind she has been. As she sees things differently, her feelings soften. It's amazing to see, mostly because we have all had similar experiences. We see what happens, assume we understand it, and paint for ourselves a story. It is only later that someone or something else opens our eyes (almost literally, when Orual is on top of the mountain) and we feel remorse, shame, or compassion. We are seldom honest with ourselves. She admits at the start of the second book that to leave the story as she first saw it would be to lie. As she re-examines the evidence, she is forced to admit her conclusions were wrong. Fortunately, there is redemption for her, even after all of her shortcomings. The wrongs she has committed against loved ones are righted by the very gods she denounced. We, too, so often discover how narrow and clouded and short our own vision is. C. S. Lewis has managed to explore some of the emotions we all feel and assumptions we all make. In Till We Have Faces, he has revealed clearly part of what makes us human."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I found Til We Have Faces to be extremely thought-provoking and it made me drown in a pool of emotions. When I began this book, I wasn't sure where it was going. I wasn't even sure I liked it. Eventually, the story got deeper and deeper. Characters intertwined and morphed in and out of eachother. That is the key element of the story; the psychological feel that it has. You suspect certain things may happen, but at least in my case, most did not. I enjoy books that are not readily predictable. What I enjoyed most, however, was all the emotion the book made me feel. C.S. Lewis brings the characters to life in your mind, it made me actually feel pain, happiness, and confusion for/towards them. Everything related to eachother, and even when the book ended, I still felt like the story was continuing without me. It was very real, and made you think. True, I lost interest in some chapters, but on the whole, the book had a very unique overall point, that if discovered, is one of the most amazing and fascinating points to discover. All the emotion the characters felt, the things they saw.. the work was beautiful. I suggest this reading, but only if one is willing to read closely and grasp underlying ideas. The book is one that should be closely read, I don't really think it is a pleasure book, though it was extremely enjoyable. Everyone should give the book a try, the message of the book is too unique not to."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Amazing story that touches on the raw experience of love, how it can go wrong, perception, the pain of recognition and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I love love love C. S. Lewis. And not just for the Narnia Chronicles, I love almost all his books, especially The Great Divorce and Mere Christianity. So when I first heard of this book on IntoTheBook, I knew that I had to read it. And when I saw this at the Christian Bookstore at Ochanomizu, the price tag wasn't even a consideration (but for the record, it's the most expensive book I've bought, and the only one I paid full price for, since coming to Japan).Till We Have Faces is a retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth. In the original story, the two sisters of Psyche are evil and jealous. But like Wicked, C. S. Lewis shines a different light on one of the oldest sisters - Orual (or so he calls her).Orual grew up ugly and unloved. But when Psyche is born (and her mother dies as a result), Orual transfers all her love to the beautiful Psyche. Eventually, this love is twisted into hate after Psyche's \\"sacrifice\\" to the Shadowbrute.Bred on a mixture of Glom (the country where Till We Have Faces is set) superstition and Greek logic (courtesy of the Greek Slave The Fox/Grandfather), Orual is conflicted inside. Indeed, after she becomes Queen of Glom (a very capable queen I might add), she's still tormented by what she did to Psyche by convincing her to betray her husband. So what she does is to push Orual inside her and let the Queen take her place. In this way, she becomes numb.It is only after she hears the twisted version of Cupid and Psyche (or to the reader, the conventional version), is she inspired to pen her version (or the 'true' version) of the story as a complaint to the gods. But when she is truly heard, she sees that her complaint was very different from the tale she told. Her complaint is one of bitterness, that she could not wholly possess the love of her sister.The writing in this book is marvellous. I really do wonder why it's not more popular. C. S. Lewis has spun a marvellous story and got me to look at the original myth in a whole new light. It felt as though it was an ancient myth, but it also felt modern at the same time. The language is easy to understand and very absorbing.In short, this is an excellent book (I love how I've been finding a lot of excellent books since coming to Japan). It's not only an entertaining tale, it's also a story about love, what it is, and what it is not.First posted at [...]"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I have for several years said that TILL WE HAVE FACES is the best novel in the English language. While I am sure there are many books that might also make that claim, and I have read many of the books that have been considered great. However, after all these years of reading I still retain that opinion.I was young when I first read it (between the age of 12 and 15) and it was really beyond my reading level. I pressed on and finished it, though it took me several weeks. What compelled me was a sense of beauty and wonder, of wonderful things hiding just out of sight behind ordinary things. Out of all C.S. Lewis's fantasies, this is the most wild and most romantic. It was only when I was older during many subsequent re-readings that I realized the philosophy C.S. Lewis was expressing in this novel.Yes it is dark, there are human sacrifices, beheadings, wars and lonliness, but through it all a joy hanging within reach if one would just believe in it. The ideas are reminiscent of other Lewis books, one can imagine Oural, the protagonist of the story as grown-up Susan Pevensie cynical of Narnia as a child's fantasy or as one of the ghosts in THE GREAT DIVORCE refusing to see how she was responsible for the hurts she caused others in her life. Perhaps the Shadow Brute is how the Calormen thought of Aslan.

And I have read a lot of books. There are so many moments where Lewis reveals his heart, and the whole book is a revealing of the Love of God. This is a book i have read through multiple times and have found something new each time. God gifted Lewis beautifully, and this book is one of the best showings of this gift. In short, this is a must read. This is a great book to help you look deeper into the Love of Christ, and reflect on how you accept that love. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I've just finished reading this and must say I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect the story to be such a clear picture of a woman's psychological maturation. The story's protagonist moves from self-pity through a life of concealed pain, and ends with her final triumph. It holds up a mirror to the way we live our lives, firmly stuck in ourselves - and when all of those prejudices and ego-tricks fall away, we get to see reality from a wider perspective.

Lewis retells the myth of Cupid and Psyche, making Psyche's sister the narrator. He changes the myth slightly, and the story starts considerably earlier in the order of things than does the myth that we all know.Lewis brings his theological and philosophical skills to bear on such questions as whether gods perform evil acts, whether humans are capable of understanding their actions, and how events appear to different observers.

The characters stand out, and will stick in your mind, with Lewis's keen description of their passion and pain. If only more myths were retold and remade this well.However, for all of its strengths Till We Have Faces suffers from the common weakness of Lewis . . . his tendency to be preachy, and to damage his story by being heavy handed with the point he wants to make. The story would have been more startling, thought provoking, and well written if Lewis had ended the tale after the first part. Nonetheless, the central strengths of this story bears it up and in the end it remains a well worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"To call this merely a book, is like calling Niagra Falls, merely a water fountain. CS Lewis takes you on a tour of your soul, showing how the dragons and demons within, are ten times more frightening than the demons without. I tremble at how clearly Lewis can hold up a mirror and force us to look in it, and yet have us walk away with MORE compassion on ourselves and others. CS Lewis' lifetime of work, suffering and joy, is boiled down into this one book. Reading it is a life-changing event. But it will mean more to you if you read certain CS Lewis books first, especially Mere Christianity, Surprised by Joy, The Weight of Glory, Miracles and The Great Divorce. This is truly CS Lewis &quot;dessert&quot;. Don't miss it, but save it for last."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Right now this is my favorite book, even after reading it 8 times. The book is divided into two parts: the first half is a &quot;complaint against the Gods&quot;, where Queen Oural tells her life story and how &quot;the Gods&quot; have ill-used her and lied about her; and it seems that she is indeed ill-used. The second half of the book is an addendum, where she realizes that she's been a horrible person all her life; she's sucked the blood out of everyone that loved her and discarded them when she's finished; and about her redemption. Full of powerful symbolism and the terrible truth of God's love."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis is a literary genius - that much is certain. But this book is extraordinary as no other I have known. With each reading, one is pulled into the depths of one's self, and forced to come face to face with new levels of truth. Each time you will take away with you a new revelation. If you have ever been angry at God, or wondered why things were so unfair, this is definitely the book for you. (Although I would recommend it to anyone.) Truly a magnificent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I purchased this book reluctantly. It started out methodically(as THAT HIDIOUS STRENGTH) but had an ending that literally knocks your socks off.

I know many great writers have suffered persecution both during and after their lives, and I realize you may not have known any better (which makes me wonder how you could have really enjoyed TWHF) but so as not to confuse any other readers or potential readers, CS Lewis was a man. Clive Staples may not have been the best name and he may have gotten beat up once or twice for it in elementary school, but please don't confuse him with a girl."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is often misunderstood due to the posibility that Lewis intended to be aligorical.

With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards. Perserverance is not always a good or noble thing I suppose, as the time spent reading this book could have been better used in more enlightening pursuits.Similar sentiments have been expressed to much greater effect (for me)in a number ofplaces...from the Bible to the classics to poetry, music, opera etc. *JTQ"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I read this book as an Honors English assignment earlier this year. At first, it seemed like a brief respite from the dense and monotonous novels we had read earlier. However, upon further reading, I found that this book was the worst one that I have read throughout the course. My primary complaint on this book is that the story of Cupid and Psyche was almost left out. Instead, the protagonist, the cliche, jealous ugly duckling that never becomes a beautiful swan, narrates her trials and tribulations against the gods that have plagued her. In fact, most of the Cupid and Psyche myth is removed until the end of the book, where it is told with no descriptive language or immagery. The rest of the book is the protagonist whining about her life with an overly symbolic, pretensous and confusing resolution and an absent climax. If you don't aprreciate literature and entertainment at all, this book is for you. But if you love to read entertaining and thought provoking works of literature, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Sadly , and with great disapointment.

I love the classics. but this has nothing in common with the real myth and the book is distressing. i found myself wanting to slash my wrists because it was such an awful and boring hysterical book that never takes off.

Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me)."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is best out of all C.S. Lewis' adult works. I am generally in love with how he has told and written this novel. &quot;A Myth Retold&quot; is the perfect subtitle for this book. Lewis is never cliche in this book, he has taken something and molded it into a psychological and profound masterpiece.Orual is a daughter of a King and sister to Psyche. Cupid/Eros and Psyche's story is recongnizable. This only skims the surface of the book. Lewis makes a Orual into a character with jealous love for her sister Psyche. In Lewis' version, Orual is never jealous of Psyche. She is rather selfish and wants to have Psyche for herself. She is a deep and compex character plagued by many things. Her situations, her feelings, her jealous love are all told beautifully by Lewis.It is rare that I read such brilliant character developpement. Orual seems real when you read the words Lewis has told, you feel her almost. Even through this descriptive and deepened world, Lewis' writings are easy to comprehend and this book is flowing. His storytelling is aesthetic and undoubtly talented.The book makes you feel for Orual at times. I did give immense pathos and empathy to Orual at times. Lewis did a wonderful job wrapping you into this book. If you doubt the beginning of the book, at least give it more of a try and read through the WHOLE book because it gets more better as it goes on.By the end of this book, you'll have appreciated Lewis' talents in writing, storytelling, and characterization. This is one of his best books. A must for his fans. If you like great literature, this is something you should read right away. Rarely have I felt so flung into the character's life and feelings. As many have said, C.S. Lewis will always be a great author. This is truly one of his best works ever."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I read this book at a time when I was starting to really dislike C.S.

And oh my dear Lord in heaven, the ending!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! I was just in ecstasy over the end, which was by far the finest and most well-developed conclusion EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm still not out of it yet and I don't to be."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book captured my attention quite unlike anything else that I have read. The building up of each character was a work of art, the story fantastically woven between the threads of an ancient tale of tragedy and love. everything about this book made me reconsider what I truly believed to be true literature."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is my favorite novel by C. S. Lewis. He wrote that it was his favorite as well, though when the book came out, it was not well received by the public, and never gained much notoriety. Even today, few people even know that he wrote the book.I think that part of the problem is that even among those who have read the book, few understand what it is about. I am by no means a C. S. Lewis expert, but as I try to read through other things that C. S. Lewis has written, I have stumbled across some statement by him about this book, which I think sheds some light on its meaning.Let me attempt to share this meaning with you, without destroying the plot of the book too much.The book tells the story of three princesses, Orual, Redival, and Psyche. As their father the King had no sons, Orual was destined to become Queen, but she was very ugly. Redival, the middle sister, was beautiful, but was also lascivious and vain. However, the third sister, Psyche, was blessed the beauty and the temperament of the gods. She was not only beautiful, but was wise and kind. I cannot really tell much else about story without ruining it, except maybe to say that after much pain, tragedy, and betrayal, Orual becomes Queen and rules for many years.Near the end of her life, she writes a complaint against the gods. She claims that though she has done nothing but serve and honor them her entire life, they have given nothing in return but pain, grief, and destruction. She recognizes that she is powerless before them, but she feels that if there is one thing she can do against them, it is to make her complaint known by writing it in a book, and making it available for people everywhere to read. That book is the first part of C. S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces.But after she finished writing her complaint, she is given a vision. A vision of her life. A vision of her life replayed, but not from her perspective, but from the divine perspective, the perspective of the gods. It is they who saw the entire picture, while she saw only her small part. And this vision shows her that she has been wrong in her anger, and hatred, and bitterness toward the gods. It was not they who treated her so wrongly, but she who treated others wrongly. It was not they who were punishing her and destroying her life, but it was her own actions and behavior that brought pain upon herself.But even then, the gods took her actions, which had caused so much pain for so many people, and used them to accomplish good in the lives of others, especially those of others that she dearly loved.When she learned all this, she wrote a second book, which she concludes with the following statement:\\"I ended my first book with the words \\"no answer.\\" I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words. Long did I hate you, long did I fear you. I might--\\"And with that, she died.Here, I think, is the message of the book: We do not have faces until God makes one for us, and this He will only do by forming one from the garbage of our own lives. Until we learn to see ourselves clearly for who we really are, we see nothing clearly at all. In this book, Orual is brought face to face with herself, and hates what she sees. But it is only after she sees her soul's twisted face that she is given a new face, a beautiful, shining, radiant face of the gods. The most critical statement in the book is this one:\\"I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till the word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?\\" (p. 294).Here are a few other quotes from the book which opened my mind in wonder:\\"For all I can tell, the only difference [between reality and a dream] is that what many see we call a real thing, and what only one sees we call a dream. But things that many see may have no taste or moment in them at all, and things that are shown only to one may be spears and water-spouts of truth from the very depth of truth\\" (p. 277).When she stands on trial before the gods, she has this dialogue with another person who is there:\\"I cannot hope for mercy.\\"\\"Infinite hopes--and fears--may both be yours. Be sure that, whatever else you may get, you will not get justice.\\"\\"Are the gods not just?\\"\\"Oh, no, child. What would become of us if they were?\\" (p. 297).It is quotes like this from a master story-teller like C. S. Lewis which makes Till We Have Faces such a great book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold\\" is a sensitive retelling of the Psyche and Eros myth from the viewpoint of her sister, Queen Orual of Glome. We follow Orual from her childhood in Glome with her two sisters, extending to Psyche's sacrifice, and well beyond that through Orual's adult life to her death. More than the story of Psyche and Eros, it is the story of Orual's journey through life, how her life and her decisions affect everyone she cares about, including her youngest sister. In many ways, Psyche's journey is also Orual's journey. Seemingly, Orual's ambition destroys the lives of those she cares about most. The book does not end exactly where one expects it to, and though ironic, the ending also leaves the reader satisfied. The book does bear rereading, as it isn't what you would expect during the first reading and requires a second reading before the book's full message sinks in. Don't hesitate to reread this book and absorb the full message. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I agree with the many other Lewis scholars who strongly believe that Till We Have Faces is Lewis' greatest work. His lifelong love of ancient mythology shines through as Lewis presents the classic myth of Cupid and Psyche through Psyche's older sister Orual, who is Crown Princess, and later Queen, of the kingdom of Glome. We suffer with Orual who has been cursed with acne scars all over her face, and a father who believes that her only virtue is that of the strong capability to run a government; and we admire her for her military prowess, her wisdom, her strength, and her courage as she fights, not only with the sword, but with her sharp intellect. The tale of this brave warrior woman belongs on the bookshelves of all those who love and respect great literature!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis may be somewhat shocked by \\"Till We Have Faces\\" for it is unlike any other piece of writing Lewis ever published, yet it is distinctly his own and aligns seamlessly with his other works. \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a retelling of the myth of Psyche and Cupid, but it goes far beyond the classical story to a reinvention that is better than the original. For this work is not only about the myth, but about human nature in general and how we all too often mistakenly see the world around us.The tale is narrated by Princess Orual, the oldest and ugliest princess of Glome. She did not always know of her ugliness, but it is made plain to her especially by the birth of her youngest sister, Istra, who is beautiful beyond comparison and worshipped as a goddess among the village people as she grows up. When famine and plague come to the land, the people are convinced that Istra is to blame and she is sacrificed to the Shadowbrute. Orual is devastated by the loss of her sister but cannot come to terms with what has truly happened to her for in her eyes it is a fate worse than death. Yet for the rest of her life, even as she becomes Queen of Glome, Orual searches for a way to reconcile herself to not only her lost sister, but to herself and to the mysteries of the gods.\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a philosophical examination of the classical myth of Psyche and Cupid. Lewis created a world that instantly comes to life and characters who are very real in their struggles even when those struggles are supernatural. It is a thought-provoking work about the nature of love and worship and how all too often our eyes remain closed to the truth that exists within the myths we create for ourselves."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is incredible! The writing is wonderful, and the way it is put together is very well done: the pages are the right size and material, and the font easy to read. The only thing I don't like is the strange, Renaissance-y cover art. However, the writing is gripping and the plot both meaningful and exciting. A rare artistic retold myth about the way we view God!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis triumphs again with a stunning retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. It is so beautifully written and as always in his writing, challenges your mind and touches your heart."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a myth retold. The myth of the love affair between Cupid and Psyche is the basis of the story, which is about a young princess that is so beautiful that no man would dare pursue her, because she was thought to be a goddess. This makes the goddess Aphrodite terribly jealous and demands that Psyche be offered as a sacrifice to the god's. Aphrodite instructs her son Cupid to put a spell on her to desire the worst of mankind; however, Cupid falls madly in love with Psyche because she is so beautiful. Because Cupid is a god and Psyche is a mortal, Cupid hides himself from her even though he is her husband. Psyche's two evil sisters come and deceive Psyche into uncovering her lover, and therefore, bring the punishment of exile on her. Aphrodite is happy again.Lewis takes this sad legend and transforms it into a story of redemption. The novel is written with the literary theory called \\"the broken-hearted reader\\" motif. This means that the narrative is written in a self-justifying prose that, in the end, exposes the brokenness and weakness of the writer. Something like Nathan's prophecy to David about the coveted lamb would be a good Hebrew example.The story is told by one of the supposedly \\"evil\\" sisters named Orual. Orual is leads a tragic life of one love and loss after another. Her father, the king, is an abusive tyrant who despises her, not only because she is a woman, but because she is ugly. Orual's greatest love, however, is reserved for her younger sister, Psyche, who is ripped away from her by a strange sacrificial demand for her life by the goddess Ungit. Orual is devastated, yet hopes that Psyche is alive, and finds her one day in an obscure forest. Psyche is blissful and full of life. She is passionate about the love of her \\"husband\\" and refuses to return with Orual to the kingdom. Orual's jealousy corrodes her mind, and out of \\"love\\" manipulates Psyche into betraying her husband. Psyche is lost, and Orual remains bitter.The king finally dies and Orual comes to power. She wears a veil to cover her ugliness, and becomes a legend throughout the land. She is cunning and brave as she rules her kingdom with the sword and her good counselors beside her. One of her counselor's is a man named Bardia, who is a commander of the military whom Orual is in love with. Yet, she also resents him because he is married. She despises him and makes him work long hours away from his family which in the end takes his life. Orual grieves for him and goes to comfort his wife who accuses her of murdering her husband with hard toil. Orual is disheartened.However, the biggest blow comes when Orual is told the legend of Psyche by a temple priest. The story is told in such a way that makes Psyche the victim of her \\"evil sister,\\" and Orual is outraged. She labors mightly over a book accusing the gods of injustice and defies anyone to tell her she is wrong. Orual accuses the gods of stealing Psyche from her, and pours out her complaint to them in a divine courtroom. However, as Orual is reading she realizes that she made Psyche violate the god not because Orual cared not for Psyche's life, but because she so wanted the highest place in Psyche's love.Orual is interrupted by the judge and realizes that the gods have no need to defend themselves. Orual's protest is its own indictment. Orual then knows she has condemned herself. Her essential jealousy has been the jealousy of the godsa desire for their power, the beauty the posses, and the love they receive. Hence, Orual becomes the broken-hearted reader.However, there is redemption. Orual is allowed to see the journeys of Psyche through her exile. Orual is humbled to see that Psyche has been bearing her grief working to restore her broken sister. Orual's story ends with an encounter. Her heart has been finally prepared for the grace she is about to receive. In her last vision she is visited by the god who is \\"all that is dreadful and all that is beauty\\" and beholds herself reflected in a pool beside her sister, both of them made beautiful!The book ends abruptly, but that is only to show how inadequate words are to describe the feelings of reconciliation, peace, and forgiveness. Lewis writes about the book, \\"I ended my first book with the words no answer. I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words\\""},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"CS Lewis, the master Christian apologist, was also a fabulous storyteller, as well as a sort of Classical scholar. This book is a synthesis of his theology, his love for the classics, and his storytelling ability. It is a reworking of the Psyche/Cupid myth, spun by Lewis in such a way as to teach important moral values--values which Lewis propagated in his Christian writings, but which he proves (in this book) to be important to all cultures. One of the most compelling things about this novel is that it is set in a \`barbarian' society, with many gods comparable to those of the Greeks. Even in the midst of this foreign religion, however, Lewis manages to teach his Christian moral values with surprising success.In a nutshell, this is a story about too much love. Orual, Psyche's sister, loves Psyche more than anything. Her love, however, is a selfish love, and Orual ends up destroying her sister because of that love. The central message of this book (to me, at least) is that people often treat their love protectively, and that jealousy often prompts people to hurt the one they love in an effort to keep the beloved all to themselves. The result, in this story and in others, is that someone (like Orual) who claims to love another person (like Psyche) ends up being the person in the world who hurts them the most. This culminates, in the novel, with Orual using Psyche's love for her as blackmail to get Psyche to destroy her life with the god Cupid.Readers familiar with Lewis's \`The Screwtape Letters' and \`The Great Divorce' will recognize this familiar theme of love gone too far. As always, Lewis provides insights in this book that are both profitable and that hit close to home for many of us. This is a great work of fiction by CS Lewis, both for its theological content and for the narrative itself. I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it, and both enjoyed and profited from the reading."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The main character, Queen Orual, in C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces has a bit of an image problem. She was very ugly as a youth and the ghastly response her face evokes from others causes her to wear a veil in front of them. Physical beauty is almost always an invaluable asset for a leader to possess. It helps enhance their image and how others perceive them. Lewis explores the effect of appearance as well as other different aspects of image in this remarkable book.On the surface, this is a sophisticated retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth (my favorite one, actually) from the point of view of one of the jealous sisters. We get to learn much, much more about Psyche, her family and the culture into which she was born. We are presented with an in-depth exploration of a pagan, pre-Christian, barbarian tribe on the fringe of Western Civilization and how they come to be influenced by the blossoming and dominant Greek culture and philosophy. Lewis uses iconic characters to display the great, cultural shift from a barbaric, pagan worldview into the civilized Greek philosophy. So sophisticated is Lewis' narrative that you can also anticipate how the worldview will shift from Greek philosophy into Christian philosophy, which is itself a further refinement of Aristotle and Plato.The way the story is constructed, told in first person by a Queen reflecting on formative moments in her life, likely had an influence on one of our favorite authors, Gene Wolfe. The character of Orual and the way she tells her story seem to be a precursor to Severian (c.f., The Book of the New Sun) and perhaps even Silk (c.f., The Book of the Long Sun). Near the end of the book, a pagan priest finishes up the tale for her, just like Horn chronicled the Patera Cald&eacute;. We also notice a broader picture of the events occurring around the characters, although they may not realize the importance of them at the time. Names also are translated into their literal Greek meanings such as the character Lysias who is always referred to as The Fox. We see this type of thing often in Wolfe.All comparative analysis aside, the book's greatest achievement is demonstrating how image helps a leader motivate people and maintain order. Perception, rather than reality, can make or break a leader. Controlling how others perceive you is one of the main jobs of someone in a leadership role. Like the works of Machiavelli or Robert Greene, this book highlights the reasons why it is important for a ruler to appear a certain way and to always maintain control over emotions while in front of others. For example, a leader must never appear weak or foolish. The rabble wants a strong leader, not a buddy. When times get tough, and they always do, the rabble will turn to the leader. If the leader is weak, they will turn ON him. If he is strong, they will trust him, even if he is brutal as long as the brutality is does not push them into rebellion.We get to know two main political leaders, each displaying a different level of \\"image\\" control. First, we meet a Warrior King, who--although valorous on the battlefield--is cowardly, blustering and tyrannical. He is politically backward and does not tend to his image at all. As a result, he spends a great deal of time and energy stamping out insurrections and fighting pointless, pyrrhic skirmishes with neighboring kingdoms. After his much celebrated death, his daughter, Orual takes over. She is very focused on image, even taking the drastic step of hiding her ugly appearance behind a veil. Not only does this mask her foul looks, it actually creates an aura of mystique around her, enhancing her image. Below the superficial, though, Orual is brave, diplomatic, wise and merciful. Before you get too worried, dear reader, take heart. This isn't feminist \\"women good, men bad\\" stuff. It is highly unlikely that an Inkling would espouse such beliefs.Underlying the image control of each leader is their unique leadership style. The King relies too heavily on his oppressive power and blustery personality to sustain his reign. He neglects nearly all other aspects of his kingdom and does not build a very good infrastructure to counter the bad times. The Queen, however, always tries to appear calm, majestic and wise. She never loses her composure in front of her subjects. She instinctively understands how this will undermine her credibility. As a result, her people trust her and she motivates them to new levels of achievement. She also has an eye on the future and invests time into her kingdom rewarding and recruiting talented artisans, craftsmen, builders and scholars. It is initially an expensive venture, but ultimately her investment pays off. Her backwater, barbaric kingdom flourishes and becomes a rich and mighty center of culture. Her \\"command and control\\" father ruled with an iron hand and would have never invested money on builders when he could conquer and enslave a smaller, neighboring kingdom.A very good example of the contrasts between these two managerial approaches is shown by the attitude each ruler takes towards their kingdom's only valuable commodity, silver. The kingdom has several mines in operation during the king's reign. The king does not see the potential in the mines and primarily uses them for capital punishment. He sends his prisoners, enslaved enemies and political adversaries there to work hard labor until they die. As one would expect, output, production and profits are not pouring out of these mines. Orual, however, clearly sees the potential in the rich, silver deposits and completely overhauls the mining operation. She frees the slaves and prisoners and replaces them with skilled laborers. These laborers are allowed to keep any silver they mine over a certain quota. Since skilled, motivated, profit-sharing laborers are always more productive than slaves, the mines are soon working to full capacity. The wealth pouring forth begets technological and cultural innovations which then lead to even higher levels of wealth and satisfaction. The kingdom is rich and the people are happy and fulfilled. Orual has done well. Her fair and democratic managerial style has reversed the nearly fatal autocratic style of her bumbling predecessor.Orual's focus on image and how she is perceived by her subjects plays a large role in the success of her administration. It allows her to inspire confidence in her people, challenge the status quo and turn around a failing enterprise. These lessons are as true today in our modern business world as there were in the pagan, uncivilized and barbaric world of Till We Have Faces."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Although they are, by now, superfluous, I add my five stars to the constellation that's already gathered around 'Till We Have Faces' in part to underline the comments already made by many reviewers and in part to hide from you what those comments betray. For 'Till We Have Faces' is a tale whose telling is as much a reason to read the book as the tale itself. It is a story whose characters, places, and very language will haunt you in the most wonderful ways--its sounds and smells will seep into your subconscious and change the way you see and feel. It is story-telling at its most vivid and lucid and profound.Above all, I wish to emphasize that this is a book about mysteries, religious, psychological and philosophical. Consequently, the very way in which the story unfolds leads the reader (and the main character!) into a darkness suddenly illuminated by a dazzling revelation. And so this is why I began my review by saying that one of my goals was to hide from you what other reviewers give away. If you want to experience the mysteries and revelations of 'Till We Have Faces' with all the intensity felt by Lewis' heroine Orual, please stop reading the reviews here. Read on, though, for marvelous plot summaries and reflections on the book. But no matter what you choose, please READ THIS BOOK for a story that is as achingly beautiful as it is richly insightful."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"If you're looking for a book to keep you company and entertain you on a stormy night, C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces will do quite nicely. If on the other you're looking for a book that will teach and inspire you, Till We Have Faces will do just that. If you're in search of a book that will do both, that's right, you need look no further, Till We have Faces will keep you turning the pages and open your eyes to greater things. C.S. Lewis is a master story teller. This book will send your mind on a journey, taking you to a unknown land, and there spin a story that will make your mouth water with anticipation. Though the story is an adaptation of a Greek myth, and maintains some fantasy, the characters are so real and emotionally intricate that it evokes perfect pathos. The lives of the characters that Lewis portrays causes the reader to evaluate their own life, their own loves, and helps them see a better, purer way to love. It has the power to reach most everyone. There really is nothing static about this book. It can suffice for pure entertainment purposes. The story is compelling, and demands the readers interest as to how the conflict will be resolved. The story telling is vivid and brings the tale to life. And throughout the story Lewis communicates issues of faith and love, that no one can escape, issues that effect everyone. It's practically perfect in every way. I have no qualms whatsoever about suggesting this book to my closest friends and family. To say that it is good reading and thought provoking only scratches the surface of what this book can do. I believe that everyone can enjoy and benefit from reading Lewis' Till We Have Faces, it will bring you into a new and brighter world."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is a book that makes you grow. It changes you in ways that last a lifetime. I first read this years ago, and I'm still growing from the memories of the story and from the parallels to daily life. It can help resolve lingering anger issues, just by reading a simple story that seemingly has nothing to do with you. It removes you from your own life for the moment and at the same time gives you clarity over it. I once read an excerpt to a friend who was, at the time, in the process of watching her health deteriorate and she said it gave her \\"chills\\" it was so good. It's a book that helps you grieve, also. It helps you sort through the pain of a loss (of any kind) very well and brings about priceless peace of mind when you need it most. I know that CS Lewis is seen as a Christian writer, but I don't see this book as a Christian book, personally. I see it as a story about what it is to be human. You will inevitably see yourself in at least one character in this story. I feel this book helped me mature as a young adult and I still gain something from it with every read. I have the audio cd of the book as well. It's nice in many ways, but I feel the reader (Nadia May) over-dramatizes the prose at times which I feel detracts from it. Still, in listening to it, I picked up on things about the story that I didn't pick up on when reading the book. No matter the method in which you experience the story, however, it is a story you should be told."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"In his masterpiece address, \\"The Weight of Glory,\\" Lewis says, \\"if our religion is something objective, then we must never avert our eyes from those elements in it which seem puzzling or repellent; for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know.\\"Through the retelling of an ancient myth, Lewis deals with the uncomfortable issue of God's justice in light of what seems a very unjust world. Why have the gods always seemed indifferent to the afflictions of man? Why must holy places be dark places? Why can't the gods just answer us without all the guesswork and riddle?If these questions bother you, you will be able to relate to the book's protagonist, a woman named Orual. That is the great thing about this work, if we are honest, we shall see ourselves in Orual. And while admittedly not answering all the questions that arise along these lines, the book, I feel does succeed in giving us a glimpse of at least that part of the problem that we can control and at some level understand.The main issue that is dealt with in this book is perhaps the most puzzling aspect of faith. There are clearly those things that go far beyond our ability to control, and each of us shall leave this world in ignorance and most assuredly in wonder, why this, why that? But to his credit, Lewis does an amazing job of taking these tough questions and once again through myth, helping his readers to understand a bit more clearly perhaps, the most mysterious of all things, the human heart.Once we understand (in some measure) our own hearts, perhaps we too will agree with another of the book's characters, The Fox, when asked by Orual, \\"are the gods not just?\\" He answers, \\"Oh no, child. What would become of us if they were?\\"The Blackstone Audio of this book is excellent by the way. I read the book once and found (as I do with most of Lewis's works) that I enjoyed it even more upon the second reading. I hope you will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis was of course the author of the \\"Narnia\\" children's stories, the moral comedy \\"The Screwtape letters\\" and a number of other novels and books about religion, most of them told from a more or less openly Christian perspective.This brilliant retelling of the legend of Psyche and Cupid is unusual for C.S. Lewis in that it considers the relationship between human and divine while stepping outside his Christian perspective. It is also possibly his best novel.The story reads as a memoir written in her old age by Queen Orual of Glome, who had been eldest of the three daughters of the previous King. Orual herself is wise but ugly, and loves her beautiful younger sister Psyche in a way which is genuine but fierce and also jealous.During a famine, The priests advise the King that there is a curse on the land and to lift it he must leave his daughter Psyche chained in the wilderness as a sacrifice to the gods. Orual is frantic and offers herself as the sacrifice instead but neither the King nor the priests will hear of it. Psyche is left chained in the wilderness, and when she is not there the following morning everyone assumes she has been killed. Instead, however, Cupid the God of Love takes her as his wife, refusing to let her see his face.In the original legend, Psyche is allowed to receive a visit from her two sisters, who are consumed with envy at the sight of the luxurious home which the God has given Psyche, and trick her into shining a light on her husband while he sleeps. Furious at this disobedience, the god condemns her to wander the earth in great misery.This version is similar, but with two key differences: the first is that Orual cannot see the beautiful house which Psyche believes she is living in. To Orual's senses Psyche is living in the open air and dressed in rags. Orual's motives in persuading Psyche to shine the lamp on her sleeping husband are far more complex and less unequivocally evil.The second difference is that, where in the original legend the Gods cause the malicious sisters of Psyche to die soon after their betrayal of their sister, in Lewis's version Orual survives her father and becomes Queen. Indeed, Orual's struggle to rescue her country from the mess in which her father left it provides some of the most powerful scenes in the book. (I'm not giving away anything here: the narrator introduces herself in the first pages of the book as Queen of Glome and makes quite clear that she is describing the events of her youth from the perspective of old age.)When she starts the narrative, Queen Orual is writing it as a complaint against the Gods who have mistreated her and slandered her. By the end of the book Orual's perspective has changed.This is a magnificent and deeply moving story. If you like the Narnia books, think of it as Narnia for grown-ups."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"Till We Have Faces\\" gives a contemporary twist to the original myth of Cupid and Psyche while remaining true to the original. Lewis takes the story to another level with marvelous depth and revelation. Although the setting and society are very different from that of our present day, Lewis uses his knowledge of symbolism and tone to adapt the story into any culture. The theme of conditional love and knowing oneself are consistent throughout the piece.Set in Glome, a \\"barbaric pre-Christian\\" society, Lewis tells the story of Orual, Psyche's ugly older sister. Orual first struggles with secrecy not only in her family but in the world around her. Orual's father was the king of Glome and Orual was to stay inside the castle at all times. Psyche, who was the most beautiful girl in the land, was thought of as something different, something dangerous. Orual looked after Psyche during her whole childhood and felt a deep and eventually harmful love for Psyche. After a horrible crop season and famine spreading it was decided that Psyche would be offered to the God of the mountain. After the sacrifice Orual goes to give Psyche a proper burial. Orual eventually finds Psyche alive but thinks that she has gone crazy. Psyche tells her of a palace in which she eats, sleeps, bathes, and is visited by a God during the darkness of the night. Orual leaves mad at Psyche for having believed such things were true and ends up going back for Psyche. Orual tells Psyche to turn on a lantern one night while the God is there to see him for the first time. Psyche knows that she will break the God's trust, but Orual threatens to commit suicide if Psyche does not comply. Psyche does what Orual tells her and is sentenced to a life of wandering and exile. The God tells Orual that she will have to live with the guilt of having led Psyche to such a fate. This is the point in which Orual's love for Psyche becomes less love and more of a demon inside Orual. When Orual returns from the mountain she is a changed woman and eventually becomes the Queen of Glome. Once she is older, Orual begins to understand that there is no such thing as unconditional love and that beauty is as important to the God's as it is to humans. She constantly wears a veil over her face and loses herself in the role of Queen. Once a person has created an image for themselves they begin to create a soul and the sense of self. This is what becomes important and until one can realize this they cannot be acknowledged and understand the truths of life. Orual loses herself in the constant demands asked of her and she eventually realizes that there is more she has to do in order to truly survive.C.S. Lewis' style is that of tone, dimension, and underlying meanings. He doesn't give anything away, but presents the situations to the reader in a way that gives support. His style supports his scholarly reputation and the targeted audience. This piece just adds to Lewis' long list of scholarly significant works. Other works by Lewis include \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"The Screw tape Letters\\", and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". Lewis wrote this contemporary fiction after the death of his wife almost as a testimonial of Christianity and the human struggle between love and hate. The society that Lewis portrayed in this piece was reminiscent of Greek society in which the belief in Gods and oral myth was the absolute religion. Fox, Orual's mentor and teacher, taught her to think beyond what she was taught. In the end all of Fox's teachings and wisdom turned out to be wrong and he admitted his misconception.This piece of literature provides a fascinating modern look at the struggle between humans vs. Gods, good vs. evil, and ugly vs. beautiful. C. S. Lewis was able to take the Greek myth to another level of meaning and also provide a brilliant story of love."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"i have never read a book that so drew me into the so called &quot;bad character&quot; i knew the original myth of pysche and cupid but this truly does not focus on pyshce but instead on her &quot;ugly&quot; sister. the trials she goes through as she changes from a scared child to a queen is fascinating. the beautiful phrases lewis uses are aw inspiring as his eloquence is put forth for all to view. i would recommend this book for anyone who needs something other than mindless mush. it's beautiful and heartbreaking all in the same stroke and you sob with and for each character, definetly a great book and a complete classic. ( one finally not exclusively for english teachers, instead it's for their tortured students looking for something past the scarlet letter) :)"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis used fiction to lay bare the soul in ways his more apologetic work could not. The cast of characters in The Great Divorce, for example, or in the &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; invariably remind us of people we know - and give us insights into what makes them tick. Nowhere in Lewis' works is the soul explored better than in Till We Have Faces, Lewis' masterwork of fiction and a stunning psychological and spiritual odyssey.TWHF retells and enriches the myth of Cupid and Psyche, although a lack of familiarity with the myth in no way diminishes from the enjoyment of the book. In Lewis' hands, the story sorts through issues of family, jealousy, gender, faith, and ultimate meaning, culminating with a frightening and yet wonderful 'face to face' scene that gives rise to, and explains, the book's title.Readers who are looking for the kind of in-your-face Christian symbolism that characterized the Chronicles of Narnia will be disappointed with TWHF. Although I appreciate and am nourished by Lewis' Christian parables and apologetics, the theology in TWHF is pagan, at least on its surface. Underneath the surface, however, Lewis does a masterful job of intertwining the traditional beliefs of the main characters - including a stand-in for Greek rationalism - with rumors of a much more intimate and beautiful way of knowing the gods. The climactic scene itself plays off the biblical phrase, &quot;Now we see in a glass dimly, but then face to face&quot; - a phrase that comes, in fact, from I Corinthians 13, the famous chapter on Love in the New Testament. So Lewis does indeed lead the reader toward the One who is love, but he uses the carrot of intrigue and spiritual longing rather than the steamroller (if you will pardon the mixed metaphor) of too-obvious symbolism.This is my favorite of Lewis' works of fiction and was, reportedly, Lewis' favorite as well. Few books can nourish the soul the way Till We Have Faces can. Just one caveat: you really will need to read it twice ... and you will understand why once you have read it through the first time."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Besides containing one of the greatest lines about being an author ever written: \\"I was with book, as a woman is with child\\", C.S. Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces\\" also did me the service of giving me a good slap across my metaphorical face. How wrapped up we all become in our own little lives. How one-sided and self-favoring is our vision.Though a book about many things--holiness, love, and philosophy to name a few--\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is mainly about how our perceptions can fail us. How in the name of doing what we think is right, we can do horrible things.Orual, the protagonist of the story, spends an entire life learning what the apostle Paul meant when he said \\"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\\" The real twist in \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is that the reader, more likely than not, learns the same lesson (I know I did).C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors for many reasons. This book is definitely one of them. Lewis considered \\"Till We Have Faces\\" to be his best book. I do not know if I agree, but it is certainly a great story.I give \\"Till We Have Faces\\" a very high recommendation."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis's novel Till We Have Faces is based on the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche, however Lewis chooses to tel the story through Orual, Psyche's older sister. While Lewis does retell the well-known story of Psyche and Cupid, that is only a tiny piece of the story he creates. Till We Have Faces is actually the story of Orual's struggle to find love, and to discover her own identity. The actual setting of the story is unclear-it takes place in a country north of Greece, in a time long past, but Lewis does not choose to elaborate on that. In fact throughout the entire book, he focuses very little on sensory details; it is a story of emotion and psychology rather than action and physical description. Orual writes her own story, beginning at her childhood in her father's castle. There she leads an isolated life, surrounded only by her fathers servants, advisors, and her sisters, Redival and Psyche. Redival, with her golden curls and curvy figure, is superficially pretty, but Psyche is the embodiment of perfect and natural beauty. She is not only outwardly beautiful, she is also pure, unselfish, and loving. Orual, though, is neither pretty nor beautiful. She is, as she is constantly reminded by her father (the king), indescribably ugly. Orual never feels that she is loved by anyone, that is, until Psyche enters her life. Psyche's mother dies giving birth to her, and Orual takes it upon herself to become Psyche's guardian and to raise her. Orual loves Psyche more than anything else, but her love is selfishly and fiercely possessive. Orual is tormented by the thought of having to release Psyche from her suffocating grasp, and she does everything in her power to prevent it. After being separated from Psyche, Orual gradually comes to the realization that she (Psyche) is like the goddess Ungit-greedy, jealous, blood-gorged, and ugly of soul as well as body. She also compares herself to her father, the violent, selfish, cowardly, and dishonest king. Orual recoils from this realization, and as queen, she tries to be everything that her father, and Ungit, are not. While she is described by her subjects as \\"the most wise, just, valiant, fortunate and merciful\\" of all rulers, Orual feels that her actions are only a mask of her inner ugliness. She despairs of ever overcoming her hideousness inside. She says, \\"I would set out boldly each morning to be just and calm and wise in all my thoughts and acts, but before they had finished dressing me I would find that I was back in some old rage, resentment, gnawing fantasy, or sullen bitterness. I could not hold out half an hour . . . I could mend my soul no more than my face.\\" Like the veil she wears to hide her ugly face, she feels that her good actions only conceal the hideousness of her true self. C.S. Lewis felt that we, as humans, are like rough blocks of marble. He said that suffering is the tool God uses to carve away our rough edges and to refine our souls. As Orual experiences suffering, she doesn't realize it, but she is actually coming closer and closer to becoming the perfected statue. Each trial chips away another piece of the marble that conceals the perfect form within. The title, Till We Have Faces, may refer to the process of refinement and self-realization. Till We Have Faces is a captivating book from beginning to end. As the reader, I could not only identify with Orual's struggles, I felt as though I was Orual, going through the same turmoil and inner-conflict. It is a book that I can read over and over again, each time experiencing new epiphanies and gaining deeper insight. It is impossible to adequately describe, even to a small degree, this fascinating and complex novel; it must be read and read again."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Many authors have taken old stories and retold them from another character's point-of-view in order to change the theme and lesson portrayed in it. C.S. Lewis did just that in his Till We Have Faces, a retelling of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche from the perspective of one of Psyche's treacherous sisters. In doing so, Lewis adds depth to a superficial story and makes his readers question the motive of their love.Orual, the eldest sister of Psyche, doesn't love anyone more than she loves her youngest sister. In turning the story in this direction, Lewis shifts the conflict from one between the sisters to one at first between Orual and the supposed gods who were the cause of Psyche's sacrifice and then, after Orual realizes her fault in her loss of Psyche, a conflict between Orual and herself. Orual's haunting self-examination and the revelation that she has loved Psyche so much that she pulled her away from happiness, and that she also has done so with everyone she has ever loved is a stirring wake-up call to all of us. The lesson that love is not a selfish action, but one in which, if you act with pure intent, your most important wish is for the one you love to be happy, is one which we all need to learn, as it will bring about greater happiness both in our lives and the lives of those we love.The title of the novel is the source of another important lesson. Throughout her life, Orual lives with the fact that her looks are anything but attractive. To make things worse, her sister Redival, whom she absolutely detests, is considered somewhat of a beauty. Her father tells her she looks like a man, and that her looks could knock down a horse, and the like, and she becomes embarrassed to show her face to anyone. She puts on a veil, and decides never to take it off. When she does so, people stop noticing her ugly looks and begin to focus on who she is. As queen she becomes famous for her generosity, courage, and wisdom. She is remembered as the bravest, most valiant queen who ever lived. Her fame spreads, and so do tales that she wears the veil to cover a beautiful face, because certainly no one whose acts are so lovely can be ugly. Thus, through her actions, Orual receives a new face, a beautiful one, one which fits her personality and love for others. In doing so she conquers the goddess, who has no face, and achieves her victory over the gods.Lewis' portrayal of love as the only thing to brighten an otherwise bleak and desolate world is fitting in this day. At a time when selfishness and greed are prevalent, the world needs a lesson in the value of devotion to others. Till We Have Faces is just that lesson. It provides a great example of love to all who are willing to learn from it."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"'Til We Have Faces' is the sleeper novel of the century. Better than any self-help book for those who are more sinned against than sinful, better than any pop-psychology text, Til We Have Faces addresses the difficult questions of God, justice and life's meaning with underlying compassion and incisive perception. C. S. Lewis re-works the ancient Cupid and Psyche myth. He retains the mythological setting, but this time tells the tale from the point of view of a sister of Psyche; Orual. This 'ugly' sister resents the gods for the injustices of her physical unattractiveness and her consequentially loveless life... and after a lifetime of angst and loss, finally learns a liberating and joyous truth. Lewis' deft handling of the story allows him to grapple with the anguish of lovelessness and the value of the soul; timely themes for our era, obsessed as it is with physical beauty and superficial materialism. The novel satisfies at many levels: a good story; an anticipation of 'the beauty myth'; a Jungian treatise; a neo-Platonic manifesto... an articulation of the very human yearning for love, justice and meaning. An important book, a beautiful book; something for those who are between their first and second enjoyments of fairytale and fantasy."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. The two bracketed opening paragraphs were written in Sept 2001 but never published. Mike London 10-3-2012][\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is essentially Lewis's view of the four loves put into action, and how destructive they can be if you abuse them. The central character, Orual, is a very selfish sister who wants her sister totally for herself. Easily the most complex all Lewis's fiction, there are so many examples of evil love throughout that the entire book can be hard to figure out as many of these are obscure. While the third book in the Space Trilogy certainly has its complexities, only this comes anywhere close to topping it for thematic complicitions, and topping it this novel does. We get a very accurate picture of why the main character has been a consumer all her life, and why she eats people up to be her own. Individuality is a thing very hateful to her. This also shows up in Screwtape's multiple letters to Wormwood.If published anonymously, it would be one of the few works that would be very difficult to tell it was by C. S. Lewis, as the style is so much different from his usual one. He very clearly enters into this mind of Orual and it becomes very much her own story. This is a retelling of the Cupid-Psyche myth; hence the subtitle A Myth Retold. For those readers who are most interested in reading the sheer depth of Lewis's skill as a writer, this is the best place to come.]TILL WE HAVE FACES, is, simply put, one of the most beautiful books I have read. Its depths are enormous, its truth fantastically illustrated, and the author is completely given over to the character. If you are reading this for Lewis's style, don't. In an amazing feat of creation, Lewis used his God-given gift, and has completely come into Orual's mind. This is some of the best characterization I have ever read, with Lewis completely laying down his own style, and yielded to that or Orual. Although that may be disquieting to some, it reveals the true creative power God gave that fine Christian brother. He immerses us into her world, told from her eyes. The book is very, very deep, demanding several rereadings.The plot of the book is a daughter is born to a king, named Psyche. He already has two other daughters, Orual and Redival. Her older sister, Orual, becomes very loving of her. Yet this love is exactly what it ought not to be: a selfish love. Psyche, seemingly a goddess in the eyes of the people, must be taken to sacrifice to the god of the grey mountains. Orual is very distraught. They take and leave her. Then Orual, along with another character named Bardia, go up to the mountain, and Orual finds Psyche, in love with the god of the mountain. Orual, being blind (although not physically), cannot see the palace. In the end, she has Psyche, who loves with selfless love, the truest and deepest and most real of all loves, look upon Eros, the god of the mountain, and Psyche is exiled because of her sin against the god. She was not to look or cast light upon him, but she did for Orual's sake.The king is an impotent ruler, and only after Orual takes over the kingdom does Glome become something of a powerful place. All things considered, Orual really does help Glome politically and financially, and is a much better ruler than her father was. He is an abusive man, and is an evil father. He cares nothing of his daughters, and wishes for a son. He especially resents Orual for her ugliness.The Fox is a Greek philosopher brought into educate the girls as well as help the King. Redival is least interested. He examines through the Fox the rational point of view. The Fox can never live up to his beliefs, and is constantly violating them. He is out of balance, placing to much on reason and logic and not enough on faith. He greatly influences Orual.Redival is a selfish one, and wants what is best for her. This is exactly what not to be.Orual: A much more complex character, and the narrator of the book. She loves with a jealous love, a love tainted by sin and ungodliness. She wishes Psyche for herself, and she cannot understand why she must go away. The book is about how she moves away from that selfish love and into the love of Jesus Christ. She is also marked by ugliness, and later starts wearing a veil to hide herself. After many years, people begin to think her wearing the veil for, ironically, great beauty, or something more mysterious, no face at all. This is representative of her spiritual life. She is ugly because of the taint of sin. Yet, because she is made in the likeness of God, the beauty that God gave her can be placed through. But as long as she remained uncured, as long as she remained [unstilled] hidden away, she could not come face to face with God. How could she when had no face. She refused to acknowledge her selfish love. For much of her life she worth both a physical and a spiritual veil. Only when old age approached, did she set down an account of the \\"evils\\" done to her by the gods in Part I. Then, in Part II, she lays down her veil, and begins to examine her life, and in the end comes to peace with God.Psyche is the mostly Godly character, full of selfless love for others. It is she that is Orual's love. There is much to learn from Psyche.In this book, we have what Lewis wrote in his nonfiction The Four Loves. These were written and published about the same time, and he had met Joy Davidman, who was to be his wife. Erotic love, that had so long passed him by, had suddenly and out of nowhere appeared on his doorstep. So love weight heavily on his mind during this period of his life. To have a deeper appreciation of this book, read both this and his The Four Loves, because basically he tackled the same subject in two separate genres: fiction and nonfiction. In that book, he says friends and lovers are essentially different, although bound by the same reality. Friends are friends because they have a bond, yet they are not whole concerned with the other. They are comrades, and do things side by side. Lovers are intensely interested in the others, looking at each other, not working side by side. This is illustrated in Orual's relationship with Bardia. Bardia, a prime solider, is a close friend of her, and the closest to a sexual relationship she ever obtained. Yet he is married, and so Orual cannot know erotic love as did Redival and Psyche. She is friends with him, and will not destroy his family. In this way, God is helping her to the point where she will drop the veil and let him put a face on her. Through the course of the years, she is showing more character in her relationship with Bardia than in her relationship with Psyche. She will not destroy the man she loves although she did destroy her sister's happiness. Already God was gently prodding her to a more real and honest place with him...-----[The above text is a revised version of a review written in 2000. The original review ran over 1000 words.

In the categories of plot, style, characterization and theme, TWHF reaches heights that few contemporary authors can even see, let alone achieve. And the ontological-theological-metaphysical message at the heart of CSL's allegorical retelling of the Psyche myth is . . . sublime, profound--so heartfelt and beautiful that even as I write this, I have chills.Read this book as fantasy. Read this book as literature. Read this book as the serious, crystalline thought of the finest Christian writer of the twentieth century. Read it time and again as I have, trying to fathom its magic and mysteries. But above all, my friends, _read_ this book. It is one of the most wonderful examples of why the Lord gave us eyes to read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Why, oh, WHY write ANOTHER review of this book! Because it captures the soul. Like multitudes of others before me, I've read it numerous times. It IS a masterpiece. The themes, emotions, depth and sheer beauty of this work are unmatched by any fictional literature I've ever read. Don't bother to borrow it from a friend or the library. You'll want it on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I loved this book, and believe it should truly be on English syllabi everywhere. C.S. Lewis has woven another wonderful tale in the tradition of the Chronicles of Narnia, but for a much more sophisticated audience. This was a book I could not put down until I had finished so that my essays went unfinished, and I hardly slept while I was reading it. 313 pages after I began, I realized that my time had flown by and I was finished. This is truly delightful to read, and it also raises many literary and philosophical questions. Lewis retells the myth of Psyche and Cupid, but changes the perspective to that of Cupid, whom he names Oural, and so changes the story. Told constantly of her ugliness, Oural lives a life of loneliness. Without comfort from her golden-haired sister, she turns to her Greek tutor for intellectual discussion and fatherly love that she does not receive from her true father the King. Later in life, Psyche is born to the step-mother. An almost overly-perfect child, Psyche is raised mostly by Oural. During this raising, Oural comes to have a deep love for Psyche. Changing her very core of being to a love for her sister, she then faces only bitter pain when Psyche is torn from her grasp forever. Her bereavement sets up a questioning of the implications of true love. Oural's motive's seem almost selfish at times as she tries to do what is best for the Psyche that she becomes fated never to see again. The direct empathy for Oural's vicarious suffering is masterfully portrayed so that I could not help but feel pangs of sympathy for Oural's plight. Her love raised Psyche, and then that love led to her losing the near goddess and destroying both of their happiness. Besides questioning the interplay between love, happiness, and the trials of life, there are more issues brought up. For one, Lewis tells the story from a woman's perspective. Oural is a very real, complex character, and it is interesting that Lewis could have done such a good job imitating a woman's voice. One of the ways he does this is to make Oural fairly masculine. Ugly as a brick, she eventually learns to fence, and subsequently becomes queen. However, as a queen, she remains man-like, leading her armies to war and through various journeys. Gender and love were intriguing facets of the book, but perhaps the main focus is on Oural's relationship with the Gods. She finds a basic conflict that enumerates the problems that religious men and philosophers have debated throughout the millennia. Her native traditions and upbringing teach her that there are many gods, animistic in nature. Unhappy gods, they demand appeasement through sacrifices and daily rituals. However, these views conflict with the teachings of her much-trusted tutor and friend. He refutes the myths and legends about the gods as uncultured fancies, and turns her thoughts to the logic of Greek learning. Layered upon this dual mesh of beliefs are the approaches that are taken to religion by the characters around her. Some choose to ignore the gods, others are dedicated to serving them, while still others believe strongly in them, but choose to seek as little interference as possible. Another conflict comes with the god who interferes with Psyche, who seems to be viewed as the all-high god, someone above even the many gods who reside in the land and provide fertility or omens. Thus, a sort of monotheism is acknowledged that continues to clash with the other ideas, providing much material for debate. Unable to reach any definitive conclusion about the nature of the gods, but providing good insights, Oural begins a letter of complaint to the Gods. Unsure of why she has not been told exactly how she should have acted to prevent the constant pain that she eventually comes to live with, Oural bitterly recounts her tale and her suffering woe. Despising the gods for their distance, and for having taken Psyche from her, she writes until the end of her life. However, before she dies, she sees a vision, wherein she presents her arguments to the gods, and receives her answer. She becomes another beautiful Psyche in the process, after finally having found the face that she has sought for so long. The ending must be read, so I will not even attempt to explain the rich complexities that Lewis has woven into the triumphant and mesmerizing conclusion. Although I am in the habit of finding new books to read, this is one of the few books that I will read again, and I am sure to find even more subtle insights into the human condition and the manner of our lives."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"There's no doubt that &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; is Lewis' most profound book. Its prose is masterful: spare, stark, the best writing Lewis ever did. He creates memorable, fully human characters, especially in Orual, daughter of Trom King of Glome. She is ugly, brutalized by her father, friendless until love enters her life through two characters: her Greek slave tutor and her youngest sister, Psyche. The novel becomes an examination of loves true and false, of manipulation of love, and of the power of grace to redeem and love the unloved and unlovely. I've read this novel at least a dozen times; it never grows stale. You needn't know the original myth to enjoy the book. I only wish more readers knew about this book--even many Lewis fans are unaware of this one. It will move your heart and make you think."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I loved Greek mythology when I was growing up. Unfortunately, the stories were were so single faceted. It was like reading Greek myths as told by Aesop. However, in Till We Have Faces, you run into a story that's a true work of literary art. For those of you who don't know the story of Psyche and Cupid, read the last segment of the book first for reference, because Lewis tells you the myth and then tells you how he altered the storyline. Don't worry, it won't really give anything away, and even if it does, it doesn't detract from the reading. One of the most interesting things I found about the book was that when Lewis altered the myth, I found an incredible amount of Christian themes running in it. Maybe I read to deeply into the story, but knowing that Lewis was a devout Christian by this time, it seems that the religious element was not merely coincidental. Orual and Psyche seemed to represent the humanity and deity of Christ respectively, especially because he makes the human appearance so unattractive as stated in Isaiah 53 which talks about the Messiah, &quot;He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&quot; The divine aspect (represented in Psyche) on the otherhand is as beautiful as the gods. In fact Psyche eventually becomes a goddess (again representative of Christ's deity). Again, maybe I'm reading way too much into this story. Nonetheless, it was a great read and I highly recommend this book not as a \\"Christian book\\" but as a wonderful work of literature."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"If you've read the reviews, wondered why everyone raves about TILL WE HAVE FACES, stick with the book till Chapter Ten. It's a little sluggish till you reach Chapter Ten, but make no plans once you turn that page. You won't put it down after that point.I am amused, I think, by the rigid assertions of some reviewers, as to what Lewis was trying to say with this tale. If you are put off by any of those assertions, ignore them. Plain and simple, don't listen to what a single person on here says the book means.Because the first time you read it, you'll understand it one way. The next time, after you yourself have grown, changed, aged, oh sigh, yes even matured, you will understand it another way. You will identify with one character more than another depending on who you are and are becoming, you will read the philosophy/theology differently depending on what you believe at that moment.But -- once read, it's likely you will read it again."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"You'd think this was just another myth. But not if it's written by CS Lewis!Somewhat of a cross between the story of Cupid and Psyche and a science fiction novel, you travel through the mind and heart of a woman who begins as the ugliest woman in the world, and becomes one of the most beautiful. Often dark and sad, the allegory surprises you into understanding of the human and the divine."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is the first book I have read by CS Lewis. His style is a bit different then I am used to... scattered at times but very realistic.This story is the re-telling of the myth of Psyche and Cupid, only the author adds his own twist to it.The reading was a bit slow at first but by about page 80 I could not put this book down. It is hard to describe just what this story is about, there are many elements. Essentially it is written as one woman's account against the gods, claiming they have wronged her and ruined her life. Just read it and see.I look forward to reading more of CS Lewis."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"On the most superficial level, C.S. Lewis' novel, Till We Have Faces, is somewhat of a fairy tale. It involves three sisters-Orual, Redival, and Istra (or Psyche)-who are daughters of a king. The eldest, Orual, is the plainest and most abused, while the youngest, Istra, is revered as a goddess. It is a story full of double meanings, sacrifices, valor, and hidden identities. However, many of these hidden \`identities' can be found in the underlying themes of the story. I believe this story to be primarily a commentary on the meaning of true worth. Throughout the story, Orual is completely disregarded because she does not meet society's standards. Her father rails at her and beats her every time something in life displeases him. Even she understands that the world will despise her and make her their scapegoat because she is different or \\"ugly.\\" From an early age, she knows that the would \\"would be cureller to [her] than to Redival because of [her] ugliness\\" (Lewis, 12). Her only value to this jaded society is in her knowledge. When her father hires a tutor for his family, he tells the Greek slave who fills the position to educate Orual well: \\"See if you can make her wiser; it's about all she'll ever be good for\\" (Lewis, 7). In contrast, the youngest princess, called both Istra and Psyche, is the most extravagantly revered person in the story, save Ungit, their equivalent of the Greek Aphrodite or the Roman Venus. Solely on the basis of her beauty, she is equivocated with a goddess. Her subjects even go so far as to make offerings of sorts to her. As if appeasing her would bring prosperity, they lay \\"down a branch of myrtle at [her] feet and bowed and put dust on [their heads].\\" In the time of a plague, they nearly tear down the castle walls, insisting that the only one who can save them is Istra: \\"Send out the Princess with her healing hands...She has beauty enough, that's one thing. And spirit\\" (Lewis, 31). And when things do not improve, they typically call her the Accursed one. The society does not have faith in her intellectual skills or her practical knowledge. If this were so, they would have turned to Orual in the first place. Instead, they first and foremost look to the tangibly worthy. This draws a strong parallel to our own society, a point that must have been intentionally made by Lewis in his construction of the story. I was amazed by the society's superficial devotion to such a weak force as beauty, then was struck by the poignancy of Lewis' message on the false gods we worship. The most powerful blow came near the end of the book. Orual discovers that she, herself, is Ungit. Throughout the book, Ungit has been the most highly respected force of the society. She is the goddess of love, lust, and prosperity and is unrivaled in her beauty. The point of revelation of Orual as the true force behind this power, though she is despised as the antithesis of everything society worships in this goddess, is the most powerful moment in the entire story. It reveals that it is not material beauty that mankind should worship, but the true beauty that comes from within the human spirit. In the end, C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces is a testament to the noble beauty that can be found within every person and a condemnation of the materialistic hovel we exist in."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I admit, I was not completely \\"blown away\\" by this book. Maybe it's because I'm not an avid book-reader, I possess limited English vocabulary and Greek mythology interests me as much as cowboy music (shudder). A friend introduced me to this novel and I borrowed it from the library, wondering what this raved book contained and which made people write, \\"you must read this!\\"It's a very captivating book and C.S. Lewis does wonders. To someone like me, he managed to get me to continue reading, even though I didn't understand everything. Yes - I'm guilty of reading Cliff Notes and I would say I would purchase one for \\"Till We Have Faces\\" if there's one out there. This novel (to me) contains symbols and many philosophical ideas and it's not like I hang out with people who discuss them. I don't think like this, I don't carouse with people who do - so sue me! There's my vent...My favorite parts are the dialogues and especially love how Orual comes across as someone you know in real life, perhaps even a reflection of yourself and your own thoughts. I love how C.S. Lewis describes the beauty of Psyche and the love/hate relationship Orual has with her. Lewis has a way of expressing what I want to express, except he has a better way of articulating it! Part II is also another favorite section of mine, even though I found myself asking, \\"What's up with this dream sequence?\\"I decided to read Amazon reviews to shed some light after completing the book. I honestly did not see God in this, as reviewers said, and believe I will have to read this book again in the future. I really hope it will be as good the next time as others say it is."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"In order to understand what a truly amazing book this is you have to realize three things: (1) The author was an INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT man, (2) he was an INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT scholar of medieval and ancient literature and (3) he is one of the most brilliant fiction writers of all time.How Brilliant is Lewis? So Brilliant that I can't imagine him writing this story at all and let alone so beautifully. After all what does a staid, middle age typically British male have in common with a young girl from a far less repressed culture?Lewis is known as a scholar and lecturer on Christian theology, but I can just about bet that future generations are not going to remember him for that. What they will remember is the powerful ability that Lewis had to tell a tale. Besides, if there is anything of Christian Dogma in this work it is the aspects of it that are universal to all societies and religions.The story is described as the retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth, but it is in actuallity a story about a young woman who grows up to discover that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but the elements of ones personality are what make a person &quot;beautiful&quot;. In the end, individuals are respected for their character and the actions that they display.What kept me involved in this story (I too read it in one sitting)was Lewis' masterful prose. While Lewis wanted us to believe in the vibrancy and color of the sights and sounds of Narnia, here he wants us to believe in the workings of the main characters mind. Lewis' use of language also draws the reader in and keeps one riveted to each page. One other highlight here is all the research that Lewis did on Hellenic (Ancient Greek style) cultures to bring authentisity to the story.My recommendation is to read this book more than once. There is so much there to experience."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Up until now, I have never been disappointed in a book by C.S.

I found the first person narrative of &#34;Till We Have Faces&#34; to be thoroughly unconvincing-it never rang true to me as a story told by a female protagonist. The language seemed unnecessarily stiff, even allowing for the style being imitative of epic prose. I would discourage anyone from reading this book as a first contact with C.S.

His fiction in particular is engaging and tells superb stories that unlock spiritual truths. \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is his unforgettable reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. Unlike Lewis' Narnia books, in which the symbolism is overtly Christian, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is cloaked in a world that is rooted in paganism. However, the truths found within this book will amaze and thrill you.Princess Orowell is unloved, unattractive, and appreciated only for her shrewdness in politics and military ability. She finds solace in her younger half-sister, Psyche, whose beauty and joyous spirit make others love her ferociously. When plagues and pestilence invade the land of Gloam, Psyche is sent to be a sacrifice for the \\"Shadow Brute,\\" or \\"God of the Mountain.\\" What follows is a journey upon which the princess Orowel embarks; a journey fraught with startling revelations and self-discovery.\\"Till We Have Faces\\" addresses the themes of obsessive love, our heartrending struggles between our feeble flesh and our souls, faith, and the infinite mysteries surrounding God; mysteries that will never fully be explained in this life.Lewis' characterization in this book is extremely vivid. Orowel's brusque mannerisms are in startling contrast with Psyche's joyous and innocent nature. I found myself relating strongly with Orowel's struggles. She is a character not easily forgotten.Nadia May reads this audio version superbly well. The pain of Princess Orowel is evident, and the British accent is easy on the ears. The words flow, making a story that might appear difficult to understand at first very comprehensible. Please give this riveting story a chance.

Another one to have when on a desert island..."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Lewis had been thinking about the story of Cupid and Psyche for decades, going so far as to try writing a new version of Lucius Apuleius Platonicus' METAMORPHOSES (circa 125 A.D.) in poetry. He abandoned the poetry in favor of a prose story, and I think TILL WE HAVE FACES the best of his novels. It is one of those works that fits the cliche &quot;I couldn't put the book down.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I first read this in elemenatary school, and every once in a while I would remeber this book set in Egypt or Greece about a girl who was really ugly so wore a veil (mind you this was 20 years ago) I remembered exactly where in the library it was but never the title or author, recently one of my friends and I was discussing Lewis, and she mentioned it!! I had to go reread it and it made much more sense now that I have had more Greek mytholigy under my belt. Irecomend this for EVERYONE who loves diffrent views of classic stories"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Well, to say the least, C.S. Lewis's work is awesome. I am a huge fan of the 'Chronicles of Narnia', which is what pushed me to buy this book. 'Till We Have Faces' is a great story, the tale of Cupid and Psyche. I visited a website the other day that was Anti-C.S. Lewis or something; the authors were crazy and called him a tool of the devil! Obviously they had not read his work; although it is wrong of a Christian such as Mr. Lewis to believe in Greek gods and goddesses, he uses these beings as a mere reference to his Christian theme. The book tells the story of a princess of the \\"savage\\" lands near Greece, and how the beautiful Psyche comes into her family and teaches her a life lesson. The book is about love, and faith, and selfishness. It is a great addition to anyone's bookshelf, even if the reader is an Athiest. In addition to great literature and a furthur explanation of God's ways, this book gave me inspiration to some of my own writing. I recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"From begining to end a perfect example of the art and skill of Mr. Lewis. Unlike any other of his books. Yet just as wonderful."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I don't think there's much to say about this book. It's a solid retelling of the Eros and Psyche myth, but if you already know that story, then you already know what's going to happen (for the most part). It was a quick read and the ending was different.My only problems with it were the names and some underlying ideas. I know that he's trying to portray a barbaric society, but, seriously, renaming Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, UNGIT, of all things? Almost all the women's names sounded masculine to me, and vice versa. Also, CS Lewis seems to be trying to tell us that women aren't as good as men, though I guess that can be blamed on the time period in which he wrote."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I bought this book on recommendation from a friend and I could not agree with her positive opinions more. The story was engaging and exciting. I found myself identifying with the characters while at the same time wondering at their actions and words. Also, I found that while most books have unsatisfactory endings, this book has one of the best last paragraphs I've ever read."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book was a fast read, and coupled with the fact that I really couldn't put it down, it was a really fast read.CS Lewis is one of my favorite authors, I have many of his books, and currently have a few more on my \\"to be read\\" shelf. I love the way that he can be a cogent and articulate theologian in such works as Mere Christianity, but then he can switch hats and write wonderful works of fantasy, which have strong undertones of Christianity such as the Chronicles of Narnia (I really need to go back to those, because the more I read snippets of them, the more I realize just how Christian they are), or the Space Trilogy, or this book.What CS Lewis has done here is to take the classical Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, and rework it. Now one might say, well that myth is a classic, why mess with a classic? Well, read the book and find out. In a way he reworked it, but in another way he wrote an entirely new story unto its own."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I think I got confused while reading this book I hope that I am not the only one. When you are done reading it you think you see what Lewis is trying to say and then it disappears like last nights dream. But all in all Lewis put words together and spins the tale better than a spider spins a web you get caught up in it and cant put it down.Great Awsome and as I said I need to read it again."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Myths are often a distillation of human experience and knowledge, pared down to an easily digestible story that is both memorable and instructive. No less so here, as Lewis takes the tale of Cupid and Psyche and adds a small change to the basic tale - but that change reverberates and focuses the message that Lewis is imposing on the tale, a message about what love is versus what many normally think it is.Lewis sets the tale in the \`barbarian' country of Glom, with a King obsessed with getting a son, and thereby cursed with three daughters. Orual is the supremely ugly one, Psyche just as beautiful as Orual is ugly, and the third sister is the personification of greed and petty jealousy. But it is Orual that the book follows, down deep into her basic outlook about herself, her relationship with the Gods, and most especially how her feelings for Psyche and her sense of propriety cause her to commit blackmail in the name of love. Lewis clearly shows that love that does not place the desires of the loved one above any personal sense of right/wrong/duty/honor is not a true love, but rather the product of selfishness, of the \`I know what's best for my love' syndrome.But this is merely the beginning to the layers of philosophy present in this book, as it calls into question not only if there are gods, but just how mortals can or must perceive them if they exist, and how much \`God' is present in everyone. Masks are a symbol here, from the veil that Orual takes to wearing, to those masks used by the priesthood when performing their embassies for their god, to the masks that everyone presents to the outside world. Also covered is the value of good deeds versus an irredeemable sin, what vital tasks man is burdened with during his short lifetime, and even the value of philosophy as a field of study. All this and more is hidden underneath this apparently simple story, with little direct exposition of these ideas until this last portion of the book, which is written as a dream allegory.The characterization of Orual is excellent - she is person you can recognize and feel with, and her dilemmas are ones we all have faced, though perhaps not in such grandiose terms. Psyche, the King, and Fox, the sister's Greek slave teacher, are drawn with enough depth to understand their motivations, and provide the proper environment so that each person's actions are understandable and the plot action inevitable.I did feel that the last section of book went a little too far in the way of symbolism and philosophy, that perhaps a more action-oriented explication of the points Lewis was trying to present in this section would have been better. But this is certainly a book that is good for more than one reading, with a timelessness to its messages, and told with skill and great thought.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"NOT!!! I'm 14 years old and I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is so creative and it has a lot of dialog- which means it never got boring- and it was so interesting! I loved it and rate it 5 stars!!*****"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I was given this book as a gift several years ago for Christmas from my sister and brother-in-law, and promptly wrinkled my nose and put it on my bookshelf without really bothering to see what it was about after I saw C.S. Lewis as the author. However, while taking my collegiate Latin class, my instructor mentioned it while we were reading the story of Psyche and Cupid in our text. With his recommendation and now knowing its subject, I decided it would be something I'd like to read.The book doesn't take long--it's 300 pages, but they go by quickly and it's interesting, so it keeps you turning the pages. Some of the ends of the chapters have that device of young adult literature, the cliffhanger, so even when you vow you're going to stop and go to bed you end up reading further than you intended.This book is in the grand tradition of &quot;Grendel&quot; or &quot;Wicked&quot;--that is, telling the myth or story from the point of view of the &quot;evil&quot; person in the story (although, as this book was published in the late fifties, it seems it started the tradition rather than continuing it). This makes it incredibly interesting. It is written from the viewpoint of Princess and then Queen Orual, older half sister of Istra, known as Psyche to Orual and their beloved slave, the Fox, a Greek who teaches Orual his native language and looks after her. Psyche's mother dies in childbirth, and Orual and the Fox become her caregivers. However, Psyche is sacrificed to the local goddess, Ungit, and Orual receives an enormous shock when she goes up to the mountain on which Psyche was sacrificed to bury her remains.I won't say more, as I don't want to give away anything in the book. Every now and then, it seems like something is included and really does not have much to do with the larger story, but this does not take away from the book's entertainment value. While I would not number it in my top ten favorite books or anything like that, I am not regretful of having read it. It raises interesting questions for all of us as we witness Orual's struggle over whether her intentions were as pure as she originally believed, as well as the ever-enduring issuing of questioning God or, in this book, the gods.This is prime beach reading or rainy day reading. Not only that, but it tricks you into thinking about certain issues by embedding them into a heartbreaking, beautiful story."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C. S. Lewis again weaves personal philosophy into a magical story. Much more than a children's fable, Till We Have Faces is a retold myth about three princesses: one beautiful, one ugly, one perfect. Spell-binding and thought-provoking, this novel delves into Orual's intense struggle to discover herself. What she ultimately finds is a pure inner love that equals all beauty. Orual's teacher and mentor, The Fox, exemplifies wisdom and rational thinking. Schooled in logic, he teaches Orual to shun the blind following of common thought and to test truth for herself. Because of the young princess's admiration of The Fox, she comes to question many of the traditional customs and beliefs of her people. Orual's acquisition of knowledge is of itself unusual in her kingdom as she is a woman. On the other hand, Psyche represents the metaphysical realm of imagination. Her ability to heal her diseased subjects by her touch is one evidence of her divinity. Unparalleled beauty and goodness are qualities she alone possesses. Too perfect for her mortality, she is wedded to a god and taken to live in a golden palace. Caught between her love for The Fox and Psyche, Orual is an embodiment of the struggle between the rational and supernatural. When she stabs herself in the arm, Orual convinces Psyche of her seriousness and concern. But more importantly, this action symbolizes Orual's grasping for reality; in a physical sense, she attempts to convince herself that her world is not one of mystical gods and imaginary palaces. As she persuades Psyche to steal a glance at her husband's face, her realism speaks out and is the source of torment to Psyche as well as to herself. Yet when she herself views the palace of the gods, her reason submits itself to wonder and belief. Even the supernatural must be subject to reason and be proven with Orual's own eyes. As time distances her from Psyche and she takes over the affairs of her kingdom, the Orual of fantasy is lost to a Queen of reason. The veil that Orual dons to disguise her frightful appearance is symbolic of her disillusionment; no one, not even Orual herself, truly knows who she is. Some villagers eventually come to believe that she hides her face because it is unbearably beautiful. They do not even consider the fact that her face might be hideous because of her valiant and majestic actions as Queen. Her engagement in a fencing match and her courageous defense of her country and allies forever solidifies Orual's noble reputation. Her nobility of character paints a face, at least in her subjects' eyes, that is exquisite. The veil hides her face, but symbolically it hides the past. Orual thinks less and less of Psyche as the years go by. But just as her face is still present behind the veil, so is her memory and love of Psyche. Orual begins to experience unusual dreams that are so real she feels like she's living them. They prove to be manifestations of her commitment to Psyche and the devotion she never stopped giving her. The new priest of Ungit is a representation of Orual's realization of truth. The old priest had frightened her because of his supposedly awesome powers, but Arnom's powers are not at all mysterious to her. Orual finally understands that the bird-like masks, holy rituals, and bloody sacrifices were created by her ancestors and became traditions of her people; she relates these traditions with The Fox's Greek beliefs in the gods and goddesses whose actions explain the natural phenomena of nature, such as rain and harvest. Just as Orual is finally able to define her beliefs, she ultimately is capable of defining herself. However, she first sees herself in the wrong light when she compares herself to Ungit. Like Ungit, she is ugly, and no one can fully comprehend her character. Like Ungit, she is revered. Like Ungit, she is not perfect. Orual's love for Bardia is tainted with selfishness. She fails to see his ever-weakening state as he faithfully serves her. Orual's confrontation with Bardia's wife opens her eyes to her own cruelty. But for a brief moment when she admits her deep love, she literally and symbolically takes off her veil and catches a glimpse of the person she is. That person is Psyche, not Ungit. When the veil is forever stripped from her face and her understanding is complete, Orual sees herself in true light. She is Psyche; her love for her allowed Orual to live for Psyche. Her beauty is perfect. C. S. Lewis forces his reader to ask himself, \\"What veil do I wear, and what do I hide in wearing it? Do I know who I really am under such a facade?\\" As we contemplate these questions, we are forced to see ourselves in a new, untainted light. The final question we must ask ourselves is this: \\"Can we, like Orual, discover a balance between our fantasies and realities that ultimately reveals our inner beauty?\\""},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This book is by far one of the best I have ever read. It is an exploration of feelings of love and hate, and it channels deep within the human heart to display openly feelings we all have, yet very rarely express. Its beauty is in its honesty. I also was particuarly taken with the character of Psyche. Her vunerablity and her forgiving/trusting nature so a softer side to the harsh reality of her life in the book. This book is a treasure, an excellent find...I myself am only 17 and I feel in love with it instantly. CS Lewis has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I give this book 5 stars only because there is no 6 star option. From the very beginning, the book grabbed me and pulled me into a deep, but extremely followable plot. C.S. Lewis uses his skillful word choice and masterful story telling to put the reader directly in every situation, action, and thought. The situations presented to you all throughout the book are explored in full detail until it almost feels as if the decisions made were your own and not the character's. Besides being a joy to read, this book also makes you think. Lewis does a good job of putting just enough spin on the old fable until it seems as if the fable really should have been written his way to start off with. You'll find yourself second-guessing old assumptions you have, and re-addressing your thoughts, fears, feelings, and judgments. If you're looking for a book to put you to sleep at night, this is not the book for you. But if you're looking for a book that's fun to read, interesting, and deeply engaging--a book you can treasure forever--Till We Have Faces is what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"The first time I read this book years and years ago I didn't understand much of it. I was young and I think lacked the emotional klout to be able to grasp what Lewis was writing about.Because I had heard many people saying it was his finest work I decided to read it again. I mean, it's Lewis, right? The first part of the book recounts the story of Psyche and Cupid as told by Psyche's sister, Orual. It's mainly tragic, and describes the events from Orual's point of view. And if it ended there it would be utterly depressing and awful. However, what makes the book is the second part. The realization that slowly comes to Orual in her latter years regarding all that has happened before is nothing short of amazing.Having gone through a similar journey myself now I completely understand what he was writing about, or at least, much more than at first read. And it's awesome! It's Lewis indeed at his best! A shame he died shortly after or else he would have written other masterpieces like this one. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I didn't really look at what cover my purchase would have; I was only concerned with buying this book.

This story was no exception. Orual's journey from innocence to confrontation with the gods has a familiar ring. A beautiful myth remade, the story is told with depth and compassion, yet with no sacrifice to the harsh realities of living and loving under the gaze of what feels like the capriciousness of the gods. Reading it again..."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis writes his most eloquent book here as he takes the reader into an ancient myth retold. His ability to describe setting, emotion, and thought processes of the main characters enable the reader to understand and intimately identify with the characters and the scenarios in the plot. This book is certainly recommended for those C.S. Lewis fans who have yet to add this book to their collection."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This review is for the audiobook version narrated by Nadia May. I will start out with the audiobook. I was very impressed with the narrator. I've heard her on several other classics and she always does a good job. This book is no exception. Her characterizations were done well and made it easy for me to determine which person was speaking. She has a very agreeable voice, and this book made for a very pleasant commute the last week or so.I am a CS Lewis fan and this is my first time through this novel. Most of his books have a clear Christian slant, but I was surprised when this one didn't. This wasn't a problem, just unexpected. It did do an excellent job pointing out certain universal truths, but did seem to stick with the pagan mythical religious theme that this story was derived from.I thought that his rewriting the story of Psyche and Cupid from the perspective of the ugly sister was very well done. One of the things I enjoy with great literature is looking at things in life from a different viewpoint and learning from it. This book shows how people sometime do bad things with the best of intentions. It also reinforced to me that I need to look at situations from many angles before making a decision or judgment.I highly recommend this book and the audiobook was an excellent way to go through this book."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"C.S. Lewis knows how to tell an excellent story and make a few important points at the same time. He brought the story to life; Lewis's version is much more believable and interesting than the original myth. The book is mainly about the main character's development, so as a reader I felt like I was even maturing along with the main character. I connected to many of the hard lessons learned in this book because they point to inherently human issues.The main difference between the original myth and Lewis's version is that sisters were not able to see castle that the god created for the princess. This was a great twist, because it caused the characters to doubt instead of believe in the gods."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"I had not been familiar with the myth of Psyche nor with the writing of C.S. Lewis prior to picking this book up, so I walked into this story with no preconceived notions at all. I really enjoyed the plot and characters, especially for the first half or so. Then, the book became quite bizarre and abstract, and I personally became less engaged. It wasn't until the last 20 pages or so that I once again was pulled back in. Lewis helps the reader gain perspective and insight into what we have read, and this is what helped make the story worthwhile. I am not sure I would read other Lewis novels -- not being a fan of fantasy or a particularly religious person -- but I am glad that I read this one."},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"This is the most insightful work of fiction I have ever read. Lewis is not only a genius in his capacity as the author, but as an observer of humanity, the self, and the deep truths that lie beneath the convenient names we often use to simplify them.As other reviewers noted, the full power of this work is only apparent upon multiple readings. Astoundingly, Lewis' symbolic framework can effortlessly support at least two different mappings:Orual, the middle sister, bears a strong resemblance to that part of our being where our reason, will, and emotion reside. Redival could represent the body, concerned only with base interests, and Psyche is the radiant center of our being, which seeks union with the divine.On another reading, Psyche represents the spiritual side of human nature, and Orual represents religion, who through subtle missteps often contrives to rob us of our enjoyment of God as a person, a friend, a lover. (If you don't buy this reading, check out the scene where Orual realizes \\"I am Ungit.\\")Under either reading, the really remarkable part of the book is that the narrative keeps building momentum and delivers a chain of aftershocks after the supposed climax of Orual's crime of blackmailing Psyche -- aftershocks that represent the stages of Orual's becoming undeceived about herself, her nature, and the truth about her good intentions... and finally there's her repentance and her labors to undo the damage she has wrought!And besides all of that, you get the annals of Orual's reign as a wise and industrious queen and her rise as a swordswoman, which are great fun.And there's so much more I haven't even touched on! Just go on and read or re-read it!"},{"Title":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold","review":"Up until this point, my favourite C.S. Lewis books were \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". This book hasn't taken away from the appeal of those books, but this book is on a level all its own.This is a \\"reworking\\" of the tale of Psyche and Cupid, though the book has less to do with \\"Psyche and Cupid\\" per se, as it has to do with focusing on one of the historically \\"evil\\" sisters of Psyche.The tale is fascinating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put the book down. It's a tale of a woman with a grudge against the gods. It's a tale of disappointment and suffering. But it's also a tale about love, and what love really is as opposed to what we think it is and what we try to make it.This book is a masterpiece, and a recommendation for anybody who wants to read something substantial without being overly \\"heavy\\".

The stories are an unabridged narration by Joan Hickson, who gave the best interpretation of Miss Marple I've ever seen. The only quibble I have with the recordings is that the publisher didn't group the stories into separate recordings based on content (e.g. a story from THE TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS is on this recording). I advise you to scoop up the set of recordings (see my Listmania list), unless you can find some omnibus audio edition of Hickson's narration that includes the lot.\\"The Thumbmark of St. Peter\\" - Miss Marple's contribution to the Tuesday Night Club (see Hickson's narration of THE TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS for the earlier stories), at which each member was required to tell the story of a real life mystery, to which he or she knew the answer, but none of the others did. One of her many nieces - Mabel, this time - had made an unwise marriage, but after her husband's death, wrote her aunt in near hysteria. Not grief; stress, because rumours were spreading that she had poisoned her husband.\\"The Herb of Death\\" - Mrs. Bantry's story, the 5th of 6 stories, one told by each member of a dinner party at the Bantrys. (Hickson's recording of the 1st 4 form THE BLUE GERANIUM AND OTHER STORIES.) Mrs. Bantry didn't want to tell a story, saying that she isn't any good at it. So she begins by telling of the bare facts of a death at Sir Ambrose Bercy's - a lot of foxglove got picked with the sage, everyone got food poisoning (including the Bantrys), and Sir Ambrose's ward Sylvia actually died of it. \\"There isn't anymore. That's all.\\" Sir Henry in particular takes this as a challenge, since the listeners then have to work at ferreting out the details with clever questions.\\"The Affair at the Bungalow\\" - Jane Helier's story, the last of the 6. Miss Helier, like a few other beautiful blond actresses in Christie's works, is, to put it kindly, not regarded as an intellectual. So when she comes up with a tale of robbery that 'happened to a friend of hers', all the other guests figure they know what's coming next.\\"Death by Drowning\\" - A girl in St. Mary Mead has just been found drowned - Rose, the daughter of a man who runs the local pub. Having just learned that she was pregnant (having seduced a promising young architect in hopes of a shotgun wedding), quite a few people have reason to want her dead: the architect (engaged to a girl back in London), and her devoted admirer Joe Ellis, to name two. Miss Marple fears that the police may get the wrong person, so she reveals her own suspicions privately to Sir Henry (still a guest at the Bantrys'), and he follows up on them."},{"Title":"Plop: Recent Projects of the Public Art Fund","review":"If someone told you that there was an exhibition of plop art at your local museum, would you rush over to see it?

In other words, it's &quot;plopped&quot; there. What a wonderful surprise that can be! Have you seen Jeff Koon's huge puppy made of flowering plants in Rockefeller Center? You can't help but smile.For a quarter of a century buildings, plazas, parks, and streets in New York City have been the recipients of amazing art installations, all thanks to the Public Art Fund, an organization that enthusiastically supports contemporary art.&quot;Plop: Recent Projects of the Public Art Fund&quot; presents projects by 45 internationally acclaimed artists whose works now decorate New York City. Among the artists included are Vito Acconci, Louise Bourgeois, Martin Creed, Dan Graham, Kim Sooja, Jeff Koons, Mariko Mori, Takashi Murakami, Paul Pfeiffer, Brian Tolle, and many more.A discussion of the pros and cons involved in making contemporary art for the public is also found in this 256 page volume boasting 500 illustrations.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Plop: Recent Projects of the Public Art Fund","review":"\\"Plop\\" is an extensive, if not truly comprehensive, look at the New York City-based Public Art Fund's recent projects of public contemporary art in media ranging from light to performance. It includes memorable work by distinguished artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Jeff Koons (his famous flower puppy at Rockefeller Center), Mariko Mori (Her UFO spaceship \\"docked\\" indoors in the Madison Avenue building adjacent to 5th Avenue's Trump Tower.), Takashi Murakami (An assemblage of aliens depicted on balloon sculptures in Rockefeller Center with its roots in Japanese anime and probably William Gibson's cyberpunk fiction too.), and Nam June Paik (a dazzling laser light show and sculpture at Rockefeller Center). It also includes work by up-and-coming conceptual/performance artist and sculptor Anissa Mack, whose \\"Pies for a Passerby\\", a kitschy Americana performance piece, received some curious national and international attention two years ago (An astute blog columnist wrote a well-reasoned essay back then arguing that this work was not art; I believe it is still posted on the internet.). Notably absent is the sculpture installation by the late George Segal, the distinguished sculptor noted for his realistic papier mache sculptures of ordinary people doing ordinary things - and I might add, a fellow alumnus of Stuyvesant High School - exhibited late last year near Central Park's Grand Army Plaza (southeast corner of the park, across the street from the Hotel Pierre). While the Public Art Fund's aims are truly admirable, much of its work on display tends to be too whimsical (e. g. work by Koons, Mack and Mori, to name but a few). As such it lacks the gravitas I've seen in excellent work by such prominent Tucson, Arizona artists as painters Robert Colescott, James G. Davis, Alfred Quiroz and Jim Waid, photographers Harold Jones, Joe Labate and Frances Murray and last, but not least, performance artist, sculptor and poet Ned Schaper (aka Mat Bevel)."},{"Title":"CHRISTOPHER + ALEXANDRA CL","review":"I disagree whole-heartedly with the reviewer from Kirkus Reviews. I found this book, known to me as &quot;Where are the snows?&quot; absolutely riveting and beautiful.The characters were well suited to the story, with beautiful Irish Alex and dapper Christopher spinning their life away as the end of the millenium approaches.The book paints a picture of what hedonism can lead to and what happens when you use the world until it grows tired. The story is poignant and their love is truly beautiful.It makes one believe that there is someone out there, a soulmate, who will make you whole. Which is exactly what Alex and Christopher were.This is one of my all time favourite books and I would heartily recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Seven Days to a Magickal New You","review":"Maybe I'm so enamored with it because I'm needing a vacation from life right now. It's like going to a magickal retreat, but in a book. I have heard of women's retreats, and there are spas that cost thousands to be pampered for a week, but for those of us wanting to get in touch with our magickal selves, this is the kind of retreat you can afford, especially if you already have a well stocked herb and oil cabinet. I really do like thebasic premise.Each day is dedicated to doing things with a magickal intent that are appropriate for that day, Moon-day, Sun-day, etc, such as Wednesday is focused on wisdom and knowledge, and Thursday is focused on good fortune and prosperity. Friday is about self love and love for all humanity, while Saturday is devoted to tapping into your dark feelings and purging fear, pain, resentments and negativity. There are exercises to do while waking up, a morning pentacle salute to the sun, and a chakra meditation. Then each day has some things to do for the day, such as going for a picnic, making an amulet, or cleaning out clutter. Each day also has affirmations to say, teas to drink, herbs to mix, and a color to wear, like Monday is white or silvery blue, and Thursday is green. Often, she gives alternatives for the herbs, or incense or teas, and little &quot;tips&quot; are all over the place. There are also simple rituals to perform each day, sometimes more than one. Each evening you are encouraged to take time to read in a magickal book, like Book of Shadows by Phyllis Curott, before going to bed. Keeping adream journal and notebook are strongly recommended, as are taking pictures of your altars, drawing, etc.I know most people can't do this in the &quot;ideal&quot; way, but I think it's great to try to pick days and do it just to get a good reconnection of your magickal side. Ideally, she recommends taking a week off from work during a waxing moon, getting away from friends and family, basically getting away from your typical mundane life, and being magickal every day, all day. Itis something you should be doing for yourself, without interference in your focus.This sort of thing may not appeal to everybody, and I'm sure not all will agree with what she has chosen to include, or the herbs, or something, but overall I think the idea is solid and wonderful. The whole book is about taking time to step out of the daily grind, even if for one day, and step in to magick. It is about taking the time to honor yourself, both personallyand magickally, and reconnecting with the mystical. The book does have a decidedly feminine perspective, but I think it can be adapted for men without too much effort."},{"Title":"Seven Days to a Magickal New You","review":"i liked her first book witch : a magickal journey alot. she took a chapter out of witch: a magickal journey also titled 7 days to a magickal new you added a few new things and made it into this book. save your money and just get her first book it has the same material as this plus tons more and if you already have her first one don't even bother with this. it's a cute idea but it looks way too much like she was just trying to make a quick buck reproducing old material."},{"Title":"Seven Days to a Magickal New You","review":"i liked her first book witch : a magickal journey alot. she took a chapter out of witch: a magickal journey also titled 7 days to a magickal new you added a few new things and made it into this book. save your money and just get her first book it has the same material as this plus tons more and if you already have her first one don't even bother with this. it's a cute idea but it looks way too much like she was just trying to make a quick buck reproducing old material."},{"Title":"Seven Days to a Magickal New You","review":"I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not.

The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read."},{"Title":"Sign and Sing Along: Itsy Bitsy Spider","review":"My son is obsessed with this book.

Hand positions are not correct for most of the signs. As someone who works with children with special needs and uses signs all the time, I purchased this book to be a fun addition to my sutdents' library.

I find the review very helpful, and it gives the baby another sing-along opportunity she always loves!Recommended for ages 1-2 only, as it's a very basic song that older toddlers will probably not sit still for for long."},{"Title":"Sign and Sing Along: Itsy Bitsy Spider","review":"It's a cute book, and I think our little one will like it, but I'm not too crazy about the illustrations. They are very simplistic and not as detailed as I was hoping. It's mostly just pictures of the child, which is fine and helps with the sign language, but the pictures should also help tell the story, such as pictures of the spider being washed out or a water spout... I'm glad to have it and we will surely use it, but I'm not sure I would order any more from the same company/publisher."},{"Title":"Sign and Sing Along: Itsy Bitsy Spider","review":"When someone gave me this book before my son was born I didn't think I or he would be much interested in it. But then my son was born with Down syndrome, and I realized signing would be important to help him communicate before he could speak. I like this book because it clearly shows me how to do the signs, so I can sing and sign to my baby at the same time (I don't even bother holding up the pictures for him; he likes watching my hands make the signs). He is only about four months old but is gripped whenever I sing and sign from this book.

She will LOOK for this book amongst her others, and run over to me with it, and do the signs.

I recommend that this book be read first."},{"Title":"Observational Before-After Studies in Road Safety","review":"This is one of the best technical books I've ever read on any subject--and I've read many of them! It should be must reading not only for those who conduct transportation safety studies--the subject of the book-- but also for those conducing any observational study (\\"before/after study\\"), whether safety-related or not.This book is a valuable and much-needed contribution to the technical literature. The book begins by showing how classical statistical techniques are often misused in observational studies. Classical techniques assume a rigorous experimental design, with random assignment to treatment and non-treatement groups. These conditions do not apply to observational studies, such as those determining the influence of smoking on health. Errors such as assuming safety in the immediate \\"before\\" period is a good predictor of safety in the \\"after\\" period are discussed. The book then goes on to provide valid techniques that work. It shows how to compare the what would have been the safety in the after period without treatment, to the safety that was achieved. Complications of assessing the safety in the before and after periods are addressed.The book is not only an important technical contribution, it is also extremely well-written. The author's writing style is extremely lucid and should serve as an example to others. The first section of the book provides a qualitative description of the material. Subsequent sections then repeat the material, but with mathemtatical rigor. Numerous numerical examples (some with real-world data; others with hypothetcial data for simplicity sake) make the material clear. Mathematical dervivations are provided for rigor, but isolated from the rest of the text to keep from overwhelming the reader.The author writes with a conversational style, frequently re-emphasizing important points. He takes care to show at all points where he is in the logical discussion and how the current topic fits in to the overall picture. Some of the words are written tongue in cheek. My favorite is his description that\\"they do not have a problem of congnition, but only of brittle bones\\".In short, the book is outstanding for both its technical content and for the way the material is presented."},{"Title":"Observational Before-After Studies in Road Safety","review":"The product arrived on time, and it fullfiled my expectations.I do recommend this seller"},{"Title":"A simple story (The British novelists)","review":"This is no &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; -- everybody gets what they deserve, according to the strictest moral code, and some get it with interest.However, Inchbald excels at characterization -- she unites vanity and passion in one character, and still has a believable personality to show the reader -- and she can show a character in change, without losing the character's integrity. Although the tragedy she creates has a moral &quot;told you so&quot; aspect hard for modern readers to take, it also has the pathetic grandeur of the great tragedies -- small, pointless faults and actions which lead to irreversible pain. The humanity of Inchbald's insight is what makes this book one of my favorites among the 18th century women writers."},{"Title":"A simple story (The British novelists)","review":"Those who like Austen, Edgeworth, and Burney will enjoy this novel by Mrs. Inchbald. The primary characters of Mr. Dorriforth and Miss Milner are written with such humanity and honesty rather than cliched caricatures. (Warning: spoiler alert) Of particular notice is Inchbald's treatment of the adulterous or \\"fallen\\" wife. It is quite different than the other portayals given in other 17th and early 18th century novels. Inchbald makes neither a villainess nor a martyr out of Miss Milner (Lady Elmwood), but shows her as a victim of being brought up to be selfish and spoiled. The reader finds themselves rooting for Miss Milner's reform due to her many good qualities and her sincere and ardent love for her husband. You find yourself alternately pitying her and being disgusted by her. Yet the image of her that is left is that of a true penitent. Dorriforth's weakneses are explored as well and his transformation into an unmerciful tyrant as a result of her betrayal is an interesting plot twist of Inchbald's. By the end of the novel, Mrs. Incbald succeeds in convincing her reader to lament the spoiled and indulged upbringing of Miss Milner and to ponder what could have been if she had been raised differently."},{"Title":"A simple story (The British novelists)","review":"Inchbald has a great talent with words. This books is insightful, provocative and dramatic. Inchbald talks about love with such candidness and frankness that while your reading you can't help but feel an overflowing of emotions toward the main characters. Very satisfying ending the tidies up all the problems throughout the book."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage: A Novel","review":"i thought this book was terrific - sensitive and perceptive about a woman's struggle to come to terms with an abrupt reversal in her life, yet very funny at times. the secondary characters are so skilfully and vividly sketched, you can really get involved in their stories too, but it's tess i really cared about. anyone who has experienced a serious break-up (about 98.3 per cent of us - right?) will recognise her, empathise with her and cheer her on to the very end."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage: A Novel","review":"If, like me, you've read a lot of books in the \\"chick lit\\" genre, then you've probably read this story before: woman loses husband and pines for him to come back; woman begins to realize that her marriage wasn't quite what she thought it was; woman starts to enjoy her new-found independence; and finally, woman finds a surprising new love. THE STARTER MARRIAGE pretty much follows this formula, but what it lacks in originality it makes up for in warmth and wit. One added twist here is that the woman in question, Tess, joins a divorce support group, and the although most of the book is told in Tess's first-person voice, each of the eight group sessions are presented from the perspective of William, the group leader. One of the group participants, Carol-Ann, lends quite a bit of humor to the book, and I found myself laughing out loud here and there. Otherwise, the story is somewhat predictable and even a little corny at times, but that doesn't make it bad. Overall, I enjoyed this quick read and would definitely recommend it to others who are interested in this genre."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage: A Novel","review":"I am not sure how you identify a marriage of 7 years between people who have been dating/living together for 18 years as a starter marriage. Nor does Harrison make any real effort to have the reader understand the marriage's limitations.In any event, the value in the book resides in its writing, not its plot. The writing is witty and crisp, the dialogue is good, and Harrison knows how to put together effective scenes; moreover, the protagonist is credible, so one doesn't mind the more clich&eacute;d aspects of the plot too much. The ending was a bit too forced, and I wish the camp head hadn't been so good looking and so earnest."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage: A Novel","review":"The saddest part of reading this book is that the protagonist puts down unoriginal phrasing (i.e., cliche) while the book relies on a lot of it. It was a bit difficult to take, reading a character abhor bad writing, given the plodding, tiresome writing style of the author. It was too bad because the outline of the story is actually very interesting and with some time and effort could have been a very good novel. In this case, however, the heroine becomes more unattractive as a wife and friend the more you get to know her. She goes to a divorce therapy group but she really needs private psychotherapy. She is the kind of self-absorbed manic-depressive control freak that one never knows what one might say that will be upsetting for her. Because of this, her friendships in the book and her love interests don't ring true, since she is not the type of person who would normally attract a lot of friends as easily as this character does. Also, the family interactions ring false. If it weren't for the divorce survival group sessions, the book would have failed completely, but since they were from the perspective of a workshop leader they give a thread of honesty to the mostly superficial human interactions outside the therapy group. It's almost like she was borrowing from a best-seller from the 90s, Rachel's Holiday by Marion Keyes (which actually was a great book about going to group therapy and the interactions actually ring true) but just didn't understand how to do it right."},{"Title":"The Starter Marriage: A Novel","review":"Although you'd expect a book about divorce to be at least somewhat bitter and angry, there's none of that in this book. Though it was sad on occasion, this story is primarily optimistic and heart-warming.If you're relationship is falling apart, if you're divorced or thinking about divorce, this is a must-read, but I'd recommend it as a fun read for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Nature in downland, (The collected works of W.H.

I do not doubt the credentials of the author (R & D consultant, inventor, entrepreneur) but his writing is dry & monotonous, while the treatment of the subject is also seemingly too philosophical in context.Although I must add that the four distinct phases - from idea to exploitation - of the Innovation Project Model as postulated by the author are well understood by me, but I find that the author should have done a much better job in dove-tailing his own personal experiences & the practical aspects of innovation to make the model more meaningful. The model is technically sound. If it is of some consolation, the author did admit that the subject was much more complex that he first imagined.Neverthless, I did attain a better understanding of how ideas emerged & how they are translated into invention & progressed through the various stages of innovation up to the exploitation point.For readers, I would like to recap the layout of the various major sections of the book:THE INNOVATION PROCESSKEY EVENTS OF PRODUCT INNOVATIONINNOVATION & TH EINNOVATORCONCEPTS TO FEASIBILITYAPPLICATIONS RESEARCHDEVELOPMENT & DESIGNTHE BUSINESS OBJECTIVE - PRODUCT EXPLOITATIONTHE PRACTICE OF INNOVATIONIn conlusion, for all intents & purposes, I reckon this book is more appropropriate for background reading by the R & D engineer."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (A Mentor book)","review":"Planning a trip to both of these wonderful places and was tickled to see a book with both in the title.

Adams at times finds his enthusiasm for his subjects embarrassing, but gives in to it nevertheless and writes a brilliant and joyous paean to these cathedrals and to the spirit that created them. Rereading this book now, twenty years later, I remember the thrill of reading it the first time, and it sparks my own enthusiasm all over again."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (A Mentor book)","review":"A reading of Richard Brookhiser's recent (and highly recommended) *America's First Dynasty* sent me back to *Mont Saint Michel and Chartres*, a book I hadn't read in thirty years. I'm glad I returned to it, because a few years have, I trust, put me in a better position to appreciate what's going on in the book.On one level, the most obvious one, Adam's book is a sometimes idiosyncratic history of Medieval art, literature, and religion that takes as its center of gravity the great Gothic cathedrals of the period--structures that Adams thinks sum up what the middle ages are all about. To read the book on this level alone is fine. It provides intriguing insights into, for example, courtly love and the cult of Mary.But I now believe that, at a deeper level, the book is disguised autobiography on the one hand and a backhanded history of Adams's own time on the other. An at times overwhelming sense of nostalgia permeates the book. In reading Adams on the 11th century mystics, the debates of the schoolmen, the chansons of the troubadours, and the unified worldview of the middle ages, one can almost hear him sigh with longing to return to a world which, he thinks, was whole, unfractured, and pure--a world, as the medievals themselves would've said, which reflects &quot;integritas.&quot; This reveals a great deal about the restless, unquiet nature of Henry Adams the man. But it also reveals the restless, unquiet nature of the modern era which spawned and molded him: the gilded age, the fast-paced first wave of capitalism, secularism, and consumerism, which has no center of gravity, no art, no tradition. And even though we claim to be living in a &quot;postmodern&quot; age, it seems to me that a great deal of the qualities Adams deplored in his own times are still with us and account for our own sense of homelessness.*Mont Saint Michel and Chartres,* then, is more than a quaint turn-of-the-last-century history. Read correctly, it's also a mirror of our present discontent. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (A Mentor book)","review":"Henry Adams' MONT SAINT MICHEL AND CHARTRES (MSMC) is simply a great book. Adams' lucid writing style and his insights are impressive, and this book should be read by every supposedly \\"educated\\" individual. Adams deals with complex topics such as Gothic Architecture, Medieval poetry and mysticsim, and Scholastic Philosophy with clarity and ease.The early sections of MSMC compare the church of Mont Saint Michel with the Catholic view of St. Michel who was militant and was the perfect example of the Medieval hero defending the Catholic Church against all enemies. The comparison with this church with that of Chartres which was the examplar of God's mercy via St. Mary is insighful and facinating reading.Such embellishment of St. Mary or Notre Dame(Our Lady)is further investigated in Adams book by Adams' careful treatment of Medieval Poetry. Adams's translations of Medieval French and Latin are good and give those who are not familiar with these languages a better understanding of both the poetry and the Medieval devotion to St. Mary.Much of this peotry was mystical, and Adams demonstrates the attempt of St. Francis and the Franciscans to use such mystical thought in their missionary efforts to help the very poor. St. Francis' mysticism is revealed in Adams' translation of St. Francis' poem titled BROTHER SUN AND SISTER MOON.Henry Adams then compares and contrasts Medieveal mysticism, which bordered on Pantheism, with Scholastic Philosophy. Adams gives the reader an insight to scholastic debate when he summarizes the debate between William of Champaux and Peter Abelard(1079-1142). Here Adams demonstrates his understanding of how students and masters argued and learned. He also shows the careful balence the Catholic authorities tried to impose between reasoned debate and heresy.The last section of the book deals with the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Adams careful treatment of Aquinas' thought is worth the price of the book. Adams gives the Angelic Doctor high praise for both his clear thinking and liberality. Adams also effectively deals with the liberality of the Medieval Catholic authorities who canonized so many men whose views were apparently contradcitory.Henry Adams' MONT SAINT MICHEL AND CHARTRES is intellectual history at its best. The book deals with complex ideas and views in an attractive literary style which holds the readers' interest. This reviewer has read this book numerous times since he first read it in 1968 and has never found the book to be boring. Readers should also read Thomas Woods HOW THE CATHOLIC CHURCH BUILT WESTERN CIVILIZATION and compare Woods sections on the High Middle Ages with Adams' book."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (A Mentor book)","review":"Privately printed in 1904 (and revised seven years later), &quot;Mont Saint Michel and Chartres&quot; was never meant for the general public. It's the intellectual's ultimate &quot;what I did on my summer vacation&quot; essay, written for friends as a gift to accompany their excursions through France. The first half is a highly personal travel book and an idiosyncratic guide to art and architecture of medieval French cathedrals (particularly of Chartres); the last six chapters offer a succinct excursion through the spiritual mindset of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.If you've never been to Mont Saint Michel or to Chartres, the first ten chapters can be hard going; it's like reading a 250-page description of a painting you've never seen. Even if you have been to both locations, it's unlikely you'll remember the details Adams expected his readers to have in front of them. Fortunately, his prose is not dry (and is at times characteristically witty). Adams is able to render vividly the fleches, the portals, the arches, the statues, and the stained glass panels, and he provides the tourist with a thorough understanding of the achievement represented by medieval religious art. He also supplies as background a wealth of related literary and historical references .The tenth chapter (and the last of Adams's official &quot;tour&quot;) focuses less on the cathedral of Chartres itself and more on the cult of the Virgin that it represents. It serves as a segue to the second half of the book, which will be far more accessible to general readers. He compares contemporary portrayals of three queens--Eleanor of Guienne (Aquitaine), Blanche of Castile, and Mary of Champagne (who wasn't really a queen, but never mind)--to the representations of the Virgin Mary in the art, in poetry, and in hagiography. &quot;The Virgin was a real person, whose tastes, wishes, instincts, passions, were intimately known,&quot; Adams argues. &quot;Like other Queens, she had many of the failings and prejudices of her humanity.&quot; The final three chapters turn to the intellectual life: the ongoing tensions between universalism and nominalism, Bernard and Abelard, mysticism and rationalism--all culminating in the balancing act of Thomas Aquinas.Over 75 years ago the &quot;Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot; judged Adams's book as &quot;probably the best expression of the spirit of the Middle Ages.&quot; Well, not quite; such a view could be proffered by a literary critic perhaps, but certainly not by a historian, and I think Adams himself would have been appalled by such a statement. (A more accurate and more thorough account from the early twentieth century is Charles Homer Haskins's &quot;Renaissance of the Twelfth Century,&quot; published in 1927.) What Adams offers here is a glimpse of the medieval Catholic intellectual spirit as seen through the prism of his own rather conservative nineteenth-century Protestantism. His book is not so much a scholarly treatise as it is a wistful refashioning of the medieval spirit."},{"Title":"Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (A Mentor book)","review":"This review is ONLY for the edition noted above.

In Chartres, he described the medieval world view as reflected in its cathedrals, which he believed expressed \\"an emotion, the deepest man ever felt--the struggle of his own littleness to grasp the infinite.\\" Adams was drawn to the ideological unity expressed in Roman Catholicism and symbolized by the Virgin Mary; he contrasted this coherence with the uncertainties of the 20th century.

(Don't take my word for it - go look at the comments in the SBS2000 newsgroup)I'm not into denigrating other people's work, but this book really doesn't have any plus points.To be brief: - it fails to explain essential concepts, with each chapter having hardly any logical connection with those preceding it - the text is peppered with terms and acronyms which go undefined - there are few graphic examples or practical walkthroughs - what walkthroughs there are (e.g. for setup wizards) do little beyond provide hard copy screenshots of the SBS dialog boxes - the graphic layout is poor - oversized headlines made me suspect that, in the absence of decent text, the editor resorted to padding out the book.I felt as if whoever did edit the book had no knowledge of network computing, never mind SBS.Sorry, but this is a lemon."},{"Title":"Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 Resource Kit (IT Professional)","review":"As an Independant Consultant and Solution Provider, Small Business Server was an ideal candidate to add to our arsenal services being offered to our small business owners.

For example, if you want to know about Exchange, then buy the Exchange 2000 Server Resource Kit.This book is aimed at professionals new to Small Business Server, and it succeeds in this goal. It'll give you a (very) basic grounding in how to plan, install, administer and support a network based on SBS2K.I would recommend that you buy this book to give yourself a high-level summary and quick peek at SBS2K, then to buy the Resource Kits and Administrator Guides (from MS Press) for the various components of SBS (namely Windows 2000, Exchange, ISA, and SQL)."},{"Title":"Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 Resource Kit (IT Professional)","review":"This book has no substance at all.

First, Manis Friedman never had a doubt that a modest lifestyle is better for someone's mental and spiritual health and second, he's not just talking about sex. The third difference is that he's not so much talking about a broad sweeping movement as much as a method of helping individuals get their lives on track.Manis Friedman is one of the celebrities of the Lubavitcher movement and his writing and lectures exemplify why the Lubavitch movement is one of the most successful in reaching out to Jews unimpressed with observance. The operating procedure seems to imply &quot;you think it's all going to be too hard for you? It doesn't fit your personality? Well, let's start small and see what you do feel comfortable with&quot;.In this book Manis Friedman doesn't talk about the sexual mores at first. He knows that people see them as hopelessly outdated and Victorian. Instead he talks about modesty as an all encompassing part of the relationship. In his sermons, he helps to sensitize the reader to avoid little things that couples do all the time like arguing in public, making snide remarks when their partner argues with the clerk at the grocery store, etc. Through these stories and examples he gives a very intriguing and real picture of what a marriage could be and how it can be still romantic and fresh forever instead of for the first decade.By the time he starts talking about the sexual rules of modesty, you are with him. You want the kind of relationship that he describes and if that means you wait until you get married to even touch a woman, so be it. And since this is Judaism, not Catholicism, there is no condemnation of sexuality. It's all about refinining sexuality and making it better than it could ever be in the so-called &quot;swinging single&quot; scene. When Manis Friedman describes a young man who isn't interested in dating or getting married just yet, he even hints at the popular &quot;repressed guy just waiting to release all that pent up energy&quot; fantasy with apparent approval. And just in case, you think that Friedman's ideas based on Halackic Jewish law are terribly repressive and limiting in sexuality, the guy's got 14 kids. He must be doing something right.Read it. You might not agree with it. You might disagree with 90% of what's in this book, but that 10% that you agree with will make you think and make you feel and help you make healthier decisions in your life."},{"Title":"Doesn't Anyone Blush Anymore: Love, Marriage and the Art of Intimacy","review":"Years ago I heard Paul Harvey say that every American should go out and buy this book.

Friedman's gentle wit and wisdom seem to come from distant and deep understandings of the human condition. His instruction is both practical and attainable. It is presented in a down to earth, contemporary and often very humorous way. Although some of the advice might be specific to Judaism (illuminating in itself), much or most of it is universal.

Burke studied India for eighteen years and so aquired much more knowledge than his peers had attempted to aquire but his version of India was perhaps in the end no more real than theirs. Suleri sets up the actual trial which was on its surface an impeachment of th East India Companys Warren Hastings but in reality was a discourse about the nature of empire raising questions of power and accountability between merchant and government. Suleri finds the discourse to be one which enabled each in defining the other to also be made aware of its own nature. Burke was an especially interesting figure bringing to bear on the discourse a formidable intellect perhaps better suited for the aesthetic sphere than the political and indeed the trial was initially attended by the public as if it were high theatre. Burke's attempts to describe India are given thorough scrutiny by Suleri. Burke seems to make the point that India is beyond the Englishmans ken and yet he nonetheless makes many attempts to put India into words and Suleri makes much of the language he uses ie \\"we submit to what we admire, but we love what submits to us\\", such phrases Suleri feels speak volumes in our understanding of the dynamic that is English India.The travel logs of Fanny Parks & Harriet Tytler are interesting to Suleri insofar as they present a particularly female challenge to the traditionally masculine discourse of empire. The female travel log was usually a passive document of 'sketches' which rendered a dynamic continent also passive by focusing on the India of the past, ruins and relics. Parks however does not content herself with the picturesque past but focuses on the dynamic present, with a special attention being given her female Indian counterparts.The last four essays are on Kipling, Forster, Naipaul & Rushdie.The Kipling essay focuses on the adolescence of Kim and how that adolescent openness closes into a narrower vision when Kim comes of age. She thus reads Kim as an \\"allegory of colonial education\\".The Forster essay concentrates on the relationship between Aziz and Fielding in A Passage to India and how their relationship is indicative of the larger inability of cultural exchange between England and India.The Naipaul and Rushdie essays are especially impressive as Suleri offers a complete reading of their works to date. She addresses some of the criticism of Naipauls work ,particularly of his Indian travel piece Area of Darkness, but she reads even that work as a natural step in his progress towards self-perception that finds its most complete expression in Enigma of Arrival. Her overall view of the author is much more generous than many other critical views of Naipaul as she reads in his work, \\"ironies of enablement\\" that she feels have continued relevance to the newer generation postcolonial authors.Shame, Midnights Children & Satanic Verses by Rushdie all receive excellent and sustained attention. Suleri praises Rushdies postmodernist histories for their value as reconciling myths that create new openings.Excellent book."},{"Title":"The Rhetoric of English India","review":"This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory.

Or so it seems at some points, when the author breaks away from the narrative and explores what's going on in the title character's &quot;mind.&quot; Some of the angelology in here is a little bit questionable, in my opinion: the logic behind the Ten Commandments being given to humans and not angels is more than a little slim. On the other hand, this novel does make for a decent evening's reading. Decent is the best I can say, because some of the plot twists are evident a chapter or two ahead of where the author springs them on you. There was more than one occasion when I got into a chapter having been told something I already figured out a couple of chapters previously. If you're into thrillers with a spiritual bent, check this out for what it's worth. Just be warned: this one is the literary equivalent of a Whopper with fries and a Sprite: lots of empty calories.

The book's introduction lays out the general scope of his arguments and background, both of which are quite diverse. Jopling draws on many sources of inspiration but mainly focuses on some of the more recent works in this area. More telling is the section in the Introduction titled &quot;Four Philosophical Psychologies&quot; - finally, a philosopher similar to Faber (&quot;Objectivity and Human Perception: Revisions and Crossroads in Psychoanalysis and Philosophy&quot;) who is unafraid to confront the nexus of thought and being.He first looks at different approaches to the self and how the different modes of self-inquiry lead to some problems. Then he leads into a discussion on self-detachment and self-knowledge including transparency and reflective detachment borrowed from Hampshire's work. Jopling includes some excellent references to psychology while also developing the philosophical overview.Jopling then moves to the grittier questions of being versus identity. His discussion of Sartre's work, particularly the contrast with previous philosophers is very informative and interesting. Then Jopling moves to the post-modern view epitomized by Rorty. The problems associated with the infinite spiral of narratives is laid bare.Jopling's final chapter focuses on dialogic self-knowing. Interestingly enough, Jopling uses Margaret Laurence's &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; to draw in the threads of self-knowledge theory and psychology. I enjoyed the use of literature to illustrate the fact that self-knowledge &quot;takes the form of injunction, attestation, and avowal&quot;.An excellent companion to Faber's work."},{"Title":"Monsieur Dupin,: The detective tales of Edgar Allan Poe;","review":"There is nothing like reading these classic stories from the 1904 printing.Awesome!

There are many things about the man we may not like, but he has never shown himself afraid to speak his mind. That I like. Was he vain, even arrogant? You bet. Was he brilliant? I would say so.

He was the midwife of the Republican Party.This little speech (a mere 23 pages--compared to Crime Against Kansas)could be offered in the present U. S. Senate and be timely.Consider briefly what the senator says in 1862:\\"Surely this is no time for the strife of party. Its jealousies and antipathies are now more than ever irrational.

Associated in innumerable textbooks with the cotton gin that he developed, his contribution to the development of the American economy extended far beyond this simple device. Constance McL. Green explains his impact on our history in this brief biography, one that serves both as a study of his life and of the evolution of early American industry.Whitney displayed his mechanical aptitude from an early age. Growing up in colonial Massachusetts, he preferred tinkering in his father's workshop to his various chores on the family farm. Though his family was middle class by the standards of the age, his request to go to college was nonetheless a considerable burden on the family finances, though one to which his father assented. Whitney attended Yale, which Green sees as a decision with critical consequences, as his subsequent career would be greatly aided by his fellow alumni.After his graduation in 1792, Whitney's acceptance of an tutoring position brought him to Georgia, where he made the acquaintance of the remarkable Catherine Greene, the widow of General Nathaniel Greene. It was while he was staying at her plantation that he set himself to solving one of the most perplexing problems the South faced - how to process green-seed cotton cheaply. Here the author provides a valuable context, explaining the new nation's economic straits in the aftermath of the American Revolution. With America now cut off from most British markets and with her industry undeveloped, many believed that the solution was to develop a new staple product to export. The Industrial Revolution was stimulating a growing demand for raw cotton for the new machines to weave into cloth, but the green seeds of the dominant American variety were prohibitively difficult to separate from the fibers.Eli Whitney solved this problem by building a machine the separated the seeds from the fiber easily. His new device, the cotton gin, was quickly seen as the revolutionary device it was, energizing the economy of a region that until then was bereft of a role. Filing a patent for it, he went into business with Greene's plantation manager, Phineas Miller. Their plan to gin cotton for 2/5 of the crop soon encountered hostility from numerous Southern cotton growers, however, who preferred to copy the gin and do it themselves. The subsequent legal battles dragged on for another decade, and resulted in judgements that brought in only a fraction of the money Whitney and Miller had hoped to make.Yet Whitney's efforts on the cotton gin were to lead to an even more revolutionary innovation. To produce the number of machines believed his company would need, Whitney developed a standardized production process, one which he soon sought to apply to the production of muskets. After his struggles with marketing the cotton gin, Whitney turned to musket manufacturing as an endeavor that ensured a guaranteed income through federal contracts. His promise to deliver thousands of muskets rested not on a new design of the weapon, but on the application of his \\"uniformity system\\" to their production. This, as Green notes, was Whitney's \\"unique contribution to American industrial development . . his execution of a carefully-thought-out system, of which every separate type of machine was a part.\\" Such a system offset the shortage of labor plaguing the young nation, and permanently transformed both American manufacturing and the American economy.Green's book is a good examination of both the man and his legacy. Drawing upon a range of materials, it describes his inventions and his business activities in a clear and accessible manner. More than just a portrait of Whitney, it is a study of a pivotal moment in the history of the American economy and in the development of American technology, with lessons and insights that are as applicable today as they were in his age."},{"Title":"Eli Whitney and the birth of American technology (The library of American biography)","review":"Excellent book! The author presents the life of Eli Whitney from birth to death, and all his accomplishments. I found that Eli was more gifted than previously thought and accomplished much more than is covered in simple biographies.She shows how Eli was mechanical from a young age, and how through perseverence in the many tribulations he faced, he finally reached the success he desired.The author used the letters and papers from Eli's life to write the biography and inserts their text throughout the biography."},{"Title":"Eli Whitney and the birth of American technology (The library of American biography)","review":"As an inventor, I read this book with especial interest. It described how Whitney is rightly regarded as one of the earliest and greatest of the Yankee inventors.But the version of the book I read was the original one, published in the 1950s. By today's standards it is flawed. There is not a single illustration or photo in the book. While the author supplies a written description of the core of Whitney's cotton gin, a figure would have greatly aided the reader in following the narrative, and in better appreciating Whitney's innovations. There is an irony here. When Whitney filed his original patent application, the patent office required diagrams to assist the examiners in understanding his submission. Yet some 150 years later, when this book was written, and with vast advances in printing technology and much lower costs, the author did not see fit to furnishing any diagrams. Progress?!The author's omissions perhaps highlight how little she understood the need to better convey her message to readers. Or was it the fault of her publisher?On a separate note, some readers might regard Whitney's achievements with ambivalence. The book points out that it enabled the rise of a vast slavocracy in the American south, based on cotton. There were certainly slave plantations before Whitney's gin, but the economics of slavery was becoming increasingly dubious. His invention gave 3 more generations of suffering slaves, and a bloody civil war."},{"Title":"Eli Whitney and the birth of American technology (The library of American biography)","review":"When I walked in to class the first day of school , he told us get out some paper and write this down. I thought O.K. just probally those boring class rules again. He said read Eli Whitney and the Birth of American Technology,I thought oh how cool we get to read a book! So I found the book and read it.Here is my comments and summary.I was amazed to learn that we were not doing to good economical in the 1700s. England got mad at us because we were no longer doing things they hoped America would,so we went our way and they went thiers.America started declining in economics because we no longer had the machinery that England had supplied us with. We kept declining because we no longer knew how to do anything independantly. Suddenly we could grow cotton! Pulling the seeds out of the cotton was hard labor and the colonists could only produce 1 pound a day. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin to make the labor of picking seeds out of cotton easier. He was not very good at reading, but doing figures was easy.This helped him majorly in inventing the cotton gin and many other inventions. If you are interested in America's struggle for economics in thr 1700s,I would highly recommend this great book."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"If you're squeamish about sex, this novel is not for you. If, on the other hand, you not only like sex, but like it served up piping hot with plenty of funny literate repartee, then Lofting is a sumptuous feast: rich, spicy, and very satisfying. Claire, Andres, and Nick are as compelling as they are unforgettable--a menage of characters who aren't afraid to indulge their wildest appetites (at Chez Marceau, three is not a crowd and handcuffs are de rigueur). My only regret is that Lofting wasn't longer. I can't wait to see what Miss Marceau does next."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"This erotica is for the brain as well as for the nether regions; I like it when I have to look words up in between descriptions of debauchery.

Alma Marceau's Lofting is one of the most exquisite erotic novels ever written. As fiendishly graphic as it is beautifully philosophical, Lofting chronicles the unraveling of a woman's electrifying sexual desire. She has decided to surrender her body to her master, but little did she anticipate that she'd end up surrendering her heart...Lofting is full of wonderful imagery and poetic undertones. To describe this novel as erotic is putting it mildly. It is an extraordinary piece of work, beautiful and lyrical. There are some humorous moments as well. Are you in the bargain for literary erotica? I suggest you pick up this incredible book."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"Marceau's \\"Lofting\\" gives the reader a vivid tour through a variety of ultra hot sex scenes, while simultaneously offering a French tickler for the funny bone.

Once you get past the tedious \\"getting to know you\\" stage, your treated by some typical bondage, master/slave, submission, pain stuff; an affluent woman being taught the ways of a master. The thing is so contrived, it seemed created by some computer program. The author (whomever he or she really is) throws in some literary references in a feeble attempt to make the character seem like cultural sophisticates (sort of the way the writers of \\"Frazier\\" did, but at least the TV show was lots of fun. My advice: if you need to read this book,you probably spend a lot of lonely evenings in bed, so you should get yourself a more creative sex life."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"Loved it. When's the movie?Lofting is a cool and biting collage of \\"black and whites,\\" capturing a habitue that is very much alive and well. The moral elite will claim disbelief when in reality, it's a simpler case of no longer being invited. For those of us who can and DO live below and above ground, like camera film Lofting shoots nothing more or less than truthful erotic justice, over and over on high speed.Lofting (thankfully) dispels the smarmy, quixotic notions of BDSM played out in online chatrooms by kooks and pretenders. Those are your run-of-the-mill \\"Sirs and Ladys\\" who need to mitigate their own \\"icky\\" erotic fantasy with truly whacked schlock of \\"Knights in Castles accepting Gifts of Submission\\" from helpless damsels with great underwear.Lofting brings us real people, including Andres and Nick who are out and another, Claire, who comes out in front of us. The color--to frame these black and whites is great language in dialogue. Not simply real people, we're treated to intelligent, funny, well-read, real and sensitive people--exactly the kind (or one kind) of people who can, should and do live the underground erotic polis, above ground.

Pseudo-intellectual language, undeveloped characters, a few nice parts. Not at all what I expected, and not particularly sexy."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"Zabangi! Alma, Claire, Andres and Nick welcome you to a zone so real, it makes us wonder. Just as Nietzsche's \\"The Gay Science\\" isn't (necessarily) about cheek to cheek, \\"Lofting\\" isn't (simply) about sex. It's about life with real walking papers, after 35. You are now free to go. (And come in any way you please.)As a computer keyboard finds its way into the knowing, pianist-like fingers of Andres, a musing Claire finds herself in need of the music. Some may find the unyielding banter between them as upwardly pretentious. Consider however, that Merceau has simply polished an old-world patina onto the gutteral groaning groin of our most finely honed, collective orgasm. (What's the point of evolving if you can't go full circle?)Merceau craftily manages the disconnect between the base, primordial mange of long lost lusty, take-and-beg sticky goo and--\\"words.\\" Words that have betrayed even the masters for thousands of years. It is not just the words themselves, but the \\"back and forth\\" of them that turns these pages for you. One demands that one receives and where there is \\"faith-in-goo,\\" there is (not unlike Holy Communion) a discovery of wholeness. It is Claire coming full circle, diving to the bottom to reach the top. Walking papers. Certificate of Authenticity. Alas, she has taken arms and joined the men. Freedom rings everywhere, slippery when wet!Lofting imposes an erotic authenticity of wordage that begins in Instant Messaging, carrying all the way through the real-life scenarios of a faithful Claire and her \\"already-there\\" high-priests, Nick and Andres. One demands that one receive and Merceau never sacrifices the erotic authenticity of the well-spoken word of the matter as it is in the moment, for yet another lie of \\"How we should want.\\" The demand and receipt remains unsurprising (yet surprising) as Nick and Andres become demanders and receivers of each others' peelings of Claire's onion.As for me, I finally discovered that the word, \\"psnob.\\" was left out of the Categorical Imperative. I too am a \\"psnob's psnob,\\" and like Merceau, that's my story and I'm really sticking to it. No apologies for laughing at and with an acute case of intelligence, not simply in the words, but in knowing the longing of the 'every Claire\\" to be swept up--not like THAT, but like THIS.Alma Merceau reminded me of what I forgot, what WE have left behind in the SUV.

And the characters have stayed in my mind like the heroes and heroines of the best classic tales. Likable, complex men and women with strong and sometimes unreasonable passions -- the people in this story draw you in, and of course, the fascinating erotic scenes tend to keep you there. Marceau speaks the truth about sex and the sexes, and she's so damned funny! I found myself re-reading the book's online conversations to see if they would still make me laugh a second time, and they did -- and a third, as well. It's some of the wittiest dialogue I have ever read. &quot;Lofting&quot; is more than the tale of one woman's sexual odyssey, it's a tribute to what this kind of adventure can and should be, and it tells us what is going on in the heart of a bright, sweet woman as her adventure unfolds.

Is there a difference, well yes, in erotica people would have sex in a departemnt store because the lights went out and the opportunity was there, in this book they have sex in a department store considering a Sunday afternoon outing.We follow our heroine, Claire, through a sexual awakening after meeting Andres in an on-line chat room. Andres, is able to start this trip for Claire by showing her what cyber sex is all about and then he encourages her to start eploring her sexuality with people near her in order to continue the spice in their internet and phone sex sessions ...The book is wonderfull and written for the intellectual snobs in all of us.

Well, having been a reader of a lot of kink over the years, I thought that I couldn't possibly be disappointed in what was described as \\"intelligent fiction.\\" Boy was I wrong.It started with such promise: a curious woman, Claire, engages in a kinky exchange with a distant friend, Andres, over the internet. They've never met in real life, but there is such chemistry between them...This story had all the makings of a great adventure in erotic kink, but somewhere along the way, Alma Marceau lost control of her plot, and it turned into a typical, cheesy story about sterotyped BDSM sex. How disappointing.Instead of following the very erotic, chemistry-laden, and mysterious internet relationship with Andres, Marceau tosses Claire to a new love-interest: a typical Dom-ish character named Nick. Marceau then tries (tries waaaay too hard) to make him dark and mysterious. She fails. He comes across as a cookie-cutter Dom with standard attributes. Yawn.Throughout the story, Marceau adds in bits of foriegn phrases and references to literature and philosophy, but it comes across as ultra-contrieved: a attempt to be witty about being witty.The last 30 pages or so was basically a 4-person orgy, with Claire as the whipping post, and it was so poorly written and bland that I almost couldn't make myself finish reading it. If you want to read some good kink, try \\"The Marketplace\\" series by Laura Antoniou, the \\"Two Moons\\" series by Chelsea Shepard, or the very erotic \\"Blue: the Color of Desire\\" by Patrick Linney."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"I read the reviews and was very excited about getting this book, but then I found it disappointing. The main character was not terribly likeable (maybe that's just a personality clash between her and I, though) and the plot didn't seem to move very well. Honestly, I can't really remember any true specifics with what I disliked, but I definitely remember the general annoyance and disappointment I had afterwards.

Lofting takes you on a wonderfully eloquent trip through a transition period in the life of the main character.

The conceit of email sex is skillfully done. In fact, the sexy emails are the only good thing about this book, and when the author unwisely moves away from them, about mid-way through the book, the entire thing falls flat. Aside from the emails, the book is filled with unbelievable characters engaging in anatomically dubious acts described in trite sentences - over and over and over and over. By the end the book has degenerated into a mash of plot-driven pseudo S&M.;Other people's reactions to this book are proof positive that the genitals and the brain are not connected."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"This book is a delightful surprise! I came across it when my girlfriend and I were considering buying a loft and looking for some advice. I got advice all right, and it certainly has helped make my girlfriend and me very happy, but it was on a whole other level! And it wasn't really the sex, though it's riveting, page-turning stuff. And it wasn't the concept of &quot;lofting&quot; per se--I'm virtually asexual when it comes to online relationships--though that was a fascinating world to discover. No, it was the literary wit of the thing! Ms. Marceau clearly has a gift--for the nonverbal, it goes without saying--but also for the easy transition from scenes of intimacy to the rhythms of the street, from arousing narrative description to philosophical wordplay. Her lightning-like allusions and brilliant turns of phrase serve to deepen the enduring interest of this book and of its amazing cast of attractive characters. (Everyone will find someone to lust after in these pages.) You will read passages over and over, not just to revisit, say, the young girls in the stables or the sleepy studs in the &quot;loft,&quot; but also to discover even more new delights hidden away in the many folds of this intricately complex presentation of promiscuity. Whether she is lingering over a Madeleine or deftly picking apart the telltale scraps of some potted meat, Marceau knows just what it is a reader wants when it's time for a break from the routine."},{"Title":"Lofting","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer--that I finished the book with disappointment and a general feeling of \\"ick.\\" Worse, I was actually enjoying it until about half-way through. Then it just went awry. It made me feel like the way you do when you discover that an aquaintance--who has the possiblity of being a great friend--turns out to be a jerk. As I continued reading, (to continue the comparison) you have to go on with the perfunctory friendship...in this case to finish the book.I agree that it is not stupid banter between two people, but more intelligent in its language, however, big words and \\"lofty\\" references do not a great story make. It is like they are just jammed in there (the words I mean) and the ideas aren't ever really developed. Think of someone who drops their new-word-a-day-calendar vocabulary on you to impress you.I never felt that it could really be happening or that the characters were real.

Marnold gives an excellent review. I agree that Wittgenstein is the most \\"seminal\\" philosopher of the 20th C., but I disagree with the view that he's the most important. Unlike Marnold, I like Moore. I think he's underestimated. His \\"Principia\\" is extraordinary. My own favorite philosopher is Karl Popper. So this review is deliberately contrarian.Wittgenstein is very difficult to understand, with which everyone agrees. His best exegete is David Stern, who has studied LW for decades and written the best overview of his philosophy. And, once you see what LW seems to write, much of it isn't very significant.Yes, \\"language games,\\" \\"private language,\\" \\"family resemblance,\\" \\"use determines meaning,\\" and other LW phrases have entered the academic parlor game. But even those who use LW don't agree with what LW meant. The problem is obvious. Aphorisms are quaint, but they are difficult to distill into an argument (ditto: Nietzsche), simply because there aren't any. By reading LW one is supposed to have \\"eureka\\" or \\"insights.\\" Well, by golly, everyone has, but they they don't all seem to agree. Wonder why? If LW's point was that language is polysemous, well the medievalist knew that centuries ago. The clash between nominalism and essentialism (family resemblances) goes back to the thirteenth century (Occham/Aquinas), if not before. If language is stable/unstable, you can get better arguments from Saul Kripke and I. A. Richards than you can from LW. If you see a pattern here (and I hope you do), the problems that concerned LW go back centuries, but at least back then, they spoke coherently and argued intelligently about the claims they were making. LW's aphorisms lead to all kinds of equivocation, which is precisely what he was trying to avoid (we think).If that's not confusing enough, LW had a \\"Pauline on the way to Damascus\\" conversion between co-writing the Tractatus and the Investigations. Everyone agrees there's a wide difference, but over what they cannot pin down. The Tractatus is arcane and obscure, but patient (believe me) reading and reflection reveals the semblance of an argument (in philosophy's use). The Investigations, on the other hand, require a Brahman; does this belong to that, or is it a part of this over here? Even the most astute scholars don't agree. So where does that leave us?Yes (II), language was the preoccupation of the 20th C. And honestly, we've learned a lot. It all started with LW, so for that we're all grateful. Some \\"seminal\\" philosophers of the 20th C. are indebted to LW's linguistic turn, e.g., Austin, Ayer, Russell, Ryle, Searle, Putnam, Taylor, Rorty, Gadamer, Ricouer, et alia. Yet I think English philosopher Roger Scruton makes the convincing point that German philosopher Gotlieb Frege was more instrumental in that focus than LW. And, Frege, while challenging, is intelligible.Philosophy often asks the arcane, difficult, and opaque questions that concern all of us. Unfortunately, as challenging as those questions are--and they are challenging, the last thing philosophers need is someone who is unintelligible himself. It's difficult enough to try to \\"wrap yourself around\\" a particular issue, even when the person is writing coherently, so why have people gravitated to LW (another case is Jacques Derrida), in which convolution and opacity are the hallmarks? Frankly, I think it is an intelligentsia embargo. If YOU can't understand what we're doing, how dare you question what it is that we do? (Reply:) Simply because no one understands.Difficult thought can be difficult. Even David Hume, the most accessible English-speaking philosopher of all time, has widely different exegetes. Which proves the point. So why invest in an author whose aphorisms continue to confuse, rather than in writers who write plain English. And if philosophy is your game, as it is mine, then write in coherent arguments. You know: If a is B, and B is C, then A is C (that's Aristotle's syllogism, for those who don't know). Boolean logic has largely replaced Aristotle's, but the same general concept applies. Why would a computer programmer, for example, write a software program that her hardware couldn't understand? We are the hardware, and LW as software doesn't seem to get us very far.If one is really interested in the philosophy of language (which frankly I find boring), Frege and Austin are the writers to read.

Phish gets it. Einstein with his theories on relativity got it. The stream of consciousness guys, James and Faulkner got it. The nude coming down the stairs and the cubist got it. Wittgenstein (hereafter W) does the same for logic. The above all changed their fields, what they were, by their work, W changed what philosophy is.

Few have figured out how to make his works a business and sadly that is all our society is now, our main context is money. 2. The philosophy he changed was quite irrelevant so he is tainted by the past he rejected and changed. 3. Generally when you revolutionize a field your peers load you on their shoulders and carry you through town. They do this since you have made the field and thus them more important. Einstein did this for physics, everyone loves smoked string cheese now. But W made his peers go down the hall and get a new office sign, reading, 'History of Philosophy'. 4.

While the earlier work was heavily influenced and endorsed by Bertrand Russell, who was always better known than his Austrian colleague in the world at large, the latter work is a complete departure from the logic based philosophy of Russell and the Logical Positivists, for whom the Tractatus was their bible. Although I have never seen this in any philosophical or historical analysis of Wittgenstein's work, the \`Philosophical Investigations' were much closer to the \`common sense' style of philosophy of G. E. Moore than to the thinking of Russell. All three were Cambridge dons and it is certain that Wittgenstein and Moore knew one another very well. The only thing which may have prevented Moore's ideas from influencing Wittgenstein is that the latter man was a much deeper thinker whose ideas still shape modern philosophy while Moore has become something of a footnote in the history of philosophy, best known for his common sense defense of the real world and his \`naturalistic fallacy' invention in his pretentiously titled \`Principia Ethica'.Wittgenstein and Moore certainly were the joint parents of modern English and American academic philosophical style and doctrines. While Wittgenstein did not publish very much in his lifetime, his influence is widespread and deep due to his long tenure as a teacher at Cambridge, from the early thirties to his death in 1955. As abstruse as Wittgenstein's philosophy may seem at first look, it is really exceptionally applicable to everyday thinking. One of my favorite stories about Wittgenstein is in a memoir written by the American philosopher and Wittgenstein student, Norman Malcolm. During World War II, Wittgenstein and Malcolm were chatting about something the Germans had done and Malcolm said it was against the English character to do any similar action. At this comment, Wittgenstein lost his temper at how his student, Malcolm could make such a statement which so totally went against Wittgenstein's teachings. A much less anecdotal application of his thought is his notion of \`family resemblences' expounded early in the \`Philosophical Investigations' as a tool for analyzing the meanings of words. His example was the notion of games. Try as you might, someone can probably find a counterexample to virtually any definition of games which will fit into a reasonably sized dictionary definition. Wittgenstein's solution was that everything which can be called a game has a \`family resemblance' to other games and does not have a family resemblance to most things which are not games.This is just one tool and two examples of the extreme empiricism in Wittgenstein's thought. While there is a world of difference in the styles of Wittgenstein and the great Scottish philosopher David Hume, there is a strong \`family resemblance' between their doctrines in that neither was in the least congenial to generalizations of any sort. The biggest difference between the doctrines of Wittgenstein and Hume is that while Hume was concerned with what we can know, Wittgenstein was concerned with the meanings of what we say and write.Wittgenstein's most famous doctrine in the \`Investigations' is that to determine the meaning of words and ideas, look at how they are used. This became his E=mc squared. All his students wielded this doctrine like a bludgeon to beat any \`old school' position into submission.Although the doctrines of the Tractatus and the Investigations are quite different, Wittgenstein's style of writing in aphorisms appears in both works and appears in virtually every posthumous collection of his notes which have been published in the last 60 years. Unlike Nietzsche, this style was not an artifice or merely done for effect. Wittgenstein's thinking was so intense I think he simply did not have the patience to connect the dots between his primary inspirations.After the notion of \`use' and \`family resemblences, the most important position in the Investigations may be his arguments against the notion of a private language. While no one in everyday life has the slightest notion that they may be talking in a private language, the concept is central to the refutation of many older philosophical positions as diverse as those of Bishop Berkeley and Rene Descartes. The concept simply was that a language that is by its nature understandable by only its creator is not possible. It is not a language.While Wittgenstein's own works stayed close to everyday language or mathematical thinking, the great virtue of the \`Philosophical Investigations' over the system of the Tractatus is that the later work creates tools which may intelligently be applied to all kinds of discourse, from Ethics to Aesthetics to Politics to Religion. The later work does not turn its back on these things as some may have seen in the earlier work when it relegated virtually all discourse not about the natural world to the bin of meaninglessness. Since Wittgenstein's intention was to show the emptiness of metaphysics, he followed his thinking to its logical conclusion and threw the baby out with the bathwater in the Tractatus.One of the most indelible images imprinted on my thinking from my study of the \`Philosophical Investigations' is the comment that the search for the solution to a philosophical problem is often like trying to force open a locked door, when all you need to do is turn around to see the open window. This is the notion of thinking outside the box writ large.Some of Wittgenstein's ideas can be very easy to grasp, like the notion of \`family resemblences'. Others like the concept of a private language may be very, very hard. This means that even a nonprofessional can come away with something from this very, very important book."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations = Philosophische untersuchungen","review":"it would probably say something about The Tao. What does the Tao have to do with Wittgenstein? Very little. I bring it up because there are three books of philosophy which I believe everyone should struggle with at some point in their lives. The first is Plato's Republic, for what I hope are obvious reasons. The other two are The Tao Te Ching and Philosophical Investigations. These two books have common threads that are often unremarked on, but perhaps the most pertinant point to this review is the fact that both are often mistaken, by people who should know better, for being much more esoteric than they actually. The Tao Te Ching is in many ways a manual for surviving in tumultuous times, and most of it's advice, stripped of it's poetry, is nothing if not practical.Similarly, Philosophical Investigations is a user's guide for the urge to philosophize. Throughout the book, Wittgenstein instructs the reader on not what to think, but how to go about thinking. If there is a thesis at all in this book, it is that we must be cautious about how we use language. He goes to great lengths to illustrate why this is, and exactly what sort of nonsense happens \\"when language goes on holiday.\\"Unfortunately, it is not a lesson that everyone in the philosophical community learned from Uncle Ludwig. One suspects that the history of philosophy in the 20th century might have gone quite differently if folks like Quine, Lewis, Nagel, Harman, and Ryle had spent a little more time putting together Wittgenstein's puzzles. There is a great deal of confusion in the world of philosophy, a great deal of disagreement, and a great deal of nonsense. Wittgenstein's legacy is that he realized that this was the first problem that must be faced by anyone at all tempted by the questions of philosophy.Was he right? Are all philosophical problems reducible to linguistic puzzles? Are we led astray by our picture of the world as it is presented to us by our language? Is there an important distinction between an empirical and a grammatical truth?I, for one, was convinced by this book. Others are not.

While Wittgenstein's solutions to age old philosophical problems may infuriate those with a vested interested in continuing to discuss them endlessly, anyone with an open mind will immediately see the value in his work. If you think that a good deal of philosophizing thoroughout its history has been the utterly misguided search for so-called real essences, then Wittgenstein's later philosophy provides an interesting and insightful response to that history of philosophy.After reading this book you will never think the same way again."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations = Philosophische untersuchungen","review":"Originally published in 1953 the \`Philosophical Investigations' was the latter of Wittgenstein's two influential philosophical texts (the Tractatus being the offer). This Fiftieth Anniversary edition provides the original German text and Anscombe's English translation on opposing pages.The Investigations is widely considered to be one of the most influential philosophical texts of the last century. Although it touches on a range of issues including logic and philosophy of the mind it is largely focused on issues pertaining to the philosophy of language. That said, I share the view that Wittgenstein is difficult to categorize - in many ways he stands outside the mainstream of philosophy.I have occasionally heard it said that Wittgenstein is appealing and accessible to non-philosophers. Undoubtedly this will vary from reader to reader, however, I think a good understanding of the philosophical questions of the time is essential to getting the most out of Wittgenstein - he spends little time framing the issues under discussion and without this background many of his musings may seem meaningless.From a historic perspective this is one of the most important works in twentieth century philosophy, on a more basic level it is a choppy and poorly constructed work. I struggle with Wittgenstein, sometimes viewing him as trivial other times as profound. Clearly, many great thinkers are in the latter camp, as are ironically many neophytes who want to appear as if they understand Wittgenstein.Overall, this is an excellent edition of a modern day classic - an essential addition to any serous student's library.

Broad (who did not understand nor like him). \\"Not offering the chair of philosophy to Wittgenstein would be like not offering the chair of physics to Einstein!\\" I think of him as the Einstein of intuitive psychology. Though born ten years later, he was likewise hatching ideas about the nature of reality at nearly the same time and in the same part of the world and like Einstein nearly died in WW1. Now suppose Einstein was a suicidal homosexual recluse with a difficult personality who published only one early version of his ideas that were confused and often mistaken, but became world famous; completely changed his ideas but for the next 30 years published nothing more, and knowledge of his new work, in mostly garbled form, diffused slowly from occasional lectures and students notes; that he died in 1951 leaving behind over 20,000 pages of mostly handwritten scribblings in German, composed of sentences or short paragraphs with, often, no clear relationship to sentences before or after; that these were cut and pasted from other notebooks written years earlier with notes in the margins, underlinings and crossed out words, so that many sentences have multiple variants; that his literary executives cut this indigestible mass into pieces, leaving out what they wished and struggling with the monstrous task of capturing the correct meaning of sentences which were conveying utterly novel views of how the universe works and that they then published this material with agonizing slowness (not finished after half a century) with prefaces that contained no real explanation of what it was about; that he became as much notorious as famous due to many statements that all previous physics was a mistake and even nonsense, and that virtually nobody understood his work, in spite of hundreds of books and tens of thousands of papers discussing it; that many physicists knew only his early work in which he had made a definitive summation of Newtonian physics stated in such extremely abstract and condensed form that it was impossible to decide what was being said; that he was then virtually forgotten and that most books and articles on the nature of the world and the diverse topics of modern physics had only passing and usually erroneous references to him, and that many omitted him entirely; that to this day, over half a century after his death, there were only a handful of people who really grasped the monumental consequences of what he had done. This, I claim, is precisely the situation with Wittgenstein.Had W lived into his 80's he would have been able to directly influence Searle, Symons, and countless other students of behavior. If his brilliant friend Frank Ramsey had not died in his youth, a highly fruitful collaboration would almost certainly have ensued. If his student and colleague Alan Turing had become his lover, one of the most amazing collaborations of all time would likely have evolved. In any one case the intellectual landscape of the 20th century would have been different and if all 3 had occurred it would almost certainly have been very very different. Instead he lived in relative intellectual isolation, few knew him well or had an inkling of his ideas while he lived, and only a handful within philosophy have any real grasp of his work today. He could have shined as an engineer(he has an aviation patent), a mathematician (he sketched out a proof of Euler's theorem, since shown to be valid and grasped the psychological foundations of math , incompleteness, infinity etc., as no one else (afaik) has to this day), a physiologist (he did wartime research in it), a musician (he played instruments and had a renowned talent for whistling), an architect (the house he designed and constructed for his sister still stands), or an entrepreneur (he inherited one of the largest fortunes in the world but gave it all away). It is a miracle he survived the trenches and prison camps (while writing the Tractatus) in WW1, many years of suicidal depressions (3 brothers succumbed to them), being trapped in Austria and executed by the Nazis (he was partly Jewish), and that he was not persecuted for his homosexuality and driven to suicide like his friend Turing. He realized nobody understood what he was doing and might never (not surprising as he was half a century ahead of psychology and philosophy, which only recently have started accepting that our brain is an evolved organ like our heart.)PI was not published until 1953, 2 years after his death and can be viewed as two quite different books. Part one is from his middle or W2 period and Part two is from his final or W3 period (which overlaps extensively with his books LWPP1 and 2), when his ideas crystallized into a unique and amazingly deep and prescient description of behavior. Although W wrote thousands of pages and is the most discussed philosopher in modern times, only a few have any real grasp of what he did and how it anticipates in detail many of the latest advances in psychology and philosophy (descriptive psychology). It is essential to first read some of the commentaries on his work by others. One of the best is that of Daniele Moyal-Sharrock (DMS) whose 2004 volume \\"Understanding Wittgenstein's On Certainty\\" is mandatory for every educated person, and perhaps the best starting point for understanding Wittgenstein, psychology, philosophy and life, since it explains the unconscious, axiomatic structure of animal behavior. Next I would suggest the writings of Daniel Hutto, especially his \\"Wittgenstein and the End of Philosophy\\"(2004). However (in my view) like all analyses, they fall far short of grasping his unique and revolutionary advances in describing behavior by failing to put them in a broad evolutionary and contemporary scientific context, which I will attempt in skeletal outline here. Finally, all of Searle should be read, with special attention to \\"Rationality in Action\\" and his more recent works. Though Searle does not say and seems to be unaware, his work follows directly from that of W.To say that Searle has carried on W's work is not to imply that it is a direct result of W study, but rather that because there is only ONE human psychology (for the same reason there is only ONE human cardiology), that anyone accurately describing behavior must be voicing some variant or extension of what W said. I find most of Searle foreshadowed in W, including versions of the famous Chinese room argument against Strong AI. Incidentally if the Chinese Room interests you then you should read Victor Rodych's xlnt ,but virtually unknown, supplement on the CR--\\"Searle Freed of Every Flaw\\". Rodych has also written a series of superb papers on W's philosophy of mathematics --i.e., the EP (Evolutionary Psychology) of the axiomatic System 1 Primary Language Games (PLG's) of counting as extended into the endless SLG's (Secondary Language Games) of math. I will also note that nobody who promotes Strong AI and CTM (Computational Theory of Mind) seems to be aware that W's Tractatus is the most striking and powerful statement of their viewpoint ever penned (behavior is the logical processing of facts). Of course decades later (but before the digital computer was a gleam in Turing's eye) he described in great detail why CTM was a bankrupt point of view that must be replaced by psychology (or you can say this is all he did for the rest of his life).Wittgenstein (W) is for me easily the most brilliant thinker on human behavior of all time and this is his most famous work. His work as a whole shows that all behavior is an extension of innate true-only axioms (see \\"On Certainty\\" for his final extended treatment of this idea) and that our conscious ratiocination emerges from unconscious machinations. His corpus can be seen as the foundation for all description of animal behavior, revealing how the mind works and indeed must work. The \\"must\\" is entailed by the fact that all brains share a common ancestry and common genes and so there is only one basic way they work, that this necessarily has an axiomatic structure, that all higher animals share the same evolved psychology based on inclusive fitness, and that in humans this is extended into a personality based on throat muscle contractions (language) that evolved to manipulate others (with variations that can be regarded as trivial). This book, and arguably all of W's work and all useful discussion of behavior is a development of or variation on these ideas. Another major theme here, and of course in all discussion of human behavior, is the need to separate the automatisms which underlie all behavior from the effects of culture. Though few philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists etc explicitly discuss this, it can be seen as the major problem they are dealing with. I suggest it will prove of the greatest value to consider W's work and most of his examples as an effort to tease apart not only fast and slow thinking(e.g., perceptions vs dispositions--see below), but nature and nurture.In the course of many years reading extensively in W, other philosophers, and psychology, it has become clear that what he laid out in his final period (and throughout his earlier work in a less clear way) are the foundations of what is now known as evolutionary psychology (EP), or if you prefer, psychology, cognitive linguistics, intentionality, higher order thought or just animal behavior. Sadly, almost nobody seems to realize that his works are a vast and unique textbook of descriptive psychology that is as relevant now as the day it was written. He is almost universally ignored by psychology and other behavioral sciences and humanities, and even those few in philosophy who have more or less understood him, have not carried the analysis to its logical (psychological) conclusion, nor realized the extent of his anticipation of the latest work on EP and cognitive illusions (the two selves of fast and slow thinking--see below). His heir apparent, John Searle, refers to him periodically and his work can be seen as a straightforward extension of W's, but he does not really get that this is what he is doing. Other leading W analysts such as Hutto and Moyal-Sharrock do marvelously but (in my view) stop short of putting him in the center of current psychology, where he certainly belongs.I eventually came to understand much of W by regarding his corpus as the pioneering effort in EP, seeing that he was describing the two selves and the multifarious language games of fast and slow thinking, and by starting from his 3rd period works and reading backwards to the proto-Tractatus. It has been extremely revealing to alternate W with the writings of hundreds of other philosophers and evolutionary psychologists (as I regard all psychologists and in fact all behavioral scientists, cognitive linguists and others). It should also be clear that insofar as they are coherent and correct, all accounts of behavior are describing the same phenomena and ought to translate easily into one another. Thus the recently fashionable themes of \\"Embodied Mind\\" and \\"Radical Enactivism\\" should flow directly from and into W's work. However almost nobody is able to follow his example of avoiding jargon and sticking to perspicuous examples, so even the redoubtable Hutto (see below) has to be heavily filtered to see that this is true. However, even Hutto does not get how completely W has anticipated the latest work in fast and slow, two-self embodied thinking (acting).W can also be regarded as a pioneer in evolutionary cognitive linguistics--the Top Down analysis of the mind and its evolution via the careful analysis of examples of language use in context, by exposing the many varieties of language games and the relationships between the primary games of the true-only unconscious, axiomatic fast thinking of perception, memory and reflexive emotions and acts (often described as the subcortical and primitive cortical reptilian brain first-self functions), and the later evolved higher cortical dispositional conscious abilities of believing, knowing, thinking etc. that constitute the true or false propositional secondary language games of slow thinking that are the network of cognitive illusions that constitute the second-self personality. He dissects hundreds of language games showing how the true-only perceptions, memories and reflexive actions of system one grade into the thinking, remembering, and understanding of system two dispositions and many of his examples also address the nature/nurture issue explicitly. With this evolutionary perspective, his later works are a breathtaking revelation of human nature that is entirely current and has never been equaled. Many perspectives have heuristic value, but I find that this evolutionary two systems view not only lets me understand W, but cuts like a hot knife through the frozen butter of all discussions of behavior. To repeat Dobzhansky's famous comment: \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\\" And nothing in philosophy makes sense except in the light of evolutionary psychology.The failure (in my view) of even the best thinkers (with a few possible exceptions) to fully grasp W's significance is partly due to the limited attention \\"On Certainty\\" (OC) and his other 3rd period works have received, but even more to the inability to understand how profoundly our view of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, politics, law, morals, ethics, religion, aesthetics, literature (all of them being descriptive psychology), alters once we accept this evolutionary point of view. The dead hand of the blank slate view of behavior still rests heavily on most people, pro or amateur and is the default of the second self of slow thinking conscious System 2,(which is oblivious to the fact that the groundwork for all behavior lies in the unconscious, fast thinking axiomatic structure of System 1). System 1 is more or less equivalent to \\"mirroring\\"(Goldman), \\"neural resonance\\"(Gallagher), \\"biosemantics\\"(Millikan), and \\"biosemiotics\\"(Hutto). Steven Pinker's brilliant \`The Blank Slate: the modern denial of human nature' is highly recommended preparation, even though it is now dated and limited in various ways, and he has no clue about Wittgenstein, and hence of what can be regarded as the first and best really deep investigation into the foundations of human nature. Also, he seems not to grasp that the Blank Slate view is an expression of the cognitive illusions that constitute our mental life.The common ideas (e.g., the subtitle of one of Pinker's books \\"The Stuff of Thought: language as a window into human nature\\") that language is a window on or some sort of translation of our thinking or even (Fodor) that there must be some other \\"Language of Thought\\" of which it is a translation, were rejected by W, who tried to show, with hundreds of continually reanalyzed perspicacious examples of language in action, that language is the best picture we can ever get of thinking, the mind and human nature, and his whole corpus can be regarded as the development of this idea. He rejected the idea that the Bottom Up approaches of physiology, experimental psychology and computation (now we say Computational Theory of Mind, Strong AI, Dynamic Sytstems Theory etc) could reveal what his Top Down deconstructions of Language Games (LG's) did. The difficulties he noted are to understand what is always in front of our eyes and to capture vagueness (\\"The greatest difficulty in these investigations is to find a way of representing vagueness\\" LWPP1, 347). And so, speech (i.e., oral muscle contractions, the principal way we can interact) is not a window into the mind but is the mind itself, which is expressed by acoustic blasts about past, present and future acts (i.e., our speech using the later evolved Secondary Language Games (SLG's) of the Second Self--the dispositions --imagining, knowing, meaning, believing, intending etc.). As with his other aphorisms I suggest one should take seriously his comment that even if God could look into our mind he could not see what we are thinking--this should be the motto of the Embodied Mind.Some of W's favorite topics in his later second and his third periods are the different (but interdigitating) LG's of fast and slow thinking (System 1 and 2 or roughly PLG's and SLG's), the epiphenomenality of our second self and mental life, the impossibility of private language and the axiomatic structure of all behavior. The PLG's are utterances by and descriptions of our involuntary, System 1, fast thinking, true only, nonpropositional, untestable mental states- our perceptions and memories and involuntary acts, while the evolutionarily later SLG's are descriptions of voluntary, System 2, slow thinking, testable true or false, propositional, dispositional (and often counterfactual) imagining, supposing, intending, thinking, knowing, believing etc. A useful heuristic is to separate behavior into Intentionality 1 and Intentionality 2 (e.g., Thinking 1 and Thinking 2 etc.) He recognized that \`Nothing is Hidden'--i.e., our whole psychology and all the answers to all philosophical questions are here in our language (our life) and that the difficulty is not to find the answers but to recognize them as always here in front of us--we just have to stop trying to look deeper (e.g., \\"The greatest danger here is wanting to observe oneself.\\" LWPP1, 459).W makes these points throughout his works in countless examples and again his whole corpus can be regarded as the effort to make them clear. After all, what exactly is the alternative? W showed over and over that standard ways of describing behavior (i.e., most of philosophy, and much of descriptive psychology, anthropology, sociology, economics, etc.) are either demonstrably false or incoherent. Once we understand W, we realize the absurdity of regarding \\"language philosophy\\" as a separate study apart from other areas of behavior, since language is just another name for the mind. And, when W says (as he does many times) that understanding behavior is in no way dependent on the progress of psychology (e.g., his oft-quoted assertion \\"The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by calling it a \`young science' --but cf. another comment that I have never seen quoted \\"Is scientific progress useful to philosophy? Certainly. The realities that are discovered lighten the philosophers task. Imagining possibilities.\\" (LWPP1, 807). So, he is not legislating the boundaries of science but pointing out the fact that our behavior (mostly speech) is the clearest picture possible of our psychology and that all discussions of higher order behavior are plagued (as they are to this day) by conceptual confusions. FMRI, PET, TCMS, iRNA, computational analogs, AI and all the rest are fascinating and powerful ways to extend our innate axiomatic psychology, but all they can do is provide the physical basis for our behavior, facilitate our analysis of language games, and extend our EP, which remains unchanged (unless genetic engineering is unleashed to change our EP--but then it won't be us anymore). The true-only axioms most thoroughly explored in \`'On Certainty'' are W's (and later Searle's) \\"bedrock\\" or \\"background\\", which we now call evolutionary psychology (EP), and which is traceable to the automated true-only reactions of bacteria, which evolved and operates by the mechanism of inclusive fitness (IF). See the recent works of Trivers and others for a popular intro to IF or Bourke's superb \\"Principles of Social Evolution\\" for a pro intro.Beginning with their innate true-only, nonempirical (automated and nonchangeable) responses to the world, animals extend their axiomatic understanding via deductions into further true only understandings (\\"theorems\\" as we might call them, but of course like many words, this is a complex language game even in the context of mathematics). Tyrannosaurs and mesons become as unchallengeable as the existence of our two hands or our breathing. This dramatically changes ones view of human nature. Theory of Mind (TOM) is not a theory at all but a group of true-only Understandings of Agency (UOA a term I devised 10 years ago) which newborn animals (including flies and worms if UOA is suitably defined) have and subsequently extend greatly (in higher eukaryotes). Likewise the Theory of Evolution ceased to be a theory for any normal, rational, intelligent person before the end of the 19th century and for Darwin at least half a century earlier. One CANNOT help but incorporate T. rex and all that is relevant to it into our innate background via the inexorable workings of EP. Once one gets the logical (psychological) necessity of this it is truly stupefying that even the brightest and the best seem not to grasp this most basic fact of human life (with a tip of the hat to Kant, Searle and a few others) which was laid out in great detail in \\"On Certainty\\". Incidentally, the equation of logic and our axiomatic psychology is essential to understanding W and human nature (as DMS, but afaik nobody else, points out).So, most of our shared public experience (culture) becomes a true-only extension of our axiomatic EP and cannot be found mistaken without threatening our sanity. A corollary, nicely explained by DMS and elucidated in his own unique manner by Searle, is that the skeptical view of the world and other minds (and a mountain of other nonsense including the Blank Slate) cannot really get a foothold, as \\"reality\\" is the result of involuntary fast thinking axioms and not testable true or false propositions.I think it is clear that the innate true-only axioms W is occupied with throughout his work, and almost exclusively in OC (his last work), are equivalent to the fast thinking or System 1 that is at the center of current research (e.g., see Kahneman--\\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\", but he has no idea W laid out the framework over 50 years ago), which is involuntary and unconscious and which corresponds to the mental states of perception and memory, as W notes over and over in endless examples. One might call these \\"intracerebral reflexes\\"(maybe 99% of all our cerebration if measured by energy use in the brain). Our slow or reflective, more or less \\"conscious\\" (beware another network of language games!) second self brain activity corresponds to what W characterized as \\"dispositions\\" or \\"inclinations\\", which refer to abilities or possible actions, are not mental states, and do not have any definite time of occurrence. But disposition words like \\"knowing\\", \\"understanding\\", \\"thinking\\", \\"believing\\", which W discussed extensively, have at least two basic uses (or, one might say, in philosophical contexts, one major use and one abuse) or language games. One is a peculiar philosophical use by exemplified by Moore (whose papers inspired W to write OC), which refers to the true-only sentences resulting from direct perceptions and memory, i.e., our innate axiomatic System 1 psychology (\`I know these are my hands'), and their normal use as dispositions, which are acted out and which can become true or false (\`I know my way home').The investigation of involuntary fast thinking has revolutionized psychology, economics (e.g., Kahneman's Nobel prize) and other disciplines under names like \\"cognitive illusions\\", \\"priming\\", \\"framing\\", \\"heuristics\\" and \\"biases\\". Of course these too are language games so there will be more and less useful ways to use these words, and studies and discussions will vary from \\"pure\\" System 1 to combinations of One and Two (the norm as W made clear), but presumably not ever of slow System 2 dispositional thinking only, since any thought or intentional action cannot occur without involving much of the intricate network of the \\"cognitive modules\\", \\"inference engines\\", \\"intracerebral reflexes\\", \\"automatisms\\", \\"cognitive axioms\\", \\"background\\" or \\"bedrock\\" (as W and later Searle call our EP).Another point made countless times by W was that our conscious mental life is epiphenomenal in the sense that it does not describe nor determine how we act. It is an obvious corollary of his descriptive psychology that it is the unconscious automatisms of System 1 that dominate and describe behavior and that the later evolved conscious dispositions (thinking, remembering, loving, desiring, regretting etc.) are mere icing on the cake. This is most strikingly borne out by the latest experimental psychology, some of which is nicely summarized by Kahneman in the book cited (see e.g., the chapter \`Two Selves', but of course there is a huge volume of recent work he does not cite). It is an easily defensible view that most of the burgeoning literature on cognitive illusions is wholly compatible with and straightforwardly deducible from W.Probably the leading exponent of W's ideas on the language games of inner and outer (the \`Two Selves' operation of our personality or intentionality or EP etc. ) is the prolific Daniel Hutto (DH), who teaches at the same University as DMS. His approach is called \`Radical Enactivism' and is well explained in numerous recent books and papers. It is a development of or version of the Embodied Mind ideas now current and, cleansed of its jargon, it is a straightforward extension of W's 2nd and 3rd period writings (though Hutto seems only dimly aware of this). He is also author of the best deconstruction I know of Dennett's preposterous claim to be following in W's footsteps (in fact Dennett is just repeating most of the classic mistakes in grandiose fashion and hasn't a clue about W). But of course one must read Searle too and the title of his famous review of Dennett's book says it well \\"Consciousness Explained Away\\". Incidentally, unlike most philosophers and other scholars, who make little or no effort to give the general public access to their papers, Hutto has put nearly every paper (though of course often just proofs and not the final paper) free online at www.academia.edu.Here, as throughout W's works, understanding is bedeviled by possible alternative and consequently often infelicitous translations from often unedited and handwritten German notes, with \\"Satz\\" being frequently incorrectly rendered as \\"proposition\\"(which is a testable or falsifiable statement) when referring to our nonfalsifiable psychological axioms, as opposed to the correct \\"sentence\\", which CAN be applied to our axiomatic true-only statements such as \\"these are my hands\\" or \\"Tyrannosaurs were large carnivorous dinosaurs that lived about 50 million years ago\\"(and since this is an unavoidable extension of our psychology, what does this imply about creationists?).Regarding my view of W as the major pioneer in EP, it seems nobody has noticed that he very clearly explained several times specifically and many times in passing, the psychology behind what later became known as the Wason Test--long a mainstay of EP research.The view that even the brightest philosophers do not really grasp the context in which they are operating is perhaps most strikingly illustrated when they attempt to define philosophy. In recent years I have seen such definitions by two of those I hold in highest regard--Graham Priest and John Searle, and of course they mention truth, language, reality etc., but not a word to suggest it is a description of our innate universal axiomatic psychology and its extensions. Priest, by the way, has noted that W was the first to predict the emergence of paraconsistent logic.Finally, let me suggest that with this perspective, W is not obscure, difficult or irrelevant but scintillating, profound and crystal clear, that he writes aphoristically because we think and behave that way, and that to miss him is to miss one of the greatest intellectual adventures possible."},{"Title":"Philosophical investigations = Philosophische untersuchungen","review":"Why aren't dual language editions this easy to find with other philosophical authors?

I agree with the previous writer that one probably needs to read more than one travel guide on a country as big and diverse as Australia, but I would definitely give this guide more than just 3 stars. I think it deserves at least a four, but to sort of counteract his paltry three stars, I'm going to give it a 5. :-)For one thing, although he's right about the photos being rather sparse, having worked in the publishing field for a few years once, this is obviously intentional to keep the costs down. It more than compensates for that by having detailed, well written, informative text. Also, I have a recommendation below on how to approach these guides in terms of how to use the shorter, more photographic guides, versus the longer, less visual ones like Frommer's.For example, if you want beautifully illustrated, glossy photos of Oz, you can pick up the Insight guide, the Dorling Kindersley, or the Nat'l Geographic guide, all gorgeous guides visually, but they are five to seven dollars more than this one, and contain 200-300 fewer pages of text. They are truly beautiful, stunning, and graphically very well-designed and laid out books, and after looking at them, I almost felt like I didn't need to spend $4000 on a real trip to Oz anymore since the photo essays in these books were so good. You can take an armchair excursion for $30 for the DK book and save yourself several thousand dollars. Plus you don't need to sit in those cramped coach seats for 14 hours, which doesn't especially appeal to me since I'm 6'4\\" and I'm not exactly built for that.My recommendation here is to spend a couple of hours with any of these guides just looking at the great photos on the glossy pages in the cafe of a Border's or B & N bookstore, make mental notes on what you're interested in from there, and then buy and use the bigger but less lavishly illustrated Lonely Planet, Fodor's, or Frommer's guides to get more information. If you use this two-pronged approach you'll get the most for your money, or you could even buy one of each if you're flush with cash. The DK, Insight, and Nat'l Geographic guides are great too, I just happen to prefer getting two to three hundred pages worth of information and fewer photos for 30% less.For one thing, most of us have seen all the amazing pictures of Oz to begin with. And I'd seen several nature specials on Australia, and I didn't need to be convinced of how cool a country it is to visit from a natural beauty and photographic standpoint, or I wouldn't be thinking of plunking down thousands of dollars of my hard-earned money to fly half way around the world for a vacation in the first place. :-)Whichever way you decide to go, happy travel guide browsing and buying!"},{"Title":"Frommer's Australia 2005","review":"I tend to prefer the layout of Frommer's guides, and this one was no exception: easy to read with easy to find, relevant info. Of course, no one guide to a country this size can cover it all in depth. Insight and Nat'l Geographic have the best pictures, and Let's Go is the best budget travel guide and might be worth buying even for non-hostelers. Daytrips to Eastern Australia is a good supplement for longer stays there.The first reviewer said Frommer's has only 30 pages on Melbourne (it has 46) and 30 pages on Sydney (it has 90). That's plenty for a country guide, and Frommer's gives a good variety of restaurants, hotels, and sights both in the cities and the countryside. Don't expect 90 pages to say it all about a city of 4 million. Check the Internet, AA club guides, city books, tour companies, and spend all the time in Oz. And buy this book.

This is not your 43rd American president's southern accent. Nothing clipped, cocky, or clumsy about it. Kaye Gibbons speaks earnestly in extended syllables and dulcet tones, her voice imbued with serenity, compassion, and intelligence. Think drawl, not twang. Similar to, but thicker and warmer than even the loveliest of my North Carolinian friends' accents, it transported me southward in place and backwards in time.The audio edition my library carried was abridged, and so immediately upon finishing that, I read the unabridged print version, more because I couldn't bear to leave Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate's company than any feeling that I'd missed something, though it was rewarding to delve even more deeply into their richly-drawn, highly idiosyncratic world. While I quite enjoyed Ellen Foster, as well as all of Gibbons' books (in fact, I prefer Diving Women to Ellen Foster), it didn't impress me nor draw me in nearly so thoroughly as Charms.Since the description Amazon provides of this book is not very detailed, and since I can't do a better job, I'll quote the one from the Harper Collins website:\\"A family without men, the Birches live gloriously offbeat lives in the lush, green backwoods of North Carolina. Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.Sophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II. Charms for the Easy Life is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer ... even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.\\"If I ever get around to making such a list, I'd say Charms for the Easy Life would be among my top 20 favorite books. It's such a shame that Amazon offers none of Kaye Gibbons' books in audio."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"\\"I have read two books a week for thirty years. I am satisfied that I know everything.\\"So says Charlie Kate Birch, and she's not shy about sharing her knowledge, whether you want to hear it or not. Charlie Kate is an early-1900s North Carolina midwife, herbalist, and self-styled doctor (with no official credentials). She's feisty, outspoken, and somewhat manipulative, but also very civic-minded and generous. You can't help liking her, even if she is a little too full of herself. Her daughter Sophia and granddaughter Margaret live in her orbit and are mostly grateful for the direction she gives their lives as a threesome.Kay Gibbons' writing is highly polished and carefully restrained--a quality I'm coming to appreciate more and more for its rarity. She also has a sly gift for humor that sneaks up on you. One of the characters will make a seemingly dry observation, but if you circle back and read it again, you catch the subtlety and burst out laughing. For example, when her mother Sophia asks God for help in a hurry, Margaret notes: \\"He no doubt knocked Himself out getting to her, as she was such a trophy among his creations.\\"This is a quaint, charming, and at times hilarious story. I really liked the portrayal of these three highly intelligent, book-loving Southern women. They learn from their mistakes and don't take any guff from men.***If you want your own easy-life charm, you'll need to find the hind foot of a white graveyard rabbit caught at midnight, under the full moon, by a cross-eyed Negro woman who has been married seven times.***"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This was first book of Ms. Gibbons I'd ever read.

Very well written and in an easy, conversational dialogue. I like her writing style and I enjoyed the book very much. HIGHLY recommend."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have read and enjoyed Kaye Gibbons' other works (\\"Ellen Foster\\", \\"A Cure for Dreams\\", and \\"Sights Unseen\\") and I think, with the possible exception of \\"Ellen Foster\\" that she has outdone even herself. The characters- grandmother Clarissa \\"Charlie Kate\\" Birch, a self-taught alternative healer, mother Sophia, the most romantic of the family, and main character and daughter Margaret, practical, intelligent, yet romantic- are unique, they stand out from the average woman of the 1930s-1940s of the South. Yet at the same time, they have the same basic desire, to be loved and respected, as anyone else.Gibbons' portrayal of Charlie Kate as eccentric yet admired by the community for her healing work showed that one does not necessarily need to follow the mainstream in order to be successful and happy. Reading \\"Charms for the Easy Life\\" in fact made me kind of wish I had the education and skills to be an alternative healer."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I enjoyed Kaye Gibbons' Charms for the Easy Life immensely. I thought it was a well-crafted, character-focused novel that explored the deep familial relationships of three Southern women.The book details the lives of Charlie Kate, a smart, stubborn, self-taught healer; her daughter, Sophia, a beautiful woman searching for companionship; and her granddaughter, Margaret, a shy girl growing up in the WWII era. The book follows each woman as she finds love, manages family relationships, and blazes an unconventional path towards her own happiness. Through it all, the women demonstrate an insatiable and admirable thirst for knowledge.The story is told from granddaughter Margaret's point of view. The writing is evocative and engaging. In addition, the character of the grandmother is one for the ages. Uncompromising, set in her ways, and sure of her talents, she is not a woman you will forget easily.The novel is largely about how family cares for one another, about how Charlie Kate, Sophia, and Margaret are each one another's \\"charms,\\" making life easier, happier, and more livable. You will thoroughly enjoy keeping their company for a while."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This is a very good story of women relationships, set in the old timey rural South.

What interested me as I skimmed the book was the location of the novel in the South. Ms. Gibbons writes like McCullers, Welty and O'Connor, not in their unrelenting manner of the Southern grotesque (although there are some gruesome tales of people suffering from all kinds of afflictions), but in their portrayal of vivid, memorable characters. The core of this novel is a three-generation family of intelligent, strong women, and the most remarkable character is the grandmother, a de facto doctor, without a license. She is the healer of the town, but more importantly, she heals her family and gives them the strength to perservere. She gives her daughter and her granddaughter the resolve to leave their cloistered home and venture into life self-assured. Ms. Gibbons' writing is simple, profound and compassionate. My only criticism of this work is that at times I felt that it was a bit simplistic and contrived, but I recommend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This may be the first school reading assignment that I have ever actually fully enjoyed, except for maybe a few exceptions. I really liked reading this book because it talked about a young girl's life growing up in a family of women, which is something I believe many teenaged girls can at least partially relate to. I really liked how not one bit of it was boring. The author kept it interesting by meshing the main character's grandmother's doctoral experiences with the entire family's daily life. I especially enjoyed how towards the end the author created a bit of a romance between the main character and a young man. Overall, this book is something I could read again in a few years without getting bored with it:)."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"...but I really liked it anyway.

I didn't share in her enthusiasm after I had finished it. I don't think that there was some hidden greatness to it that I somehow missed, I think that this is the type of book that you have to have a very specific taste to enjoy. While the relationships were interesting, I felt that they lacked certain emotions or realities, which alienated me as a reader. As a whole I found it to be an easy read, but flat.

I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills.

The characters were stereotypes, drawn with the broadest brushtrokes, with no remotely &quot;human&quot; qualities. What qualities they did have were repellent, a trio of do-gooders with no compassion for human failings other than their own.

You can make it very complex, if you must, or simply take the story as it is, and as it was meant to be. You will find yourself thinking back to these characters often, and wishing for that charming life that made living with each other easy. When you have that, you just may have what it takes for an &quot;easy&quot; life. This book can help in the meantime."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have seen negative reviews of this book, but I loved it. My teenage daughter's margin notes made it even more special.While the story may be unrealistic, it is fiction, and why do we read fiction? I read it for escape, and this book &quot;escapes you&quot; to a place where women are strong, where your grandma can tell you everything you need to know, where there are some bad, lost, and abandoning men, but not all men are bad, where life is full of hope and magic is possible.It is literate, with references to many authors we should all read. There is some social commentary, some sadness, some things everyone should know (papaya tablets for digestion, aloe for burns, etc.)Charms for the Easy Life (&quot;depending on your definition of easy&quot; should have been a subtitle) was wonderful. I will be reading more of Kaye Gibbons books in the future.A lovely novel."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbons has one of those rare gifts that not all writers possess: the ability to take the lives of fictional people who are seemingly nothing in a high profile society and make them sparkle with with more interest and more reality-based magic than any heavily financed publicity machine could ever do.You come to believe these three beautiful, strong women and the reasons for why they stand together--not because--but in spite of the unworthy men they've encountered. Grandma Charlie Kate, a smart, literature loving, though uneducated woman, is gifted in natural healings and believes that when a person dies and purges (foam at the mouth), it is all their hopes, dreams, and things left unsaid. She is odd by others' standards, outspoken, and that's what makes people respect her!Daughter Sophia is the more openly dreamy side of Charlie Kate, hopelessly romantic in spite of a disappointing marriage to a man in yellow shoes, and she loves high fashion. She faints easily at the sight of infections when she helps her mother on housecalls, and is mad for a man named Mr. Baines who takes his sweet time going to the altar.Sophia's daughter Margaret tells the entire story of the family's somewhat Hemingway-like suicidal history and recounts their lives mainly around WWII. Margaret is more like Charlie Kate, but she still has enough of her mother in her to fall in love with a wounded soldier who comes from a good home, having broken the circle of bad men on the first crack.Everyone makes such a big deal about the Vietnam soldiers suffering more than any others, and I know that they did their share, but if you read this book and the life breathed into it, you will see that no war and what it does are any good. Beautifully written, easy to accept as nonfiction, and full of bittersweet richness, this is easily a book that should reap rewards for its quiet grace, humility, and strength of character. I love this book dearly, and urge you to read it because of the human interest. You will never forget it long after you are finished."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Contrary to some of the reviews I have read for this book, I found it believable and enjoyable. Just because you come from a rural background does not mean you cannot develop an appreciation for fine literature or are unable to rise above your origins to make a better life for yourself -- college education notwithstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Charlie Kate was an inspiration and reminded me of similar older people who I grew up with here in the much-disparaged rural state of South Dakota. Most of the people living in the 1930s had no other resources besides themselves. They had to rely on their own ingenuity and that of their neighbors, to pull them through. I think that was very well-illustrated in Gibbons' narrative. The main reason I enjoy Gibbons' books is because in spite of all the trauma her characters go through, they rely on humor to deal with it. That is one of the most valuable lessons that can be learned whether you live in urban America or not."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I cannot get enough of Kaye Gibbons! I thought this book was a sweet story and although I read it some time ago, the relationship of the grandmother and granddaughter has remained a lasting memory. I recommend the book as an enjoyable read. If you are looking for something intellectual and deep this is not the book for you. It is a story, entertaining, and reminiscent."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I read the reviews of this book because I wanted to see what other Amazon-ians thought of one my all-time favorites. I now want to jump up and down on my monitor after the Kirkus review. Boo. Hiss. The review criticizes the book mostly for it's Southern storytelling influence and values, and as someone who read it while temporarily living in the deep South, I have to say that those elements made it all the more special. As a &quot;Transplanted Yankee&quot; I not only learned about the South from this book but it make me appreciate the sense of family that is so abundant there. This book moves through generations of women gifted with honorable traits and as a reader I related to a bit of each of them. That, to me, is the mark of an excellent story._Charms for the Easy Life_ is one of the best books you will ever read. I promise. When Oprah selected Gibbons books as her book club selections, I was ticked, but disappointed that this wasn't one of them. This book will lighten your day and paste a grin on your face that will last for days. I highly recommend it...especially for the wintery dark days coming up. This will light a candle in your soul that will warm you for years on end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbons' \\"Charms for the Easy Life\\" tracks three generations of tough-minded women from the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War Two. Charlie Kate is the larger-than-life character, an \\"Ubermensch.\\" Charlie delivers babies, heals with herbs, reads two books a week, and directs the lives of her daughter, Sophia, and Margaret (Charlie's granddaughter). Since the impressionable Margaret is the narrator, it stands to reason hero worship takes precedence over a more reliable picture of the family's history of the first half of the twentieth century. She recites events before her birth with a fondness that is reserved for those we do not truly know; some warts of the family tree are exposed, such as the history of several suicides that provide some morbid humor. One male family member whose sexual orientation is questioned by everyone except his mother, \\"shot himself after having spent two miserable years grieving over the death of Rudolph Valentino.\\" Women's clothes are found in one of his drawers. The son's mother says, \\"Oh, Charlie Kate. He had a girlfriend. Look at all her things here. I always knew what people said about him wasn't so.\\" Margaret recalls, \\"my grandmother stuffed the dreamland girlfriend's things into a paper sack and marveled that a man would cram his feet into shoes so high and narrow.\\"The meat of the novel centers on Charlie and her indomitable spirit (she surely would be labeled a feminist today). One conflict both Charlie and Sophia have endured, that Margaret is determined to avoid, is the deserting husband. As far as dating advice, Charlie would often say, \\"Kiss all you want. Kissing's fine, nothing more than uptown shopping on downtown business. But if you suffer him to put that ugly thing in you before you're married, do not come to me to ask how to undo what you have so stupidly done.\\" Somehow the three of them live under one roof in Raleigh, North Carolina, and quite well financially, since Charlie's mobile medical business (no license) is booming. Margaret recalls several stories of how grandmother saved this person from a lynching; sewed body parts together, treated malaria, and comforted the dying. After awhile one half-expects to read Charlie donning a cape and running around in tights with a big \\"S\\" on her chest (Charlie would have to wait at least until 1938 when Superman was created).Besides the over-the-top portrait of Charlie, the novel still seems to plow forward as Gibbons fleshes out characters with dialogue that is sharp and has no effects of sounding contrived in order to say something witty. \\"Charms for Easy Life\\" may not offer a rounded character description of Sophia, Margaret, or a realistic one of Charlie, but the novel still manages to enliven a picture of life down South from the turn of the century to World War Two. Life may have not been easy for these renaissance women, but Gibbons sure has afforded us the pleasure to partake in their charms.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Three generations of women are the focal point of this novel, and though their familial bonds are tight, there are unique characteristics of each that make the reader care for each. Charlie Kate, a headstrong &quot;medicine woman&quot;, says it like it is and won't take no for an answer. But she is not just forthright with her opinions, but also with her feelings for her family. Her daughter Sophia tends to &quot;need&quot; to be someone's companion, whether it be a man, her mother, or her own daughter. Margaret, my favorite character, was raised by the women and gets to experience things in her life that truly define her. I loved how close the three were, and that their traits complemented one another.A book that you hope goes on and on. I read it in two evenings."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"It's a little gem of a book ~~ one I've had in my bookcases for a long time. This past weekend with everyone in my family struggling with the stomach flu ~~ I picked it up to read it as I needed something light and easy to read. It is a lovely insight in a family of three women of three generations. It's mostly about Charlie, the midwife and all-around nurse. Her daughter, Sophia and granddaughter, Margaret were secondary characters but their stories are just as charming.Charlie grew up poor. She married the river ferryman. After their daughter, Sophia was born, they moved inland. Charlie kept her midwife practice going and soon, her husband abandoned her to work on the Ohio River. It was just Charlie and Sophia, till Sophia married a man who made a mockery of their wedding by wearing yellow shoes. While Sophia's daughter Margaret was still young, Sophia became a widow. Then Charlie moved in with them and this is the basis of their story. They lived through life with stories of people and ailments, love and friendship through the years.It really is a charming little book. If you love stories on mother/daughter relationships, this book is for you. If you like stories about people living in rural areas where community is very important, this one is for you. It's my first Gibbons book in a long time and reading it is just as sweet as stealing an afternoon to read it!4-16-07"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This is the fascinating story of three generations, with a midwife/herbalist grandmother, her single mother daughter, and her bookworm granddaughter. The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife. The book leaves you wishing for a grandmother like Charlie Kate and a suitor like Tom Hawkings III. Good easy read- would make an especially good winter read, curled up in an armchair in front of a fire, covered by a cozy throw, sipping a mug of homemade cocoa."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Not being a woman, or a midwife, or a semi-witch, or a southerner, I'm sure I missed something about this book.

Still, not a bad read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I can't read this book because the Kindle edition costs 3 times more than the printed paperback edition.

It's sad because I have loved every one of Kaye Gibbon's books."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"As I read this book I kept waiting for some catastrophic event to occur, but it never does. The author gives you great characters that live an unconventional life for that time period, yet nothing happens to them. They go about their lives doing good deeds and you the reader are just peering into there goody goody routines. The characters are very well developed and funny even at times a bit corny for me. The best part of this book was that it was short."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"A light wonderful read about 3 women full of sass"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I had to read this book to do a review on for a college class.

It just seemed like it wasn't finished."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have read several Kaye Gibbon's novels and found this to be a wonderfully passionate and emotional novel. Charlie Kate represents a forward thinking woman who was not afraid to care for sick and desolate people of that era. I found much substance in the novel. I am in the medical profession and felt that Kaye Gibbons did her homework regarding herbal remedies and medical treatments that seemed appropiate. Take time to read this novel it is worth it!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book is good, but only if you can tolerate the rambling narrative style it is written in. The characters are solidly developed, and the anecdotal episodes are well-done. It can be predictable at times, and I'm not sure if a male audience will like as much as a female audience, but both genders could find this book entertaining. Only the femaile audience may find it enlightening, however. As a college literature professor, I read this book in hope of perhaps using it in a course, but I decided against it. That doesn't mean it's bad; it just means it's a nice piece of light, easy reading which women will enjoy ... and men probably won't."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This story is more than a little farfetched -- quirky unlicensed but sought-after physician grandmother enlightened enough (in the U.S. South, in the 1940s and 1950s) to give abortions and do CPR on colored folk -- silly mom -- plain young girl who has no exposure to males in any form or at any age, who suddenly falls in love with a rich privileged handsome guy with curable war wounds. It instantly blended into a dozen or so such chick-lit feel-good southern stories I've read over the past decade or so, and like them left not a trace on my brain or imagination."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"This book is a kind and gentle read. There are no startling insights or life-altering observations, but it is worth reading because it does speak of values and ethical behavior. The grandmother is a strong woman whose opinions are revered and who doesn't tolerate fools. She is unfailingly consistent in her outlook and mission, which is to help other people - with or without their consent. Her daughter is lonely and well-meaning, and the granddaughter is growing into herself and her beliefs with help from her grandmother. This book has charm."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Kaye Gibbon's Charms for the Easy Life will be a shock for most of us, accustomed as we are to the doomed, dysfunctional women of Southern literature. The book deals with the lives of three generations of hyperfunctional Southerners: Charlie Kate, grandmother and miracle working midwife, her vamp daughter Sophia and her intellectual grand daughter Margaret. Gibbons used WPA interviews as background to the story, and the closer she adheres to the WPA stuff, the more interesting it is. All in all, it is an engaging read with lots of interesting detail on Southern superstitions and folk cures. After a while though, my B.S. counter started to tick. Here are people who came up from nothing, yet manage to have the literary taste of Boston Brahmins. They sail quite comfortably through the great depression with all the comforts -- including indoor plumbing. Despite being an uneducated midwife, Charlie Kate is firmly in control of all the doctors and hospitals in her area, she has a better success rate than the Mayo Clinic, and Margaret, the clever misfit, never seems to have a lonely moment."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"gibbons weaves a compelling, influencial novel about three generations of women and the lives they lived and their impact on one another. detailed first person through Margaret birch's eye, this story tells of margarget's coming of age during world war 2. the book tells of margaret's mother (who constantly strives to be young and stylish and concequently is quite irresponsible)and her grandmother (a self-proclaimed doctor who always seems to have the right answer as well as unconditoinal love for her grand daughter) with whom she lives. in a dramatic ending, margaret realized that she has to move on from her sheltered home-life and must learn to face the world on her own two feet."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I enjoyed this far more than A Virtuous Woman--it was hard to put down.

I loved the relationship between these three smart, strong women. They stick together, they watch out for each other, and they take care of everyone. This book has some really sad moments, but overall you feel good reading it.A couple of great quotes from the book:\\"My grief had been plain and unpoetic, and the hole in my heart would've grown wide enough and deep enough to consume me had my mother and grandmother not kept me with them, and still.\\"\\"In our house, the point of reading and learning was neither to impress outsiders nor to get a job or a husband, nothing like that. It had nothing to do with anybody but the three of us. When a good book was in the house, the place fairly vibrated.

The novel was set in the mid 1930's to 1940's in Raleigh, North Carolina. Margaret, the narrator of this novel, shares with the reader her story of the women she lived with: her gorgeous mother, Sophia, and her grandmother Charlie Kate-Birch, an unlicensed physician/healer. Although there were two unsuccessful marriages within the two generations before Margaret, in the end, all found love and happiness. Charlie Kate made a name for herself for being one of the kindest, hard-working physicians in North Carolina and was included in an edition of Busy North Carolina Women. Sophia became involved with an intelligent, handsome, charming lawyer, Mr. Baines, a graduate of Yale. The three generations of women were engaged in helping those who were ill. Hence the reason why Margaret became a doctor. The Birches were women who promoted strength, loyalty, love, and compassion, not only to their patients, but also to each other.Kaye Gibbons has done a grade A job. She provided the reader with great plot elements, showing each character's strength to carry on a good life. Charlie Kate's will to continue her legacy of reaching out to the community, regardless of her aging, was an inspirational aspect of the novel. As was the journey to finding Sophia's future love. Gibbons presented to us a lovely story, not just another unbelievable fiction.This story of how women made it through life during the time of World War II is not only inspirational, but also engaging."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I have wearied, in recent years, of reading novels by authors whose characters are interesting only by virtue of their being from the South, and whose plots depend on rural Southern details and the characters' Southern eccentricities. I feel this is a cheap ploy, so I wasn't particularly interested in picking up Gibbons' book, Charms for the Easy Life. But I'm glad I did! OK, the novel benefits from its &quot;Southerness&quot;, but I got the sense that such a skilled writer as Gibbons could make proper Bostonians glow in realism. This book is not only a delightful read, but it also touches on the not-so-easy relationships between mothers and daughters, and the equally difficult relationships between women and men. Gibbons also exhibits a detailed (but not obvious) research of the Depression Era, and, on top of it, she makes a sturdy comment about the value of non-traditional medicine. My only complaint is about the book's resolution, which came too quickly and tidily for me. Although I read it in one afternoon, the characters have stuck to my ribs and, the more I think about the book, the more its layers are revealed to me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I like to keep a second copy of this book handy in case I need to recommend it to someone. I don't ever want to be without it. The women in this story all live on in my mind/heart long after the last time I read it. I was not crazy about Ellen Foster when Oprah went on and on about it...I always thought she should have chosen this book.I guess if you're \\"forced\\" to read this for school I would recommend that you have a quick attitude adjustment first. Having been stuck reading some seriously dry assignments long ago in the stone ages, how I WISH a story like this would have been put in my life when I was younger! I can't understand a word of the negative reviews here.It's like chocolate.I understand how people might not like brussel sprouts even though I do. I don't understand how anyone can possibly NOT adore chocolate. That's what Charms for the Easy Life is for me."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"I loved this book.

It is great!"},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"The narrator is top high school student Margaret Birch, who lives with her mother Sophia and grandmother Charlie Kate in a small town in North Carolina in 1940. Charlie Kate is the well-read town medic with no formal training but a whole lot of experience who upstages the doctors from time to time. Margaret can't be persuaded to choose a college, because she loves assisting her grandmother on house calls too much to leave home. Charlie Kate is Margaret's main adviser and confidante. Sophia is a good mother, but she lacks Charlie Kate's wisdom when it comes to unconventional Margaret, who shows no interest in boys, clothes, or cosmetics. Both Sophia and Charlie Kate made bad choices in husbands, both of whom strayed and are now out of the picture. Margaret constantly laments that she wasn't sired by the doctor who Charlie Kate chose as a suitable mate for Sophia but whom both parties rejected. My favorite section of the book is where Margaret is volunteering at a hospital and takes on the task of reading and writing letters for wounded soldiers. Appalled at what they dictate, as well as a screwy Dear John letter that one receives, she and her grandmother fabricate their own letters to send home for these men, with mixed results. These three strong, smart women make this book an uplifting delight from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Charms for the Easy Life","review":"Gibbons' book is amount three strong women who possess the determination to succeed and do so with their hearts intact. You'll fall in love with these characters as the author cleverly displays their motives, desires, thoughts, and feelings.

She has nothing but pride for the bold field doctor insticts and motives that she seeks. Each character is rich in complexity and truly a story of their own.Together their lives grow and evolve. The town and lives grow around them and they manage to keep up.

I loved the way she portrayed her characters; compassionate, practical (about some things), with definite peculiarities, and with the importance of family at the very core. The book is narrated by Margaret, who has a strong and very interesting Grandmother who had strong, but not very practical daughter, who had a very practical and intelligent daughter. They all help out the Grandmother who is a midwife/herbalist/medicinal-do-it-all give medical services to the poor and bereft.

I have been using the 1981 edition for almost two decades and have found this study tool indispensable.I also own a number of PC-based on-line Bibles/concordances for the NAS. Most of these are somewhat limited by the complex interfaces and slow response times when compared to accessing the text of the concordance sitting on my desk.The big advantage of the hardcover book is the visual cue one can take from seeing in a glance all the verse fragments that use the word in which you are interested. The numbering scheme is very friendly, especially given that the full dictionary text and word history are combined.

I still refer to it regularly and think of its content often in my daily life, and I use the information in Bible teachings regularly as well. The charts help to make deep truths clear and memorable.

It was much easier to apply the biblical truth in a fruitful way."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"If you've never understood God's acceptance and grace fully, this is a book you would definitely benefit from! McCallum obviously put a lot of thought into how he could make these deep truths easier to understand and apply. Personally, I love the tables sprinkled throughout this book. They do so much to make things clearer, and are a great resource for group bible studies!!Some of the many tables found in this book:&lt;> Comparing Biblical and Modern Love&lt;> How the Means of Growth (Prayer, Word, Fellowship, Ministry) work together and affect one another.&lt;> Our Old Self (in Adam) vs. Our New Self (in Christ)&lt;> Living under the Law vs. Living in Grace"},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"What a great resource to have to work through personal issues and also bringing along a friend in their life-long walk with God. Eye-opening for the new believer; a trusted reference book for the maturing Christian who wants to see more of Christ in their lives and their output to others. This is a unique book that has no real equal on the subject of \\"how to\\" walk more-and-more in godly obedience (which is our victory)."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"This book recognizes that our actions flow from our beliefs.

I often wonder how things would be if we hadn't read it."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"I really like this author's body of work. I've read all his non-fiction. He's very objective and can sound a little bit like notes from a lecture. But it is also emotionally productive, without the bells and whistles, unlike many Christian authors, and has genuine feeling and vulerability to appeal to anyone's subjective sensibilities. This book is my favorite from this author. He wrote that walking with God is about tranformation by the Spirit, not a change of behavior. The author makes points about principles and leaves the reader in charge of how to purpose God based on teachings from the Bible. This message is biblical and encouraging to anyone who has accepted Christ but doesn't know what to do next. This book is not a self-help book. It's not a method plan. Many Christians love the book of Romans and should really take a look at this book as extracurricular. This book is not a substitute for reading the Bible but a companion, conversation piece, the result of the word of God in the author's live - which the author states could happen to anyone who wants a personal relationship with God through Christ."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"McCallum's book helped clarify for me what it looks like to walk in God's grace.

It really makes you want to dig deep into the Bible. I highly recommend this book for a small group Bible study."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"This book is a fantastic look at Romans 5-8, focusing on Christian life issues such as understanding the difference between law and grace, the dangers of legalism, formality and license in the believer's walk, and what it means and looks like to walk in the Spirit.

He's the One who did it all. Based on the content you can tell the author was greatly influenced by Watchman Nee's book \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" (also a VERY good book).

This book lays out some amazing truths from God's Word in a clear and easy to understand way. Mr. McCallum does an excellent job explaining how we can have victory day to day because as you will see in the book, Christ has already accomplished what we were never able to do.

This is also a great book to go through in a small group and study guides are available at [..]."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"Books like Walking in Victory are invaluable because they directly use and teach the Bible. This book is a guide to the crucial concepts in Romans 5-8, concepts that every Christian needs. The interpretation is accurate and the application contemporary. McCallum writes in an easy to follow, to-the-point style that is, as other reviewers have mentioned, very useful when trying to help a new Christian. On the other hand, because these concepts are straight from the Bible, long-time followers of Christ will be consistently challenged."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"McCallum has written an excellent book in \\"Walking..\\" The book of Romans, especially those middle chapters are so huge to understanding God's love in a deep-down way.

Victory lies in a believer's full acceptance before God based on Christ's atoning work on the cross. It's by understanding and focusing on this truth that Christians are able to develop lives of zeal, ministry effectiveness, and slow growth toward true holiness. Aside from the Gospel message itself, this concept, my identity in Christ, has been the most important lesson I've ever learned, and I haven't found a more sound explanation of it than in Walking in Victory. Now, I rely heavily on this book in mentoring students, and I'm able to see in them the fruit that is born from an informed and enthusiastic grace-focus.The content matter, perfect for the scholar or new convert, is masterfully presented and extremely useful. McCallum skillfully mixes careful Biblical exposition and interpretation with down-to-earth application and insightful observations of human nature to create a work that is both provocative and practical.I highly recommend this book to all believers who want to begin their walks with God on the right foot, who wish to deepen their appreciation of their identity in Christ, and who seek to help ground others in the firm foundation of grace."},{"Title":"Walking in Victory: Experiencing True Sanctification and Holiness through God's Grace","review":"This book will change your life if you let it...it's a new way of approaching life...a new way of approaching God."},{"Title":"Hiking Alaska (State Hiking Series)","review":"I spent 3 mos. in Alaska and I had this book as well as Jim DuFresne's Backpacking Alaska (Lonely Planet).

What I especially love about this book is that they provide a numb er of different designs - three different types of wooden towers as well as different types of masonry/cement block towers - so you have options. There are pictures - photographs and drawings throughout to help with the building and the materials/instructions are very clear. I haven't convinced my husband to build one (yet)and we already have swifts in our chimney but I am working with a local park and some eagles scouts to put one up. Another thing I really like about this book is that it goes beyond just putting up a swift tower. It also gives guidance on monitoring the tower (to include electronic monitoring like putting a camera inside) and report forms. It also has great pictures so that at a park, for example, you can create an educational evironment as well. Another neat thing is to also host a \\"swift night out\\" in the fall, where people gather to watch the swifts (babies all fledged and practicing their flight maneuvers)as they fly around the tower, dive in and more. Its so amazing to see them flying at incredible speeds and then dive into the chimney or tower. What a sight. I've also ready that when the young are learning to fly, if one is having trouble, the adults will flying in circles below them, creating an updraft to help lift them higher. They are such amazing birds, deserving of our attention and preservation. This book really helps us not only provide a nesting site but also opportunities for our own education.....as the saying goes....we conserve what we love, we love what we understand, we understand what we are taught."},{"Title":"Chimney Swift Towers: New Habitat for America's Mysterious Birds (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"I found this book to be very informative and easy to follow if you decide to build a Chimney Swift tower. I built my tower in March 2007 so that I can attract the Swifts to control flying insects like mosquitos and I am still waiting for my first Swift to take residence. My neighbors were very curious about what I was building and I enjoyed educating them about the value of Chimney Swifts. I am sure the Swifts will find the tower eventually."},{"Title":"Chimney Swift Towers: New Habitat for America's Mysterious Birds (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"good book about Chimney swifts, their habitat loss and constructing \\"Chimneys\\" for them to raise young in. The book describes the construction of these small towers using modern methods and materials. I think this book will be the definitive Chimney Swift work of our time. Buy it and build a tower. You and these gregarious little flying insect eaters will be better for it. Watching Chimney swifts reminds me greatly of watching a Quiditch match as described in the Harry Potter books."},{"Title":"Chimney Swift Towers: New Habitat for America's Mysterious Birds (Louise Lindsey Merrick Natural Environment Series)","review":"This is an excellent guide to creating a home for the Chimney Swifts. Before we cut down the forests and every dead tree we could find, the swifts used the hollow trees to nest in. Then, swifts learned to use chimneys on the homes of the people who came in and cut down their homes. Now, everyone is putting caps on their chimneys so the swifts can no longer get in to nest.

It is what every book about the middle ages should be and more, with suspense, action, disguises, escapes, and of course, the occasional love scene. Robert Louis Stevenson lived in the mid-1800s, and is renowned for his many works, includingTreasure Island, Dr.Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, andKidnapped. The Black Arrow, written originally for a magazine, was written after a serious illness in Stevenson, and was published right after Treasure Island.Dick Shelton, a boy of sixteen, is quickly thrust into the conflict of the War of the Roses. He battles against almost any kind of evil - bloodthirsty pirates, a murderous priest, and even his own legal gaurdian - Sir Daniel Brackley. Through the whole book Dick strives to become a knight, and to rescue his true love. The Black Arrow is a sure winner for 6th graders and up."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The Black Arrow is, without a doubt, one of my all time favorite books, just as Robert Louis Stevenson is one of my all time favorite authors. I find it hard to believe that The Black Arrow is probably the least well know of his great adventure novels (the others being, of course, Treasure Island and Kidnapped), as it is certainly the best as far as I am concerned. As far as the story goes, it is one of the most entertaining plots that I have ever encountered. It is filled with more twists and turns than I would have thought possible, but remains very clear and fast paced. The characters are wonderful, as is the description and the writing itself. Granted, some of the language is a bit archaic, but I feel that this adds a lot to the authenticity of the story.The Black Arrow is not a very easy read at first, but once you get into it it really flies by. It is as entertaining, exciting, and intriguing book as you will find, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"This gorgeous edition of \\"THE BLACK ARROW\\" is a reissue of the book first published by Charles Scribner's Sons ,with N.C.

Within this story we encounter knights, and a band of outlaws (ala Robin Hood). We have disguises, archery, battles, betrayal, revenge, friendship, honor, and love. What more could you ask for in an adventure?Though it was a fun story, it didn't have the depth of plot or character that I look for in my reading. Instead we follow Richard on what seems an aimless journey of one adventure after another. Richard often finds himself in tight situations and just when he escapes he finds himself in another. Written like a serial (probably was), Richard seems to hardly have time to take a breath before something new and exciting is happening again. Although this type of writing is great for a serial, leaving the reader with a cliff hanger at the end of each section, it doesn't lead to a unified feeling within the work. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the story and have fun reading it along the way; it is just that to me it seemed just a fun adventure story. It was fun to read, but didn't leave me with a lasting impression or emotion."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"Set against the backdrop of the Wars of the Roses, The Black Arrow is an intriguing look at the life of young Richard Shelton. Richard's life is shaken when he realizes that those he had thought to be his friends are really his enemies, and he is forced to make choices that will determine the course of his life. Although the characters are well-developed and the plot is fascinating, this book is not for the squeemish or lazy reader. The description is not only vivid, it is often gorey. The language is sometimes difficult and a dictionary might prove quite handy. But anyone looking for a well-written, action-packed classic should read this book."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"...that buckles every swash imaginable.

We read this book as a read aloud for our family reading time and our kids loved the story which has plenty of adventure and intrigue and also a good deal of humor. The story fits well for boys and girls, as one of the main characters and a significant secondary character are young women. Mom and Dad loved the story as well, but the kids definitely couldn't wait for the next reading time. The language is a bit dated, which at first challenges the readers (mom and dad) but it adds authenticity to the tale."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"I picked up The Black Arrow on speculation, driven by three considerations - it was written by Robert Louis Stevenson, I had vague but good memories of the old TV series the Black Arrow and well it was going cheap at a jumble sale.The Black Arrow relates the adventures of Richard Shelton, a orphan and ward of Sir Daniel a landed knight and veteran warrior of questionable loyalty who has been successfully negotiating the War of the Roses siding with either York or Lancaster based upon who is on top and who is currently providing the best opportunity for material advancement. The only cloud on Sir Daniel's horizon is the mysterious order of the \\"Black Arrow\\", a band of outlaws who have previously been injured by Sir Daniel and who have now sworn themselves to his death and the death of his supporters. Although initially Sir Daniel's loyal ally, Dick eventually becomes aware that Sir Daniel may in fact be responsible for his fathers death. Forced to flee from Sir Daniel's house (and his true love in the form of Joanna another ward of Sir Daniel's), Richard joins the order of the black arrow and swear vengeance for his fathers death. What follows is a series of adventures with espionage, fencing, shipwrecks and many deaths, culminating in Dick joining forces with the Yorkist forces lead by Richard of Gloucester at the battle of Shoresby, where they confront the forces of Lancaster including Sir Daniel.So why do I say that this is not quite what I expected? Well I was expecting in Dick, a hero from your standard boys own adventure, you know the type brave to a fault, a strong fighter, smart and wise beyond his years and completely moral. Instead Stevenson defied my expectation by presenting Dick as brave and strong and honorable, but not terribly smart, capable of making very bad decisions which have a terrible affect upon the lives of those around him, someone whose lack of experience means that he is regularly trumped by his opponents. And although in the end, Richard is knight and married to his love, he is judged by Richard of Gloucester as a man who I will go no further a man who has reached his natural level of advancement a judgment which I found myself agreeing with."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"In this book you can read about knights, soldiers, action, treachery, and other things from the middle ages. I thought that it was a pretty good book, but I only got into it after a while. I had to read it for school, so I couldn't give up, but I was wary of the lack of \\"interesting-ness\\" when I first started. I would reccomend this book to you, but you should beware that you may not be interested for a while. If you are a person who doesn't like a book that takes a while, I would not reccomend this to you. But if you don't mind having to read something a while, I would reccomend this to you. (Sorry if I keep repeating myself.)"},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"With the War of the Roses as its backdrop, The Black Arrow blends the romance of young love and the excitement of its hero's initiation into war and politics. The theme of loyalty runs throughout--loyalty to parents, guardians, leaders, followers, lovers, and oneself.England's loyalties are divided between Lancaster and York, although the distinction makes little difference to the country's more practical citizens. \\"It is the ruin of this kind land,\\" a woman said. \\"If the barons live at war, ploughfolk must eat roots.\\" When the naive young hero, Richard Shelton, reassures her that men \\"cannot better die than for their natural lord,\\" another man points out, \\"No natural lord of mine . . . I followed the Walsinghams . . . And now I must side with Brackley! It was the law that did it; call ye that natural?\\"Despite young Dick's idealism, which makes him faithful to his guardian and to the men with whom he has served, and despite many disturbing rumors, it soon becomes apparent that most men are loyal primarily to their self-interests, whether they seek power like Richard Crookback or favor and riches like Dick's guardian, Sir Daniel Brackley. Even the mysterious \\"Jon Amend-All\\" of the black arrow, whose objective is to revenge himself and his friends on Brackley, is found collecting rents from Brackley's cottagers, acknowledging that they will suffer the hardship of having to pay twice. The man behind \\"Jon Amend-All\\" is no beneficent Robin Hood, but as cold and crafty a political operative as Brackley himself.Brackley's loyalties are soon explained. \\"I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war, and then ride to join me with the conqueror . . . Tosspot and Shuttle-wit run in, but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o' one side, waiting.\\" As Clipsby says, \\"For, indeed, he is one that goes to bed Lancaster and gets up York.\\"Fleeing from one danger into another, Dick finally understands that he cannot trust Brackley simply because he is Dick's guardian, or even Ellis Duckworth as his savior and protector. The only person upon whom he can rely is the girl he loves, who, ironically, was intended to be his wife in one of Brackley's financial maneuvers. The black arrow flies from Tunstall Forest to Kettley, then through wetlands back through Tunstall to the Moat House and on to Shoreby, with treachery and the threat of war hanging over all.With every adventure, Dick's loyalty turns more inward on himself and his heart's desire. He is loyal to York because Ellis Duckworth is and Daniel Brackley isn't. When he finds himself rapidly in and out of Richard Crookback's favor, he is \\"neither glad nor sorry.\\" Danger and treachery transform Dick into a more mature man who recognizes that loyalty is neither won nor lost so easily or quickly. In one of the novel's strangest and weakest scenes, he proves his loyalty to his bride-to-be by rejecting the advances of her best friend, peculiar as they are.The series of events that makes Dick a man is his theft of the Good Hope, its subsequent destruction, and the death of the captain's man, Tom. \\"Dick's heart smote him at what he heard. Until that moment he had not perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the loss of the Good Hope; so careless, in those days, were men who wore arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors . . .\\" Dick achieves his aims, but at the cost of many lives and the prosperity of the innocent Arblaster, who mourns \\"my man Tom\\" until the end of his days.As a protagonist, Dick is refreshingly and painfully human, at least outside battle. While brave, he lacks the ability to pick up on clues that are obvious to his less-sheltered acquaintances, including those about the true nature of Jack Matcham. He suffers remorse for what he has done and begins to ask others like Ellis Duckworth to reconsider their course. He has the mercy that Richard Crookback and Brackley lack.Whatever its historical flaws (some of which Stevenson points out in footnotes), The Black Arrow is beautifully written, with well-drawn characters, a plot that rarely stalls, realistically bloody battle scenes, and dialogue that is often poetic without being jarring. While not Stevenson's greatest effort, The Black Arrow is exciting and fun for anyone of any age who loves a solid historical drama."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The book black arrow reminded me of the stories about Robin Hood. I think that Robert Louis Stevenson just took the story of Robin Hood and added more things to it. Robert Louis Stevenson had a good idea about it. the story had more depht to it than Robin Hood. the way he describe the one chariter makes him look like Robin Hood, because of the way he is dressed. I thought that the book was prety good. The book could have been better."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The main thing that made me rate this 1 star is that there are no /good/ characters, for whom I could really cheer.There are a few characters who are completely bad and are shown as such, but there are other characters who are the \\"good guys\\" yet their whole focus is revenge, so that they murder some people and steal from others. Richard deceives people so that he can steal their ship and seems to be confused on such matters as loyalty and truth. He does choose not to kill his arch enemy (despite that person's many wicked deeds), but at other times he kills people merely because they seem to be a danger to him. Once it is called into question whether this is right or not, but the characters are distracted and turn to other matters. Richard does repent of some of the things he has done, when he realizes that it can not be remedied (that was my favorite part of the book).Therefore, while this tale is interesting and makes a few good points, the careless killing, poorly written romance and poor ideals made me strongly dislike it.However, it is very interesting, particularly because of the older English used, so if you don't mind betrayal, violence, and lack of morals, it could be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The book, The Black Arrow, by Robert Louis Stevenson, did not grab my attention.

So, I would not recommend this book to most people , because, to me, it was hard to follow and because of that, boring. this book is about a young man named Richard Shelton. He was born loyal to the House of Lancaster but found himself torn between his loyalty to his master and joining a band of outlaws called the Black Arrow, led by a dashing young man named Ellis Duckworth. Shelton goes through many adventures with many partners and friends. The problem is he doesn't know who he can trust. He has been betrayed and swindled, but he doesn't stop putting his faith in people who he thinks he can trust. One person he knows he can trust is Joanna Sedley. She was a lost love in his life which he later encountered. Throughout the book he is chasing, tracking and looking for her. There is certain types of people that would enjoy this book. If they can keep their attention and comprehend very well I think they might like this book very much. Because if you can follow the plot I'm sure it will be very exciting. So, if you fall into that category I would recommend this book to you. But if you are like me and you need a book that is full of adventure from the get go, and have some trouble following books, I would not recommend the Black Arrow."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The black arrow is a typical adventure book, where romance and action are mixed.

The tale is solid, but unfortunately there are a few issues prevent it from delivering on its promise.The Black Arrow, first published as a serial in 1883 and as a novel in 1888, follows the adventures of Dick Shelton as he discovers that his guardian may be responsible for the death of his father and seeks justice, attempts to rescue his betrothed from the clutches of said guardian, and gets swept up in the tumult of the War of the Roses.Shelton comes across throughout the book as mostly naive and occasionally cruel and self-centered, and he seems to blunder from one encounter to the next. In short, it's hard to really root for him or care about him, as he has few redeeming qualities, but he's also just not that interesting, either. I've read other books where the main characters aren't exactly heroes (such as George R.R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series), but in those cases, the main characters were at least plotting and scheming and being actively devious, which is entertaining. Shelton shows a bit of character growth at the end of the novel, showing regret about some of the dubious actions he took while trying to rescue his betrothed, but it isn't enough to redeem him as an interesting character.Another downside to the book is the disjointed nature of it. It feels very episodic, as if Stevenson approached each chapter thinking, \\"Okay, what trouble can Dick Shelton get into next?\\" This precludes any sort of build-up of tension, and also results in a limit to how much each episode is affected by those that came earlier. When I started reading the book, I was not aware that it had first been serialized, but by the time I finished it, I guessed it had, as it read like a collection of episodes, and I'm aware it was common practice at the time (Stevenson's Treasure Island was first published serially in the same magazine as The Black Arrow, and even Charles Dickens released his work that way).The old fashioned language was a difficulty in getting into the book. I was reminded of watching a Shakespearean play, where it takes you a scene or two to really get into the old language and follow along relatively clearly. I had no trouble with the similarly jargon-laden and old fashioned Treasure Island. Maybe I just speak pirate better than I do knight.The best parts of the book are the action scenes. These are strong, and helps redeem some of the other shortcomings of the novel. There are chases through forests, spying and sneaking, one on one combats, and large battles.I think I'm probably being harder on this book than it might deserve because I'm holding up against Stevenson's other work. It's okay, it just lacks the life and energy of Treasure Island or the creepy tension of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and isn't the same sort of genre-defining work as those two stories.I listened to the audio version read by Shelly Frasier. Frasier doesn't stand out with this book, though she isn't inherently bad, either, and I wouldn't avoid her in other productions. I didn't especially care for her reading this book, though, primarily because 95% of the characters are male, and having to decipher her narrow range of fake male voices to track who was speaking on top of following along with the difficult language wasn't an ideal combination.The Black Arrow is a solid book that has the misfortune to have been written by an author with other fantastic books that outshine it. If you like medieval stories, you'll probably enjoy The Black Arrow, but I can't recommend it to the general reader like I can Treasure Island or Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.If you're interested, check out my reviews Stevenson's Treasure Island and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde here on Amazon for more of my thoughts on those works."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"A little bit hard to get into but worth the read!!!A great page-turner, the begining's a little unclear untill you've read it, so I would suggest re-reading the first chapter or two after you finnish it!!!"},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"I'm usually rather picky with what I read, so I was almost struck when I found myself getting into this book.

Intended to be a bildungsroman a la Kidnapped, it is set in Medieval England during the Wars of the Roses. The character development is not as good as several of Stevenson's other novels and the plot seems more schematic. In terms of creating a historically vivid setting. Stevenson did better with 18th century Scotland than with this period of English history."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"Book review-Black arrowThe Black arrow starts off very, very slow. It picks up at the end, thankfully. The book is a long one, at first it's very hard to follow. The plot also gets better as you get deeper into the book. It's a good book if you want to read something over a long period of time. The story takes place in at the time of the War of the Roses and follows the book's hero Dick. This book is clearly an action book. The main character, Dick is likeable enough. In this book, Dick encounters the Black arrow, a battle, a castle and more. This isn't one of Robert Louis Stevenson's best books, but yet is respectable. The original book was written in French and translated so it's got some weird words. Maybe some people would rank it higher, I'm a young guy so I may think it's hard to follow. For me, it's just too long and difficult to follow to be a really good book. Stevenson though has got some good books out there,though, including: Treasure Island, Kidnapped and more."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The Black Arrow seems to me to be one of the most underrated books I have ever seen. It is one of the very few works Of Stevenson and probably one of the best. It is an excellent mix of romance, drama and action, and is guaranteed to hold your interest. It is Stevensons only work in the field of Romance/Drama and is a work to rival such classics as The Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask. The language has a slight archaic ring to it which is, after reading the foreword by Stevenson, realized to be quite deliberate. A must read."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"While &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Kidnapped&quot; are more famous and beloved by the adventurous boys and girls of america, I think this book is underrated. &quot;The Black Arrow&quot; combines the best of the adventure of &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and the swasbuckling intrigues of &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. However, it adds the elements of a young and romantic pair of lovers. I would reccomend this book both for the adolescent who has progressed beyond Stevenson's more famous books as well as those of us who are still romantics at heart and miss the days of King Arthur or the Code of Chivalry.

I can count two. The first is the dialogue, which is a little too self-consciously archaic, and the second is the fact that the second half of the book isn't quite as good as the first.Other than that? This book has it all. Fencing! Fighting! True love! Revenge! Beautiful ladies!The book starts off pretty quickly. After a few introductory scenes, we get into the first and best part of the book, which sees the hero and um, a friend, running for their lives through the forest. Stevenson's genius is evident here as he mixes action, suspense, character development, and mystery seamlessly together.After this, the action slows down slightly, but the plot twists, surprises, battles, and excitement keep coming. The hero is human and relatable, the heroine fills her Spirited Heroine quota with as much gusto as the Damsel In Distress requirements. The Drunken Ex-Monk Sidekick is lovable and shrewd; the Greenwood Outlaw is magnificently protrayed; and there are special cameos by Richard of Gloucester and the heroine's talkative best friend.This book has everything. Swordfights? Forced marches? Lurking in the undergrowth? A damsel in distress? A girl disguised as a boy? A storm at sea? An interrupted wedding? Outlaws? Spies? Treacherous uncles?

The protagonist was flawed in a way that made him believable and likable. Best of all, his flaws serve the reader as subtle cautionary tales against haste and violence while still providing a very entertaining read.Written for adolescents, I expect that the novel's period-style language would be somewhat difficult for younger readers today although I do think that the lessons are valuable enough that young people should be encouraged to at least attempt what is otherwise a not very challenging read. The ending, the change in the protagonist's goals and his realizations about his own actions were very satisfying.Additionally, I found the free Kindle edition to be adequate and free from distracting format errors or other issues."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"This copy of Stevenson's excellent historical fiction piece is particularly attractive from the photo on the front cover, but the size is unusually wide and thin.

Worst of all, the print is unusually small. I'm by no means far-sighted and the print is still too small. Enough to make eyes sore small.Recommend the story and dissapointed at this copy.

I did enjoy Black Arrow, but I found it to be the least enjoyable of these four medieval-themed novels. All three others exceeded Black Arrow in these respects:- Level and accuracy of historical detail. The other works really immerse you in the period and allow you to experience the history. In contrast, Black Arrow merely uses the history as the backdrop, and even plays loose with facts.- Compelling characters and captivating story. I just didn't find Black Arrow's characters or story quite as riveting as the others.Overall: I enjoyed this work and I'm glad I read it. If you're looking for a historical novel from the medieval period, there are better ones out there. If instead you're simply looking for a good adventure, you'll definitely enjoy this. By the way, having read Treasure Island, I definitely think Black Arrow is not the author's best work."},{"Title":"The black arrow: A tale of the two roses (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"The book I chose to read for my book report was the Black Arrow.

The following paragraph will give you a short summary of the book I read.The story is about a knight named Dick who goes on an epic quest to find and destroy the group, the Black Arrows.

Abandoning the &quot;present&quot; story line where Buffy's 19-year-old body had been possessed by Zotzilaha, the estranged bride of Camazotz, the ancient Mayan demon-god, Golden focuses entirely on the alternative Buffy future, where the now 24-year-old Slayer has finally escaped captivity and has been reunited with the old Scoobey Gang. Whereas the first two parts of the Lost Slayer ended with the reader dying to find out what happens next, &quot;King of the Dead&quot; ends with us wanting to know more about what happened to everyone while Buffy was lost. But all we really get are vauge references to the horrors that happened in Sunnydale while Buffy was imprisoned, namely the deaths of Joyce, Faith and Anya (and presumably Angel), and like Buffy we want to hear more of the details.Golden takes full advantage of the fact that these books are set way back during the early part of Season 4 of Buffy, so that his characterizations of Willow as the defacto leader of the Watchers Council forces, Xander as the grim death machine, and Oz as the unleashed werewolf, ring true. One of the most impressive developments on Buffy has been the emergence of Willow as a wicca of considerably and growing power. Perhaps even more than the relationship between Giles and the Slayer, it is the relationship between Buffy and Willow that is at the heart of the Buffy mythos. The most poignant scenes in &quot;King of the Dead&quot; have to do with the two friends trying to find themselves again, and the realization that Willow has remained true to Buffy, even at the expense of her relationship with Oz. It is character relationship rather than action that ultimately dominates Part Three of this tale and provide the novel's best moments.My previous bafflement as to why Buffy was incarerated in a cell that actually had a door, through which escape was finally possible after five years, is explained away by Golden's revelation that her former Watcher has further, darker plans for Buffy in his new vampire kingdom. Although as a tendency I have little fondness for writers providing their villains with an Achilles heel that will allow the hero to triumph at the last moment, there is a certain deliciously twisted logic at work here. You can certainly argue that if Giles the Vampire King is as smart and as patient as everybody keeps saying he is, then he would not play with fire in this manner, and I would absolutely agree with you. But Golden makes the whole idea work for the most part as he builds up to the final chapters of the tale. &quot;The Lost Slayer&quot; is far and away Golden's best solo work on Buffy and his efforts do not suffer in comparison to &quot;The Gatekeeper&quot; Trilogy."},{"Title":"The New American Bible For Catholics","review":"This bible is a carbon copy of my NAB Student Bible.

His premises are largely unsupported (or supported only weakly) and his statements often paradoxical or vastly generalized. His vocabulary is of such an unnecessarily high level that it strikes me as a smokescreen for faulty logic. Furthermore, I side with John Irving in his defense of Kurt Vonnegut: the assumption that what is easy to read must have been easy to write is acceptable only in those who do not write. Note the following excerpt from a passage on page 42 of the text:the letter of the image corresponds in short to the first degree of intelligibility (below which the reader would perceive only lines, forms, and colours), but this intelligibility remains virtual by reason of its very poverty, for everyone from a real society always disposes of a knowledge superior to the merely anthropological and perceives more than just the letter.&quot;Everyone&quot; and &quot;always&quot; are two dangerous words, as most logicians can tell you. One exception disproves the premise, and a diproved premise weakens the argument. The word &quot;real&quot; reveals a bias--what does Barthes mean by a &quot;real&quot; society? It seems, at any rate, a thinly disguised ethnocentric snobbery. &quot;A knowledge superior to the merely anthropological&quot;--why is anthropological knowledge &quot;merely&quot; anthropogical? What, then, is superior to it? and why? I'm not being defensive--I honestly don't know. &quot;Since it is both evictive and sufficient, it will be understood that . . .&quot; &quot;Sufficient&quot;? Sufficient for what? &quot;Evictive&quot;? Does he mean &quot;evocative&quot;? Frankly, I'm not sure anything WILL be understood.Buy this book for a sleeping pill, a gag gift, or an insufferable class. Otherwise, don't worry about getting literate--in this case, it's overrated. His theories could be expressed in a much simpler way. And then, once you understand them, you find that the ones that do hold up are unquantifiable and inapplicable."},{"Title":"Image-Music-Text","review":"Heath selected well for this volume, the essays flow well into one another and it proves to be quick reading.\\"Ethnocentric\\" in the other review is laughable.

Kid Shelleen convinces his partner-in-crime Frankie Ballou to go to the Saturday night dance instead of their usual visit to Crib Street and there he meets Cathy Morgan, the prettiest schoolmarm west of the Mississippi. It's love at first sight and the two ride away into the night to hitch the knot and Frankie plans to go straight - until he's caught red-handed with the loot from their latest train robbery and he's hauled off to jail. Kid and the rest of the *gang* free him and Cathy joins him at Robber's Roost, their mountain top hideout where their daughter Cat is born. Old Doc, Cathy's father, gets Frankie a pardon (long story) and eventually they save enough to buy a piece of land in Purple Valley - but it's a piece of land the Cattlemen's Association needs to run their herds through - and thus begins a heated battle that ends in tragedy for Cat.As she stood there by the graveside,Her burnin' eyes was dry,But her heart swore, \\"I'll have vengeance,Tooth for tooth an' eye for eye!\\"A determined Cat is set on revenge, but things don't go as planned and she ends up in dire need of rescuing by the latest gang inhabiting the Robber's Roost, and most especially their leader, Clay Boone. One look at Clay is enough for Cat to know he's the man she's dreamed of and she follows him to the Roost, much to the ire of Clay's younger brother who desires the beauteous Cat for himself, as does Kid Shelleen who worships her from afar. Will Randy's jealousy destroy the relationship between the two brothers? Will his stupidity land them all in hot water?And that's about as far as I'm going, you know what I always say - read it for yourself. This was a quick easy read with healthy doses of despicable cattle barons, bandits with a heart of gold, a gun battle or two and more than one in-the-nick-of-time rescue from jail. The love story between Cat and Clay was very sweet, I really liked how he fell in love with her before he even had a good look at her face. No surprise, but Cat's story is very different from that in the movie, as is the character of Kid Shelleen - no drunken buffoons here - just a dear bear of a man with a heart of gold that first loved the mother and then the daughter. 3.5/5 stars and I'd recommend it for anyone who loves a good western on occasion."},{"Title":"The ballad of Cat Ballou","review":"Fans of the 1965 comedy/drama western movie \\"Cat Ballou,\\" starring the young Jane Fonda and the not-so-young Lee Marvin, will be surprised to find that it has little in common with the book that inspired it. Roy Chanslor's \\"The Ballad of Cat Ballou\\" is essentially a western novel with a woman as the protagonist. The early part of the book focuses not on Cat, a dark-haired, sultry tomboy who bears almost no resemblance to the Jane Fonda character, but on the love story of her parents, set in a small, wild-west community. Cat's mother, red-headed Cathy Morgan, is a schoolmarm and daughter of the town doctor, her father, Frankie Ballou, is a dashing local outlaw. The character of Kid Shelleen (depicted in the film as a drunken buffoon) is a cold-eyed, deadly, but secretly sentimental gunslinger, Frankie's best friend and fellow outlaw. When Cathy and Frankie are killed in a stampede started by ranchers of the Cattlemen's Association, the fiery teenaged Cat swears vengeance, and heads for the hills with a gang of young male gunslingers. She takes one of them, the handsome and charismatic Clay Boone, as a lover, and fights off the advances of his brother, Randy, while defying local lawmen and virtually ruling over the outlaw mountain hideout known as \\"The Roost.\\"While hardly a brilliant work of literature, \\"The Ballad of Cat Ballou\\" is cleverly written and entertaining, with characters interesting enough to keep you reading until the final gunfight that concludes the tale."},{"Title":"The ballad of Cat Ballou","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book Cat Ballou.

Following on from their encyclopaedic 'Reiki Sourcebook' they have now written what is probably the most up to date exposition of the roots of Reiki. The book offers much information that is not readily available elsewhere, thanks to their own research and contacts with original students of Usui Sensei (through Chris Marsh) and a student of Eguchi's Palm Healing System,(Eguchi was another student of Usui).The Stienes cover the emergence of Reiki, including its cultural background and other healing systems around at the time of Usui, the Three Diamonds, The Five Elements of Reiki, the Five Precepts, Mantras (jumon) and symbols (shirushi), Reiju, choosing a Reiki course, developing a regular routine of self-practice and a comprehensive glossary of Japanese terms and further reading.I can heartily recommend this book to any Reiki Practitioner, or general enquirer, who is interested in what Reiki is really all about. For practitioners of any level, it will bring a new dimension to your practice and heralds a welcome return to the simplicity of the original system of Usui sensei."},{"Title":"Japanese Art of Reiki","review":"I am a Reiki Master and I love to check out books on the subject whenever I can. I was recommended the Reiki Sourcebook, by the same authors, through an online Reiki group. I ended up buying this book as well because I was interested to see Reiki from a more traditional view. I was not disappointed. Both books are very unbiased and easy to follow. Very very informative and original. I was pretty sick of books retelling Reiki histoy and the new age type \\"airy fairy\\" take on Reiki. Although there is some history in Sourcebook it is not as dry and overdone as other books. It seems to also be better researched by the authors.These two books were a breath of fresh air and I had a hard time putting them down. I actually enjoyed The Japanese Art of Reiki more than the Source Book. I thought it was more in-depth on techniques and the practical side of Reiki, which was what I was looking for. It gives you a view of Reiki as a solid daily routine. It just seemed to click with me better than some of what I was taught in my Reiki classes. This book has a lot I have not seen in any other book. The Sourcebook is more of general take on things. Though, there is not much redundant material in each if you buy them together.

What I think is incredibly special about this book is that it's not only intrigueing and informative, but it is also very empowering.

As most Japanese culture is preserved in a cocoon of secrecy and perhaps intrigue, it is difficult for westerners to get to the essence of it all.

A friend of mine recommended this book, and after reading it, I believe it contains the answers I was looking for.

Yes, this is where I was when I began my quest to learn about Reiki, massage therapy, and other wellness avenues. I wanted to know more about natural healing and exercise. I was curious as to what exactly Reiki was--what it involved, and I wanted to know if it actually worked for people. I was looking for a reliable source. So, I purchased The Japanese Art of Reiki in the hopes that it would answer some basic questions. The book, which primarily focuses on self-examination, self-discipline, and self-practice, proved to be an excellent choice in that regard. Though it is a small book, it is full of thought-provoking ideas, probing questions, suggestions, and practices, which offer a genuine, doable introductory approach for the person seeking more about this intriguing art of mind/body oneness. Photos illustrate the moves and positions for different applications / meditations.There are many great sections in this book; however, the one that resonated with me the most is the one about \\"The Five Precepts\\": For Today Only...Do not anger...Do not worry...Be humble...Be honest in your work...Be compassionate to yourself and others (Pages 67-76). If you can actively follow that sage advice each day, you can handle whatever comes your way.

The previous volumes had shown the motive behind UNESCO's project was not so much to make a history of africa as to make a history africans should be proud of. That is one hard task to accomplish once you try and tackle with the post-colonial history of the continent. One can understand the focus on the struggle for independence, even though some of the chapters read tiring. It is the chapters on independent africa that simply are not honest history-making: terror, censorship and corruption in the new-born african nations does not figure in this book, the mad reveries of african socialism and personality-cult are politely brushed aside.

This book is unquestionably one of the best works I have ever read on the sciences. Devlin writes in an uncannily concise and proficient style that actually makes the topic of math interesting and understandable to a lay person. Devlin intricately weaves history, mathematical concepts, and complex theories into a very readable text. (I did not think it could be done.)The text is divided into eight sections ranging from numbers to astrophysics. While the book does build on the information offered in each chapter, it is not necessary to read the book in a linear fashion. Devlin makes it very easy to choose chapters of interest.The first chapter deals with numbers. Ironically, we assume a lot about numbers when considering math. Devlin does an excellent job of defining what numbers are apart from the symbols we ascribe to them.The second chapter provides a concise explanation of mathematical proofs, reason, and logic. Using his unique style, Devlin is able to cover this chapter with examples from classic math (algebra) to modern linguistic analysis. The latter is an excellent example of how Devlin applies math theories presented to natural real world examples.Chapter 3 deals with the calculus. If you have ever asked: what is calculus used for, there is finally a concise, understandable presentation available in this chapter.Chapter 4 refers to geometries. Devlin traces the evolution of geometries and provides a good introduction to dimensions beyond the third dimension. (These ideas are continued in Chapters 6 and 8.)Chapter 5 is rather odd but seems to build on analyzing patterns in geometries. It treats topics like packing objects and snowflake patterns.Chapter 6 is the most difficult chapter, in my opinion, but also the most rewarding. This chapter alone is well worth the book. If you ever wanted to understand donuts, coffee cups, manifolds, strings, and knots, this is an excellent chapter.Chapter 7 is my favorite chapter. For once, someone has the insight to simply state that gambling and insurance are derived from the same origins. The chapter is an excellent treatment of regressions, means, and other &quot;statistical&quot; math.Chapter 8 reminds me of Michiu Kaku. It takes many of the mathematical theories and information presented and applies it to modern scientific pursuits like gravity, relativity, and space time."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Keith Devlin is one of the best popular mathematics writers around, and this is one of his best works. The eight chapters cover number theory, set theory, calculus, group theory, topology, probability and the application of mathematics to the physical world. The discussion in each chapter, couched generally in English, not mathematics, is so clear that a math-phobic can understand it. By the end of each chapter a great deal of fascinating mathematics has been described, and in some cases the formal basis is sketched--but the emphasis is always on narration, and a lay reader who doesn't even want to understand mathematics can still read this and get a sense of the dramatic history of mathematics.Devlin states at the end that he decided to exclude many areas of mathematics in order to focus more effectively on what he did cover. As a result there is little or no coverage of chaos theory, game theory, catastrophe theory, or a long list of other topics. The fact is there will always be holes in a book this size--mathematics has expanded so much in the last hundred years that even a book ten times this size could barely survey it. The decision to focus was a good one, and the subjects chosen are good: the truly exciting stories are here: Archimedes, Fermat, Gauss, Galois, Riemann, Wiles, and many more.Potential purchasers should note, by the way, that this book was reworked from Devlin's &quot;Mathematics: The Science Of Patterns&quot;. In Devlin's words (not from either book): &quot;The Language of Mathematics is a restructuring of Science of Patterns that omits most of the color illustrations (a minus) but has two new chapters covering topics not in Science of Patterns (a plus). If you want lots of color, go for patterns; Language of Mathematics covers more ground.&quot; I've read both, and I have to say they're both worth getting. The two new chapters in this book are the ones on probability and the applications of mathematics in science; they're well done and interesting. However, the pictures in Science of Patterns are very high quality.They're both fine books, and I can strongly recommend each of them. If you have to get one, I'd say get Science of Patterns. Even though Language of Mathematics does have some colour plates, Science of Patterns is really a gorgeous book to read with many good illustrations. I ended up buying both, and you may end up doing that too."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"I've always had a like-hate relationship with math; I didn't do well in it in college, but I've long been fascinated by physics. There are many books for the lay person about the cutting edge in physics; books like that are harder to find in the world of mathematics.But Keith Devlin has done it. He surely captured me near the beginning when he described mathematics as the study of patterns; a wonderful description that starts to get at why mathematics seems to be the language underlying the physical universe.This was not an easy book for a slightly math-averse person, but Devlin's explanations were always clear, and more importantly, always gave a sense of context of what he was discussing."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"The other reviewers have done a fine job reporting that this is a fun, engaging book. I want to say that my level of math includes two semesters of calculus, and that was more than enough to understand and enjoy the contents of this book.I'd known that knot-theory and set-theory various other kinds of math existed out there, but I didn't know much else. I'd never heard of projective geometry, although after reading this book I've found some nice examples online. I was introduced to these and other forms of math very gently and provocatively by Devlin's book, so if you are in a position similar to me, this is the book you want to read.I read dozens of books a year; and every year for Christmas I give my father the five best books I've read in that year, with the provision that they must be diverse and comprehensible to him: an intelligent man, though largely self-educated, with no papers to show, but a \\"working-man's PhD,\\" as Aaron Tippin sang. As a testament to the comprehensibility of this book, it will be waiting for him this December.As for myself, someday I hope to continue studying math at a universtity; for now my curiosity is sated with books like this, and it pleased me very much."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Most people either misunderstand what math is all about, or see it as a collection of rather disjointed areas collected together under a single name. Devlin does an admirable job of re-educating us all, and showing how the different areas of mathematics are linked together, often in rather surprising ways.This book is simply brilliant. The amount of information Devlin has managed to cram between two covers is amazing. Having spent years studying this stuff, it's rather depressing to see that most of the important things I've learned can fit into a 350 page book, but then this is surely a testament to Devlin's skill.Although this book makes no formal educational expectations of the reader, I feel that a true beginner would have trouble following a lot of parts, although they would still get the general idea. This would be better then nothing, but I think that this book would be best appreciated by those with some formal math background. I would be curious to see what a high school student would make of this, since I really wish I'd had this book back then. When you see the beautiful ways that mathematics connects the most seemingly disparate ideas, you can't help but want to learn more!"},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"By the time you get to exactly page 107 and see the logic of differential calculus hanging as beautifully as \\"Water Lilies\\", you might want to thank and slap those teachers who did in fact teach you mathematics, but who did not give you even a little of the reason behind the math -- the fundamental problems or quests that give rise to mathematics.All of this adds context that makes learning a big rush. It's possible that mathematics would not be so patently daunting if it were approached with deeper context instead of the abstraction beginning in chapter 1 of many school texts. This seems to be Mr. Devlin's approach in the book -- helping the reader appreciate and embrace the abstraction that is a prerequisite for opening the mind's eye.Both the author's and his reviewer's constant usage of terms such as power, elegance and simplicity is clearly in order. It's not just a left-brain affair and Mr. Devlin's book is a powerful exposition on that, especially as he details the creative cognitive leaps by many great minds over the course of thousands of years.For the record, I don't mean to go slapping anybody - I just got happy; that's all."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"This book is an incredible account into the ideas of mathematics. Devlin presents simple and extremely abstract ideas into a language that just about anyone can understand. Although some previous knowledge of the fields investigated does help, this book serves as a great introduction into such things as perspective geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, network theory, topology and quantum mechanincs. It also provides some great insights into the history and uses of number theory, algebra, geometry and calculus. I've have never read a mathematical/scientific work that was written with such passion and was a complete page turner (I read it straight over the course of 3 days). I am still amazed on how such a work can be under $50 because it is worth much more than that."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"I loved this book. If you want want to know what exactly mathematics is then it's just the ticket. Mr. Devlin doesn't have the whacky humour of Paulos or the literary flourishes of Stuart but I didn't want to be entertained, I wanted to understand and this book has a refreshingly clear style. My only criticism is that all too often the author said &quot;I won't show that here&quot; when you felt if he'd only tried you would have got it. A couple of things like Bayes' theorem felt incomplete but maybe they'll be a sequel."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Devlin: \\"The particular topics I have chosen are all central themes within mathematics... But the fact is, I could have chosen any collection of seven or eight general areas and told the same story; That mathematics is the science of patterns, and those patterns can be found anywhere you care to look for them, in the physical universe, in the living world, or even in our own minds. And that mathematics serves us by making the invisible visible.\\"At this writing it has been more than a few years since my last class in mathematics. But I liked math as a student and still do, even at the point that notation and degree of abstraction begins to hurt my head, so to speak, I still like it. There is a solidity and a beauty in mathematics that eclipses the empirical sciences. It is not only the practical applicability, logical purity, and beauty of mathematics that interest me, it is also its very immateriality. As Devlin states, \\"music exists not on the printed page, but in our minds. The same is true for mathematics; the symbols on a page are just a representation of the mathematics.\\"This is a wonderful book. Before 1900, mathematics could be wholly categorized within about a dozen subjects. While advances are still being made in some of these older disciplines -- Devlin discusses how developments in number theory are being applied to encryption for such purposes as banking security -- there are now at least 60-70 somewhat distinct disciplines of mathematics. The author reveals the logical foundations, history, and current applications of number theory, mathematical logic, the calculus, relativistic geometry, topology, and probability. Applications of mathematics to such seemingly far-flung fields as linguistics, electrodynamics, and astrophysics are briefly but aptly considered. He introduces us to the patterns and progressions of perceptive minds, from the Pythagoreans, Platonists, and Peripatetics, to Pascal and Penrose, with glances at Galileo, Gauss and Godel. [Okay, enough alliteration ... just having a little fun with patterns; and patterns, as Devlin instructs, is precisely what mathematics is all about.]"},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"This book reads like a mystery novel. Only that the mystery to be resolved is about the universe and the one seeking to resolve this is the collective human mind. The logic behind developments in different disciplines of mathematics is laid out very clearly and in most interesting manner. Book does not shy away entirely from mathematical formulas to make it easy on readers but the complex mathematical concepts are explained with optimal use of mathematical jargon and accompanied by storytelling ease.

He presented a biased view of mathematical history.The books is misleading in that regard."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Devlin's language of mathematics is an outstanding book \\"about\\" mathematics. It's best suited to lay audiences without any background in mathematics, I particularly disagree with other reviews which claimed that this work require any higher understanding of mathematics. In fact, if you are one of the people (including myself) who have not done any math or took a class or read a book relating to math since secondary school, this is a good place for you to start. I'm a lawyer who have spent much of a lifetime as a math-loathing individual. My mathematics education ceased 13 years ago when I was 17. But thanks to this book, with its blend of engaging narative history as well as concise-but-sharp explanations on the concepts of mathematics, I am now in love with mathematics for the first time in my life.This book needs not be read from cover to cover. Every discussion can stand on their own, and you are free to explore the content as your curiosity may lead. The first two chapters about what mathematical endeavor has been to manknid is brief but effective. I especially like the chapter on the mathematical induction; the subject was presented very clear yet powerful. The power of that simple exposition awakened something in me. I can only regret that I wasn't exposed to something like this when I was in school. It would have changed my life.However, if you want a proper mathematics education. This book is not up to that task. It is written only to educate lay people or just to whet an appetite for more serious treatment of math. In short, this is a book \\"about\\" mathematics, not a mathematics book. Therefore if you have a serious goal in reeducating yourself about math, I recommend \\"What is mathematics?\\" by Courant (it has got to be one of the best math books written in the past 60 years). Also books written by Prof John Stillwell definitely worth checking out. Stillwell wrote many books on fundamental concepts of mathematics without requiring deeper background than highschool mathematics."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"For trying to be a popular exposition on mathematics Devlin's book is too difficult for the lay reader. Unless you have university level mathematics in your luggage you won't understand much. The explanations of basic conepts are missing, the proofs are not there and the history is condensed into a few pages. Thus if your mathematical imagination cannot fill in these gaps you will not extract much pleasure from this book. You will rather be frustrated. I myself have read mathematics at the university and still couldn't follow him everywhere. The problem is that the labeling of the book is misleading. This is not a book of popularized mathematics. This is leizure time reading for mathematics professors and math-freaks. If you want to read something that is easy to understand but still interesting try some of the American Mathematical Society's wonderful publications (you can find them all on amazon)."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"I'm in my early 30's, got an undergraduate math degree, and have been experiencing a renewal of my interest in math. I found this book at the perfect time.The negative reviews on this book are true. I can't imagine more than small parts of chapters being interesting to someone who hasn't already been exposed to university level maths. The symmetry and topology chapters were very entertaining, but I can imagine them being a little opaque for someone without prior study of these topics (or who hadn't at least tried to tile their bathroom).If you're in my position, having studied math, forgot about it for a couple of years, and are now renewing your interest in it, I highly recommend this book. If you've never studied, but are interested in learning about math, find an easier introduction and save this for your 3rd or fourth book, when you're ready to see how math helps us understand abstract ideas even before they have real world application."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"In The Language Of Mathematics, Keith Devlin (Dean of the School of Science at St. Mary's College of California) shows the reader the vitally important role mathematics has played and continues to play in helping us understand and conceptualize ourselves and the world we live in.

If you want to buy a book of this 'type', buy this one.It gives you a very good picture of the evolution of mathematics, without loosing focus. Devlin doesn't forget the objective of the book: to show you the beauty of mathematics, and how the language evolved to higher levels of abstraction, as soon as a problem appeared that couldn't be solved with the (then) current techniques.He shows (by means of examples) how mathematics is so good at uncovering the hidden patterns in science and nature and he also comments on the direction of discovery (mathematics driving physics, and the other way around).Solid 5"},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Devlin is not esoteric in his approach; he is not interested in ivory tower mental rumination. One need only an imagination, not cumulative jargon. He sincerely wants to share the beauty of mathematics with the general populace, its theoretical development and utility.

In summary: mathematics is the rigorous discipline of identifying patterns both in the actual and imaginary worlds (however, what one can imagine is at least partially dependent on reality as one perceives it through one's senses). On top of identifying such patterns, mathematics also study, examine, and investigate them. A lot of these are \\"not part of the physical world we live in; they are part of ourselves, of the way we are constructed as cognitive entities\\" (page 163). Another vital feature of mathematics is its power of abstracting information, including the process of axiomitization (of course within the constraint of Godel's theorem).While it has myriad branches (eg. number theory [Ch.1], set theory [Ch.2], analysis [Ch.3], geometry [Ch.4], group theory [Ch.5], topology [Ch.6], probability [Ch.7] -- these are discussed extensively to illustrate the nature of mathematics), they share the same aforementioned features, viz. abstraction, and consistency; and they are all inter-related. This is beautifully demonstrated (in a most truncated way) via Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem (pages 259-269).The last chapter is in a sense the crown of the book - it shows how mathematics describes how our universe runs without actually telling anyone what the underlying \\"nature\\" of reality is. This is fertile ground for deep thinking.A truly marvellous achievement. Five stars!"},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"By the time you get to exactly page 107 and see the logic of differential calculus hanging as beautifully as \\"Water Lilies\\", you might want to thank and slap those teachers who did in fact teach you mathematics (thanks!), but who did not give you even a little of the reason behind the math -- the fundamental problems or quests that give rise to mathematics.All of this adds context that makes learning a big rush. It's possible that mathematics would not be so patently daunting if it were approached with deeper context instead of the abstraction beginning in chapter 1 of many school texts. This seems to be Mr. Devlin's approach in the book -- helping the reader appreciate then embrace the abstraction that is prerequisite for opening the mind's eye.Both the author's and his reviewer's constant usage of terms such as power, elegance and simplicity is clearly in order. It's not just a left-brain affair and Mr. Devlin's book is a powerful exposition on that, especially as he details the creative cognitive leaps by many great minds over the course of thousands of years.For the record, I don't mean to go slapping anybody - I just got happy; that's all."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"Devlin defines mathematics as the science of patterns - numerical patterns, patterns of shape, patterns of motion, patterns of behavior, voting patterns, etc. Throughout history dating back at least to the Greeks (around 500 to 300 BCE) where they were concerned with primarily geometry forward to the present where we deal with relativity and quantum mechanics, we have been devoted to learning more about these patterns.Throughout history we have had many great minds contribute to our understanding of these patterns through the use of mathematics. Devlin introduces us to the work of these great minds, such as, to name a few, Pythagoras (~580 BCE), Heraclitus (5th century), Aristarchus (~300 BCE) Diophantus (~250 BCE), Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665), Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), Isaac Newton (1643-1727), Christian Goldbach (1690-1764), Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), George Boole (1779-1848), Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879), Hermann Minkowski (1864-1909), David Hilbert (1862-1943), Albert Einstein (1879-1955), Kurt G&ouml;del (1906-1978). Of course, many more are discussed in the book, and their work also contributed to our understanding of the patterns in our world.The subtitle of the book is \\"Making the invisible visible.\\" A very good example of this in the book is Maxwell's equations describing the electric and magnetic fields. The equations, interestingly, don't provide us with an explanation of electromagnetism, but provide us with the mathematics to see the invisible. They make the invisible electromagnetic radiation visible through the math.I found his discussion in chapter seven on probability very interesting; I have a whole new way of looking at statistics and probability. Also, in chapter eight, he provides a very good explanation of the light cone in Minkowski spacetime. I read about this in one of Stephen Hawkins' books, but Devlin provides a much more meaningful description here.As the author himself admits, he could not practically cover every branch of mathematics - \\"one must make choices,\\" but the ones he does cover, I think, give us a good feel for the development of mathematics over the years and our quest to understand those patterns.Overall, this is a good book to learn about how mathematics reveals the patterns in the world, and it gives you a history lesson on the development of mathematics over the years as well."},{"Title":"The Language of Mathematics: Making the Invisible Visible","review":"It has long been argued that to understand the universe, it is first necessary to understand the language used to describe it, namely mathematics. Devlin opens with that position and then proceeds to give a historical account of many areas of mathematics and how they are used to describe the actions of the physical world. Devlin does an excellent job in explaining the mathematics at a level of basic understanding, although to his credit he does not hesitate to include formulas and equations when they are necessary.Some of the topics covered are:*) Formal grammars*) Number theory*) Conic sections*) Logical reasoning*) The fundamental geometries*) Basic topology*) Fundamental probabilityIn each section, Devlin's goal is to explain the material well enough so that the reader can understand and appreciate the value that it brings to the mathematical world.

I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Morality is subject to some rolling blackouts in this book. At the end, the law stepped in and made sure that the destruction was mutual. Law seems to be particularly inept in situations where a book is this hard on the reader, and those critics in the Norton Critical Edition who consider this novel almost a crime against literature have a point. If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses. There were parts of this book I enjoyed: Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme. Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born. I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly. I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say. Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time. For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame. Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way. There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear. D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville. I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it.

In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \\"get\\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \\"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text?

Whilst reading the 50 Shades Trilogy recently, I noted the references to Tess in that book and it perked my interest in this book. I decided to re-read it as I really couldn't remember it much and wondered how I would interpret it now being more mature and experienced. Well suffice it to say that this book is devastatingly excellent! The language is hard to get at first (having not read a Thomas Hardy in a long time!).... it's a Thomas Hardy novel so you know he's very detailed and it's going to be tragic as he doesn't do happy ever after! The novel is set in Victorian England and features its heroine Tess a very poor country girl. It details her journey from innocent young girl on the cusp of womanhood to womanhood. It is essentially a love tragedy but not in the manner of Romeo and Juliett, its more, more real, more realistic. Its speaks to just how tragic life can be when the right man doesn't meet the right woman at the right time, about missed opportunities, and, depicts how the biggest of injustice and violation often happens to the most vulnerable and undeserving of persons. It speaks to how morals and society's beliefs can cause us pain and sorrow and often to punish those undeserving of same. But that was life then and its still so today. Suffice it to say that this book is 100 times better than the 50 Shades Trilogy and has impacted me so profoundly, I just can't understand how I didn't see the monumental tragedy it is when I was 17 years old. As a result I've taken to re-reading most of my literature books.

Besides the fact that it is a classic - and I think that every teenager or young person in one's twenties must read it - I learned that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a pretty controversial novel when Thomas Hardy first released it. As we know from history and from literature courses, the Victorians considered themes such as sex, religion, the condition of women or the lives of the peasants taboo subjects. Fortunately we are more open-minded today and we don't make a big fuss of what's moral or not in books such as this one. I guess that Thomas Hardy had the intention to open the peoples' eyes - though it is a fictional story - that unfortunate things were happening to innocent girls during that time.The story is very realistic and the characters are complex.Tess is a free-spirited girl until her destiny changes and becomes more difficult. Tess swings between strength and weakness, between reason and her heart. I admire her capacity of dusting herself off and decide to find another place to work, in order to help her poor family. Although Angel is far away, her hope that he will come back someday does not leave her. I didn't like the fact that she constantly blamed herself for the first bad episode of her life which led her to other complicated situations. She felt guilty for something she wasn't aware of or she wasn't taught to avoid.The book also gives us a glimpse of how were the lives of peasants, and the depiction of the landscapes will appeal to those how love nature.I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin your reading.Therefore read Tess of the D'Urbervilles because you can enter in Tess' world and learn more about her troubles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I must admit that this is one of the few classics that I have not read, so when I found a free copy for my Kindle, I immediately downloaded it.

Hardy's characters are brought to life and you feel as if you could know someone with these same characteristics in the here and now. The ending of this story, for me personally left something to be desired, but I really could not put it down. If you have not read this story, yet, please do!On a side note, I would love to see a contemporary adaptation of this story and see how the characters would interact with each other, as social standing, money, love, and betrayal are certainly themes worth examining in this day and age."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Should not be made into an afterschool special.

And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy is an extraordinary writer; though his writing is poetic, and includes on point historical references, he is an imaginative and thoughtful storyteller. Hardy reveals Tess's soul with such care and regard that she is irresistibly complex; delicate and strong willed, deeply loyal and obstinately independent, yet submissive and capable of extreme violence. So well did I come to understand her that, over time, I could predict her reactions and decisions -- though I hoped she would decide otherwise. Once a preacher reveals to Tess's father his connection to a long lost prominent family, Tess's is life is set on a seemingly unalterable path. Used, manipulated, misjudged and shamed, she struggles on, grinding out a living in unspeakably harsh conditions, while resisting with all her might a man who had already stolen her innocence and would shamelessly destroy her soul as she waiting for the man who had abandoned her. I found myself wincing at her pain, hoping she would receive what she deserved rather than what life seemed intent on doling out to her. Perhaps the best novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" is, well, the story about Tess of the D'Urbervilles, a \\"simple,sensuous and passionate\\" peasant girl whose maturation into a woman has tremendous antipathy to its brim. The transfiguration of \\"a fine and handsome\\" country lass into a blooming woman with hapless consequences is the theme of this the most ambitious tragic Hardyan novel and the artistic flair of the late Victorian novelist blended with the subtle craftsmanship transcends the individual concern into one of the society.The proposition involved in \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\" first published in 1891 in three volumes has a tragic enough diction as we get it so clearly throughout the 550 or so odd pages of the book. It is to contract the unending horizon of the human life into a miniscule and apparently insignificant domain of an individual, who's inexperienced, unsophisticated, candid and uncanny. Tess Durbeyfield is a meek, submissive sixteen-and-a-half year old country girl with several siblings, a dissipated father and an illusioned mother living in the village of Marlott in the county of 19th. century fictitious Wessex,Hardy's eternal refuge from the real world outside. The chance discovery of John Durbeyfield from Parson Tringham, the antiquary of Stagfoot Lane, of his ancestral line of D'Urbervilles and a freak accidnt culminating in the death of one of his horses for which Tess herself shouldrs the blame sends the eponymous protagonist of this darkly compelling drama to find monetary solace in the wealthy Mrs. D'Urberville. As if the exploitation of the have nots in terms of financial issues weren't enough, the poor peasant girl from the poor \\"blighted\\" Durbeyfield family is seduced by Mrs. D'Urberville's sensual and lustful son Alec. Alec shuns her, Tess becomes pregnant, the child passes away in infancy, the unmarried mother mother starts working as a diarymaid in a farm, the Talbothays, falls in love with Angel Clare, the rector's son.....the whole flow of the tyde has a strangely familiar suspicion about itself and it's actually Thomas Hardy's exceptional gift for exploring a relatively small setting to compile a general drama of human life that transpires real tragic proportions from a fictitious figure.Art is indeed often illusory, sometimes it's even a whisper of the urge of reformation; but in more probabilities than one, art is symbolic, a sign of much deep-seated intent. The genuine accomplishment of all forms of art---be it literature, painting,sculpture,music or much else---is to portray the vastness of the human expanse in the most trimmed space and geniuses of all ages in all spheres of art have managed to do just that. Van Gogh's \\"Sunflowers\\" and \\"The Starry Night\\" are more symbolic than cliches, Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina\\" is the depiction of social turmoil in 19th. century Russia, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" is a journey through a distorted and divided soul's mind and Eric Clapton's song \\"Tears of Heaven\\" is the ultimate homage to our passed away beloved ones. \\"Tess of the D'Urbevilles\\" too is a metaphor for agonies, humiliations, inward and outward strifes, twists and turns in life and the ultimatum. The unprecedented and nihilistically conspiring turn of events that Tess encounters in her hard and lonely life could've been thrown to anyone in general and any woman of any age in particular and through Tess's character as well as through the brilliant evocation of the fictional Wessex landscape and people, Hardy stags \\"the ache of modernism\\"in the novel.This abyss of \\"the ache of modernism\\" is aptly poured into the images of the rustic realm and the ascend of the morally and spiritually corrupt. Nowhere in the book is this concept clearer than in the nature of the shrewd and machiavellian Alec D'Urberville. A sinful man come to no good by demolishing an unsuspecting girl's life, Alec is also a preacher of the Gospels in his so-called reformed stage. But all his baser passions are aroused on seeing Tess after four years and he turns into a wolf once more: \\"Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master again. If you are any man's wife, you are mine!\\" This to a Tess whose innocent flaw of revealing her horrendous past to Angel on their weddind night had caused their subsequent separation and 'the deserted wife\\"-'s struggle in sustaining hr livelihood. The typical male sexual desires and possessive phyche is symbolized in Angel Clare whose own sinful past is acceptable but not Tess's unconditioned misery.Throughout the novel, the bounteous description of the landscape, the environment and Nature keeps the reader spell-bound at the author's immense imaginative power, marvellous visualisation skill and abundant choice of similes and metaphors and aptly used words. Yet the language and mood always maintain a touch of pessimism and not even spares the simple, unrestrained and self-sacrificing friendship of Marian,Retty Priddle,Izz Huett and Tess.Hardy is barely good at analysing characters and that is vividly exposed towards the end of the novel. Angel returns from Brazil and scampers to rejoin with \\"a cottage-girl, his young wife\\" only to find her with Alec D'Urberville once again. In utter desperation of realising that she was taken in by Alec with morbid promises about her dishevelled family, Tess kills him and then elopes with Angel nly to be caught within a short span of time and be hanged. Such a sudden turnaround of events is too confusing and leaves one wondering whether more words and pages should've been devoted to such critical situations. The reader rues too the missingdescription of Tess's and Angel's marriage as much as the incomplete pictored characters' change of notions.That the end of the novel is a befitting tribute, be it poetically just, tragic or sarcastic, to the three major characters is a Jack jumping out of the box. Alec's sin is too much for this world to bear and so he dies; Tess's life is too inundated with misery, despair, responsibility and uncertainty and so she meets with a tragic end; Angel's puritan perspective finds him a pure, genteel partner in the shape of Tess's younger sister Liza-Lu.What adds jewels to the crown are the dramatic effects installed into the novel to make the reader approach the chain of events with a sigh and regret. What if Tess's written confession pushed under Angel's door hadn't gone under the carpet? Surely the tragic aftermath could've been bypassed. Again, had Tess not overheard her husband's brothers' critical approach to her, she would've surely met with her in-laws and her life would've turned over a new leaf. But tragedy is always concentrated on inevitability and waivering of the obvious and so it is in the case of Tess, the \\"little fool\\".The fate of an unassuming girl \\"put to by an Enemy in the shape of a friend' and played from one court to another and back again like a shuttlecock isn't rare enough but what's rare is the quality of Hardy to paint a solemn picture about the essence of the issue. True, the book does often become a laboured read and provokes a deep pang of pain, anger, frustration, resentment, resentment and a rebellious intent,but the reader cannot help but fel that \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" is \\"a new kind of beauty, a beauty of tragic tone\\".SUBHANKAR MONDAL, UG STUDENT, BANGALORE, INDIA"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Probably Hardy's most famous work and definitely containing his most sympathetic heroine. Takes direct aim at the class system and gender roles and forces the reader to see stark differences between what is socially acceptable and what is socially ridiculed. Note how Tess is blamed for her past more than Alec is, when it's Alec's fault Tess ends up as she does. A final ultimate retribution does surface but of course, at the expense of Tess's future. She's heartbreaking here, especially when she writes to Angel, pleading for his love and forgiveness. You can feel every second of her plight , right down to the harsh outdoor work she's forced to endure in order to stay alive. All dust, sweat and fatigue... Supporting characters are as vivid as the main ones... This may be Hardy's most complete and upsetting story. He really puts the players (thus the audience) thru the ringer."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"it truly is an amazing story of love, strength, passion and second chances.

Thus, like many other of the reviewers on this page, I was &quot;forced&quot; to read. I must admit that at first the reading was quite tedious. It must have taken me two months to read through the novel. If I had written a review after this first encounter with Tess I might well have given the novel a two star (**) rating. I believe one of the explanations for this lack of enthusiasm is that I did not get along well with my English teacher and I felt that I could not allow myself to enjoy Tess, lest I let my teacher score an important victory.As the exam period itself approached I read Tess four more times with increasing enjoyment. The last few readings were truly enlightening. I knew exactly what I would encounter on the next page and yet I shuddered with anticipation, reacting to the words even before my eyes caught them.It seems clear to me now that the reason I enjoyed Tess so much was not only the familiarity bred by multiple readings but also the dissection of the novel in the classroom. I must confess that although we had problems getting along, my English teacher was excellent.The only advice I can give those of you who doubt Tess' greatness is to muster some courage and give the novel another chance. Tess is on my all time Top 10 list along with The Grapes of Wrath, which, incidentally, I was &quot;forced &quot; to read in my high school English class."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Not a frustration in the negative sense, but in fact, this was a book which I could hardly put down. The fact that I felt compelled to express my thoughts here perhaps point to it's even greater impact on me. A fabulous story, and of course, tragic in the end... And why do I feel frustrated? Perhaps merely for the fact of Tess ' rash action, almost one of self defence, which closes her tragic life. And the want or need for the story to extend beyond the final close to see her defence succeed and her life prevail. However, these are not the modern times, and the chasm seems wide. Tess is a beautiful person - innocent and with only the intention of good - and suffers as a result.

It is a beautifully written novel about one wopman and her struggle to find love and her duty to her family.Tess was a child who sought to right her wrong by working for her &quot;cousins&quot; she hoped that by doing this she could become a productive member of the family particularly as the eldest child. She was required to take care pof most of the chores as her siblings were too young to help the family. As a daughter she was taught that it was her duty to marry wealth so that her family would not have to live in squallor. In her attempt to do this she was taken advantage of, but not raped, and she was made pregnant. She could not abort the child, and she could not properly carry the child to term without being married. She did the latter of these because she hated the childs father. Many times she wished that the child would die so that it would not have to live with the bastard lable. She felt that it was best that the child be taken from the earth to make her and her child's life easier.Tess soon finds that there is a doiuble standard for pre-marital sex in Victorian England. Her husband, on there wedding night admits that he has been promiscuous, Tess is greatly relieved by this because she thinks that he will be more accepting of her situation when she tells him, this is not so. Angel, her husband, walk out on tess and leaves her to fend for herself, an unloved and un cared for woman. This novel ends sadly with Tess' death after Angel comes back to her and they live happily for a number of days.This novel is an excellent example of social commentary in the form of literary art. This novel is a poinient dipiction of the life of a young woman in Victorian England.

Thus, I wasn't completely into the novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"It has come to my attention that this novel is required by American and Canadian highschools - which is why some of the ratings are so poor. Infantile criticisms by teenagers (who might change their minds later) disrupt the rating system used by Amazon. The fascinating aspect of Hardy - in this work, as well as in others is the manner that Charaters and setting intertwine. Relationships are seemingly established but what renders Hardy a literary tragedian is his capacity of substantiating the relationships into pre-determined moulds; the ending is somewhat predictable but the psychology leading to it and how it is developed is the interesting part. My only problem with Hardy is how he characterizes Brazil - Curitiba and then follows with him being in Rio de Janeiro. I would have liked to see more written about the actual experience there - but that is a minor complaint. PS - for some of the readers out there: Brazil is NOT just a rainforest. There are dry plains, extensive wetlands, moutainous forests (not the same as rain forests), snowy peaks, deserts, etc..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess is such a weak character, one you'd love to hate.

He sends his older daughter, Tess, to live with the D'Urbervilles, unaware that the current family of D'Urbervilles are imposters.At the home of these imposters, Tess is raped by the eldest D'Urberville son, Alec. She flees and gives birth to a child conceived by the rape. The infant dies and Tess buries him in secret.In an attempt to escape her past and start anew, Tess takes a milkmaid job at Talbothay's Dairy where she meets and falls in love with Angel Clare. Angel is a beautiful man who loves Tess deeply, but when he proposes to her, she is torn between lying to him by omission versus telling him of her past with Alec -- a choice that would likely alienate him in the strict morals of Victorian Britain.After they are married, Tess breaks down and tells Angel of her shameful past. Angel can't cope with it and leaves Tess penniless to travel to Brazil. When both Angel and Alec return to her, she is faced with the choice between them and the disastrous consequences of her decisions.Overall, I was disappointed by the lack of theme. The story is just unrelenting bleak, which wouldn't have bothered me except there didn't really seem to be a point to it. A lot of the text is spent repeating things that really didn't need to be repeated, especially in the entire section devoted to the lead-up to Tess agreeing to marry Angel. We knew it was going to happen, so I quickly lost interest in all tension-building that didn't really build any tension.I guess it might have been about the tragic fate of principled people. Tess is a moral woman, she desires only to be happy -- and both lead her to nothing but tragedy. I realize this was a bit cutting edge in the late 19th century when people wanted their stories to have happy endings no matter what happened in the middle. But explorations on the unfairness of life are only realistic if they rest on the capriciousness of fate. Murphy's Law just doesn't kick the hell out of people like it does to Tess.There is the class confusion element; the \\"what constitutes a true gentleman?\\"; the critique of basing the aristocratic label on either blood or money. But, really, I'm getting burned out on the theme that poor people are just inherently better than everyone else. It's not realistic so it doesn't do much for the development of a class conscience.There isn't even any feminist theme. Men dominate Tess her entire life, but this isn't the factor that leads to any of Tess' problems. Her problems are shown to be entirely the work of cruel fate (who apparently has it in for her to an extreme degree).Don't get me wrong. I did enjoy the book. This is just what really prevented me from really loving it. I did enjoy the story and the writing itself. I just think there are better classics out there."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I did not lose any weight, however.

I thought that The Return of the Native was good...Tess of the d'Urbervilles by the Great Thomas Hardy was a very long novel for me. Hardy's scope and incredible projection of Wessex was very admirable and how he presents Tess as a person is very beautiful.The novel begins with Tess' father learning that his family, the Durbeyfields is descended from a long gone ancient regime, the d'Urbervilles. I really love how Hardy makes you feel like this is the ultimate cross for Tess and her family to bear. How Tess grows to hate this fact. After the Durbeyfield's horse is impaled, yes impaled, when Tess and her brother are trying to deliver something that her father is too ill (or too drunk) to deliver, Tess blames it all on herself and is sent to work on the manor that her parents think that her \\"cousin,\\" the cruel Alec d'Urberville resides in. A great Hardyan lustre of that element of the story is that Alec d'Urberville's father just bought that name after lookin it up in some book, so Tess falls into a trap of fate and is continually punished. Tess' whole life is told through the novel and is filled with very tragic scenes, so if you like feel good books, stay away from this one.This novel is full of beautiful and moving tragedy, incredible projection of Victorian rural life, and just about everything Hardy can give you in one novel.Definatley essential Victorian Literature, definatley essential Thomas Hardy, and without question one of the greatest novels ever written....Only a poet could've written such a beautiful novel..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This book is wonderful for many reasons and especially for its portrayal of Tess.

When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read.

I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part.

Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel.

Never again turn the pages of Tess of the D'Urbervilles with baited breath and a longing ache that realistically shouldn't stem from mere fiction.Phenomenal, this work of Thomas Hardy's is.Not since reading Jane Eyre have I been so totally immersed in the life of a character, so in tune with her sufferings and joys, so hopeful yet fearful for her future. Tess seems so real, sometimes pathetically so, but always wishfully so. Her story is a sad one, but it brings with it its own reward.I almost wish I could have stopped reading at a point before the ending, so I would be free to imagine my own perfect conclusion. Or better yet, so Tess could live on, could still have that elusive chance at fulfillment and lasting joy. But Mr. Hardy's ending is the best one, the most fitted to the rest of the book.

It is a book which has intense atmosphere, character development, romance, an interesting storyline and yet still gives us much food for thought.At the start of the book our beautiful heroine Tess is a teenager of a poor family with a father who is an alcoholic. She is a young woman who always tries to do the best for her family which lands her in trouble. Tess is eventually raped and gives birth to an illegitimate child. That she remains a good person who still tries to do her best and is a heroine of a book was shocking at the time of publication.In many ways it is obvious that Tess' story is going to end tragically. Even while we root for Tess and grow to admire her courage and perseverance we are aware that it is against all odds. This then provokes interesting questions about how the story would appear in today's world and the moral questions involved in contemporary society.Growing up as a farm girl, I enjoyed all the interesting details about the various types of farming in the late 19th century England. I loved the descriptions of the walks and travels by coach across the rural countryside."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"'Tess' is a beautifully-written classic that kept my kindle dictionary busy. It is a story about how painful and unfair life can be, and especially to those who are by-nature the most loving, kind and sensitive.

So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English. It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero. It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology. It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies. It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does. It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes.The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure. Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work. Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first. Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of \\"Wessex\\" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison. Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation.Hardy's style is like no one else's. It is not snappy, as Dickens can be. It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's. It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either. It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as \\"modern.\\" Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest. Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions. Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere. The effect is not pretentious but timeless.There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here. Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience. I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best stories I've ever read. Its characters, especially Tess herself, are so alive and memorable that they stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. That being said, though, it's also not a novel for the casual reader. This book is so thought-provoking and, ultimately, heartbraking that it can't be easily forgotten, and will more than likely leave you with an overwhelming sadness for a long time afterward. I read a lot, and material with very different subject matters, so I'm not being melodramatic when I say that this book left me extremely choked up, and almost on the verge of tears. For a guy in his mid-20's who never gets emotional, I think that's saying quite a lot. It certainly left me with a lot of respect for the author. The reader comes to care so much about Tess, and agonize over the way her life turns out, that it becomes almost unbearable at times. For a fictional tale to have that effect on a person is quite incredible. Difficult or not, anyone who is interested in reading a brilliant and moving story that deserves to be called a classic should read Tess of the D'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Recently, my brother and I were discussing the \\"poverty penalty,\\" the concept that the poor pay more for what they must buy because they have no bargaining power to invite competition, which drives down prices. This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of her life of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"When Thomas Hardy first had \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" published in 1891, the controversy that surrounded it ensured for him financial security and status as one of the most popular authors of the time. The novel's scandal was concerned with the plot itself, in which an innocent young maid is seduced by an aristocratic cad, and pays for such an indiscretion with everything she holds dear in her life. In Hardy's journal (as recounted in Margaret Higonnet's introduction in this edition) he records that one of the Duchess of Abercorn's dinner parties ended in an argument between those who believed that Tess deserved her fate, and those that sympathized with her plight. However, by today's standards (in which premarital sex barely registers an eye-blink) one can't help but wonder if such a novel is relevant anymore.I'm going to argue, that yes, of course it is - if not simply to illustrate how lucky we are to no longer live in a world where a woman can be utterly destroyed through the hypocrisy of the society she lives in. However, there's considerably more to it than that, particularly as the remnants of this ideology remain to this day; and since one of the central themes of the novel is the negative effect of past traditions on the present, this bears keeping in mind.Tess Durbeyfield is a simple country lass, easily manipulated and with a limited education, but with a keen intelligence and insight into human nature. However, when her foolish father is casually told by the village minister that he is the offshoot of a once-noble family, Tess is thrown into her parent's ambition mechanizations. Made to leave her home and younger siblings, Tess begins work tending chickens at a relative's house whilst attempting to ward off the unwelcome attentions of her devious cousin Alec D'Uberville. However, her resolve slips one night when she is alone with Alec, lost and (as the text suggests) intoxicated, and he takes full advantage of her vulnerability.Having borne his child and lost it soon after (all without Alec's knowledge) Tess seeks employment elsewhere, and finds a sense of peace and security as a milkmaid in a neighboring village. That is, until she meets the parson's son Angel Clare, a very different kind of man from Alec D'Uberville. Falling in love, (along with every other girl on the farm!) Tess finds herself in a new moral crisis. Should she reveal her secret to Angel? Would he accept her if he knew? Her family (not to mention her common sense) warn her to keep her mouth shut, but can any relationship last if it is based on a lie? Shouldn't she have faith in Angel's testimonies of love to her?However, you've probably already guessed that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and this is a tragedy in the old grand tradition. When young Tess is seduced by a man her fate is sealed. She is a fallen woman, carrying the shame of her indiscretions throughout the rest of her life. However, the novel is remarkable because of Hardy's ability to find light amongst all the grimness. In the depths of Tess's drudgery and despair, we feel her moments of tranquility and appreciation of the beauty that surround her. Likewise, in moments of joy and peace, there is the underlying dread of the secret threatening to rare its ugly head. The emotions stirred in reading this novel are relentless - not to put anyone off from reading this novel, but I was in a constant state of agitation and discomfort in reading; that's how vivid the circumstances of the novel were. I mean that as a good thing of course; books these days are like movies - you sit, you watch, you more often than not feel nothing. But I was truly moved by \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" and her story; and I can't remember the last time I became so invested in a character and her happiness. Despite the pain it brought me in reading it, \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" was worth every agonizing word.In many ways this is a feminist novel, and although I would hate to put too modern a spin on it, it is very easy to see that Thomas Hardy's sympathies lie with Tess, writing in a letter: \\"I lost my heart to her as I went on with her history.\\" It is impossible not to feel a swell of indignation when Alec D'Uberville makes Tess swear not to tempt him anymore (as if his lust for her attractiveness is somehow *her* fault!) and a sense of bitter frustration at Angel Clare's inability to accept Tess's indiscretion, particularly when he himself is guilty of the same crime. When his lofty image of Tess as his pure \`child-bride' is taken from him, you can't help but feel he's doing it just as much out of injured pride than any sense of propriety.But this propriety is all-powerful in the novel; a heavy weight upon Tess that destroys her life. Hardy brings forth the idea that this is indeed a fallen world, but that it is so because of mankind's own structures of tradition and circumstance, rather than any divine ordination or original sin. To be free of some of them is a great release, though there are plenty that remain in this and other cultures around the world. The story is one of endurance; enduring the condemnation of others, the physical trials of manual labour, the suffering of a broken heart, the terror of encroaching death. We cannot control any of these aspects of our lives - all we can do is endure them, as Tess did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I'm many years out of college and thought I should start reading some more of the classics. Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, \\"Pay attention to ME!!!\\" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read \\"mind candy\\", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist. When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man. But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household. (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.) Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose. Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel. Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy. Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love. Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess. He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences. Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige. He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony. The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements. Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully. Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood. An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results. The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I see \\"Tess\\" as the story of how a beauty is wronged by evil and by arrogance.But oh, what a story. Hardy's novels read like poetry. Tess is so lovely, innocent and good, Alec so relentlessly hideous, and Angel so pathetically self-righteous, that I find the gradual destruction of Tess (with whom I empathize) at the hands of these two men, to be difficult to experience again, line by line!What a masterpiece of the human condition, and I'm told, of the female experience. Hardy's bitterly honest portrayal of the worst and best of human behavior is as powerful as any I've found in literature.When I need a Hardy fix and I don't want to be depressed, I turn to \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"(Warning: Tells Plot of the Story)Through many revisions and editions, Tess of the D'Urbervilles A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented By Thomas Hardy still holds readers captive over a hundred years later. Tess's plight though childhood innocence to womanly revenge is similar to other fairy tales and classic novels. It is said to be a love story for young girls or an adults' treasure of allusions and serious themes. Tess grows up fast, having to deal with the wrongs of mankind, her social class, a noble lineage, and the renewal of her true self. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel that can surpass the ages as a heartbreaking tale for any reader who believes in redemption and compassion for the all-encompassing heroine.In 19th Century Britain, Tess searches for a little pleasure out of her wronged life. Through many novels, Thomas Hardy has told the stories of characters and flaws. Hardy's insight to a woman's life is remarkable. He shows the injustices women have received and the stereotypes that follow women still today. Without knowing the narrator to be a man, it could easily have been a woman who told this very feminine tale. The book was very controversial at the time of its release in 1891. Parts were censored and seen as obscene because of it's sexual views. Hardy continually revised the story, changing the interpretations of the main characters. He did this through including information on some facts and removing statements on others. Alec D'Urberville could be seen in one edition as only the antagonist, not the villain he is in this version. His alterations lead to the 1912-13 edition that is usually the book available now.Hardy focuses on many themes throughout the book, mostly on the feminine role and social class. Tess Durbeyfield realizes her social struggle when she caused an accident to happen sending her family into financial need. With the recent discovery of their family's lineage to be that of the once very prominent D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent off to her wealthy relatives. The relatives in reality are not D'Urbervilles, only a family that had taken the name because questionable activity was attached to their old name. Alec D'Urberville realizes Tess's financial need and uses it against her to join him at his mother's estate. Gender roles are brought up when Joan Durbeyfield, Tess's mother, believes that \\"her face\\" (53) is her one advantage. Only D'Urbervilles advantage is greater. He holds the blackmail of economic need over Tess's head until he eventually takes advantage of her. \\"An immeasurable chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm\\" (74). The pregnant Tess, as an unmarried woman isolated from others, escapes home to have her baby. Tess tries her hand as a field worker where women \\"were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature\\" \\"A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field\\" (87-89). Roles are defined by gender again as women being earthly and beautiful, men having no goodness, and in the end the man still gets the better of the woman.Tess's baby dies, leaving her to start over at Talbothay's Dairy. Finding real love in Angel Care, he convinces Tess to marry him. She tries to tell him of her past only to have him refuse to hear her each time. After their wedding, Clare admits his previous sexual experience asking for forgiveness and receiving it. When Tess relates her story, he can no longer be with her, claiming that \\"forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another\\" (228) \\"the woman I have been loving is not you\\" (229). Men's double standards are shown. Clare leaves her for Brazil to decide if they could fix matters. During his long extended absence, Tess is reduced to farm labor. Her father dies and her family is evicted from their home. Her economic welfare falls again into Alec D'Urbervilles hands. His advantage persuades Tess to be his wife because her real husband was never coming back, according to D'Urberville.Clare came back to find his wife living with D'Urberville. Tess, in a moment of revelation, avenges the wrongs of D'Urberville by killing him. Clare and Tess have a few days of paradise together before she is taken away for D'Urbervilles murder. Tess understands that this is how it has to be. She will be able to die before Clare can despise her again. She dies a fulfilled woman, \\"'I am ready,' she said quietly\\" (396).Besides being a wonderful tale, Hardy's strength in writing merits the book to be an excellent read. Hardy achieves his goal of relating the story of an innocent girl whose life was simple before the villain D'Urberville comes into the story and nearly perfect after he is out of the story. Hardy portrayed his \\"Pure Woman\\" with brilliancy and faithfulness. Social class issues are displayed though Tess's country girl nature yet noble lineage. If her family had not been in economic problems, her tragic flaw would never have occurred. She could have lived as a farmer's wife and lived a simple life. The feminine stereotypes and generalizations are represented by the actions of others upon the poetic Tess.Hardy's background in poetry gives the novel a lyrical quality missing in the books of today's generation. Hardy alludes to several other works of art including Greek mythology, Shakespeare, fairy tales, and the Bible. He utilizes imagery as well. His uncanny imagery creates the entire world of Tess for the reader, down to the little window reflections upon a dress. The extremely detailed and well articulated descriptions can easily be seen in the readers mind. These literary elements are well used and fit the tale accordingly.Enjoyment would be received from Tess of the D'Urbervilles by those hopeless romantics who value depth to a story and appreciate the British setting. Gender roles and social class issues are blatantly raised with no subtly. Love story or social issue awareness, the beloved heroine, innocent, strong, loving, and pure will reach into one's heart and capture it forever in the world of fairy tales and happy endings."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Even though the length of this book is very long, it was one of the most compelling books I have read.

Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles, written by Thomas Hardy is a classic novel set in the countryside of England at the turn of the century . It reflects the lifestyle of the 19th century-- women didn't have many rights back then, men being superior in every aspect. Communication was not very fast and effective, increasing social and personal isolation.The main character, Tess, is a very credulous and naive daughter of a poor cottager. At the beginning of the book, the cottager learns that he is a descendent of Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles. The cottager instantly thinks of himself as a rich man because of the money his relatives have, and celebrates the great news by going to a bar to drink. When their dad doesn't come back from the bar, Tess and one of her many younger siblings go to get their dad from the bar with their family's horse, Prince. On their way to the bar Tess and her brother fall asleep and lead Prince to a near fence with sharp nails, causing Prince to stab himself on the chest with the nails and dies. Tess, feeling guilty, agrees to go to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles so that she can work to help the family. It turns out that the 'relatives' living there were just trying to build position for themselves and had bought the name\\"d'Ubervilles\\", a secret that no one knows until too late.While working at the D'Urberville Tess meets Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her endlessly until he gets what he wants. Tess goes back to her home village and learns she is pregnant, but soon loses the unwanted baby. Trying to make a new start, she goes to a farm where she makes a few friends and learns basic farm work. She falls in love with Angel, the son of a minister, who chose the peaceful farm life in hopes of running his own farm some day. It seemed like Angel did love Tess, but didn't want to really know her. Tess then gets into a self conflict where a part of her wants to tell Angel about her past, but the other part just hopes to keep it a secret. They get married, and that same night, Tess makes up her mind, thinking that Angel will accept her past if he really loves her because he had been in a similar situation before. But, unfortunately, Angel refuses to give her a chance and leaves to another country. This episode describes a traditional, but altogether hypocritical, male attitude towards females.The character development is realistic, Tess gets stronger and more mature as her life gets harder. At the beginning of the book, Tess was this a fragile and somewhat responsible girl who cried very easily and as the book ends, she shows her strong side where she can actually defend herself. In my opinion, she was a good daughter who cared about her family even though they used her as a source of money. Her parents, in contrast, are selfish, trying to earn money the easy way.As one reads this book, the impression emerges that Tess' love for Angel was greater than his love for her. Angel wasn't 'innocent' when he married Tess, yet he was disgusted by her past. If he hadn't left her, then she wouldn't have gone to Alec to help her family and she wouldn't have died a tragic death. Thus, this insensitive man was actually responsible for the tragedies of other innocent people. I believe that Tess' love for Angel was somehow 'greater' because even after Angel leaves her for months, she accepts him back and even kills someone to be with him. In this way, Hardy suggests that women are actually are actually more steadfast and strong in their love.Tess' death was unfair if we think in modern day terms. Alec had pursued her, ruining both her marriage and her entire life. The books describes how Alec and Tess get into a fight when Angel comes back for her. Tess killed Alec for both revenge and self defense, but British justice did not acknowledge that and executed her. Again, we have a criticism of social rules and practices which treated women unfairly.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a tragic novel which will make readers feel gloomy, sad and upset for quite a while. It is definitely not the best read for summer, or in that case any other time of the year if the reader seeks pleasing entertainment.It will, however, make readers think deeply just how different the whole system of justice and society operated in the past and how much has changed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I'm not going to write a long, flowery review.

Without a doubt, this is the most probing and moving novel I have ever read in my entire life. It hit areas of my heart and mind as no other book ever has, especially in terms of being a woman. It was never required reading in any area of my schooling, even college. Yet as a former administrator, grade advisor, and mentor in a private school, I now realize that many of the students were required to read this book, but I never thought of reading it to discuss it with them; what a mistake. Had I known, this book would have been an invaluable tool for bringing out the horrors of the double standard.Every man, woman and child alive should read this book to find out the true sentiments of a woman who is brutalized sexually and mentally and shunned, not only by the man in question, but by the community, her family, the clergy, and ultimately, the man who claims to love her. How she deals with a \\"shame\\" that has been thrust upon her is crushing, and brings to mind that even in this 21st century, the double standard has not changed one iota, not even in the biggest of cities, regardless of what we see and hear in books, films and music. Go into any neighborhood, in any town, and in any city, and we see that this still exists.

The short scene before her death at stonehedge just emphasises this woman's (how do you say) weakness? I can't describe how wonderful this book is.Tess of the Durbervilles is Thomas Hardy's equivalent towards The Ambassadores by Henry James. Both are flooded with metaphores.

His descriptions of social mores and customs, as well as class structure, and pastoral England are well worth the read. There are some classical writers whose work I slog through, and some whose work I parcel out slowly so my enjoyment lasts longer. Hardy would be in the latter of the two groups.

Life seems so unfair to her, but Hardy handles her masterfully; indeed it is safe to say Hardy loves her more than God does."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, unlike the description of the mixer included in a second user review, is a fantastic, if not incredibly difficult, book that is a must for any woman. It follows the story of a young girl who, in an attempt to help her struggling family, makes a series of mistakes that result in a loveless affair, an unfortunate pregnancy, the loss of a child, an estranged marriage, and ultimately murder. I was so caught up in the injustice of it all, that I scribbled responses to Hardy in the margin. In addition, the beautiful descriptions of 19th century farmlife in Britain are amazing. At times, this book seems hefty and longwinded, yet it is one of those rare gems that you suffer through only to find at the end that you are surprisingly satisfied."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"** Major plot points revealed ahead **Having thoroughly enjoyed _The Mayor of Casterbridge_ and _Jude the Obscure_, both of which featured strong central characters and real pathos, I was somewhat disappointed with _Tess of the D'Urbervilles_. The novel starts promisingly enough: early on, Tess Durbeyfield's family learns that it is descended from the noble and ancient D'Urberville clan. Tess's father is so elated at this news that he drinks himself into a stupor, requiring Tess to perform his delivery route early the next morning. Unused to the work, she gets into an accident, killing the family's only horse, and is sent to a nearby D'Urberville homestead--which the family thinks belongs to a rich relation--to beg a replacement.Alec D'Urberville, the owner of the mansion, is a wealthy bourgeois who purchased the D'Urberville surname. He hires \\"cousin\\" Tess as a farmhand and attempts to seduce her. Eventually, she gives in (some reviewers wrote that she was raped; Hardy never spells out the nature of their sexual relationship, but various clues led me to believe it was consensual). Tess becomes disgusted with this way of life and returns to her parents, soon realizing that she's pregnant. The child dies soon after birth, however, and Tess leaves home once again to find employment.She meets and marries Angel Clare, with whom she believes she is mutually madly in love, but to whom she cannot bring herself to reveal her past relationship. Finally she does so, at the worst possible time--their wedding night--and Angel, being one hell of a hypocrite (he had just \\"confessed\\" to her that he once spent two days with a hooker) rejects her. Brokenhearted, Tess goes back to work, falling deeper into poverty while mourning the loss of her husband's love. By sheer coincidence, she runs into Alec D'Urberville again, who expresses real remorse when he learns that she had had a child by him and had been disgraced, and offers to marry her and legitimize their relationship. Although Tess dislikes Alec and holds out as long as she can, hoping for Angel to return to her, she finally accepts Alec's offers of assistance and security and elopes with him--right before Angel arrives to reconcile with her. Upon seeing her husband for the first time in years, Tess spurns him, then runs upstairs and stabs Alec to death. At the end of the novel she reconciles with Angel, then is executed for Alec's murder.If the latter half of the plot sounds a little silly, it is. Tess is not a wrongdoer or a \\"bad woman,\\" but she is utterly spineless, submissive, and slavishly devoted to her husband--himself a weak hypocrite who abandons his now \\"impure\\" wife. If you're looking for a Victorian novel with a protofeminist heroine who defies public opinion and really belives women's role in society ought to be improved (as in the works of Burney, Wharton, or even James), you won't find it here. The real tragedy of _Tess_ is that she victimizes and punishes herself as much as the society that condemns her. Oddly, the most sympathetic character in the novel is the villain, Alec, who, having destroyed Tess's virtue, feels genuine remorse and tries, in good faith, to make it up to her. Tess is a creature of such gutlessness--time and time again, she finds herself unable to assertively communicate with those around her even when it's imperative that she do so--that it's impossible to imagine her stabbing this fellow; one of the major faults of this work is the implausibility of the characters' development.As always, Hardy pens lovely descriptions of his famed Wessex as well as of 19th century farm living; as a travelogue, this novel can't be beat. But the story lacks any real conflict: Tess is so despairing and accepting of her fate that we can't hope she'll ever move forward, and she doesn't. The inevitability of _Tess's_ conclusion is its tragedy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess is typical of Hardy heroines, pathetic/victim. She is good and beautiful, but gets raped, rejected, pilloried, and ultimately hanged. With no control or strength of character, she is as helpless as a wet noodle.

I wish he had a written a dozen more novels, even if only half as compelling as this title."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is truly one of Hardy's best books! The story is of a young girl (Tess) who's father finds out that he comes from the old great family of the D'Urbervilles. So the family sends Tess to one of their relations to ask for money but also Tess' mother knows that at the house where she is going to be staying there is a man named Alec and she hopes that Tess and he will marry. Alec is tempted by Tess and seduces her after she has been working at his house for a while. Tess has the baby which soon dies. Tess goes to a dairy farm where she meets Angel, a higher class well edgucated young man. These two fall in love and marry.

I love this story passionatly. It is so easy to identify with Tess, hate Alec and be ashamed of Angel. I only hate that Tess has to pay for her wrong doing as it is so hard to sympathize with Alec or to find anything redeaming in him. I love some of the passages in the book that show Tess's ideals, compassion, and proud nature, like when she takes sympathy on the injured quails by puting them out of their misery. It is odd but it shows part of Tess's selfless nature and endears her to the reader. The story also has much to say about hypocrisy with out being preachy. It is one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I love Thomas Hardy's characters because he allows them to be fallible, allows them to be unduly influenced by the rigid thinking of the time in which they live. They make bad decisions, and suffer for them, and we suffer along with them. How refreshing!This book is incredibly rich, and there would be much to discuss in a class or book group. I actually think one of the most interesting characters is Alec d'Urbervilles. He is utterly contemptible, of course, but he goes through such changes in the book that he's fascinating to watch. A great bad guy.Not surprisingly, Tess's and Angel's theme, the Double Standard one, shows up all over the place. I caught 3/4 of Sweet Charity on TV last night, remember that one with Shirley McClaine? Great dance numbers. She confesses her past in a fit of passion, and guess what happens? A scene certainly as heart-wrenching as the one in the crumbling d'Urbervilles mansion.If you love classics, what are you waiting for? It's worth it, as are Hardy's other novels. If you are new to this sort of thing, reading it for a course or a class, you have a treat in store. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel makes a heroine out of a simple girl. Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a nearly extinct noble line, leads a life of heavy responsibility where her impoverished family is concerned. At the behest of her parents, she seeks assistance from the D'Urbervilles who are, supposedly, relatives. This assistance yields disastrous results and Tess feels compelled to find work as a milkmaid where she meets Angel Clare, the son of an evangelical pastor, who is gathering experience in order to become a farmer.Hardy does a splendid job of illustrating Tess's strength as she goes from innocent girl to pure woman. Though she is not as educated as Angel, in terms of theory, her experience with Alec Stokes D'Urberville has given her a deeper knowledge of life and acceptance. Ironically, it is this experience which captivates and, predictably enough, repulses Angel.Hardy's narrative is a powerful one in this particular tale. It is clear that this is Tess's story and we, as readers, witness her painful journey. Through his subtle and understated use of irony, we come to realize the hypocrisy of Angel and wonder about the diabolical nature of Alec.What Hardy does emphasize in this novel is the unwavering hand of Justice which allows the novel to come to a bittersweet end and lets no one escape its strong, yet objective, sense of judgement."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbevilles, by Thomas Hardy, is a wonderful novel, which tragically and poignantly follows the ill-fated life of its heroine, Tess Durbeyfield. Through his exquisite use of imagery, his reflection of Tess in nature, and the continuing thread of tragedy which he weaves throughout the novel, Hardy is able to present to us one of the most memorable figures in English literature. Despite her sincerity and integrity, Tess is forever destined for disappointment, and Hardy's immensely lucid and descriptive writing allows the reader to appreciate this. I would recommend this tremendous piece of fiction to any readers interested in reading the work of a brilliant Victorian author, or for those who appreciate the paradox of sadness and beauty represented in the figure of a strong protagonist."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"In Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy employs nature as a tool in helping him depict and develop the tragic nature of his protagonist, Tess. At least two aspects of nature are central to achieving this end: First of all is the establishment of a correlation between Tess's mental state and natural settings. Second, the use of natural phenomena as a prediction of Tess's own fate. Hardy has fully exploited the use of nature to illustrate that Tess is the victim of her uncontrollable and predetermined Fate.Hardy establishes from the beginning the notion that the world is a mere &quot;psychological phenomenon&quot; (Hardy 101). One can, therefore, deduce from this &quot;fact&quot; that nature, as it is seen through Tess's eyes, is only the physical image of Tess's inner emotions during a particular period of time. It is during the intercepting period between her devastating seduction by Alec and her encounter with her future husband, Angel, that Tess feels most deje! cted. &quot;The only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it was then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary&quot; (Hardy 100). Indeed, Mother Nature is the only place where Tess can attain &quot;absolute mental liberty&quot; from all her worldly troubles (Hardy 100) and where she can find her peace of mind.After her seduction by Alec, Tess gathers her strengths, recollects herself, and starts a new life as a milkmaid in a quiet countryside at a farm called Talbothays. This is a deliberate attempt on Tess's part to avoid the possibility of the occurrence of another event on such a castatrophic scale. Now, working closely with nature (cows to be specific), she has succeeded in &quot;shunning mankind&quot; (Hardy 101), and truly believes that she is laying a new foundation for her future (Hardy 124). Surrounded by serene natural settings, this &quot;fresh and virginal daughter of Nature&quot; (Hardy 137) finds tranquillity in her surroundi! ngs despite the fact that she is in the midst of misery. In! Tess's eyes, nature is beautiful because it brings her joy-- and because it is where she belongs to.Angel comes from a very religious and educated family. Although he would never think of &quot;sacrificing&quot; humanity for religion (Hardy 284), he is in actuality a very convention-bound individual. The moral code and the &quot;arbitrary law of society&quot; (Hardy 297) that accompany religion are deeply rooted in Angel's thinking. His presence at Talbothays disturbs the natural settings with the social customs he brings into the village &quot;which had no foundation in nature&quot; (Hardy 297). Hardy introduces Angel into the novel in order to signal a transition in Tess's life. Unfortunately, it is a transition for the worse. From this point on, as Tess' and Angel's relationship grows, Tess's relationship with nature, which has come to symbolize all that is good for her, has declined in proportion. Tess has allowed her relationship with the society (Angel) to take prec! edence over that with nature (by falling in love with and marrying Angel).&quot;Nightfall, which in the frost of winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer, as a lover&quot; (Hardy 368). Angel's passion for Tess in the summer does not carry beyond its boundary. Tess's dream of a happy life is shattered into a thousand pieces when her worst nightmare comes true-- Angel is unable to accept her past. As Tess's mental state changes, so does her perception of nature. The beautiful scenery at her once cherished village of Talbothays is no more. &quot;The gold of the summer picture was now grey, the colours mean, the rich soil mud, and the river cold&quot; (Hardy 269). In the place which Tess had once thought of as a place of rebirth after her disastrous experience with Alec, she now sees only the dullness and helplessness of a dead winter. Tess's view of nature is purely perceptual. What should have been natural-- fallen leaves and bare tree branches-- have become depre! ssing and unpleasant. These natural phenomena are, in truth! , nothing more than physical manifestations of her sadden and broken heart. Nature has taken on a melancholy outlook not because it is indeed melancholy but because Tess is projecting feelings upon it. This is Hardy's so-called &quot;psychological phenomenon.&quot;Another important method besides relating Tess' feelings with natural phenomena is the use of imagery to mirror Tess's own fate. In two instances, long before the end of the novel, the stage for the final act of Tess's life has already been inauspiciously set up. In the first instance, Tess is symbolized by different animals being hunted down in a field :&quot;[U]naware of the ephemeral nature of their (the animals') refuge and of the doom that awaited them later in the day, when, their covert shrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled together... till the last few yards of upright wheat fell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every one put to death by the sticks! and stones of the harvesters&quot; (Hardy 103).Hardy speaks of &quot;doom that awaited them later in the day&quot;; Tess knows exactly what awaits her. &quot;She walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those shapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding or they might be approaching, one or the other, a little every day&quot; (Hardy 212). Tess, like these animals, is unable to defend herself from the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Tess's attempt to escape her fate in her &quot;refuge&quot; (Talbothays) proves to be futile. Without any question, Angel and Alec are the &quot;harvesters.&quot; Although they do not kill Tess in a physical sense, they must bear the responsibility of forcing her into the &quot;horrible narrowness.&quot; What is this &quot;horrible narrowness&quot;? It is the only option left for Tess to liberate herself once and for all from her past-- the killing of Alec (Hardy 406). Tess has done just that; and this is the fatal act t! hat destroy not only her past, but also her own ephemeral e! xistence.In the second instance, Hardy presents to the readers, in a graver tone, an even gloomier setting in which Tess is symbolized by pheasants-- also being hunted down: &quot;Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage dabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some staring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some stretched out-- all of them writhing in agony except the fortunate ones whose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to bear more&quot; (Hardy 296).One must admit that this scene best reflects and symbolizes the horrible experience Tess has gone through in the whole novel-- her struggle for survival, her indescribable agony, and finally, her &quot;luck&quot; that nature is unable to sustain her painful existence any longer. Hardy notes that the hunter of these birds has a &quot;blood-thirsty light in [his] eyes&quot; (Hardy 296). He is, however, civil and gentle for most! of the year-- except in autumn and winter (Hardy 296). This is where the change of seasons takes part in Hardy's shaping of a predetermined fate for Tess. Angel is &quot;civil and gentle&quot; to Tess during summer; but one also must also note that his rejection of her comes during winter. One can fairly say that Hardy leaves his readers no other choice but to convict Angel as the killer of Tess. He presents the end of Tess in his bloody account of the pheasants. In doing so, Hardy has revealed the unshakable destiny of his protagonist.Hardy is able to make use of his materialization of both the mental and fatalistic elements in the novel through his clever descriptions of nature to draw a portrait of a great tragic heroine. In the face of unbearable misery, only nature testifies to the sad story of this simple country girl. The speechless speaks for the inside of Tess. And the readers have been given a chance to realize that what will come is predetermined and inevitable.!Reference: Hardy, Thomas. Tess of the D'Urbervilles. New!

I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness.

Tess is a hunted animal, pursued by a cruel world and a society that can accept the evil of men, yet rebuke women for their mistakes.Tess (cause and effect):Because of her beauty she is pursued.

When Angel finally repents and sees how he is wrong, it is too late. Tess has already fallen back into sin with the man who caused her to fall many years before. Once she finds out Alec has deceived her, she not only despises him, she kills him. I just thought it was a good way to say that there are always consequences for our actions. I kept wishing the whole book that she had told Angel about her past before she married him. It would have spared them a lot of grief. I think he would have handled it better and hopefully been man enough to forgive her. It would have saved a lot of the grief that came later. What was really bad was how hypocritical Angel was when he confessed his own sin, she forgave him; yet when she confesses hers, he cast her out of his life.

Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles. If you liked the authenticity and poignancy of Tess but felt there must be another side of the story, please read Paul Faber."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later.

As her character developed she showed me what a fine line the Victorian woman lived --whether to profess her thoughts, will, love or to abide by society's wishes and be self-sacrificing and totally obedient to the man she loves. Without spoiling the ending, her last act was the crescendo of all of the small ways in which she held herself back. There were times that I pleaded with her to &quot;go to him&quot; or &quot;tell him&quot; but it would have been out of character for a woman of her day. Hardy kept us informed of the landscape, weather and all living things in Tess's environment, which I found breathtaking on many occasions. He painted the picture of his perfect woman. So perfect that he didn't want anyone to have her because he loved her himself. I enjoyed Tess very much."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"\\"I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naivet&eacute; is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare.

Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental!

Once I got into it though I really enjoyed the story. There was a real sense of sympathy for Tess, a real sense of hatred for Alec, and a sense of &#34;what?&#34; with Angel that could not be denied. As the story was reaching its climax I found myself racing to the finish. The ending will leave you angry, sad, infuriated...Tess's life was so manipulated and in the end torn apart by family. Great story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Hardy cleverly divides this novel into \\"phases\\", like those of the moon, and each has its own atmosphere within the greater plot. It's a novel about the destruction of innocence with two of the most complex male characters in fiction; Alec, who seems like the archetypal pantomime villain but never abandons Tess, and Angel, the bad harp player who appears to be a perfect lover but who turns out to be a hypocrite of the highest order. The famous Stonehenge scene at the end is almost poetry, which is the way Hardy was heading in his career.

Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"What is the point of reading classic literature if all you are going to do is analyse it? What a waste. Hardy, Austen et al would be turning in their graves if they knew that their work would be treated in this way by self-proclaimed experts. Classic novels are to be enjoyed; they are written for the satisfaction of all readers, not just to massage the egos of academics.Yes, I've studied classic literature, and it isn't the genre I am typically interested in. However, \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\" is the novel that has inspired me to give this genre another try. I found it to be incredibly moving; dismissing the idea that it was poorly written. I've found English literature too stifled by its own airs and graces, but this is not the case with Thomas Hardy. He paints a picture of great hope in a way that allows us to empathise (unlike some of his contemporaries) with the characters of a different era.I recommend anyone who wants to start reading classic English literature to begin with \\"Tess of the d'urbervilles\\". You will find it an easily accessible read. It is beautiful, hopeful and tragic."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"It seemed to me that Tess of the D'Urbervilles was a bit dull at times, but the storyline as a whole was quite interesting. There is a great deal of imagery, so much that I deemed it to be in the way of my actually getting absorbed in the novel. Surprises abound, but they are surrounded by lengthy passages describing everything and anything. Nature, being an important aspect of the novel, receives so much attention, and Hardy expounds upon it so meticulously, that it becomes an effort to read through everything. I was disappointed in the very beginning by this style of narration (actually, thinking of Hardy's other novels, it is very much like him), but by the end, I found it to be absorbing. The character of Tess is very memorable, and awe-inspiring. I recommend this if you have plenty of time to devote to a novel (not looking for a quick read), and if you like Hardy's style; if you do, you'll find this to be a very good read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A love story that has all of the makings of a made for TV movie.

It is a pastoral - the set-piece descriptions of nature (the play of light at differing times of the day, the verdant plenitude during Tess and Angel's courtship, the astonishing effect of bonfires at dusk etc.) are among the most overpoweringly vivid in literature, genuine word-painting - and an anti-pastoral, with even the natural world infected with poisonous, unnatural social conventions, with the growth of Talbothays petrified into the sterile limbo of Flintcomb-Ash.As in Shakespeare, there is a conflict in 'Tess' between the surface, linear plot, which tells a transient, austere tale of some people whose existence is short and ultimately barren, and the movement of the imagery, eternal, self-generating. The abundance of the latter makes the relentless grimness of the former just about tolerable (although the Flintcomb-Ash section is painfully unreadable) - as in Shakespeare, the burden of sexuality and emotion denied by society is placed on the natural world, on the language and the imagery, so the emotional deprivation in the plot starkly contrasts with its potent, lubricious surroundings.The plot is not 'realistic', but ritualised and patterned, set in heavily symbolic, paganistic sites, human nature stylised in pageants and tableaux. The climactic part, where Hardy twice startlingly changes narrative point-of-view, ushers in a new age of anti-Victorian fiction."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I was forced to read Tess for summer reading. I have possibly never been so glad to finish a book, not out of joy at a good reading experience but because the novel was such torture to wade through, in all its melodrama, sensationalistic elements, unlikable characters, and gaping holes in the plot, especially towards the end. Tess is a weakling who acts illogically, vacillates and secures the reader's complete disgust before the end. One should already know it from the title and the first few pages, where Tess's father, a peasant, finds out that he is the relic of an old noble family (his real name is Durbeyfield). Why cannot books have sense? All through the novel I longed to be reading Pride and Prejudice or Middlemarch. The time this book was written in has nothing to do with it; both the two books just mentioned were written considerably before it. I was left with a very poor impression of Thomas Hardy's talents as a writer. (Incidentally, it should tell you something that more than one reader/reviewer compared it to the movie Titanic.)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"A true joy to read, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is filled with situations that paint pictures of real life. Hardy knew that Tess' reality was filled with enough emotion and drama that there was no reason to add to it the things fairy tales are made of.When reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles you are brought into the story by Hardy's suberb way of sketching the scene. Though Hardy's descriptive writing can sometimes be hard to digest, his choice of words allow you to enter the landscape and smell the glen yourself.Overall, an excellent book for the more ambitious reader, and for the one who isn't afraid of the less popular unhappy outcomes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy is one of the best books I have read in the past five years. It combines love and tragedy wonderfully. The characters leave memories enbeaded inside your mine. Especailly, Tess and Angel. Their love for each other is magical. It truly is a wonderful love story. By saying this you have to have a thought-provoking mind to understand the different subject matter. That is why most people read the book because you have to think and it is a sad story. I personally had to read it for class, and what honestly surprised me is the cleverness Hardy portrays to make his heroine more real rather than just another character. The way that it starts off how Tess and Angel don't seem like they are going to get together and how they eventually do. When they finally get together Tess has a confession to make to Angel. In the book we find out that Tess may have been raped or seduced by Alec. We are not sure but Angel leaves Tess because either way she isn't pure anymore. This is so hypocritical of Angel because Tess forgave him for having an affair with an older woman in London but he doesn't forgive Tess. So basically he's a jerk to be blunt with it. Eventually Angel forgives his wife, Tess and they leave Brazil. Tess goes back to Alec and murders him, so she can be with Angel without any worries. Due to this they hid away but get caught and the tragic ending comes. Tess is exacuted for what she has done.I like how the plot is not really &quot;realistic&quot; but follows a designed pattern, using heavy symbolic means. Hardy writes the book to leave an effect of you. You feel Tess's agony and confusion. You want to help her and wish you could show her the right path to take. I found myself talking to her when I read the book so she can do the right thing. That shows how Hardy gets you really involved. Difficult or not, if you like to read, I strongly recommend reading Tess of the D'Urbervilles. It is deservinly allowed to be called a classic. Hats off to Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a master craftsman. With the help of words that fit the sentences like a key into a lock, Hardy ensnares his readers like a spider traps a fly. Such is the power of Hardy's prose.\\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles: A Pure Woman\\", was published in 1891. It was one of the last -- and arguably the best -- novels from Hardy's pen. It's the story of Tess, a country girl in a fictitious English county,Wessex, and her tragic struggle against destiny. As somebody has already mentioned, Hardy has chosen the backdrops of the story with the same care with which he describes people: valleys and moors are also portrayed as if they too are characters of the novel. The Vale of Blackmoor, Tess's birthplace, is described as \\"an engirdled and secluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or landscape painter\\", and \\"in which the fields are never brown and the springs never dry\\". The Flintocomb-Ash, the place where Tess was subjected to some very rough manual work, is painted as \\"a complexion without features, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of skin\\". And the place where Tess fell in love, the Vale of Froom, is \\"that happy green tract of land where summer had been liberal in her gifts.\\"There are several tearjerkers in the novel but I found one moment particularly touching where Tess decides to baptize her illegitimate baby herself. And when the baby -- named Sorrow -- dies, Hardy becomes a little bitter: \\"Poor Sorrow's campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed to be of little brilliancy - luckily perhaps for himself, considering his beginning\\".To put forth the case of an unwed mother so passionately in &quot;Tess of the d'Urbervilles&quot; was something of a stir in the English society of late nineteenth century, which was so obsessed with feminine virginity.

A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a novel remarkable only in its quality to inspire hatred from those unfortunates forced to read it. Melodramatic and unrealistic, it meanders interminably exploring the theme of a &quot;pure woman&quot; before finally finishing with an ending that has little impact on the disgusted reader.Tess is, in short, a useless book. Apart from keeping a healthy fire roaring in my hearth, Tess contains little of merit. Well, I suppose one could improve one's vocabulary by reading Tess (fun, but completely useless words like &quot;prestidigitation&quot; abound), but reading &quot;How to improve your verbal scores on the SAT&quot; is inarguably more concise and probably more entertaining.Not to say that there is nothing to be learned from the characters. Simply observe their actions in certain situations and do the opposite. The three main characters, particularly Tess, are just begging to have a little common sense smacked into them. However, Tess can be considered enigmatic in one respect. Hardy seems to be unable to decide whether she is just ordinarily pretty, or 'a dazzling fair milkmaid' so it is up to the reader, should he still be awake, to decide. At any rate, her big, multi-colored eyes and Pre-Raphaelite hair and figure hide a complete vapidity painfully evident to the modern reader. She only develops a spine near the end of the novel, when such a change is unconvincing and thoroughly out of character.So...a predictable and heavily padded plot, infuriating characters, too much symbolism, inappropriate philosophical discussions and a great dollop of Victorian fluff.

Tess Durbeyville is a poor girl in rural Wessex. Her father is a drunk with a weak heart. Her mother is childish and her parental skills are sadly lacking. Tess is the leader of the family. Her father learns their family descends from the aristocratic but decadent D'urberville clan who came to Britain with William the Conqueror. Tess visits a nouveau riche branch of the family. She is quickly seduced, drugged and becomes pregant by the evil Alec D'urberville.Tess returns to her family in disgrace. She baptizes the illegitimate child Sorrow who dies soon after birth. Tess travels to a a dairy owned by the Cricks. Here she meets Angel Clare the nonbelieving son of a ruralclergyman. Complications and irony ensue as in all Hardy's well plotted novels. Angel is a weak man who is a fallen angel on what Hardy calls this blighted star (earth). I did not care for him or his pious family!The culmination of the novel comes when Tess murders Alec; flees with Angel; is captured at Stonehenge and is hanged for murder. These are the plot developments but Tess is so much more.The book is a poetic prose masterpiece. Hardy the countryman provides rich evocations of the English countryside yielding its pristine beauty to the coming industrial age. Reapers and trains are intrusions into old Wessex's slow progress of the bucolic season. Throughout the novel I appreciated Hardy's hatred of killing animals and birds such as the poignant incident of the dying pheasants in a field following a wantonhunting expedition by humans. Tess too is hunted, hounded and caged like a bird entraped by her dire circumstances.Hardy fell in love with the fictional Tess. Who is she? She is woman!An earth mother; sacrificial victim; a panther; a temptress; an innocent country girl; a pagan goddess sprung from the soil of England; a mysteriious presence who is often pictured in the fog and mists. Tess dreams as does a fairy tale princess. Tess is a woman of strong passions inherited from the D'urberville family who kills and loves, laughs and sings, cries and rejoices in the complicated and tragic life she is given.The prudery of Victorian England disdained Tess causing Hardy much pain. He often had to change the text of the novel to assuage the prim souls of his editors. And yet Tess lives in the minds of the reader as the acme of his creation of memorable female characters. One can never really understand the multifaceted Tess; we can simply spend time with this fascinating witch and madonna. Tess will live forever in the minds of all of us who consider Hardy a genius."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"Tess's father, Mr. Durbeyfield, is told by a minister that his family is the direct lineage of an old, noble family that was once thought to be completely gone. There's nothing left of the family's land and fortune, except the family name (d'Urberville).However, Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife see this as a chance to move up on the social ladder. They devise a plan to send their daughter to become acquainted with a rich woman who's last name is d'Urberville. From then on, Tess is left to try to maintain her dignity and honor and to pick up the pieces of her broken life that resulted from her parents' need to be important.This is my first time reading anything by Thomas Hardy. I was warned that he was cynical man, and I'll agree that Hardy's prose is cynical, yet heartrending. I couldn't help feeling bad for Tess through all her troubles. This is not a happy novel. For a moment, you think that things will get better for Tess, but the fates seem to be against her.The landscape of the novel changes with the mood of what's happening. The land itself almost seems to be a living person that he described.He uses vivid, beautifully described imagery to describe people and places in his novels. There are themes of theology (Hardy had internal conflicts with believing in God), virtue, the boundaries of love. He employs everything from Greek mythology to modern (or what was modern in his day) poetry.There are no illusions of a happily-ever-after in this story. This was simply a beautiful novel, a novel that portrays its female heroine as the strong woman she was. She could put more modern women heroines to shame."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles (New Wessex editions)","review":"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},j={key:1};function E(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",R,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",j,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const L=d(C,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-4187fa64"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/24.md","filePath":"guide/24.md"}'),M={name:"guide/24.md"},O=Object.assign(M,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(L)]))}});export{F as __pageData,O as default};
