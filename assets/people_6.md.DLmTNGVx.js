He has learned several methods of those who are creative, and these are helpful anyone wanting to be creative or help someone else like a child become creative.He does a good job debunking some of the myths that associate creativity with mental illness by showing several cases of mentally ill creators. He shows that their creative times did not coincide with the severe bouts of mental illness.He profiles a few artists, Sylvia Plath, Emily Dickinson, Eugene O'Neil, and JOhn Cheever among others. It is interesting to read how these successful people dealt effectively or ineffectively with mental illness.The author offers his conclusions about creativity and its association with mental illness. Whether they are ultimately conclusive, the reader can decide. He is a thorough researcher and writer, so this is a book worth reading if you are interested in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Creativity and Madness: New Findings and Old Stereotypes","review":"Rothenberg's 1994 book claims to have supposedly &quot;debunked&quot; the &quot;myth&quot; between creativity and madness based on his &quot;new findings and old stereotypes&quot; that many geniuses such as aristotle have proclaimed a link between the two for thousands of years. He states that previous studies linking bipolar disorder to creativity were biased and a link to schizophrenia is nonexistent. He bases this on sketchy evidence with nobel laureates where there responses to a creativity test called a word association test had a slightly different response style then psychotics. He then comes to the narrow conclusion that creativity is mostly based on juxtaposition and homospatial thinking which he contends is the part of the test that nobel laureates have scored high in and psychotics didn't based on the results of his word association test.However, since then a rigourous longitudinal study has come out in a book called &quot;The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy&quot; found that Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia like psychosis, and other disorders are Much more prevalent among creatively eminent people then they are found in the general population. Studies by Hans Eysenck and others have also shown that psychopathology (or personality traits that predispose to psychosis) is much higher in creative people then in non-creative people in the general population. Also relatives of people with mental disorders are on average more creative then in the general population. To top it all off a study done by Peter Jordanson and colleagues has found one of the biological basis to creativity, which is that creative people score low on measures of latent inhibition which measure one's openness to novel stimuli or new possibilities. People with mental illness, particularly Schizophrenics, also score low on latent inhibition showing they have a trait that is essential for creativity, and that creative achievers also have. Of course Rothenberg obviously wasn't open to this possibility (which has now been scientifically proven), when he wrote this book. While at the same time other creativity researchers were (go figure). While Rothenberg's theory does have some truth in it such as obvious facts that creative achievement and insanity aren't the same thing and in fact that insanity in itself can be destructive to creative achievement; or that not all mentally ill people necessarily become eminent creative achievers. His main premise of the book that there is no link between creativity and madness has been proven false and it is clear that he was probably the one who was biased against any association between creativity and madness to begin with.Then again psychiatrists, which are in the same profession as Rothenberg, often note that there is some truth in every delusion. Which I suppose means that even though &quot;new findings and old stereotypes&quot; has disproven Rothenberg's &quot;delusion&quot; (or false belief) of their not being any link between creativity and madness, his &quot;delusional theory&quot; should not be thought of as not being true at all. As he does make some (although mostly obvious) points about the subject in his book."},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"Imagine beetles ejecting defensive sprays as hot as boiling water; female moths holding their mates for ransom; caterpillars disguising themselves as flowers by fastening petals to their bodies; termites emitting a viscous glue to rally fellow soldiers--and you will have entered an insect world once beyond imagining, a world observed and described down to its tiniest astonishing detail by Thomas Eisner. The story of a lifetime of such minute explorations, For Love of Insects celebrates the small creatures that have emerged triumphant on the planet, the beneficiaries of extraordinary evolutionary inventiveness and unparalleled reproductive capacity.To understand the success of insects is to appreciate our own shortcomings, Eisner tells us, but never has a reckoning been such a pleasure. Recounting exploits and discoveries in his lab at Cornell and in the field in Uruguay, Australia, Panama, Europe, and North America, Eisner time and again demonstrates how inquiry into the survival strategies of an insect leads to clarifications beyond the expected; insects are revealed as masters of achievement, forms of life worthy of study and respect from even the most recalcitrant entomophobe. Filled with descriptions of his ingenious experiments and illustrated with photographs unmatched for their combination of scientific content and delicate beauty, Eisner's book makes readers participants in the grand adventure of discovery on a scale infinitesimally small, and infinitely surprising.NOT ALL WORDS.

WilsonAlthough insects are not usually the stars of popular-science writing, this engaging look at how one scientist studies their lives may add them to the most-requested lists of science- and animal-loving readers.--Nancy Bent, BooklistFor Love of Insects is especially valuable because it explains the steps missing from the research reports in Nature and Science: [Eisner] tells the story from first noticing a bug on a walk in the woods, through experiments and analytical chemistry, to a final understanding of each phenomenon...For Love of Insects is a fascinating introduction to a world we poor humans--barely able to detect most chemicals--seldom notice.--Jonathan Beard, New Scientist [UK][Eisner's] new book is a personal memoir of a lifetime in science, engagingly written and stunningly illustrated with photographs of insects doing astonishing things...What makes Eisner a world-class entomologist is not access to million-dollar scientific instruments, but a mind that never stops asking 'Why?'--Chet Raymo, Boston GlobeThis is one of the best nature titles in the last several years.--Kim Long, Bloomsbury Review[P]repare to be amazed. Brimming with enthusiasm, Eisner reveals a world of unbelievable majesty and complexity in the simplest of insects. The photographs alone are worth the price of the book, but the text crackles with the electricity of a brilliant genius at work, as Eisner leads the reader from simple observation to major scientific breakthrough. In fact this book should be required reading for every biology student because it illuminates the basic principle that passion and curiosity are the twin pillars of all great science.--David Lukas, Los Angeles TimesThe world has eagerly awaited these enchanting tales of insect life, brimming with discovery, insight, and wry humor. They're a master entomologist's masterwork. The photographs are also extraordinary, both illuminating and exquisitely beautiful.--Diane Ackerman, Cornell UniversityI don't know whether I like the text or the photographs of For Love of Insects better. The former is brilliant, the product of the dean of chemical ecology and a world-renowned expert on insects. The latter are spectacular, the work of an outstanding photographer -- once again Tom Eisner. No naturalist or natural scientist will want to be without this book. Indeed, if everyone would take the time to read it and look at the amazing pictures our society would benefit greatly from an enhanced appreciation of the insect world.--Paul Ehrlich, President, Center for Conservation Biology, Stanford UniversityLove of insects? Hell, that's barely the half of it! Better Tom Eisner had called this book Love of Life and the Lively of progeny and all provenance! With boundless verve and grace and marvel and delight, Tom Eisner proves himself, across these dazzling pages, to be one of the all-time great biophiliacs. Ah, the blessing, for the rest of us, to be alive alongside him!--Lawrence Weschler, Director of the New York Institute for the Humanities and author of Mr. Wilson's Cabinet of WonderThere are few books which present the fullness of a life in science as powerfully, as modestly, and as enchantingly as this one. The excitement of Tom Eisner's fundamental investigations are mingled with vivid descriptions of his many other loves and enthusiasms--for music and literature no less than for the natural world--in seamless and beautiful prose. For Love of Insects is not only a delight to read, but, with its amazing photographs, a visual feast, too.--Oliver Sachs, author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat"},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"VERY interesting to read, does not condescend but at the same time does not leave the layperson baffled. Well done. Enthusiastically written and modular--if you skip chapters no impact.HIGHLY recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in scientific method, insects, and biological sciences."},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"First thing you do when you get a new entomology book is thumb through the pictures. And you will enjoy the pictures in this book.But while many books have little to offer after the pictures, Eisner gives you lively, first hand narratives on how he discovered many secrets to the private lives of insects.One of the first little mysteries Eisner discusses is how he developed his nose for benzoquinone detection at an early age and how he put it to good use in discovering how species of cockroaches use them for defense.There are many such stories in this book that will be a delight to people who like to study insects."},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in nature, whether they are the highly-trained professional biologist, the aspiring naturalist, or even the person who likes to watch what goes on in their back yard. Eisner's book unlocks some of the best kept secrets of the insect world, and it does so in a way that is easy to understand and highly enjoyable to read. I previously had no interest in studying insects (my professional interest generally include vertebrates), but this book has helped me to gain an appreciation for them. I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"For those people lucky enough to meet Dr. Eisner, they will know that he is a very intelligent, very humble man. Dr. Eisner has devoted his life to studying insects, and his passion comes across in his words and his photographs. It is difficult to get this man to speak about his accomplishments, and this book gives the reader a wonderful opportunity to get to know one of the greatest biologists of this century, and learn why he has earned that title.The photographs are exquisite and they alone are worth buying the book. The stories are fascinating tales that seem like they should be science fiction, yet they are science fact. An enlightening book for those that fear &quot;creepy crawlies&quot; as to why these creatures deserve respect, even if they are still worth fearing."},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"Thomas Eisner is J. G. Schurman Professor of Chemical Ecology at Cornell University and his life long fascination of the insect world has blessed us with an extraordinary, in-depth knowledge of bugs and their awesome capabilities, esp., in chemical defenses which have led to the discovery of many helpful medicines, etc.Eisner's many beautiful color photos and micro-photography turn this book into a coffee-table txt book on insect ecology and this is worth the price of admission on just that aspect alone.The famous sociobiologist/entomologist, friend and research collaborator of Eisner, E. O. Wilson, \\"Diversity of Life\\", et al., wrote the Foreword to this book and gives a good summation on the focus of this book: \\"The many behaviors he [Eisner] has discovered and explained, and their implementation by life around us, amazing in a variety and precision, are the worthy focus of this book.\\" Well put.After the Foreword is a great quote about insects in general: \\"What makes things baffling is their degree of complexity, not their sheer size... a star is simpler than an insect.\\" From: [Martin Rees, \\"Exploring Our Universe and Others,\\" Scientific American, December 1999]In the Prologue, Eisner has given a great appraisal of the insect world in: \\"They have succeeded in one major respect where humans have failed. They are practitioners of sustainable development. Although they are the primary consumers of plants, they do not merely exploit plants. They also pollinate them, thereby providing a secure future, both for themselves and for their plant partners.\\" Indeed, symbiosis, harmony......And, Eisner on his hopes for this fine book: \\"If this book contributes in any way toward bolstering the preservationist spirit, as I hope it might, it will have fulfilled it's purpose.\\"It has certainly \\"edified\\" my preservationist spirit and will no doubt do the same for others!"},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"Once, we were warned: \\"Don't fool with Mother Nature\\". It's our good fortune that Thomas Eisner ignores that counsel. Not only does he disdain it, he turns it on its head. He probes, he directs, he examines and he dissects. When he's done, he sits down to convey to us what he's found. Between what he's learned and how he explains it to us, we are the richer for his refuting the old admonition. Mother Nature, while exposed in this book, is hardly violated. Instead, she parades her wonders before us, dazzling us with the powers of her miniscule offspring. In a book about little beasts, Eisner has triumphed in adding a new dimension to the world we inhabit.Eisner was one of those lucky children whose parents didn't rein him in. As refugees, they settled in Uruguay where young Thomas was able to wander in fields and jungles. He developed an affinity for insects, particularly beetles. Haldane's quip, \\"an inordinant fondness for beetles\\" is entirely apt. Early in his academic career in the US, he and E.O. Wilson made a \\"bug collecting tour\\" around the \\"Lower 48\\". Who better to partner with in such a quest? From those early explorations, Eisner has been often in the field, observing, collecting, testing. Although many of the insects resented his presence, they continued to perform for him.The performance is a symphony of chemicals. Many insects display riotous colour schemes. This would seem suicidal in a world where birds, unlike mammal predators, have good chromatic vision. Yet most of the insect clowns pass through life unmolested. Eisner explains that many insects are walking chem labs. Various chemicals reside in glands - chemicals that send birds tumbling, toads vigorously spitting out prey, or sending other insects packing. These chemicals may be oozed from small pores, issue as droplets or, in the more explosive cases, shot with inerring accuracy at a tormentor. If you pinch one on a particular spot, the beetle will deluge your fingers with a burning liquid. Darwin learned the power of these chemicals in while collecting. Innocently putting one in his mouth while trying to collect a new specimen, he spat it out instantly, losing the lot.These compounds are not just something that tastes or smell bad. In some cases they are virulent toxins. Cyanide isn't something you'd carry around in your pocket, but the XXX beetle knows how to send a spray of it from its body. Others disperse steroids that can be heart-stoppers. And the heart stopped could be yours. Usually, however, the victims are inattentive predators or innovative ones. Today's travel levels and the trade in pet species from distant lands, bring together creatures unadapted to one another. Pet lizards fed on local insects have no idea of their lethal capabilities. Today's $50 pet may be stretched out in its cage only moments after ingesting something as common as a \\"firefly\\".Eisner's coverage of insect novelty is immensely knowledgeable. He explains what he observed, what experiments he tried with his creatures and the results, and what it all means in evolutionary terms and for life in general. It's an immense project, yet his personalised account keeps you wondering what will come next. He's an evocative writer on what might be an arcane subject. His enthusiasm is infective and it's aided by the stunning photographs that visualise the text. Whatever you may have thought about insects before reading this, you will come away with a whole new outlook. Just remember to be cautious about putting one in your mouth.

Ear mark this author and this press."},{"Title":"For Love of Insects","review":"Anyone paging through this charming book will be captivated by the stellar quality of the photos and by what they show: the essence of discovery. In my case, as a field biologist, they range from fascinating closeups of a group of animals about which I know least, to visual demonstrations of the truth of Eisner's lifelong findings. And what stays with you after reading his often humorous (always engaging and yet self-effacing) accounts of genuine discovery, are those very discoveries: the findings. I can recall, as a grad student in the 1960's, receiving \\"Science\\" from my mailbox, and hearing friends call out: \\"Eisner's got another one\\". We would then flip through the magazine to the richly illustrated article and devour it with our eyes and curiosity. His reports were thrilling - that anyone could take the mystery of nature and repeatedly send us monthly supplements of such an array of utterly-convincing revelations of evolution's torturous path!

His enthusiasm for the tiny subjects of his explorations (mainly insects and other arthropods) is contagious. The interweaving stories and references to friends and colleagues provide so much context and plot that sometimes it feels more like a novel or an autobiography than a non-fiction/reference text.If, like me, you are interested in insects, this book will delight and enlighten you. If you are a professional entomologist, you might still be surprised by some of the facts in here and will certainly enjoy the change in tone from research papers; you may even find inspiration for new lines of research.

In this book he describes how he and his collaborators view the world of insects with the observant and questioning minds of naturalists and scientists and how they concocted experiments to uncover the purpose of smells, secretions, characteristics, and behaviors of bugs. His enthusiasm comes through in his writing and kept me hooked, reading eagerly to find out what the next discovery would be.Eisner has added a new dimension to my view of nature.

Eisner reminds me a bit of Charles Darwin, another scientist whose humanity shines through in even his technical works.

Of course there's a good reason she's done the novelizations for every movie since Star Trek V &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; and the novelization for Star Trek Deep Space Nine's premier episode &quot;Emissary,&quot; she's extraordinarily good at it and this one is no exception!When a reader picks up the novelization for an episode or a movie, they're looking for a couple of things; some personalization to what the characters are thinking during the scenes and some good &quot;between the scenes&quot; scenes and in every novelization of J.M. Dillard's I've read so far, she accomplishes that with ease. Her writing style is very fluid and the pacing is very good, producing a very engaging story that enhances what was seen on the silver screen or the home television screen.Credit also goes to Rick Berman, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga for the original story and screenplay for Star Trek &quot;Generations&quot; which, in my opinion, has been a rather unjustly maligned movie over the years. The overall story is a good one, that is well grounded in what Star Trek is all about and I believe Gene Roddenberry would've been very proud of this movie!Also included in the hardback version are some great color photos taken directly from the film. The paperback version has the same photos but they're black &amp; white. Both versions have the &quot;Behind the Scenes of Star Trek Generations&quot; A Special Report by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens which is a great little read entailing some of what it took to make the movie.The cover art for &quot;Generations&quot; is, of course, directly from the movie posters and is very nice and much better than what was the standard fare for cover art at the time of this novels release!The premise:The novel opens up with an extremely poignant scene between Captain James T. Kirk and Spock, set one year prior to the launch of the third ship named Enterprise. The novel then follows up with an exceptional scene with Kirk plunging towards the Earth during an orbital skydive that was planned to have been in the movie but time constraints eliminated it.In what many thought to be described as a dignified way of ending future possibilities for screen time for Captain James T. Kirk, the next scene in the novel and first, opening scene of the movie shows him saving the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-B and &quot;dying,&quot; while doing so.Seventy eight years later we're taken to the holodeck of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701-D and Lieutenant Worf's rather interesting promotion ceremony to Lieutenant Commander.What follows from there is a novel that is extraordinarily well written that serves beautifully to enhance what was seen on the silver screen. I highly recommend this novel, whether you can pick it up in hardback or paperback! {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"This audio-book is great entertainment and is read wonderfully by John DeLancie. What makes it better than the film is that it has additional scenes that deepen the story.

Another scene takes place a year after Kirk is lost and presumed killed by the Nexus. It includes Bones and Spock at a memorial service for Kirk.

Dillard's third novelization of a Star Trek feature film, is a well-written and exciting tale of two legendary Starfleet captains brought together across the time barrier to save a world from the plans of an obsessive scientist.Dillard (The Lost Years, Mindshadow) adds texture and context to Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore's screenplay for the seventh Star Trek film (and first of four Star Trek: The Next Generation movies) by starting the book right after the events of The Undiscovered Country: Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Original Series' crew splits up -- some retiring from Starfleet, while others accept other assignments. While this wasn't in the original screenplay or in the final film, this bit of exposition sets up a recurring reverie about time, transitions and even death.Star Trek Generations really gets going in Chapter 2, when Kirk, Chekov and Scotty are the guests of honor at the launching ceremony of the NCC-1701-B, an Excelsior-class ship which is the third starship to bear the name Enterprise. With an untried captain and with vital equipment not yet installed, a brief publicity cruise to Pluto and back to Earth turns into a perilous rescue mission when a strange energy ribbon ensnares two El-Aurian refugee ships. Kirk, Scotty and Chekov assist Capt. John Harriman on this life-and-death endeavor, and some of the El-Aurians (including future Enterprise-D bartender Guinan and Dr. Tolian Soran) are rescued...but not without cost. The Enterprise-B is damaged by the energy ribbon, and Capt. James T. Kirk is missing and presumed dead.After another chapter of original material in which Dillard shows the reaction of Kirk's senior staff to his death, the rest of the novel takes place 78 years later. The Enterprise-D crew is celebrating Worf's promotion to lieutenant commander in the holodeck, but the festivities are cut short when Capt. Jean Luc Picard receives devastating news from home. And to make matters worse, someone has savagely attacked the Amargosa Observatory, leaving only one survivor, Dr. Tolian Soran....the same man rescued from the energy ribbon nearly 80 years before by the Enterprise-B.Soon, Picard has to overcome his grief to stop Soran from destroying a star (and its orbiting inhabited planets) to cause the mysterious energy ribbon -- known as the Nexus -- to change course. Picard must discover why Soran wants to sacrifice billions of innocent lives in order to \\"go into the Nexus\\" -- and he'll need the help of a legendary Starfleet captain from the past to stop the obsessed madman.....To her credit, Dillard explains Soran's motivations far better than the movie did, and her depictions of the movie's characters are vivid and well-done. Of course, some of her additional material was needed to make up for the non-appearance of Spock and McCoy in the final drafts of Braga and Moore's screenplay (and the final film), and one scene with Kirk -- which was filmed -- was later changed, but those minor detours are to be expected in novelizations such as this."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"A novelization of a movie usually expands the readers perspective of the original film. This novel also adds a behind the scenes look at the making of the movie.Much more compact and readable than some of the other Star Trek hardcover novels, Generations is worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"This was a pretty enjoyable book. Judged against other Star Trek novels it is not the best but is far from the worst. It won't really give you more than the movie does. I enjoyed it about as much as the movie but in different ways. Instead of being impressed by visual effects i was intrigued by the thoughts of the crew. Two blunders: on page 97 Data is described as &quot;near breathless&quot;--well Data doesn't breathe. And on page 157 describing B'Etor's attraction to Soran the author writes &quot;...despite the fact that he was a puny human...&quot; but he isn't he is El Aurian. But I can live with those mistakes."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"Any one who can provide me with these books, deserves 5 stars. I never knew this one came in hardback till I searched. I love hardback books and gave the paperback to my niece's boyfriend, helping him build up his collection. When it comes to ST fans, they are more than eager wanting to know where to collect anything dealing with ST."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"OK I know I'm a fanboy, but when Kirk is killed in the book they mention the time he was on the ghost ship \\"Reliant\\". Reliant was the ship Chekov served on that was commandeered by Khan. The ghost ship was USS Defiant. You would think someone would have caught this. Kinda ruins the atmosphere for me."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"I like this book because it points out things they should have done with the dvd. There's expanded scene's, added scene's and at least in the hardcover version, there is a picture at the beginning that is not in the movie. Probably from Kirk's refusal to join them on the Enterprise-B. They could have some deleted scene's coming in a future DVD."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"Oh, PUH-leeze. What a way for a publisher to get money. Make an abridged audio adaptation of a written novilization of a movie? 3 products, same thing (more or less). Don't spend your money on this. Go buy the book novilization. It's written well, and if it's the collector's edition, it has pictures from the movie."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"The story and movie are one of the strongest in the Star Trek series. There is a very powerful villain, dire consequences to his actions and Kirk, Checkov and Scotty appear in dramatic yet somewhat comical roles. We also see a vulnerable side of James Kirk, where he regrets the focus on his career to the detriment of his personal life. Kirk saves the Enterprise twice, costing him his life both times and in the second, he is teamed with Jean-Luc Picard in a fight to the death with a brilliant madman. For these reasons, the story is interesting.However, I found the dramatic reading by John De Lancie to be a bit disappointing. His work as the pixie like Q in the Next Generation series shows his capacity to be dramatic, and yet on the tape he sounds flat. There are points where a great deal more emphasis should have been placed on his words, and yet it just wasn&#65533;t there. Nevertheless, it is still a tape worth listening too, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Star Trek: Generations","review":"great CD but Jerry Goldsmith shouldve composed it"},{"Title":"The Festive State: Race, Ethnicity, and Nationalism as Cultural Performance","review":"This study looks at three distinct Venezuelan festivals: the Afro-Venezuelan celebration of San Juan, the neo-Indian \\"Day of the Monkey,\\" and the mestizo ritual of Tamunague. The study also highlights the policies of a multinational British tobacco company and analyzes that company's role in promoting folk culture and community celebrations in Venezuela. While Venezuela is the main focus, many of Guss's findings are relevant to the study of festivals worldwide. This book represents a groundbreaking experiment in multi-site ethnography. The author's detailed and engaging descriptions will be of great interest to anthropologists, folklorists, and Latin Americanists...."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I, like a few others, was a little underwhelmed with &quot;Faking It.&quot; Nevertheless, I decided to give &quot;Bet Me&quot; a try. I liked the two primary characters and their quick repartee and the building &quot;tension&quot; between the two. The early description of the cat had me chuckling and awakened my dog out of her sweet slumber. I finished the book last night and thought to myself, &quot;that was a sweet story&quot; maybe because I too, am in search of my own fairy tale. That's by two cents worth."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I got this book because I read Jennifer Crusie's novel \\"Faking It\\", which I found to be quite excellent. I was hoping this one would be as good, but this is more on par with the other popular female writers (which I thought Crusie had surpassed with Faking It). The story is completely and utterly predictable, even though it's completely unrealistic. The characters of Cynthie and David are absolutely insane, while Cal and Min are pretty predictable. I did enjoy the inital dialogue between Cal and Min, especially when she was giving him a hard time. But the story very quickly devolved. I found the ending to be completely contrived and just over the top, in a bad-sitcom sort of way. Crusie, you can do so much better than this!That said, Crusie is still a good writer, and the book was enjoyable. I highly recommend her novels Faking It and Welcome To Temptation."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I like this Jennifer Crusie book. Her main characters weren't perfect and yet still found their prince charmings. I felt that she did a good job connecting Min's weight issues to the insecurities in all of us. I was sick of Chicken Marsala by the end of the book. I agree with other write-ups that this book was not her very best. From the inside cover, I got the feeling that it wasn't Ms. Crusie's favorite either. Even still, she never dissappoints me. She is an outstanding writer."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Generally speaking, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Crusie's books. That being said, I was a bit disappointed in her latest work. While the references to Krispy Kreme doughnuts were funny (to a point), it seems as though Min would have straightened her mother out a long time ago regarding her food choices and her weight. I also agree with some of the other reviews that this isn't Crusie's best ensemble character development.Fun to read, but not as much fun as it could have been. Let's hope she goes back to her previous self in future novels."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Are they kidding? A bestseller? I don't get it.The dialog made it almost tedious to read this book. The characters seemed to have the same conversations over and over (just in different scenes). I got a little bored and frustrated about half-way through, ready for the characters to get together already, realizing that there were, like, another 200 pages of the same lame thing. But I had to forge ahead and finish to see if there was some moment of greatness so the book could redeem itself. It did not.It's not a bad book, and it kept me entertained for a few days at the beach, but I can't see it as anything more."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Cruisie is a fantastic writer - her writing is fresh, not cliched and clever - when hy did I have to drag myself through this book one painful page after another? I've decided it's because I'm way to old to be reading this genre - for those who love chick lit with cute repartee, you'll love it! She's a fantastic writer - just not for someone like me who loves gritty angst-filled stories with deep characterizations. Now if only I could write those sorts of stories myself! I'm getting there!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book was a fun little romp, even though it offers no truly exciting plot or heart tugging emotion. It is the witty dialogue that keeps you reading. The hot love scene happens nearly at the end of the book, so you will need to have patience here."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have to admit, I was hesitant to buy this one in hardcover. I did not care for her last book, Faking It. But boy was I glad I took the chance after finishing this one! The romance between Cal and Min reminds me of the characters in Fast Women (love the Glenlivet) and Welcome To Temptation. Cal, Min and friends are really well-developed and you find yourself immersed in their world within 30 pages. This book was a one-nighter. I loved it. Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was my first Jennifer Cruise novel and selected because of the large number of positive reviews. Writing was smooth but I didn't really enjoy the storyline. Fat girl gets hot-hunky guy who enjoys watching her eat?? I consider myself a 'fat' girl (I'm about 40# overweight) and I wouldn't consider dating a guy who was smaller than me or kept offering me doughnuts!! The heroine tried on the hero's shirt and couldn't even button it because it was too small on her.I enjoy other author's 'fat' girl romances, such as 'Wishes' by Jude D. and 'Night Play' by Sherrilyn K. because the heros were BIG hot hunky guys and weren't determined to watch the heroine eat. I plan to try to another of Ms. Cruize books and hope for the best."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"According to the author's website, this was an old unsold manuscript that was rewritten and updated, a la Dean Koontz. Although it is a fun book, it feels like an early effort, not up to the standards of Faking It or Fast Women. Wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I really enjoyed this book. As someone who has tried the low carb low fat diet, I found the food scenes particularly entertaining and very easy to relate to-I thought they added a certain amount of realism to Min's character and made Cal even more likeable(what's not to like about a man who will feed you?). The only characters I didn't like were those you weren't supposed to-Cal's Mom, Min's Mom, Greg, and Cal's Brother, but you understood that they put up with them because they were family, and thats what you do with family. Overall a very entertaining novel that was a highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie is a fairy tale come to life.Minerva Dobbs gets dumped and overhears a bet that sexy Calvin Morrisey makes about her going to dinner with him. The dinner doesn't go very well but they keep getting thrown together.Bet me is a delightful read form beginning to end. Love is never easy but Min and Call show us it's worth it.Bet me is a keeper and a favorite."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Is it fair to compare an author to herself? I don't know. What I am sure of is that this book is not as fabulous as Crusie's Welcome to Temptation. However, that should not stop you from buying this book and staying up all night just to finish it! It's a good book, and it's a good Crusie book. The characters are quirky, the situations are wacky, and the dialogue is witty. Yes, it's true that the book is lacking in sex scenes, but I really didn't mind. I enjoyed the plot and the banter between the characters so much that I didn't miss some of the traditional elements of a romance novel that might be missing.Bottom line: buy this book. Buy all Jennifer Crusie's books. Read them and keep them on your bookshelf so that you can read them again. You'll thank yourself."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Minerva &quot;Min&quot; Dobbs has only three weeks before her sister's (Di) wedding, when her boyfriend (David) dumps her in a bar because she refuses to go to bed with him.

I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I love the fact that Min isn't a perfect size 4. She's a normal woman with issues about her body. It was refreshing to read a story about a great-looking guy who falls in love with a smart, funny and attractive girl who just happens to be overweight.Ms. Crusie has done it again. Her characters are funny, quirky and enjoy great friendships. Is it too early for summer? This one goes hand in hand with sun, sand and a boat drink.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Don't get me wrong. I highly recommend this book because Jennifer Crusie is among a very small circle of writers who are consistently funny. The caliber of her writing transcends the romance genre. Add in her ability to write comic, yet sexy love scenes and the circle grows even smaller. If this were the first Crusie I was reading, I'd be jumping up and down for joy in discovering this writer. She's that good.I read \\"Bet Me\\" in one setting, and I enjoyed it. It's funny and witty and fast-paced. The small feeling of dissatisfaction I felt after reading it was the sense that the story could have been more. This is a return to a more romance-focused story than Crusie's later efforts and I missed that a little. The subplots involving Harry/Bink/Reynolds and Diana/Greg weren't as fully developed as Crusie's usual subplots, which are often so strong they threaten to overwhelm the major plot, but in a good way. I missed that in this book and I think Crusie missed the boat. The romance between Min and Cal wasn't enough story. It needed these subplots. The characters were there, the hint of conflict was there, Crusie had my interest but then their stories were cut short a little. That was my only complaint and it's a minor quibble."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"OK, I finishedBet Meand it was an amazing bit of chick lit that was enamoring and funny all the way through, kept my interest in the stupid things they all did and made me wonder why I liked it so much, it was light reading but captivating, hard to put my finger on but I enjoyed the whole thing, it was about 300 pages and was at least a 4.5 Star read as far as entertaining, who cares about any deeper meaning or crap, it made me laugh and had a great ending, what more would I want?"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This really is one of my favorite Cruise novels. I adore it when the heroine isn't physically perfect according to popular opinion, yet the \`hero' adores her anyway and even sees it as a plus.That said, I want to say that this book takes an over-heard and misunderstood conversation and molds it into the perfect novel. We go from the \`heroine' holding Calvin in contempt for his shallowness to Calvin out hero thinking that Minerva is a stick up the bum, overly practical and boring person. And boy are they both ever wrong.I think that this comedy of errors will tickle your funny bone as much as it did mine."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"My first Jennifer cruisie book. Not sure if I'll read more of her books. Albeit there were some funny parts in this book, I didn't love it because the characters were not believable to me. In the real world, a 'fat', chip on her shoulder, frumpy, bitchy girl doesn't win the heart of the gorgeous heartthrob, who is intelligent, self motivated, and can cook.. I'm sorry, first impressions go a long way and her first, second, third impressions were horrific. He should have been running the other way right after they left the bar that first night."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The writing is smart and the plot is thoughtful and fast-paced.

This book is all about fate and how it comes up in the most unexpected ways. I recommed it allllllll the way!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book has all the element's of JC's books that we've come to love and expect, only it was better for me in one way - the main characters didn't jump into bed immediately. That said, the book is so full of sexual tension it crackles! I love that these characters take time to fall in love the old fashioned way - through talking and getting to know each other - while playing around the fringes of sex enough that they drive themselves nuts. In my opinion, this is the best Crusie book yet, hands down!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've had this book on my bookshelf for months only because I saw it sitting on the shelf at a book store and thought the cover looked cute and the story sounded all right. I finally decided to read it because when I'm on my lunch break I don't really have anything to do so I pick up a book. Let me tell ya, I couldn't only read it for 15 minutes a day. I had to take it home and I couldn't put it down! I finished reading it yesterday and I already want to read it again.

BET ME did that, though it's not destined to be a favorite. The entire time I was reading it, I kept seeing scenes from a made-for-TV-movie scrolling through my head. As one other reader said, any other author would have gotten 5 stars. But I've read ALL of Crusie's other books and know that this is not her best. Is it good? Oh yes. Did I laugh out loud? Several times. Did I feel the heat? Quite nicely. There are so many good things to say about it, and I liked all the characters I was supposed to like, and disliked the undeserving, and being on Atkins myself, commiserated with Min about the carbs (though I kept saying EAT THE BUTTER, IT'S OKAY!)I just couldn't quite get over the feeling it was written to be a TV movie instead of a book. I hope it does come out on film. Kate Winslett would be great as Min. Nothing will deter me from eagerly awaiting Ms Crusie's next book, however. She is consistently entertaining, and one of the best authors in today's market. BET ME is a good book that I enjoyed thoroughly, though it did not take me away like her others have done. No one can do that quite like Crusie."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am an avid reader. I read at least one novel per week, usually romance. My favorites are Nora Roberts, Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Janet Evanovich, etc. I have read Jennifer Cruise in the past and thought the books were cute reads.

This really is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me is a fun book--great main and secondary characters (Min being round and plump was great!) and great banter.What distracted me from the book was the number of props and lines in the book that have appeared in Crusie's other books--Dove Bars, ragged orphan animals and reference to rum and Cokes as wimpy drinks, to note a few. It got to the point I was looking for them, and I found I was getting more and more disappointed when I would find them.Crusie writes well and the bantering is fantastic, but the lack of freshness did the book no favor."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"She's done it again. If there's anything to believe in, it's Jennifer Crusie. Her witty dialogue keeps the story rolling, and there's no way you can get bored.

I normally like historicals and paranormal romances because I am more drawn into the world and out of mine. Cruise successfully captured my intrest even without a unique setting or super powers.Min has just been dumped when she secretly hears her ex betting a gorgeous man at the same bar that he can't get Min in bed in a month. Pissed off, she decides to let the handsome Cal take her out this once and make him regret it. Cal has no intention of taking the stupid bet. He is willing to get away from his ex girlfriend though, so he decides to ask Min out to dinner to make an escape. What follows is a story about two people who fate has decided need to be together whether they like it or not.I really liked Min. Her character is real and likeable. I like that she wasn't perfect looking, and her friends add humor to the story. Cal was an interesting hero. He has depth beyond good looks. I love it when a hero thinks the heroine is gorgeous even when she isn't looking her best, which Cal did. The two ex's added some more drama with there outragous plans to get Cal and Min back, and I really liked the idea of fairy tales and how they would play out in real life. Overall, this was a really enjoyable read. It is certainly my favorite contemporary that I have read. I still prefer historical and paranormal romances, but I will probably give Cruise another go since I enjoyed this novel so much."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"When I first bought this book, I was sure it was going to be an offbeat book that is decent enough of a read for a bargain price. What I got was an author who knew her business and how to grab the attention of this skeptic. I really do not like romance novels, but she paired it with real life situations and comedy, and the timing was perfect. That fact alone is what will keep anyone who reads this book in hysterics. Worth 22 bucks, and worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"If I could've rated this book higher than five, I would've. I started Bet Me at six o'clock last evening and stayed up until two in the morning to finish it. I could'nt put the book down. Did I figure the ending of the book out within the first few chapters, yes. Did I care...NO. I've been reading a lot of chick lit and have liked most of what I've read, but have found a lot of flaws in the characters and such, but not in this book. I loved Min's style. Her wise cracks made me laugh and I loved the way she didn't get too down about her mom's constant arguing over her weight. The guy she falls for; Cal, started out looking like scum, but once you got into the real him who could'nt help fall in love with him. Her friends and his friends complimented each other and there was real chemistry between the friendships they had with each other. I can't say enough about how great this story was! I will say to everyone out there, read this book!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" is possibly one of the best books I have read in a long time, and it's going on my shelf as one of my absolute favorites. I am a very avid reader and although I alternate between genres, there is always a fondness for 'chick lit'. And I think this story is one of the best.First off, it delights me to find that the heroine in this story is both voluptuous and strong willed. Min is someone that I belive I know quite well, and someone I hope others see me as. She is a heroine I feel I might some day reach - and that is a wonderful thing.To keep this brief: I think Crusie did an excellent job of writing real, engaging, witty characters. I would love to know these people and find my Emilio's. The romance is wonderful and even as they fight it you can feel the reality and truth behind it. It makes shivers run up my spine and has me happily writing a review at 4 am just so I can tell you all how wonderful it is. I loved how Min spoker her mind and stood up for those who needed it. Harry is a jewel as is Liza and Shanna. In sum: The writing is comical, witty, spine-tingling and real. I couldn't put it down, it was finished in 27 hours with an 8 hr work day in there somewhere. Couldn't put it down.Critics ('cause no review should be perfect): It broke my heart that so much came between the lovers - but it always does. It may have gotten long, but I still ate it up. If for awhile Cal seems too perfect, he gets more real, believe me. Okay, I'm on a book high and can't think of any more critiques.I strongly suggest this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"A friend (that is not an avid reader like me) raved about this book and told me I must read it. I had never heard of Jennifer Crusie before but took my friend's advice that it was a great read, hilarious and hard to put down, so I got the book. She was definitely right! It was the most humorous book I've probably ever read! It had me laughing all the way through it. Normally I will chuckle or smile through some books but this one had me laughing out loud with all the witty comments and sarcastic humor. It was such an enjoyable read and definitely is one that you don't want to put down. Yes, it's somewhat predictable but it's such a light hearted, fun book with truly believable characters that you won't mind that you can probably guess how it will turn out. The additional chapter at the end was icing on the cake for those of us who like complete closure at the end of a book. I recommend it highly! Can't wait to read more of her books! I'm hooked now!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I just read BET ME because a girlfriend recommended it. I loved it, and plan to recommend it to others. It's too early to call anyone, so I will start with an Amazon review!BET ME is light, fun and charming. Jennifer Crusie does a great job of capturing single girl struggles and making them light and fun. Like many good tales it starts off with 'once upon a time:' \\"Once upon a time, Minvera Dobbs thought as she stood in the middle of a loud yuppie bar, the world was full of good men.\\" It turns out that she is here being dumped by her \\"tall, dark and righteous\\" boyfriend just a few weeks before her sister's wedding. Instead of being a tragedy, this of course opens up space for a good man to show up.The loser boyfriend has been cranky because Minerva has not been sleeping with him. He looks like Prince Charming but has had the poor taste to indicate she is too plump. Cal, when he shows up, loves Min's curves, and keeps feeding her decadent treasts like chicken marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts with chocolate icing.Crusie does a great job keeping the whole think light and fun. The dialog between Min and Cal (the good man) has the energy and crackle of the dialogue in romantic comedies like \\"Desk Set.\\"Late in the book, we meet the Families, and get a dose of what each has to overcome in order to be happy. The pace slows a little here, towards the slow and significant, but never completely loses the energy and charm that keep you turing page after page.A note for the modest: The hero and heroine do finally fall into bed together, and we do have that described to us. If you are bothered by a fairly explicit description, this may bother you.A thumbs up for BET ME! This is Chick Lit at its best."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I'd never read any of Crusie's books, until I picked this one up at the store after it caught my eye. I have to say, I've already went out and bought a few more of her books, because if they're as good as \\"Bet Me\\"- I'm a new fan & I'm hooked!We first meet Min Dobbs as her boyfriend is breaking up with her- in a bar- for not sleeping with him. Thank god her friends are there for support, and so are some good looking available men. Cal catches her eye and she's definitely interested, until she sees him talking to her now ex-boyfriend & making a bet that he can't get her into bed in 1 month! No longer interested in his good looks, out of spite she does agree to leave the bar with Cal. Only, this casual acquaintance seems to take a life on of it's own...and Min & Cal begin running into each other where ever they go. Their love/hate relationship becomes irresistable, even though both of them try to deny it.This book was such a pleasant, fun read! Very quickly I became attached to the characters in the book, the friends of Cal & Min, their families, even their conspiring Ex's! I think this is one of the best romantic comedy books I've read in a long time. As another reviewer put it, the dialogue and situations in the book are realistic, they do not come off as contrived or fake- as some books do. I'd certainly love to see a movie version of this book- and like I said, I'll be reading much more of Crusie in the future!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love this book. I have read all of her books, even re-read most, but this one I pick up again and again just so that I can smile while I read it. I read very fast.I enjoy the fact that Min, is a normal, average sized woman who stands up for who she is and doesnt take any crap from Cal, no matter how handsome he is. The conversations/arguments are witty, honest and sometimes make you laugh out loud.Her characters are realistic, the situations they find them selves in are as well. Really, how many times do you find youself with a group of you closest friends and talk about what if. I think that all close groups of friends should have weekly \\"if-dinners\\". The melding of the groups, male and female very honest.I always recommend Crusie, to all my fellow readers, whether it is this book or another of hers. Her stories are witty and heartfelt. They, especially \\"BET ME\\" will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me isn't Jennifer Crusie's best work, but I think it's still pretty quality, since I tend to regard Jennifer Crusie as one of those authors who is great even when she's bad (kind of like Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Julia Quinn--they just stand head and shoulders above everything else out there in lighthearted romantic fiction)First of all, the characters aren't quite as quirky as some of Crusie's others. While they definitely still have spunk, I just felt as though this novel was lacking in some of the originality of Crusie's other novels. No con-artists or film stars or mayors/pool sharks here. The most interesting thing about the hero and heroine's families was that they were rich, which really isn't all that interesting at all.Secondly, Crusie tends to bludgeon the reader with her themes, as some other reviewers noted. Elvis, Krispy Kreme, Chicken marsala... over and over and over! She also spends far too much of the novel preoccupied with emphasizing Min's insecurity about her weight.The novel loses a little steam towards the end, when Min stops being a smart aleck and starts fishing for reassurances about her figure constantly. Also, the sub-plot concerning Min's sister's wedding just didn't pack quite the punch as some of the other sub-plots in Crusie novels. I found myself skipping pages to get to the part where Min and Calvin finally get together, but even that seemed to lose my interest (perhaps because it took so long to get to the point!)All in all, however, this novel was still very funny and very sweet, and inspired me to actually use butter for about the first time in forever. Crusie does a wonderful job with Cal; and of course, what woman wouldn't appreciate a man who feeds her donuts and calls her beautiful at the same time? Cal was a wonderful hero, and the initial spark between Min and Cal was great. I just felt that this one lost a little bit of momentum between the middle and the end. However, if you are looking for a funny, light read, this one should satisfy. (Or make you intensely hungry for donuts... haha..)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is the first book I've read by Jennifer Cruise. I liked parts of the book, but other parts of it drove me crazy. There was some good dialogue, but the word said was over used. There were good parts and interaction between the characters, but there were a lot of long and drawn out scenes that slowed down the book. Several times during the book Cruise could have ended it, but it kept going. The frequency of betting was getting old also. I liked the relationship between Cal and Min, and thought Bonnie was amusing. David was a chump and towards the end I couldn't stand him or Cynthia. Pretty early on, almost from the beginning, the ending was predictable. I liked the ending, but actions by the family members didn't seem realistic. Overall it was all right, but would have been better if it had been shorter and quicker paced."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's audio books. I think her humor really comes through. I listen to her books while I'm on the treadmill and I find myself laughing outloud. I have a hard time turning the tape off because the stories are so good. I can honestly recommend this one (Bet me), Welcome to Temptation and Fast Women."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Looking over the reviews, \\"Bet Me\\" seems to be a book that you either love or hate. Personally, I thought that parts of the book were worthy of *10 stars*, but I *love* romantic fiction and am not looking for realism in a book like this one. Jennifer Crusie is *excellent* at adapting the fairy tale into a contemporary romance. I loved the characters of Minerva and Calvin--an insecure, chubby Cinderella with a sharp wit and her gorgeous, commitment-phobic Prince Charming.Minerva Dobbs has just been dumped in the middle of a theme bar by her handsome boyfriend of 3 months because she will not sleep with him. She is more upset about losing her date to her sister's upcoming wedding than losing David (the boyfriend), but she is feeling pretty down on herself and on men in general. Her friends try to distract her with a gorgeous guy (Calvin Morrisey) standing across the bar from her, talking to David. When her friends goad her into approaching the hunk, Minerva overhears David betting Calvin that he cannot get her to sleep with him in the next month. Minerva thinks that she has heard Cal agree to the bet and starts fuming. When Calvin approaches her to ask her to dinner, an angry Minerva agrees, thinking that she will string him along until after her sister's wedding and then dump him. Cal cannot understand why all his legendary charm falls flat with a very prickly Minerva, and Minerva cannot understand why she finds Cal so attractive, despite all that she knows about him.I loved the character of Minerva, a curvy girl on a low carb diet in a world full of skinny Minnies. Her insecurities were very real (but I agree with Cal, all that talk about not eating food was pretty boring.) Calvin was a wonderful literary creation--a gorgeous, charming, \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" type who gets blindsided by his deep attraction to Minerva. So *unlikely*, I know, but that is what makes romantic fiction *great*! They both have awful families, intrusive friends, meddling ex's and some real insecurity issues.The dialogue was snappy and very witty and the plot quite clever. I loved the slightly mystical touches (minor accidents befall the H/H when they deny their love to others) and the fairy tale references in the plot (a shoe is lost, a \\"wolf\\" approaches a woman in a red hooded sweater, a kiss \\"awakens\\" a sleeper) that underscored that Cal and Min were \\"meant to be\\". Food was used as a metaphor and plot device a bit *too* much for my taste (ha!)--enough already about Chicken Marsala, donuts, bread and butter! I admit that I did love the scene in which Cal seduces a kiss out of Min on a picnic table with the help of a Krispy Kreme donut (the donut acting as a metaphor for the kiss itself--both forbidden *bliss* for Min!) My other quibble with the book was with the epilogue. Min complains near the end of the book that nobody ever writes stories about happily ever after--and she is right. While everyone agrees that the heroine should get the handsome prince at the end of a good romance, \\"happily ever after\\" means different things to different people and is best left to the reader's imagination (I think anyways...)In summary, \\"Bet Me\\" is a sexy, light, humorous romp with an engaging hero and heroine. I think that Jennifer Crusie is a *wonderfully* talented author and would also recommend \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" (a book by JC that I liked even more!)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I was starting to get a little worried. I thought &quot;Fast Women&quot; was so so and that &quot;Faking It&quot; was a near miss. Then there was that fall into the land of rereleasing. With &quot;Bet Me&quot; Ms. Cruise is BACK. This book is laugh out loud funny, unpredictable and very well written. I hope we don't have to wait three years for her next great book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Minerva Dobbs is a young lady that begins to have doubts about every finding Mr. Right when her boyfriend dumps her for not wanting to have sex. \\"IS that all men think about?\\" she judges. Just when things seem to have gotten as bad as they could get, they go even lower. Her ex-boyfriend, pegging Min as a cold-hearted lady with no sex drive, bets Cal Morrissey that he is not able to bed her.Min decides to have fun in raising Cal's hopes before she ultimately plans to leave him with the desires in his hand. A funny thing happens on the way, they actually go beyond their original plans for each other and start to come to terms with the fact that they may have found their perfect match. Sometimes, destiny is grand and Jennifer Cruise takes us through a humorous journey in search of the Cinderella ending that everyone dreams of but always feels is beyond our own reach."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"First off, I concur with the previous 140-some people who characterized it as a humorous and sexy romp and good beach reading.Second, this being a review and not a book report, I promise I won't rehearse the plot one more time.Third, love Crusie or hate her, but don't say her writing's poor! It may be formula (which is why the cover doesn't say WAR AND PEACE-coincidence? You be the judge!), and you may well hate the formula (some days even I do), but the execution of the formula is generally flawless. Crusie, unlike way too many popular authors, doesn't go mad with adverbs, doesn't refer to people as \\"the man\\" or \\"the blonde\\", avoids endless just-slightly-wrong synonyms for \\"said,\\" and knows the difference between MAY and MIGHT and LIE and LAY. Unless you can say the same for your own prose, you might want to count to ten before bashing Crusie's style.Fourth, though...ah, fourth. As some of the reviewers have mentioned, the book does circle around weight and acceptance of weight: Min's \\"round,\\" though we never hear a number (probably a good call); her mother's mad for thinness, like so many other mothers, and Cal, the beautiful guy, feeds her and encourages her not to worry about her weight, which she ultimately agrees not to do. Many, including me, have mixed reactions to this aspect. Some readers think Cal's a sicko for feeding Min and undermining her efforts to diet, despite the fact that, left to herself, Min doesn't really want to diet. Some applaud the book's message of self-acceptance, despite the fact that, for many women, learning to manage diet and exercise in ways they can live with IS about self-acceptance and that, for many others, obesity is the visible sign of despair and other kinds of constraint. For some women, thinness means power and self-acceptance; for others, fat means the same things. It's a very interesting dispute.I think this schism in readership reflects our cultural divide about weight in general, and women's weight in particular: we're supposed to accept and love ourselves as is, AND we're supposed to maintain a certain weight. We're supposed to be sensual creatures who enjoy food, sex, and a trashy novel in the hammock, but we're supposed to control the flesh, conquer it, overcome the body with the mind. What this divide says, to me, is that depending on one's state of mind, either stance can be \\"right\\": there are ways in which we should and want to take control of our lives, and other ways in which we shouldn't and don't want to, and still others in which we literally can't, and which category our weight falls into really, REALLY varies from person to person, from woman to woman. Cal's right to feed Min because her desire for thinness is externally imposed; he's wrong to feed Min because it's just another external imposition of control on her body. Min's right to want carbs and sweets because she enjoys them and doesn't seem to link them to anything else, but she could be wrong to eat them if the circumstances were only a little different: if she were diabetic, if being heavy made her deeply unhappy, if her appetite were just a way of anesthetizing other feelings.If anything, maybe Cal's wrong to feed Min when he doesn't know any of this about her; the trope of the romance novel, though, says that even when Mr. Right doesn't know anything about us, he really does. I don't know how much I like that trope, even though it speaks to a universal desire to be understood and still loved; the suggestion that Mr. Right understands Ms. Right better than she does herself may sometimes be true, but would be very dangerous as a rule of thumb. However, the broader message--that heavy women and beautiful men can do well together--is a nice rejoinder for Hollywood, which spews the opposite dictum nonstop and limits its treatment of this possibility to *Shallow Hal.* Moreover, the idea that self-acceptance is crucial to accepting love is worth considering.And what all this means in the long term, of course, is that we can't, or at least shouldn't, make quick judgments about what's going on inside people based on weight. Weight's a kind of floating signifier: it means what the person wearing it most deeply believes it means; sometimes(dare we say it), it may mean nothing at all. And yet we treat it as a universal moral signifier. For those who say this book is a formula-driven piece of predictable hackery, that's a fairly sophisticated message."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am listening to the CD, after giving the book a quick read when it came out. The premise is great, but the dialog gets boring because its all \\"xx\\"Cal Said then \\"xx\\"Min Said \\"xx\\"Bonnie said \\"xxx\\"David Said. The word SAID must have been used 10,000 times in this book. It slows down otherwise snappy dialogue."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have to agree with other reviewers that Ms. Crusie's last two efforts (BET ME and FAKING IT) have not been up to par with her usual standards of excellence. Although the characters are likeable and there are some witty lines, the book lacks any kind of plot. It consists mostly of couples pairing off in a singles bar. It reminds me of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; meets &quot;The Dating Game&quot; (which is not a compliment since I don't care for either show).Also, I felt the author threw in some things to try to please everyone. Min is overweight and carb conscious. The bartender (who is also Cal's neighbor) is a Lesbian. One couple decides to remain childless, which disappointed me because they both like children and it is pointed out a couple of times in the book that they would make beautiful children. I will continue to read Ms. Crusie's books, but hope for better in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" was the first Jennifer Crusie book I ever read. Now, after reading them all, it's still my favorite.I adore Min Dobbs. It's rare to find a main character in chick lit who's overweight and doesn't end up having to lose pounds to get the guy. Plus, Min is funny, sarcastic, and a solid woman. The guy in this (Cal Morissey) is a bit of a cad at first, but he gets to your heart and manages to win you over. And the plot is great- their friends and family remind me much too much of my own sometimes.My only complaint would be that the major sex scene comes fairly late in the novel, but it's worth the wait, and Crusie keeps you laughing and reading until the last page. A great read anytime."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Until recently I haven't had much interest in \\"chick lit\\" or romance novels. A friend recommended that I read Bet Me because I reminded her of the main character, so I took a leap and loved this book. The main character, Min, was a feisty, fun character with a biting wit. I also enjoyed the cast of peripheral characters...Min's friends and those of her unlikely love interest, Cal. Outlandish happenings abound in this book, but that was part of the fun. Above all, Crusie writes great sexual tension that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book. I will definitely pick up more Crusie in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Excellent reading - an enjoyable story - it will bring a smile to your face. The music on the discs is perfect for the tale."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"3.7 stars I enjoyed this romantic twisted knot of a tale. The women had strong independent roles and were intelligent. I've had enough of the poor dumb women clich&eacute;s'. It was filled with quick snarky lines and tender sweet moments. Yes there was a'bad' buy and although he wasn't stupid he was an idiot and very believable idiot.Now about the story, I don't really need to tell you anything about it. It's a contemporary romance, there is a cat, a handsome man, a woman,one witch of a woman, the evil man, some friends, two crazy nut-o families and some really good Italian food. If you're looking for fun, light romantic comedy with a HEA this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Light hearted read. Enjoyed it and will read some more of her books. Have already ordered a couple more. Lots of funny situations"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The skeptical person that I happen to be was the draw to this book. While the summary leaves plenty of room for speculation, I kept an open mind to how this book played out and I am I pleased to say that this book is a sure thing for enjoyment.Min and Cal are probably the most sincere characters I have ever read. They did everything that they could do to avoid falling in love, but with them.... love was something to be reckoned with. The admiration that these two had for one another regardless of how everyone in their path tried to destroy them really touched me. Min's opinions about her embarrassment over her weight rang so true to how I feel about myself. Cal's thoughts that weight is never an issue... it is the person inside that matters gave me hope. Regardless of the fact that this book is a fictional story, it was a feel good story to all that read it. While their first meeting was unconventional with having a bet be the catalyst for their connection, it was the journey that they took to getting their fairy tale ending that made reading this all worth while.This is just one of many books I have read of Ms. Crusie's and ranks number one on my list of enjoyable books to read. Of course, I also loved \\"Anyone but you\\" by her also. So if you are up for a feel good story.... you definitely need to read this book. I highly recommend it!! Then, of course, you need to read \\"Anyone but you\\", too."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie, and the title of my review pretty much says everything you need to know about it - it's a fun, light, sexy chicklit/romantic comedy novel. Minerva Dobbs ('Min') is a sharp-tongued actuary with a shoe festish and an overbearing mother who wants her to be a size 6 instead of a size 12. Calvin Morrisey is an entrepreneur with a reputation as a 'love them and leave them' ladies' man. Both have witty and loyal friends, and cross paths after recent breakups in their lives at a local bar. They initially go out as part of a bet, and betting is a running theme throughout the book. Crusie pokes fun at relationship self-help through the character of Cynthie, Cal's ex, a relationship expert and wanna-be author who wants him back.This book is distinguished by the witty dialogue, which is pretty contrived - a bit like watching a television sitcom aka 'Friends' - but entertaining and lighthearted. If you are looking for a good, fun escapist romantic read, this is for you. If you want depth or realism, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"omg.......this has been one of my favourites for years! minnie is like a real life person filled with insecurities....a heroine i can relate with......an absolute must have"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love picking up a Crusie book because I never know what to expect. Her stories are entertaining and always a world apart from other writers'. Bet Me is one of my favorite books, one I've read at least three times. It's funny and romantic and just an overall great read! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I think of my favorite romance novels as some of my best friends. I save them and bring them out when I need comforting or something familiar. Bet Me is one of those for me. I cannot even say how many times I've re-read it. At least 5, maybe more like 10. To me, it's just that good.There's a reason Bet Me was voted #1 (out of 1,231!) by Goodreads voters in the list of \\"Best Ever Contemporary Romance Books\\". It really has it all. Great (yet flawed) romantic leads, wonderfully delightful supporting cast of characters, humor, food... It could use a bit less conflict and bit more sex, but the lack of sex is sort of the point to the book (and when we finally do get to it, it's pretty damn good) so we'll give it a pass on that one. Cal and Min play off each other so well, in what could be a frustrating game of cat and mouse, but Crusie writes it with such ease and humor, it just seems right. And the depth she gives to the characters personalities made me feel like I was part of their group of friends and knew each and every one of them. Details like Min's \\"couples-only\\" snow globe collection and Elvis obsession to Cal's dyslexia and hatred of baseball coaching (which he does anyway). I was sad to finish Bet Me because I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends I had come to love. But, I guess that's the good thing about books - when I miss those friends, I just dust my copy off and get to know them all over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I thought this book was so juicy and good.

The characters really grow on you and the plot has plenty of twists and new developments. This is my first Jennifer Cruise novel, but I will be looking for others soon!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is definitely my favorite among all of Crusie's books! Min, the story's main character, is such a sweet, lovable character who is not perfect by any standard. Her insecurities are relatable, yet she's able to overcome them with wits and humor. Her feelings for Cal, the subject of her affections, are believable, because his character is charming and bigger than life, yet dotted with typical male weaknesses (i.e. looks comes first, then personality). At the end, you'll love both characters, and will definitely cheer them on!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was my first Jennifer Crusie book and I think I've found one of my new favorite authors! I LOVED it!She has a great writing style, and I appreciate that she can give information about each character's past without being boring or trite.Bet Me is about an unlikely couple that fights their attraction to each other. Min is bitter with men because she's just been dumped for not sleeping with the guy. Cal is a smooth ladies man that seems to be a typical commitment-phobe. While at a bar, Min's recent ex bets Cal to 1.get Min to leave the bar with him and 2.get Min to sleep with him. Their relationship may have a rocky start, but fate has other plans.Min's character is chubby, and I really liked that in this book the chubby girl didn't have to loose weight to win the guy. Finally. On the other hand, I did find it a little annoying how much she enjoyed food, and how much chicken marsala was mentioned. I think i'll laugh at that whenever i see it on a menu now.Crusie's plot is really clever and you can't help but love her characters. Bet Me is funny, fresh and romantic. It's like a breath of fresh air compared to many other books in the same category. It's one of the best romance books I've read. I'm definitely going to read this book again one day and get her other titles.It's a must read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I could not put it down when I picked it up and started reading it yesterday. I ended up staying up to 4 am to finish it (and now I am extremely tired due to 2.5 hours of sleep). But the book was worth it!There are plenty of summaries about the story already, so no need to get into that again. However, I do want to point out that (IMO) Min is not what I would call \\"fat\\" per se, she's voluptuous and curvy - that's a far cry from fat! It's mentioned in the book that she's a couple sizes bigger than an 8 - so I would say she's about a 12 (that's what I pictured in my head anyway). Well that's not fat, that's pretty average. Of course, compared to her size 2 sister and size 4 mother, she would appear on the heavier side.In any case, if you love Crusie's writing style, you will love this book too! Very funny, heartwarming and sexy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me is the perfect lazy summer day at the beach read. It's top notch brain candy and if you prefer a book with more depth, you'll probably be disappointed. We all know how it's going to end, but it's one of those books that's impossible to put down. Go ahead and buy the book. I'll bet you you'll love Minerva, the lead character as much as I did."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I absolutely loved this book.

I've since returned to the novel over and over again - I love it and have read it a million times. The storyline is almost fairytale-esqe, with rich descriptions and snappy dialogue. I love reading how Cal falls in love with Min and how they create a relationship against their will. It gives me hope and definitely will have you believing in fate when you finish the book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I adored this book up until the very end, where it got a little uncomfortably raunchy. A lot of her books are a bit that way, but this one at least held off until the end. I very much liked the main character, and the writing and dialogue was clever and funny, and if she'd just lose some of the tackier, more crass elements of her books I'd rank her as one of the better authors in my book. Her sex scenes bump her down a notch to 'read if you're not easily offended,' though."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I got my book in the condition it claimed it to be in and by the date promised.

I was not disappointed. The dialogue is especially amusing (how I wish I thought as quickly on my feet as Min!) and I still pull this one out when I'm in need of a smile. Crusie is a master of the big scene, with nearly every character present in the room, each with his or her own agenda, and several different conversations going on. Strictly farce, in the best literary sense.If only more men liked the Rubens look..."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I inhaled this book in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. The dialogue was absolutely delightful, very witty, very funny, very warm. Cal is sexy as hell, and Min is so funny and so insightful.

Her thoughts as she linger in the upscale Yuppie bar is that her latest loser David deserves a swizzle stick shoved by her into his heart though he probably wouldn't miss a beat.Hollywood handsome Cal Morrissey has a $10,000 bet with his pals that he will bed Min within a month. Min knows about the wager and decides to play along with Cal so that he can escort her to her sister's wedding and then dump him with her sheets remaining dry. As Cal and Min compete for the upper hand and their friends interfere either by separating or pushing them together, they fall in love. However, will Min trust this slick stud with her heart especially when she agrees with Gloria Steinham that \\"Women's total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage\\".The Steinham line is a great opening to a humorous off beat relationship tale as it distinctly shows the gender differences that help turn this tale into an audaciously delightful screwball comedy. Min is a delightful cynic while Cal is a charming schemer. The support cast including Krispy Cr&egrave;me is an eccentric bunch, but the novel belongs to the lead couple war to implement their respective plan that makes for a fine time for readers who appreciate a wacky romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I can't tell you how much I loved this book. To give you an indication, I got it from the library (not liking Crusie's last book, I wasn't willing to risk a waste of money on a hard cover) and read it. Now, I'm buying it myself! I usually buy hardcovers once every year or two, so you get the idea. Like Crusie's other books, this made me lol--for example, when describing Min's dad: he was &quot;a lumbering man with a shock of blond hair and heavy white eyebrows who should have been hearty and welcoming but instead had the vaguely paranoid look of a sheepdog whose sheep were plotting against him.&quot;So, why did I like this book? Let me count the ways. I loved Cal, an extremely handsome man who realizes that he loves, loves Min and that she should eat! He defends her beautifully from her mother who is always vigilent. carping about Min to diet. In turn, I also loved Min who considers herself fat and cannot really believe a good looking man would be attracted to her. Yes, the book is predictable, but that's half the fun--you don't have to worry that something unpleasant will happen and you anticipate and enjoy what you know will happen--even before it does. If you have weight issues (and how many women don't?), you'll love this book too."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I find myself comparing this to Crusie's other books instead of the tons of mediocre romance novels that are out there. This is a great book compared to most, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Welcome to Temptation or Fast Women. She set such a high standard with those books, and I haven't found the last couple to be up there.The protaganist characters are charming, but there are too many secondary characters with not enough to do. They are interesting, fun people, but they should have either been more developed or a few of them culled out. Crusie always does her sub-plots, which, in the two titles mentioned above, are awesome. The subs in this one aren't as developed and therefore seem a little distracting.I read and re-read constantly, because I DO insist on good writing, and the authors that I like can't keep up. Therefore, I'm not at all sorry that I bought this in hardback, because I will come back to it - just not near as much as I will her other books. So, I don't know whether to recommend this to a first time Crusie reader or not. If I said to get it first, you'd not be getting her best, but will get a good story - but if I said to read Welcome to Temptation first, you might be like me and be a bit disappointed by this one when you do read it... Tough call. Those who are already fans will like it, I'm sure. You just may not love it as much as the others!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I bought this book as an ebook for my Kindle, and could have not been more disappointed. It's such an excellent book, but whomever put it into ebook format did not even bother editing it before putting it up for sale. The paragraph formatting is messed up, words like \\"I'm\\" and \\"I've\\", frequently are messed up as \\"Fm\\" and \\"Fv\\", and there is missing punctuation, spaces, and on occasion, entire words were somehow translated into numbers. Don't even bother wasting your money if you want this as an ebook, because it's nowhere near worth it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie is a dazzling writer. She knows how to feed the heart of women. This book is my ultimate favorite, it's the Pride and Prejudice of our time.Min Dobbs knows that happily-ever-after is a fairy tale, especially with a man like Cal Morrisey, who asked her to dinner to win a bet. Cal Morrisey knows commitment is impossible, especially with a woman as cranky as Min Dobbs. When they say good-bye at the end of their evening, they cut their losses and agree never to see each other again.But fate has other plans for them. Min and Cal are dealing with meddling friends, wedding cake, a jealous ex-boyfriend, and Krispy Kremes.I recommend all of Crusie's books:charlie all nightfaking itcrazy for yougetting rid of bradley"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have long been a fan of chic lit, however I was just recently introduced to Jennifer Crusie. Boy am I glad that I was. \\"Bet Me\\" is an entertaining read full of sharp quips and quick paced dialogue. The characters are fun to be with and really easy to get to know. We are first introduced to Min Dobbs as she is unceremoniously dumped by her loser of a boyfriend, only to have him turn around and make a bet with Calvin Morrissey that Cal won't be able to get Min into bed with him in one month.Min, overhearing the bet, decides to play Cal and give David a run for his money. However, she decides that after one date with Cal that annoying David isn't worth the trouble and her and Cal part and go their seperate ways. The rest of the story is truly romantic (and hilarious) as Min and Cal are pushed together again and again. David, on the other hand, continues to see his money slipping farther and farther away, ending in hilarious results.I was very entertained by this read and can't wait to try my hand a more Jennifer Crusie novels. So if you're looking for something light hearted and fun to read, try \\"Bet Me.\\" You'll be glad you took the gamble!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is so realistic and down to earth! It hits home in some many areas, yet it is dramatically funny! Once you begin reading this book, you won't want to put it down! It's an easy read and guaranteed to make you laugh and feel every emotion possible! It gives hope to every smart, energetic, and intuitive woman alive!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book came recommended to me and I have never read this author before. It is a quick read with witty dialogue. The plot line and relationship reminded me a little bit of \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\". The main character was interesting, but I never could really relate to her. It does describe the modern dating scene in detail (which looks a little scary to me - glad I'm not in that arena!) While I liked the book, I did not give it 5 stars because I like books with more intricate plots and greater character development. This is a good book for a quick read on vacation or on the week-end."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've heard that the author herself described this novel as a \\"cheesy romance\\".Is it a cheesy romance? You bet, pun intended--it uses some old romance-novel tropes like the Big Misunderstanding, and focuses almost entirely on the love relationship rather than other issues.Is it a lot of fun? Yes! I enjoyed every minute of this book. I relished the banter and friction between Min and Cal as they got to know one another. He can't figure out why she's so acerbic--but then he doesn't realize that she thinks he made a very slimy bet with her ex-boyfriend. And she can't figure out, if he's only with her to win a bet, why her gut is telling her his feelings are real. Meanwhile, after a whole life spent dieting and being prim, she's learning how to live a little, from chocolate-iced donuts to red lace bras. Add in some quirky friends, some dysfunctional parents, and mix well.Yes, the plot was a little improbable, but the sweet, sexy dynamic between Min and Cal was worth it. Think of it as one of those Krispy Kremes Min loves so much: a little fluffy, but sweet and satisfying."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have always avoided books said to be \\"chick lit\\". I think I always thought the term sounded prententious. Or perhaps I was turned off by the whimsical book covers. However, I picked this book up at a local paperback exchange because Amazon had listed its title in my recommendations. Amazon got it right. I loved this book to pieces.The story of Minerva and Calvin is full of comedy and witty conversation. The character development was great. The characters, both major and minor, were vividly depicted. I really felt that I knew them.The warmth and comedy is reminiscent of Susan Elizabeth Phillips, although Crusie's hero is not as masterful and stubborn as many of Phillips' are. Also, Crusie's heroine is more self-reliant than many of Phillips'.The plot was sweet and fast paced. However, this does not mean that the main plot and its subplots did not recieve the attention they needed. In fact, at the end of the book, I was satisfied that all problems were sufficiently resolved and understood.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. Do you like to laugh? Do you like books that you can't put down? Do you like heroines who are \\"real\\"? I think you should pick this book up today. (Then, you just may find yourself picking up another Crusie book - I did!)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book goes at it from the very beginning and although we can guess what is going to happen for the most part, it will hit a funny bone and make you wanting more!Our characters will step out of the book and won't go back in! I read this book in one sitting!I love Min. She is without a doubt wonderful normal character. I love shoes so I couldn't help but like her! This book is full of laughs and will make you hungry also!You won't regret picking this one up!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"What a fun book! I almost gave up on it at the beginning, but I think that's more because my heart wasn't in it that because of the book. I am so glad I didn't. An easy breezy read that made me laugh several times out loud, and even made me cry twice. The characters were well drawn and played well together. The main characters made you fall in love with them from the get go.This author has me hooked. I'll be reading more of her work in the very near future.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I usually prefer historicals because I find that there are few contemporary authors who have a distinctive voice. And although I enjoyed \\"Welcome to temptation,\\" I found Crusie's other books to be more of the same. But this one was very good.It was funny,different and enjoyable.I guess I liked it so much because it appealed to me on a personal level since like Min I too have weight issues.And Cal is just the perfect hero.He reminds me of my favorite literary male character - Darcy from Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" although he's not a straight-out stuck-up snob.But I felt that he was - although not blatantly so.It's really romantic how he boosts Min's confidence and stands up for her even though she's not always a pushover.And she does the same for him.That really rings true for me.I can understand why these two characters would fall for each other even though they fight against it - they compliment each other,genuinely care for each other and accept each other just as they are.You can relate to the problems of the main characters and really want them to end up together.The supporting characters are also wonderful and go beyond the usual stereotypical boorish mother and man-hating best friend.I loved Harry and his shoe fetish.Another great thing about this book is how during crucial scenes there are sometimes two conversations going on simultaneously - one serious and one funny.So,one moment you're all solemn and the next line has you cracking up.The only thing I didn't like about this book had to do with the writing.The conversations are staged like this - \\"......\\" he said, \\"........\\" she said, \\"......\\" he said, \\"........\\" she said.Sometimes we don't need references in order to understand who's speaking the line and this makes the story flow more smoothly.I just wish the editor had spotted this.Other than that I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is the 4th Crusie book I have read, and definitely my favorite so far. The dialog is funny and the characters are appealing. The ending, however, was a bit weak but not enough to give it a lower rating."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me was a delightful read. It definately delivers some real characters, humor, and a heartwarming story with a few unexpected turns that will keep you guessing (if only for a short while). Maybe, the dialog in a few places get a bit corny but its easy to everlook because the story is so entertaining."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Listened to the audio version.

Minerva Dobbs, is a plain old normal woman. A bit overweight, by her mothers standard, but when her ex bet's a business associate that he can't get her bed, she overhears and take the challage. Only no one knows that she knows. What comes next is a series of funny, heart warming events that lead to love. The charaters in this book are so real that there is no way that you won't relate to at least one of them. This is the first book I have read by this author, and I have to tell you thatI will read more. I have already recommened this book. It you want a feel good read. Buy this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Romantic, funny and sweet -- the perfect weekend read.

Deborah Curran"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've read my fair share of romance novels over the years, and this is my all-time favorite so far. Min and Cal are well developed. We see who they are and some of what made them that way, which makes them all the more real. The dialogue among all the characters was clever and fun. I laughed out loud a time or two the first time I read it.I don't expect that I'm going to be reading Literature (yes, with a capital L) when I pick up one of these novels, nor should anyone else. I'm looking for a good story I can escape into for a while. Jennifer Crusie delivers, and \\"Bet Me\\" is a guilty pleasure I can turn to again and again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is my favorite of all her novels, and I've been reading them for years. Min's internal dialogue, where she tells herself not to say what she's thinking, makes me laugh every time I see it. And the twist that almost keeps Min and Cal apart at the end is perfect... she pushes his buttons and he pushes hers.I enjoy the humor in Jenny Crusie's writing, even when her plots get too convoluted. Her straightforward writing style works for me, too, and her characters are always entertaining.The sex scenes are too graphic for my liking, but I can always skip over them. I know a lot of people who want that sort of stuff."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is the first Crusie novel I have read and I pretty much got what I expected after reading other reviews on Amazon, but I do think this book is way overrated. Bet Me is a terrific vacation or beach read. I think that the characters were a little too mean for reality and I got really tired of the people telling Minn (and Minn telling herself) that she was overweight and could not eat butter or carbs. If you are looking for a fun little romance to escape from for a while this is your book. If you are looking for reality, depth or a detailed story line keep looking."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have loved all of her books.. I never enjoyed reading until I someone gave me one of her books!! I am now in love with reading!! Thank you Jennifer Crusie!! You Rock, Just sherrie"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"What I Loved: Minerva Dobbs is a fantastic lead character. She is funny, snippy, real, and just downright screwed up as the rest of us. I laughed a lot reading this book and I even cried at some points. I probably would have done exactly what she did if I was in the same predicament. At 33, perpetually single, she is a good reputation of most single women in her 30s. Calvin was a fantastic leading man. He was stubborn, charming, screwed up, and gets into plenty of situations that put him into hard situations. Those two together are the most fantastic couple I have read in a long time. I love Liza, Tony, Bonnie,Emilio, and Roger they were fantastic friends to Cal/Min. David/Cynthi were great \\"villains\\" and perfect thwarts along the way. The parents will just crack you up and the siblings are a big part of their life too. Everything meshes together really well.What I Liked: Everything! This truly was a great book:)Complaints: None :)Audiobook specific review: The narrator Deanna Hunt did a fantastic job. She did a great job with the book :)Why I gave it a 5: I liked everything about this book. It was such a fantastic read from beginning to end. You would not go wrong reading this book if you like romance, fun, and great couples!Who I would recommend this too: Contemporary, Chick-lit, and Romance readers would all love this!Author Website: http://www.jennycrusie.com/"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I just became a fan of Ms. Crusie after reading this book. She has those steamy scenes, which I don't need, but she makes me laugh so much. I love her writing, it is entertaining. I am glad to have found her. My daughter was struggling after moving out on her own and I gave her Bet Me after I read it and it was great to share the laughs and b.s. in this book with her. It cheered her up AND GOT HER BACK TO READING!! So now I will continue to feed her all of Crusie's books so she can be entertained and we have something to talk about(not the steamy scenes....)We love her spunky characters, how the women are always finding there own strengths and loving men in the process. Great Reads!!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love this book!! Love, love, love it!! It made me laugh and smile. I have read it about a dozen times now, and it never gets old!

The snarky quips kept me up well past my bedtime as I fell in love with the realistically flawed young adults looking for love while they came to terms with their own imperfections.Minerva \\"Min\\" Dobbs decided \\"The world was full of good men. Those days are gone\\" as she daydreamed of stabbing her currently-becoming-ex-boyfriend to death with her plastic swizzle stick for breaking up with her weeks before her sister's wedding. Just to ensure the universe has proved her point, she overhears the same ex a few minutes later bet Calvin Morrissey, hottest guy in the cheesy themed bar, that he can't get into Min's bed within a month. The beasts!Seizing the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, Min decides to encourage the seduction, ensuring she has a jaw dropping, mother-pleasing escort to the wedding with enough time left over to teach both men a lesson. Calvin's charm and polish crumble under Min's keen observance and ruthless honesty. The two end up developing an unlikely friendship and they find acceptance in each other's eyes for what they dislike most in themselves.Surrounding the unlikely duo are four close friends trying to look out for them, family trying to perfect them, and exes trying to win them back. And oh, a cat named Elvis.Cruise's style is fast-paced and humorous. Her characters find a way to be very human and relatable through their choices, self reflections and brutal honesty with each other. I was amazed at how much depth she was able to create in the characters without dragging the reader through an emotional minefield. The tone was light and upbeat ensuring a constant smile on my face as each character endeared himself to me.When you are ready to curl up with a good book, laugh out loud, and fall in love with new friends, Bet Me by Jennifer Cruise is a sure bet."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I loved this book the writing is wonderful and truly drags you into the story.

Charming story!I always listen to audio books on my commute and there are several Jennifer Crusie books available. I wish more authors would follow suit.

What could be better? There's even ice cream and a bit too much veal marsala. And some passionate sex. Really who could ask for anything more.

I must admit, I had trouble putting it down.A story about a gorgeouos serial dater who meets a plain \\"chubby\\" girl and end out out to dinner in part because of a bet. (Lots of bets of various sizes are made throughout this book and I think it works for this story.) As they have mutual friends that are involved, and a mutal love of the same restaurant, they end up seeing more of eachother over time and something starts to happen.They try to resist and you can almost feel the sexual tension in the story. Loved that. It's absolutely believe in spite of the \\"types\\" of people they are as Cruise doesn't a great job writing their story. You find many things about the characters lifes, parents, past relationships and I think that adds to the credibility of the match.Much drama and humor is added to the story with a jealous ex-boyfriend and girlfriend who will stop at nothing to keep them apart. They both have interesting families (mostly not in a good way), a sister's wedding to deal with, a sweet nephew, complimented by a great group of friends. It all adds to the charm.The only issue that I had with this story was the climatic ending. That was a little unreal and not the as romantic as I anticipated due to the amount of tension throughout the book....and I felt there was too much emphasis on Krispy Kremes. Perhaps I just don't get the draw of the donuts."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Loved this book. I love romance books where the doubtable love always end up to a spectacular love.

Later Min hears her ex making a bet with Calvin Morrisey. David bets that Cal cannot get Min into bed within a month's time. The bet is $10,000. but Min thought she heard $10. Furious, Min decides to use Cal for a month because she now needs a date for her sister's wedding. When Cal introduces himself and asks her out to dinner, she accepts. During dinner she realizes that she may not be able to hold out against this handsome man and decides to scrap her plan but fate will continue to throw these two together.I read another book by this author entitled \\"Welcome To Temptation\\" and I did not like it. I will always give an author another try so when I read the first chapter of \\"Bet Me\\", I thought I was in for a good read. Well, halfway through I was again bored with these quirky characters. I am not a sourpuss or a prude and I love \\"Sex In The City\\" but all these characters really needed to get a life. Min is voluptuous and is constantly bemoaning her weight. Min's mother constantly reminds her about her weight. Cal is a hit and run lover who cannot commit to a woman. One friend, Bonnie is living in a fairy tale world. Min's sister, Diana, is not a happy bride. Min's mother is a pain in the butt. Cal's mother is a self-centered witch. And we hear the same things over and over and over. The love scene finally arrives at the end of the book and that also is a big letdown.I now realize that there is no sitting on the fence with this author. You either like or dislike her work."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Cal bets his booze hounds buddies that he can get his ex booty call into bet and goes so far as to bet them 10 grand he can do it in a month.

His best friend Jules told me that he's going to have to borrow it from his Target visa if he loses."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I found Bet Me to be a huge disappointment. There were no quirky, funny secondary characters in this book like there had been in her others. All of the characters were lacking depth and fire. Even Jennifers' usual great dialogue was flat. From the moment the book started, you knew the ending, but there were never any curveballs thrown in along the way. And 3/4 of my way through the book, I still didn't feel any real chemistry between Min and Cal. Min is described as everything from being full figured to fat, but Cal seduces her with food every step of the way and uses Krispy Kreme donuts to tease her. What is sexy about that? I wanted to scream at her \\"Run for your life - you will die of a coronary before your 40th birthday if you stay with the guy!\\" If you want to read a fun Jennifer Crusie book - buy Welcome to Temptation or Faking It instead!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Wow, is this bad! What a waste time! You can't care about the characters because they are so brainless and in-humane you can't make a human connection. Jennifer, you can do better than this."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I don't normally read romance novels, but I'm in a book swap club and we were challenged to pick something that we wouldn't normally read. I found the story pretty far-fetched and the characters all sounded like the same person. All the voices seemed like slight variations of the main character. As long as the author was just writing story, it was an okay read, but as soon as the dialogue started, I really had to struggle to keep reading.It also probably doesn't help that I'm a statistician and the main character is an actuary who uses \\"statistical terminology\\" in her everyday conversations. I'm pretty sure the author did not study statistics, because this is how I imagine a non-statistician thinks statisticians speak, but the terminology was all wrong. But this is a point that probably won't bother most readers of this book.The number of times Krispy Kremes and chicken marsala are mentioned were irritating. Can't the characters eat anything else? This took place over a four week period and how many times did Min have chicken marsala? It had to be 2-3 times a week!I also found the shoe references pretty awful. When I think of a cool impractical shoe, I think of 4-inch Manolos, not clear plastic mules with molded cherries.I really found it hard to believe the author was a New York Times bestselling author, but I guess romance books are read more for the fantasy than as great literature. In truth, my idea of fantasy is more Sex and the City than this. This seemed more like a very weak Bridget Jones imitation."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I had never read this author before, just knew she was popular and I wanted a light read -- picked it up at the library. I could not get past the middle of the book, and that was a struggle to reach. The book was just extremely boring, full of tiresome cliches and unlikeable characters. The main character is thoroughly repellent and not admirable in any way. There is no motivation whatsoever for the male character to be interested in her. This is typical fairytale bad romantic (ie \\"date movie\\") garbage where some very unpleasant woman is pursued by some guy who loves her anyway and they all live happily ever after. This is not decent character development or writing. I don't know how the author got a job at a university, but I imagine she is laughing all the way to the bank by the money she gets from these formulaic novels with low standards. The \\"snappy dialogue\\" is typical of current poor-quality TV sitcoms, and is not how people in real life ever talk. This is just a book of one-liners and dislikable characters, and the author should go write for TV shows."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Although I am enjoying this story, the transcription errors that riddle this ebook version are driving me crazy. &#34;I'm&#34; routinely comes through as &#34;F'm&#34; or &#34;T'm&#34;. There are many other typos that appear to be the result of scanning the book and then failing to check the spellings that resulted. This indicates lousy quality control. The publisher should be ashamed, and Ms. Crusie should demand better treatment of her work."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie, Bet Me was a big disappointment. The gimmicky plot was bad enough (A grown man still betting on whether or not he'll score with a woman? Give me a break!), let alone the cloying cutesyness of the unending props, but what really killed it for me was that I simply didn't like these people. With two minor exceptions, they were whiney, immature, bitchy, bitter, and boring. The minor exceptions themselves were drearily smug. Not even Crusie's trademark style can save this one. Too bad."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was an engaging, light read. Crusie is good at writing snappy dialogue, but I could not get past her choice to give her 2 leading characters the very old-fashioned names- Minerva and Calvin! I kept imagining my grandparents, which frankly is not a picture you want in your head when you're reading a romance novel!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am such a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie, I have read all her books with true giddy excitment. Unfortunately this book did not give me that feeling, it was so bad I started to skim through the book, I have never done that with a Crusie book before. I almost felt like crying that was how upset I was with this book, I have re-read all her books several times, so me saying one of her books are bad is very tragic. I know I must sound so dramatic, but she is my favorite author and I feel I have been let down. I hate to say this but I will be very cautious about going out and buying her next book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am hitting myself for passing up this book many times. The shoes put me off from buying this. Don't MISS this book. I read it twice in one night. I love Min she's the sister or best friend I wish I had. The perfect book where you need an instant pick me up. I want more."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Judging by the cover of \\"Bet Me,\\" a silly looking pair of shoes, a chick-lit connoisseur could be excused for dismissing the book as another \\"Sex in the City\\" ripoff. But don't be fooled-this is one of the better books the genre has produced, and owes nothing to half-baked efforts that focus on rich beauties in the big city. Jennifer Crusie has a real knack for dialogue and plotting, and the heroine comes to life as far from perfect but without too many phony \\"quirks.\\" The ending especially is a cut above, sticking to the characters' flaws and principles without too much sugar-coating. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I'm a fan of contemporary fiction and not usually a romance reader...but now I'm happy I got the audio version of this book on a whim. I was so pleasantly surprised, I'm hooked on Jennifer Crusie stories now!The main characters in \\"Bet Me\\" are interesting and flawed - I especially like that the heroine struggles with insecurites about her appearance (like most real-life women) and isn't necessarily an effortless knockout like so many women in romances. Also, the storyline is not completely stereotypical - I was guessing until the end about how some of the threads would tie together. The supporting characters are interesting and entertaining, as well.My only criticism is about the constant \\"he said\\" and \\"she said\\" at the end of each line of dialogue - but maybe this was only present in the audio version for clarity. It did seem repetitious and unimaginative. Even a few \\"she replied\\" or \\"he asked\\" might have helped break the monotony. Even so, this was only a minor distraction, in my opinion. The story was so much fun and the characters so engaging that I still give the book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I digested this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. The dialogue was delightful, very funny and witty.Cal is a wonderful character. I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read Jennifer Crusie's other books. The secondary characters were also funny.This book is a real modern day fairy tale and I loved every minute of it. Jennifer Crusie's voice is here to stay. Also recommended are \\"Don't Call That Man\\", and \\"He Never Called Again.\\""},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I picked up this book, thinking it sounded pretty interesting, and wanting something light after all the thrillers I've been reading. This book did not disappoint! I could not put this book down! I was up until 2am reading!The characters were fun (although Crusie did not get into her sub characters stories - and that would have been good), hilarious and I loved that Cal was so into Min. I thought he was a true romantic. He made her feel gorgeous and sexy and what woman doesn't want that?If you are looking for something fun, light and with a little romance, BET ME is a book for you!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Great read - I stayed up until 3 so I could finish in one setting. Wonderful main characters that were so real and genuine they felt like a breath of fresh air in the world of 'cookie cutter' hero/ines. The author did a wonderful job of matching up this odd-ball pair with sly witt and laugh-out-loud humor. The secondary characters were intersting and multi-demensional, people you actually wanted to read about versus filler material. Crusie wrapped it all up with her killer writting style and so fun one liners i.e. &quot;Min's father met them in the hall, a lumbering man with a shock of blond hair and heavy white eyebrows who should have been hearty and welcoming but instead had the vaguely paranoid look of a sheepdog whose sheep were plotting against him.&quot;The reason I rated this a 4 is that the main character Min was overweight and could not be comfortable with herself (until the latter part of the book). Her boyfriend, Cal, was understanding, supportive, and completely comfortable with her size but she wasn't. As a result I felt uncomfortable for her through the majority of the book. I realize that the character was 'in process' and her outlook had changed dramatically by the end still this is why a 4 not a 5. Give me a chubby character who is comfortable in their identity and secure with their self image and you get a 5!This was my first of Crusie and it will not be my last, I plan on getting the rest of them and hoping that they all will be as fun, intersting, and entertaining as 'Bet Me' Worth your time and money!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book was wonderful. From start to finish, I was entertained and laughing all the way through. I fell in love with Min and Cal from the start. Min's story is a wonderful message to any woman who thinks they can't find a good man because they don't have the perfect body. Min and Cal's first kiss is probably one of my all time favorite love scenes. The ending of this book is absolutely hysterical and had me laughing out loud. (Not going to spoil it for those who havne't read the book) Anyone who regularly reads Jennifer Crusie's books will definately rate this one a 5. The only thing that I thought wasn't really necessary in the story was in the end where we find out what happens to everyone in the future. That was fun to read but the ending itself was good enough :-) Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I loved this book! It was funny and sweet and hot! I could not put it down! Cal and Min were so cute, determined not to be attracted to each other and constantly assuring the other that they weren't!A definite keeper!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"There hasn't been a bad Jennifer Crusie book. I appreciated the humor and the people. After all, life is full of all those people she introduced us to. Carbs, weight, appearance, diets, clothes. These are all topics of multimillion dollar industries. To have a man say, curves are good. Women lose weight for each other. To have a male give the encouragement for a woman to say, 'I am beautiful' is a rare and wonderful thing. To do so with humor, great shoes and an ensemble of good freinds is a delight. Too bad we don't have fresh Krispy Kreme where we live."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This woman has never let me down...Her writing is always hilarious and tightly plotted, and the characters are always quirky and loveable. And to correct a glaring mistake made in some readers' comments on this book: CAL DID NOT MAKE THE BET. Minn's scum of an ex-boyfriend did. To everyone else: Buy the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is so much fun! It is very romantic and hilarious!! I read this book in one sitting!! BUY THIS BOOK NOW!! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The book was adorable for about the first 10 chapters....then it's a spiraling descent into stupidity and repetition that could only end when one throws the book against the nearest wall. At first the story was witty and the characters so true-to-life. The one liners had me laughing out loud. I loved the heroine and rooted for her all the way. Then suddenly it all went wrong. The one-liners became annoying and the focus of the story went off course. Crusie writes with the sole purpose of creating a life her secondary characters...which boggles my mind. The story was then focused on Min's sister and her wedding. The main characters' relationship was never fully developed and Min went from being lovable to obnoxious. Cal developed into a pathetic guy with a puppy dog mentality of \\"I like big women.\\" The constant, and I do mean constant, references to Min's weight were unnecessary. You loved her from the start for who she was, not what she looked like.Oh, and did I mention the constant advertising for Krispy Kreme donuts? Chicken Marsala? Elvis Costello? Julia Roberts? Did I mention the jokes and the food references getting old? Again and again?And one more thing, the bet was the most confusing plot I've ever read. I've never heard of someone losing a $10,000 bet and chasing after the winner with a check to pay him off. If I had lost that big a bet, I'd change my phone number and stay out of sight."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Well, let me break it down to you the way I felt about the book as I was reading it. The beginning of the book was pretty good. With quick one liners and funny predicaments. I thought the book had real potential at that point, with the scene at the bar and the bet, etc. Then the entire theme dashing hero falls for her plain plump girl really hit you over the head - repeatedly. It isn't that I haven't read previous books about the ugly duckling getting the prince charming. It's just that it wasn't believable in this case. Even romance novel believable. Generally the plain girl isn't told over and over how unattractive she is without the reader still finding some qualities, physical and otherwise, in her that are attractive. Her eyes are gorgeous, her skin is luminous, or her smile lights up the room....she posseses some outstanding qualitiy that makes her worthy of heroine material. She might have have that dynamic personality or an umbeatable sense of confidence that compensates for her lack of beauty. But, in this book, I was constantly reminded of how unlovely this girl was. How lacking in confidence she was. How everyone found her so unattractive. It was hard for me to see why the hero found her attractive. Sure, they had some funny exchanges, but...come on...not enough to carry on a strong romantic attraction.And why as the hero constantly having to reassure her of how beautiful she was? Explain to her how she looked so \\"round\\" and plump and real, and that she was never going to be thin, but that she was beautiful anyway...was he her counselor? I mean, I'm all for a guy pumping up your self esteem, but this guy was took it as a second job, it was so over the top. It made you think that the physical attraction was too manufactured. Just what was it that liked about her?The weight issues in this book were over-emphasized to death. I don't mind reading about it in books, but this book took it to an extreme. It overshadowed talking about anything positive that the heroine had that would make somebody want to be with her.There was no secondary storyline. In Crusie's other novels, there generally is a murder story, an adulterous affair, or a mystery that is being conducted in parallel with the romance. Or rather, the romance develops as a by-product of that mystery. Here, there was absolutely no other subject other than the love affair between the two characters. Therefore, all the emphasis was placed on the romance, and the romance failed to entirely deliver.I'm not against this book. I'm all for satisfying the inner plain jane in every female reader by having the hot stud pick out the less dazzling beauty. But, his getting turned on by her \\"sturdy legs\\" and her admittedly unattractive wardrobe...I just wish the author had made the attraction a bit more convincing, that's all."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is so lame. I bought the Kindle version out of the rave review and the cheap price, but I couldn't believe I was reading a crap like this. It's full of cliche and unrealistic plots and characters. I love reading romance and enjoy watching romantic comedy movie, so I understand it can sometimes consist some coincidences and events just to add that romantic spice. And I think this book has a good potential to go on a movie if it were not so ridiculous and stupid. The characters are one dimensional and the entire story is surrounded with a silly bet, which is alright if the author can develop more depth on her story. The lines just keep jumping from Cal and Min and their silly friends, with coincidences and trashy comments. I gave it two stars for its sometimes funny lines, but other than that this book is totally waste of time. I would have gone for Sophia Kinsella over this."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I know I am a very small minority here, but I did not like this book. I found the characters to be flat and boring.Min's food fetish was annoying and, I must say, somewhat offensive. Why is it that the character without the perfect body is obsessed with food and has low self esteem? Is it not possible for a chubby woman to have interests that do not involve taste.Other than the job, which was purely background, Min did nt have a whole lot going for her. Did she travel? What kind of books did she read? Did she have any interests at all? I think her friend was right in saying that she brought nothing to the relationship with Cal.Cal was o.k., though he suffered a similar lack of character development. We know that he is gorgeous and likes to hit and run, but what else has he got?The writer did not show enough of either character to get me truly invested.I do not regret reading this book, but it was my first and last by this author."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is everything you expect from Jennifer crusie and more. This book was full of hilarious dialogues and characters. Every character is weird in their own way and real too. The important thing is that nobody is normal and that's the fun part because what's the fun in being normal?Cal and Min were great together. All their confortations from starting were full of witty dialogues and sexual tension. Both of their families were horrible. Min always used to ask her mother 'who are you and what did you do to my mother?' she was convinced her mother was really her step mother because her mother would never let her eat anything good. When she met Cal's family she thanked God for her own family because although her mother was interfering and dominating type but at least she wasn't as cold and heartless like Cal's.This Hilarious tale is full of Elvis's songs, Krispy kreme doughnuts, funky stylish shoes,a single intelligent cat, chicken marsala, a lovesick psyciatrist who kept analysisng everyone and Cal was her favourite subject,a fairy tale beleiving best friend and another protective fairy godmother of Min, a sister who is more excited about her wedding than about the man she is going to marry,a mother for whom food was enemy.I loved this story. it was hard for me to put it down before it was finished. Cal was Great and Min was sweet, inspite of her man hating attitude, but you can't really blame her after what she witnessed two men trying to do to her for a bet.Go for this one definately if you are Jennifer Crusie's fan and even if you are not and you would be one, if you like funny romances."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. It was a very fast read and kept my interest throughout the whole story."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love Jennifer Crusie's writing style and basically have brought all her books, even the older ones. This book was a return to the classic romantic tale with a modern fairy tale thrown in. I had pre-ordered this book and was not disappointed.I did not give it 5 stars because I am one of those women who likes my books to end with a husband, wife and kids. I know not every woman needs kids to be happy, but I just can't help it, I like my novels to end that way.Other than that very tiny preference, I loved this book. The hardcover price did not bother me at all, it was worth it. I am really looking forward to more of her books."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I fully admit that I like my fiction entertaining. That's it. Not fancy, thought-provoking or relevant. Just entertaining. This recommendation came to me through a ravelry.com (knitting) recommendation as the best of the author's work. While I haven't read any of her others yet, I can say that I now want to do so. As an avid reader in my mid-30s an undiscovered-by-me author is a dream come true. In terms of genres, Bet Me hits on both the Chick Lit and Romance side. If you haven't tried Cruise, bet on this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"wonderful, wonderful book. very funny, constantly moving and engaging, sexual tension very high. loved it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The plot here is Minerva overhears her ex-boyfriend bet a good-looking stranger in a bar ($10K) that he can't get her in bed within a month's time. Right from the description you know where this is going. Of course Minerva accepts a dinner invitation from the stranger with the idea of using him as well, but they become attracted to each other, and so forth. Nothing surprising.So why read it? Because it's hilarious. There are tons of great one-liners and sarcastic conversations to make it worth while. There are a lot of similarities here to the How To Lose a Guy In 10 Days, even some of the banter is the same, but well worth reading. And at almost 400 pages, it's full of wonderful vignettes and sub-stories that highly entertain."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Heroine: voluptuousActuary Minerva Dobbs is short a date for her sister's wedding, thanks to her no-good low-down boyfriend dumping her at just the wrong time, all because she wouldn't fall into bed with him. Her erstwhile almost-lover then bets notorious womanizer Calvin Morrissey $10,000 that Cal can't charm her into bed within a month. But beware a woman scorned! Min's onto their scheme and figures she can string handsome Cal along and get a meal or two, a date for that darn wedding, and the last laugh out of their little game.Trouble is, her heart, or at least her loins, tell her she wants this guy for real, but her so-sensible mind points out that nice \\"white-cotton-panty-and-bra-set\\" girls do not--can not--keep this kind of Adonis for life. And wager aside, the odds are stacked against their making it in the long term: He's beautiful; she's not. He's all charm, she's no-nonsense. He's triple fudge, she's plain vanilla. And don't even get them started on which Elvis is better.But will common sense win out over their hearts' desires? Don't bet on it.What worked for me:I thought this story was sweet and funny and felt like a Meg Ryan movie. And while some readers might feel like the plot was contrived in spots, I myself was fine with that for the most part. After all, keeping the hero and heroine out of each other's arms only raises the stakes and the tension.I, too, know the heartache of trying and failing to make Chicken Marsala \\"heart smart\\". Just can't be done.I don't want to give it away, but the epilogue made this particular curvy gal smile. It was perfect for the reader who requires her story be tied up in a neat little package with a perfect bow.Size-wise Min is very voluptuous, like an old 50s pinup and then some. I love that Cal loved her curves and stood up for her, reassuring Min that she could both be beautiful and eat bread and butter.What didn't work for me:I was so hungry after reading this book!What parents these people had. Poor Cal and Min! I wasn't entirely sold on all of their friends, either.I was didn't mind it, but some folks who are looking for a story along the lines of \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" might find most of this one too tame for them. Still, stick it out. It gets rather interesting at the end.Overall:\\"Bet Me\\" is just begging for a production company to take a gamble on it and make it into a movie.

In this story, a young woman is discouraged by the dating scene, after being dumped by a boyfriend for not having sex with him throughout their entire relationship. She then meets the most gorgeous man ever, Cal Morrissey, soon after that breakup. Their relationship grows through a series of bets, which puts Cal deeper and deeper into trouble with Minerva Dobbs, the young woman in question.Cal and Min meet in the worst possible way - through a bet. But as they get to know each other as friends, the two fall in love, but refuse to admit it to each other. As their friends watch with amusement the charade that Cal and Min go through, pretending they are only friends and that they cannot stand each other, Cal and Min slowly realize that they can't live without each other. But as their ex's try their best to keep the two apart, Cal and Min's best friends try to decide whether the two belong to each other.The book is told in the typical style that \\"chick lit\\" is famous for, with a humorous tone and a lot of comic relief. While I found this book to have gone on a little too long, I still enjoyed it and do recommend it to others who delight in reading books in this genre. It's a fast read and although not the perfect book, I think readers will enjoy getting to know Minerva Dobbs and maybe even relating to her, as Min tries to find that perfect fairy tale romance and happy ending that all of us hope to find in our own lives."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Min Dobbs is a thirtysomething actuary who believes fairy tales are for other people. Her mother harps about carbs, her sister is perfect, and Min wonders if she'll always be alone. Min's also under the gun -- her perfect sister is getting married in three weeks, Min's just broken up with David the creep, and Min just can't tell her mother that she has no date for the wedding.Cal Morrissey is gorgeous. Cal has his own challenges in life, though, one of which is David the creep, who also is one of Cal's firm's clients. David attempts to get Cal to bet him he won't get Min into bed with him in 30 days. It all starts one night in a local bar.Throw two interfering mothers, best friends with their own thoughts on the burgeoning romance between Min and Cal, chicken marsala, Elvis (Presley and Costello,) a one-eyed cat, and two people who have no idea they're slowly falling in love into the mix, and you have \\"Bet Me\\". It's funny, it's fast-paced, it will grip you from the first paragraph, and it's Jennifer Crusie at her best.Obviously, Ms. Crusie does not need another five-star review. Her multiple New York Times bestsellers speak much more loudly than I can. At the same time, she represents the best of the genre, and she's what all romantic comedy novelists should aspire to. In closing, I have purchased seven copies of this book as of this writing. I keep giving them away to women who tell me they \\"don't read romances,\\" then find themselves in the romance section of the bookstore after they've polished off \\"Bet Me\\"."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"In Bet Me by Jennifer Cruise, Minerva Dobbs does not believe in fairy tales. But when her boyfriend of two months dumps her, her life will change. A dinner date that same night with Calvin Morrissey is just the beginning. Cal also does not believe in love or fairy tales but Minerva's shoes just blow him away. They resign themselves never to see each other again. A bet, Krispey Kreme doughnuts, her jealous ex-boyfriend, a determined psychologist, and a frisky cat among other things start to change their minds. They have to figure out if they are ready for the biggest game of them all, true love.I loved Min because she always tried to be true to herself even though her mother Nannette wanted her to be thin. She had to learn how to stand up to her mom and embrace her true self. Cal taught her to love herself again. He wouldn't put up with any excuses.The storyline and characters were very real. I loved seeing them change and grow. Min does a complete 360 by the end of the story. It was not easy work. Moms always think that they know best and Min's mom was no exception. The mother's goals for her daughter only hindered her true growth and change. Min had to deal learn what she needed for self was not necessarily what her mom wanted but she had to be gentle with her mom at first.This book made me laugh, cry, and was very difficult to put down. Jennifer Cruise's writing style is easy to follow as well as enjoyable to read. She really lets you feel what the characters feel. Another thing I really liked was that the characters were not perfect. They made mistakes and the emotions ran from joyous to fuming anger. It was not uncommon to have two characters going thorough the spectrum of emotions at the same time.I highly recommend this book to hopeless romantics or anyone who likes a real romance novel. Every thing that happened felt right and never was rushed or out of place. It was a good rainy day; snuggle under the covers, and leaving you warm and fuzzy type book.Reviewed by KristaFor BBW Reviews"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is the first Jennifer Crusie book I've read, and it will definately NOT be the last. I could not put this book down. Not only were the characters on a whole, witty, well-written, and real, but the star of the show for once is not a little bitty perfect woman with \\"slim hips and a narrow waist\\". Min Dobbs is built like a real woman -- she is not a toothpick -- and through the book both she and others recognize her beauty.Cal Morrisey is every woman's dream guy and the chemistry created between he and Min is electric. The interactions between the two had me laughing out loud. This book is a must read for anyone who has ever played the dating game. It will make you believe in true love and fairy tales all over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie is a master at creating believable and fully developed characters. If that's all she had to rely on, her books would still be good. Add snappy dialogue to the list and you're in for a good read.Minerva Dobbs is not what we've come to expect from Chick Lit heroines. She's round and soft (pudgy if you have to label) and she's been dumped by her boyfriend of three months, just weeks before her sister's wedding. All because she won't sleep with him.When Min overhears her ex make a bet with another man that he can't get her into bed in a month, she's livid. Her actuary brains cools down as she looks at all sides of this. She needs a date for her sister's wedding in three weeks. She has no intention of sleeping with this guy, and just to punish him, she can string him along for 3 weeks and dump him.What she doesn't count on is that gorgeous Calvin Morrisey has so many hidden layers. She tries to resist her attraction to him and remember that bet. The fact that Cal has a bad habit of making side bets on her throughout the book doesn't make it too hard for Min to stay focused--until Cal short circuits her with his kisses.Cal's certainly not interested in getting involved with anyone, and even though he continues to remind Min's ex that he did not make a bet to sleep with Min, no one will believe him.Lots of fun, silliness, smooching, denial, secrets, and eventually, yes, sex and love ever after. The story has its flaws, but who cares when Crusie gives us an irreverent look at how the universe can maim us if we don't pay attention to love."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I had read a lot of good reviews about this book, so I had high hopes for it. Now I am halfway through it, and don't know if I can force myself to read the rest. It is so BORING. They do and say the same thing almost every page. Minerva (wth is up with that name? I know they explain it, but still...) and Cal somehow keep winding up together, even though they say they'll never see each other again. Then all they do is eat and Cal thinks about how sexy Min looks when she eats. Yeah. And Min is bitchy to Cal, but he doesn't seem to mind. Then there are the ridiculous characters of David and Cynthie, who are plotting to break them up. The obvious \\"evil doers\\" to create problems for them, I guess. One of the worst scenes in the book is when Cal and Min are on a picnic, and every time Min opens her mouth to speak, Cal shoves a piece of doughnut in her mouth. I don't know if that was supposed to be sexy or funny, but it just grossed me out, and I would be pissed if someone did that to me. I gave this book 2 stars because some of the one liners were almost funny, mostly with Minerva's mother and sister. In conclusion, do not buy this book unless you like reading the same thing over and over."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Minerva Dobbs has self-image issues, which is not shocking considering the grief her mother gives her over every carb she puts in her mouth. Min's a sensible girl with cheeky taste in shoes, and she's met her match in Cal Morrisey, who's hot enough to melt the cherries on her shoes.After being dumped, Min's in a man-hating state of mind the night she overhears her ex bet Cal that Cal won't be able to get \\"frigid\\" chubby Min into bed within a month, and is too furious to hang around and listen to the outcome. So when Cal approaches her a few minutes later, she can only assume the worst.Horrible families, ten-dollar bets, and over-protective friends aren't enough to fight the fates that seem to want Cal and Min together. Bet Me is a wonderfully light and enjoyable read. If I had a rating system, this one would get top marks!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was the first romance novel I've read in quite a while, and I'm glad I did. As a former Ohioan, the first thing that caught my interest was the setting (Cruisie doesn't specify where, but my guess would be Cincinnati).But the things that kept me reading were the interactions of the characters. I liked it that Cal and Min both had friends and families. I liked the dialogue. I liked the changes of viewpoint (particularly Cal's--I've never read a romance novel before that let a reader into the hero's head).But I especially liked the fact that the main characters are not perfect.Cal has problems and buttons, but he's learned to deal, and he's a nice guy (!).Min's a heroine that an average reader could possibly identify with. She's not beautiful, but the hero thinks she is. And by not getting specific about numbers, Cruisie allows the reader to sympathize with Min, whether she's a size 20 or a size 12 (trying to squeeze into a size 2 world).I also think this would make a fun TV movie."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Being a recent college graduate, I haven't read books for pleasure in years. So when I got a job with considerable down time, I picked this up at my local grocery store on a whim. I LOVED this book. It's far and away my new favorite book of all time. I couldn't wait to finish reading it just so I could read it over again. And I NEVER read books over again. Now I am reading Jennifer Crusie's books one after the other (with Faking It and Welcome to Temptation also being excellent, and Fast Women being quite good). Jennifer Crusie is a spectacular author, and out of all of her fantastic books, Bet Me stands out on top. Not only is Bet Me hysterically funny, romantic, and well thought-out, but the fact that Min was a chubby heroine also did wonders for my self esteem (as I'm no bean pole, either).

David was a sleaze, but Cal is close to the real fairy tale prince. And Min can't afford to have her heart broken again.She may think she's fat, but Cal thinks Min is about perfect. If she'd only wear clothes that show off her figure rather than hide it. He turns on the charm not to win the bet because he wouldn't really bet on getting a woman into bed, but because he's attracted and ready to move on with his life. But Cal has his own issues and he's not sure he can deal with a woman who's always rejecting him, who likes Elvis Presley, or who keeps asking him strange questions about secrets. Still, fate seems to have plans of its own and Cal and Min can't seem to stay apart even when they try. Of course, things get serious when Min's ex-boyfriend and Cal's ex-girlfriend gang up to break up the new couple.Author Jennifer Crusie creates a fresh and contemporary telling of the cinderella myth. Although the shoes are no longer glass slippers but [attractive] fruit-enhanced pumps, and the wicked stepsisters are transformed into ex's, it's still the classic fairy tale--but told with Crusie humor and insights into the human condition. Min's insecurities about her weight, her issues with her mother, and her fears about her future all ring true. And it's refreshing to see a romance heroine who doesn't think that instant pregnancy is a great thing.(...)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book was hilarious from start to finish. Bet Me kept me wanting more and was a fast moving book. The characters were realistic and had minds of their own. Looking forward to another book from Jennifer Crusie."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Read this book if you enjoy funny, sexy, witty characters and writing. You will chuckle and not even realize that time is passing quickly - I finished this book in one day - it was good and I definitely recommmend it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet me was a great read! I read it in one sitting. I was so looking forward to reading this book and I was not disappointed. If you like quirky characters and funny dialogue this is a book for you. One of Jennifer Cruise's best."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Reading this story is like eating a box of your favorite chocolates. Delicioius! The first book of Ms. Crusie's that I ever read was &quot;Welcome To Temptation&quot; and it was 5+ stars funny and hot. It got me looking up everything Crusie had ever written previously and reading them all. &quot;Bet Me&quot; wasn't up there with &quot;Welcome To Temptation&quot; or &quot;Fast Women&quot; in plot depth and complexity, but it was a thoroughly enjoyable and funny read. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Once I had this book in my hands, I did NOT put it down until I had finished. Reading it from cover to cover. And when I finished? I wanted to read it again. I enjoyed the ride that much, and was close to wanting to highlight my favorite parts. Thankfully, I stopped myself.I found this book to be worth the wait, and up to par with Crusie's other works. It was everything a fun-filled ride should be: light hearted, witty, honest, and romantic. The character of Min was realistically crafted, and a true woman. Cal viewed her the way any woman wants to be seen, and he himself wasn't without flaws.When I find myself wanting to be part of the core characters lives for longer than the duration of the book, I view that as a good sign. I didn't want the story of Min and Cal (and their friends) to end. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"BET ME is as well-crafted as any of Crusie's later novels, but has the lighthearted approach to life of her early books. I kept grinning throughout the book; my husband glanced over at me, said \\"Oh, another Crusie\\", and immediately understood why. BET ME isn't as sexy as Crusie's most recent books, but makes up for it with sensuality. The descriptions of food are mouthwateringly evocative.February is dark and dreary; a new Crusie brings some light into the month."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is one of my favorite books ever!

I was LOLing and slapping my carb-full thighs through out this book. Min was hilarious. I am lucky enough to have girlfriends like Bonnie and Liza, I just wish they were all close enough to do If Dinners:-( Cal was an ass-in-shining armor, but I loved how Cruise made him fall for Min and I appreciated his interesting take on chivalry! The plotting was beyond amazing and so unexpected in so many places. It never got predictable. I loved both Cyn's and Tony's theories of love -I was taking notes! Cruise showed love from every side: scientific, random, fairytale, lust, as well as the dissolution of a relationship. I snort-cried through the wedding ceremony!My only issue is how the word \\"bitch\\" was thrown around so causally and constantly throughout this book. I was really bothered by it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"My wife is a Romance Author and she has said to me that she believes that Bet Me is one of her keep books that she loves the dialog and the characters in Bet Me.

It's not deep literature no, but the characters seem a little more real that your usual romance novel. Min and Cal are not the princess and prince you normally see in similar books.

Jennifer Crusie's characters are fun and interesting, not fake and perfect."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I read this book when it was first released and have read it three more times since. If you want a book to end by giving you a really good feeling inside then this is the book for you.

It was my first Jennifer Crusie novel and I was not disappointed. Like others I could not put this book down. I related with the characters, I laughed, and I cheered. This book will not disappoint it is up in my Top 10."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Lately I've been feeling a bit blue. Nothing desperate. Just in need of some cheering up, some laughter, something bright inside amid all this dreary weather we're enduring outside. I found myself craving it every night when I settled down to read and just not finding it in the books stacked around me. Then about month ago Keishon over at Avid Book Reader reviewedManhuntingby Jennifer Crusie. I love Keishon's reviews and eclectic taste and I remembered I'd been wanting to give Crusie a try for awhile now. I asked for suggestions in the comments there and got several good ones. The consensus there and on a few other sites I checked was that BET ME is widely regarded as one of Crusie's best titles. So on my next trip to the library I picked it up and settled in that night, not sure exactly what to expect, but hoping for the best.Minerva Dobbs is ready to kill her suddenly ex-boyfriend David when he dumps her in a crowded bar a couple of weeks before her sister's wedding. Flanked by her two best friends, Liza and Bonnie, Min tries to focus on the fact that she never liked David much anyway and she's actually quite relieved to be rid of the smarmy loser who insisted she stay on a strict diet and always picked the restaurants they went to. At the same time, in another corner of the bar, Calvin Morrisey is happy to be rid of his marriage-hungry former girlfriend and is looking forward to just running his company and spending time with his buddies. He is neither amused nor interested when David Fisk bets him $10,000 he can't make it with Min within a month. Lucky for Min, she overhears the conversation and determines to beat (and hopefully humiliate) them both at their own game. So when Cal approaches Min in an attempt to get away from David, the game is on and he doesn't even know it. What he does know is this woman wants to be with him approximately as much as he wants to be with her, which is to say not even a little bit. Also, there is nothing exciting or colorful about her except the unlikely and impractical shoes she's got on. But he asks her to dinner anyway and she inexplicably accepts. Hilarity, heat, and shenanigans ensue.Jennifer Crusie had me from page one. I liked Min and Cal so much it was perfectly delicious watching them push each other's buttons and alternately despise and surprise each other. I liked all four of the best friends--particularly the sappy-but-impossible-to-dislike Bonnie and Roger, determinedly pursuing their happily ever after no matter how hard their well-meaning friends tried to convince them it doesn't exist. Yes, it was utterly predictable fluff. But the writing was surprisingly deft and the characters were no cardboard cutouts. Every now and then I'd run across a sentence that was at once airy and light and perfectly placed to resonate with the reader or sketch out what was going on between characters at the time. There were a couple of \\"villains\\" that behaved just as you might expect, but even they turned out to be grayer than I thought. But secondary characters aside, Min and Cal make this romantic comedy. They're real and fully-fleshed out and they have histories and families and careers and it all comes into play as they try and fail to remain detached from each other. So much of why I had a ridiculously good time reading BET ME was the nonstop humor. An early example from that first dinner:Cal turned and saw Emilio, this time with a fragrant platter of chicken marsala, golden-brown filets and huge braised mushrooms floating luminously in dark wine sauce.\\"Oh, my Lord,\\" Min said.Emilio beamed at her as he served. \\"It's a pleasure to serve someone who appreciates food. Taste it.\\"Min cut into the chicken and put a forkful in her mouth. She looked startled and then she closed her eyes and began to chew, her face flushed with pleasure. When she'd swallowed, she looked up at Emilio, her eyes shining. \\"This is incredible,\\" she said, and Cal thought, Me, look at me like that.\\"Try the mushrooms,\\" Emilio said, happy as a half-Italian clam.\\"Go away,\\" Cal told him, but Emilio stayed until Min had bitten into one of the huge mushrooms and told him with heartfelt passion that he was a genius.\\"Can I get some credit for bringing you here?\\" Cal said when Emilio was gone.\\"Yes,\\" Min said. \\"You are a genius at restaurants. Now be quiet so I can concentrate on this.\\"Cal sighed and gave up on the conversation for the rest of the meal. There was a skirmish at the end when Min tried to insist on separate checks, but Cal said, \\"I invited you, I pay. Back off, woman.\\" She looked as though she were going to argue for a moment, and then she nodded. \\"Thank you very much,\\" she told him. \\"You've given me a lovely meal and a new favorite restaurant,\\" and he felt appreciated for the first time that night.When they left, she kissed Emilio on the cheek. \\"Your bread is the greatest, Emilio, but the chicken is a work of art.\\" Then she kissed him on the other cheek.\\"Hey,\\" Cal said. \\"I'm right here. I paid for the chicken.\\"\\"Don't beg,\\" Min told him and went out the door.\\"Morrisey, I think you just met your match,\\" Emilio said.\\"Not even close,\\" Cal said, grateful to be without her for a moment. \\"This was our first, last, and only date.\\"\\"Nope,\\" Emilio said. \\"I saw the way you looked at each other.\\"\\"That was fear and loathing,\\" Cal said, opening the door.\\"God, you're dumb,\\" Emilio said, and Cal ignored him and went out into the dark to find Min.Sigh. I loved this book. Clearly a case of the right one at the right time. I took it back to the library knowing I would need to go out soon and procure my own copy because I can tell I'll want to revisit these characters. I laughed so much reading it and by the time I finished everything was bright and lovely inside once more.Note: I went on a bit of a Crusie binge after this and, four books in, BET ME is far and away my favorite. Definitely the best of the lot."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I usually don't delve too deeply into the love stories, however, this is a fun read. This book travels through the relationship from start to finish, and is based around the guy being \\"bet\\" to get a date with the main female. This is an interesting cast to follow. Both main characters have real families, with real problems. And that follows them into their own relationship issues too. The book is interesting, but light-hearted at the same time with the main characters love of silly shoes! Good book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Before reading 'Bet Me' I had already been a huge fan of Jennifer Crusie. I had read all the books she had released so far, and I was completely in love with all of them, so you can imagine how excited I was to be reading 'Bet Me' for the first time. Little did I know that this book would seriously become my absolute favorite!The characters were great, the story was brilliant, everything about this book was absolute GENIUS!! And I may be overexaggerating, but there's just no other way to describe it. Even though it bugged me that Min was in so much denial even when proof that Cal was perfect for her was staring her right in the face, I still loved her and felt for her because she was going through sooo much. And I absolutely loved Cal, he was hilarious! This is the first book to ever make me laugh out loud, and being the huge romantic that I am, the love between those 2 touched my heart very much. Jennifer Crusie is the one author I can count on to give me my 'romance fix' with her wonderful stories, but this book hit me the most in the best way possible. I love this story and Ms. Crusie so much, and I can guarantee that after reading 'Bet Me', you will too. :o)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I LOVE Jennifer Crusie but she is at her best with Bet Me! I could not put the book down, in fact I stayed up all night reading it. I have enjoyed the quick wit and dialogue of all Crusie's books, but my favorite by far is Bet Me. I have bought copies for all the women in my life who have in turn bought copies for all the women in their life! I haven't met a person who didn't love this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Rather than retelling the plot, I'll focus my short comments on my reaction/review of the novel:I really enjoyed this novel with all of its sauciness and sexual tension. This book, more than any others I've read in awhile, really builds the chemistry between the two characters so that you can't put it down! If you're wanting some good, escapist reading, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Min Dobbs has had it with her stuck up ex-boyfriend, her weight-obsessive mother, her sleazy future brother-in-law, and her ugly apartment. Then one night at the bar she overhears her ex-boyfriend, David, making a bet with one Calvin Morrisey. The terms? Cal has to get Min in bed within a month. Outraged, Min decides to string Cal along through at least one miserable date, before parting ways. What she doesn't expect is to fall head over heels with commitment-phobe Cal. Suddenly he's feeding her Krispy Kremes, buying her perfect shoes, and belting out Elvis in a crowded restaurant. Despite meddling exes, Cal's frigid family, and her overprotective best friend, will Min finally find her fairy tale? And will Cal be able to risk it all for love? Crusie will delight readers with her trademark humor and witty dialogue in this novel about a pleasantly plump sweetheart and her playboy prince.I'll admit that this book was not what I would call true-to-life. After all, I've never met someone as perfect as Cal (who assures weight-conscious Min that men prefer women to be \\"soft and round\\" and sexy is all in the head *sigh*). But, Min and Cal's relationship is pretty realistic. Crusie demonstrates how love doesn't necessarily happen at first sight (i.e. the hilariously horrendous first date), but takes time and effort. Min may be funny and smart, but she's insecure about her appearance, a feeling almost all women can relate to. And despite his confident outlook, Cal has some family/childhood issues that come into play as well.I love Jennifer Crusie and \\"Bet Me\\" is a fabulous example of her ability to tie in romance, humor, and wonderful characters into a great read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Min and Cal's relationship isn't off to such a great start when Min 'overhears' him and his friends making a bet on whether he can bring her home. But as the book continues and these two fight and fall in love, I couldn't stop reading. The story is funny (very very funny), romantic, and very honest. Min and Cal get input from family and friends, but in the end it's only how they see each other that counts. Also, after reading some of the sexy scenes, I'll never look at a Krispy Kreme the same!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I picked up the book one afternoon and didn't put it down until almost 7am the next morning.Min is anything but perfect and fun. And she wears great shoes! What woman can't relate to that?Calvin, the main hunk, is everything we hope he is and more. Through in some food, some crazy and loyal friends, an overbearing mother and Elvis, and you have a romance comedy that you just can't stop reading.It breaks the rules to the traditional romance novel and I love it for it.It was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Oh, for all us hopeful romantics out there, this is the book. When you find yourself down and discouraged about finding your prince and fairytale ending, read this book. It definitely reminds you that fate works in mysterious ways and that ultimately, when \\"the one\\" comes along, fate takes over and handles everything for you.I absolutely loved the story, not just for its fairytale story and ending, but because it could happen, it's not too far out there to the point where it just gets your hopes up for nothing. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love this book! This was the second Jennifer Crusie book that I read, but it got me addicted to all her other books. She is one of my favorite authors. It is a very funny read and very well written. It gets better every time I read it. A must read if you love one of a kind shoes, Krispy Kremes, wild kitties, chubby girls or Elvis. Min is my hero."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is a pleasure to read, especially for fans of romance. And for fans of Chic Lit. And for fans of funny, witty dialogue full of a surprising amount of social commentary and wisdom for the modern woman. This wonderfully original slant on the old fairy tale examines the barriers we erect for ourselves to stop us from really falling in love. The genius of this book is that it comes back to touch you when you're least expecting it, and you realize how true-to-life Crusie's recipe for love can be!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I had previously picked up Crusie's \\"Crazy for You\\" and \\"Welcome to Temptaion.\\" I found them to be slighlty entertaining but really just romances disguised as contemporary; nothing too exciting or interesting and mostly predictable. I'm a big fan of chick lit so I enjoy comedy intertwined with romance but not the Harlequin type. This book, which I read in one day as I could not put it down, was HIGHLY entertaining and enjoyable. It did not dissapoint and the I felt the plot was unique and refreshing. The characters were all well developed and therefore you enjoyed them... in fact, it made me feel like I was part of the group (and I wouldn't mind having one just like it! LOL) Although there are parts that are overdone, Cynthie and David for example, the overall effect is definitely one to entertain. If you like this book, check out the works of Janet Evanovich and/or Whitney Gaskell."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I enjoyed this read, because it was a light way to read through my work week. Each chapter introduced a new side of each character, and it kept me reading and wanting more."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I totally loved reading this book. It was an easy, enjoyable read that you can sit back and enjoy without putting a lot of thought into the book. The characters are able to put chills down your arms when you read about their feelings for each other. I absolutely loved reading this book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've gotten into chick lit over the last year or so and have been exploring new authors. I picked up this book based on some viewers reviews and LOVED it! I've re-read it at least 4 or 5 times already and still enjoy it.It's a great story with real live, warm, characters who are relateable and likeable, but certainly not perfect. Some of the storyline had me laughing out loud and some of it had me staying up way to late to read it. It's a bit more relateable then some of the other books in this genre and features some great writing and snappy dialogue between the characters. None of them are one-dimensional and all are relateable in some way.It's wonderfully written and by far, my favorite Jennifer Cruise book. I hope her future writings are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was an awesome book! The best book I have read in a very long time. This book just touched me. It made me want to read it slower because I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the characters. It has humor and I'd be laughing out loud and grinning the whole time! It was such a good story. I am buying and reading more Jennifer Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Hey all you Big Beautiful Women. . .this story will make you feel great! Sorry skinny gal's. . . you will enjoy it too!This was my introduction to Jennifer Crusie! What a great read! I was tired of reading all the gore of crime books and needed a fun reprieve. THIS WAS A GOOD BET! Now, I am hooked on reading all Crusie's books (in copyrighted order!).As for the story, you will find characters with true emotions and warm personalities. The endings may be predictable, but that will put a smile on your face as you finish the story."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Calvin Morrisey cannot say no to a bet, not to save his life. This man will bet on everything, but truly, it's part of his charm.Minerva Dobbs calculates the odd, lives within nice parameters until she meets the Heartbreak King, then she's all-in.The story opens with a break-up scene. Min won't sleep with David, so he's cutting the relationship short and only a few short weeks before she needed a date for her sister's wedding. That's when she sees him, Cal Morrisey. A man with the reputation of a love-\`em-and-leave-\`em sort. After a lengthy discussion with her friends, Min approaches Cal only to mistakenly overhear a bet between David and Cal. Frustrated and hurt, Min sees a way to pay them all back. Calculating the odds of success she works the bet in her favor. She thinks.This hysterical romp will grab your attention. It's a one-sitting read. Becareful where you read it, because there are many places you will actually laugh out loud at the antics of Cal, Min, and their friends. In this one novel, you get Elvis preoccupation (both of them), one-eyed felines, shoe-fetishes,101 things you never knew to do with Krispy Kremes and much much more. This is a must have for anyone interested in romantic comedy. Yet again, Jenny Crusie steals our hearts with truly magnificent characters, who make us yearn for, laugh for, and hurt for them. This is a Five Angel Recommended Read if I ever saw one."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read!!! I couldn't it down. I actually laughed out loud, and I kept a grin on my face the entire time. This is totally and completely a must-read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Cruise did an excellent job with creating belieavable characters. I became totally engrossed in Minerva's story. I found myself laughing out loud in several scenes. This was definately a great read and I'll be going back to read some of Cruise's earlier works."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"It took me forever to find the time to get a healthy start on this book but lo and behold jury duty rolls around and man am I glad it did! This is a great read and a terrific story. I enjoyed reading about a curvy woman who called the shots and was able to step up to the plate when it came down to the wire.As hopeless of a romantic I am, I was able to identify with Min and the girls very quickly. And the banter between her and Cal trying to convince each other that their very presence disgusted them was right on par with true love. In addition to the witty conversation and the richly detailed scenes, the book moves with a quick pace to keep your interest and move the story along.This is my first novel that I read by Crusie and I am encouraged to read more. It was a perfect book in a day read and I recommend it for people who can laugh and learn that love is stubborn, maybe more stubborn than we are ourselves."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I checked this book out at my local library, it was a new issue, so I could only have it for 7 days...what with work and children and life, I didn't quite finish it so I kept it until I had finished and paid the fine! Well worth it, I must say! I loved the characters (I can picture each one of them in my head!) and I thought her dialogue was very, very funny. In fact, the funniest of all...\\"Well, they let me eat bread...\\" had me laughing out loud at 1:00 AM with my DH snoring beside me. I am anxious to reading more of her books and hopefully will enjoy them all as much."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Minerva made me feel so good about myself! Have you ever battled with your mom--especially during stressful times like weddings? And felt guilty about it? Worried about what a man thought when you took your dress off? Minerva worries about all these things, too, but Cal loves her from the get-go--all of her. Read this book if you want to laugh and smile, and generally be happy about love and life. One of my fave Crusie's!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I LOVE this book. Really, really, REALLY love it.The best thing about this book is how straightforward it is: it's a classic, funny romance. Crusie isn't trying to explore any deep issues or confuse the reader with a complicated plot, a sideline mystery, or tons of characters. We get Min and Cal, two very likeable, believable characters, falling in love and that's more than enough to keep your interest.The dialogue is sharp and funny and the build-up to Min and Cal finally really getting together is perfectly paced. The love scene is sublime. Even Min and Cal's fights made me smile.I've read all of Crusie's books, and this one was absolutely my favorite. I truly have nothing negative to say about it. It's the best contemporary romance novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am a huge JC fan and so have been saving this book for a good holiday read. Sadly it was not as good as her previous works. Maybe JC took on board the comments made in relation to 'Faking It' - too confusing and having too many characters. Sadly I felt she may have dumbed this book down and made everyone too one dimensional. Did anyone else think that Bonnie was Charlotte from Sex in the City (without her fantastic manic side?) or that another outspoken redhead friend was just tired?Don't get me wrong - I will still buy all of JC books. On anyone else this review would have been 5 star. I just expected more orginality I guess."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Reading the reviews, I was sooo excited about this book. It's nice, silly, typical chick lit, but too many things annoyed me about it.First, it's just too long. The 'ole cat & mouse game only goes on for so long, especially when nothing else is happening in this plot.Min & Cal have a colorful array of friends, but very little character exploration is done with them. It makes you re-read dialogue between them because nothing has stood out between the pack.I recommend the movie \\"Down With Love\\" if you like this book. It reminded me a lot of the movie, only I liked the movie much better.Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy a lot of the book. Min's character is real & great! I really dig that strange cat, Elvis, too. She & Cal are fun to read as they go at it. Their fights are silly & funny, yet witty & intelligent.This is my first time reading Cruise & because I found some really good elements to this novel, I think I'll try her again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie has written many books. Having read most of them, I can say that while a few have been dreadful, most of her books have been quite good, and some of them have been brilliant.BET ME falls into the brilliant category.BET ME is the best of that notorious category known as chicklit.The plot here is not linear or predictable...the gimmick which forms the hook of the story is original and amusing...the characters are real and endearing...and the dialogue--well, the dialogue is honed and sparkling. Typical of Crusie's writing, the laughs here are quick and genuine.At her best--and BET ME is among her best work--no author does it better than Jennifer Crusie."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me is quite similar to the wonderful Welcome to Temptation - Little League, icy mothers, difficult sisters, improbably handsome hero, stray animals - but still very enjoyable, with witty dialogue and a fun plot. I do think, though, that once you've read several Crusie novels you notice the same phrases and expressions cropping up. I think she's a brilliant writer but I'd like to see her do something more original. How about it, Jennifer?"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"What a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon! I could not put it down. My old favorite was &quot;Crazy For You&quot; but the characters in &quot;Bet Me&quot; were so colorful and found myself sympathizing with Min. Is this going to be made into a movie, as the credits in the front of the book suggest?? I sure hope so!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is an absolute gem of a book. Min is everywoman and the way she deals with so many of our issues is, well, justinspirational. Although Min was never a doormat, it's great fun watching her flex her muscles as she gradually realizes that she doesn't have to put up with all that stuff cluttering up her life -an obnoxious boyfriend, a toxic mother, her own negative body image, well-meaning yet interfering and slightly loopy friends.She's just learning to know and love herself when Cal comes into her life. And what a perfect reward for all her pains Cal is - better than Krispie Kremes. (Vegas Here I come) *ahem*Min and Cal's relationship is so skillfully developed thatI didn't even notice how long Crusie made us wait for one of her famous &quot;hot&quot; scenes until it finally happened. And the dog we've come to expect is in this case a cat - but what a cat.I just loved this funny and wickidly sharp book and I know it's one I'll read again and again - especially when the old self-esteem needs a boost!Well said....Diana"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Is there such a thing as a fairy tale romance? Does anyone ever live happily ever after? Actuary Minerva Dobbs finds out in BET ME, the latest in a string of Chick Lit books written by the popular author Jennifer Crusie. In this story, the focus is on a young woman who does not wear a size six dress nor cares about how she appears to the opposite sex. She is tired of the dating scene and of her criticizing mother, and is ready to move in with a cat.The story opens in a bar in New York with Minerva and her soon-to-be ex-boyfriend David breaking up. Apparently he is not happy that she has refused to have sex with him during their entire dating relationship, and he decides it's time to move on. Not that Minerva cares; she is actually relieved. She was tired of David's advice on how to lose weight and what not to eat, and wished that he could have accepted her the way she was. She leaves David and seeks out her two best friends, Bonnie and Liza, who are waiting for her at the bar.Min soon notices a trio of men across the way who are watching them. Three guys for three gals --- a perfect match. So Min decides to go over there and see what's up. As she approaches, she overhears them talking about her (in a rather unflattering way) and the man who has caught her eye is making a bet with his friends that he can convince her to go out to dinner with him by the end of the evening. On that note, Min runs back to her safe corner with Bonnie and Liza, and as the women wait, the man who caught her attention, Calvin Morissey, walks over to them, and subsequently asks Min out to dinner. Min accepts.What Min does not know is that David was the one who made this initial bet with Cal. She also isn't aware that David bet Cal $10,000 that Cal could not get Min to have sex with him within a month. David thinks this is an easy win for him, since he is under the impression that Min simply is not interested in sex. But what David does not understand is that Min simply was not interested in David, period. Cal, on the other hand, has a reputation for never losing a bet. He does not take David's sex bet seriously, but nevertheless wins the $10 bet regarding dinner with Min, thanks to her eavesdropping just minutes earlier. She basically went out with Cal just to infuriate David.From that point on, the crazy up and down friendship between Cal and Min begins. The two are obviously attracted to each other, but they drive each other nuts. It's like oil and water. They talk, they tease, they flirt. But neither one wants to admit that there is anything going on between them. Bonnie and Liza notice that something exciting IS going on between the two, and so do Cal's friends, Tony and Roger. Soon, the six of them become regular buddies, with Roger and Bonnie falling in love, Tony and Liza \\"dating\\" but with no serious intentions for a commitment, and Cal and Min arguing, flirting and stealing kisses every now and then.Min soon sees another part of Cal's life --- his personal relationship with his family, his ex-girlfriend Cynthie (who is secretly plotting a way to get Cal back), and a childhood that left Cal scarred and scared about being a failure. Cal also meets Min's wacky family, including a sister who is having pre-wedding jitters, an overbearing mother and an overprotective father who may be having an affair with his secretary.BET ME is a winning book. Although this reviewer feels it went on a bit too long, Jennifer Crusie does an excellent job creating some very funny characters. We see each individual written into this story as someone uniquely important in his or her own right, yet integral to the love story of Cal and Min. There are subplots that surround the fairy tale; although at first this reviewer did not see the point in throwing in all of these characters, it all comes together nicely by the end of the book. BET ME is recommended for all fans of Chick Lit.--- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love all of her books but Bet Me is one of her best yet! I had a hard time putting this one down. I've become a Jennifer Cruise junkie and can't wait to get my hands on another one of her fun and frisky books"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This has to be one of the most hilarious books I've read in a while! Great dialog, great romances, great relationships. An easy, fun read to enjoy and not have to study or interpret its meaning. Loved the slow development of Min and Cal's relationship, perfect for a romantic comedy! Kick back and enjoy! Take it with you on vacation."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Never has almost 500 pages sped by so quickly; I think I read this RomCom in one sitting. Very cute, very funny, very satisfying in the end. I love that Minerva Dobbs is a \\"big girl.\\" (That is, guessing by the descriptions in the book of her not fitting into a size 8, she's probably a size 12, perhaps even a 14. The horror!) While Calvin Morrissey only seeks her out initially, because of a bet placed by her asshat exboyfriend, David, he quickly becomes enthralled.A few of the food themes were a little overdone - I'm sure chicken marsala is delicious and all that, but it seems like that and Krispy Creme donuts were ALL these two were eating. Generally people who love food and eating like more than 1-2 things. And enough with the Elvises already!This is another book with excellent use of the subplot romances and background characters - there are many, but they are all very quickly distinct, from Liza to Tony to Diana to nephew Harry. The 'rents are NOT evil people but who have managed to screw up our hero and heroine quite nicely, thank you. The ex-girlfriend who wants Cal back is not a villain; Crusie's use of Cynthee was interesting, she was both an antagonist, and something of a Greek chorus, filling the audience in on what stage of love that Cal and Min were experiencing.Another thing I loved that was different, was that while they liked kids, neither heroine nor hero WANTED them. This was consistent throughout the book, and in the epilogue, they did not in fact HAVE kids. I love kids; had one of my own, but not every HEA needs kids, and I love that Crusie matched a couple and gave them a HEA without the obligatory offspring."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is by far Crusie's best book. I have read it twice, and given it as a gift to my sister who loved it also. It is witty, sexy, and down to earth."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Very funny & cute story. Some of the scenes set up betwn Minerva & Calvin, & their friends are easy to picture, just comical. If you want a comical romance, Bet Me wont disappoint!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I downloaded 'Bet Me' for Kindle after seeing people rave about it in a forum. I was hooked on the first page and literally read it straight through. The main characters, Cal and Min, are great characters. If you preview the book and like what you see, you'll probably enjoy it. Her witty fast paced writing style reminds me a lot of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. It's a cute romantic story that's also funny and sexy. I will probably read another Crusie book in the future, but I have a ton of Stephanie Plum novels to catch up on!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I read this book almost 5 years ago, and haven't gotten it out of my mind ever since. I'm a pretty avid reader, and I spend any free time I have trying to catch up on amazing literature and new novels. Very few, compared to the amount released, stick to me the way this book has. This book had me laughing so hard, and (even though it got a little risque) sharing the most hilarious moments with my mom. I could not recommend a book any more than I recommend this one - she's such a fantastic author. The style is superb, it's light, indulgent, and will have you craving donuts for weeks.Just read the damn book. Please. And give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Well written, great character development. Couldn't put it down. Loved the authenticity of the characters and the mix of humor and heavier emotions. Not your typical love story. A nice shot of realism to go with the happily ever after!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Just love Min and Cal is a darn great guy who doesn't know it yet.Really loved the writing style. Funny and witty.I did not quite get why the kissing while being \\"just friends\\", but it keeps you reading until the book is done. I read it in one day.The end is hilarious.You just need to read it for the fun of it and indulge in the romance."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"As most of Jennifer Crusie's books are, this is a sweet, funny easy read. I enjoy reading these little funny quirky stories between other more intense novels."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Once upon a time...I was surfing the web and stumbled upon jennycrusie.com. When I saw that she had a new novel coming out, I wrote down the date, marked my calendar, tied a string to my finger, etc, etc all so I would remember to rush right out and get it. And I did.Bet Me is an entertaining, enlightening read that takes figure-insecure practical Min Dobbs and gorgeous comittment-phobe Cal Morrissey and puts them in a wacky situation, the kind we've come to expect from Jenny by now. When Min's boyfriend David dumps her before her sister's wedding after she refuses to have sex with him (but who would?), an outraged Min is ready to give up dating and get a cat. Then she stumbles upon Cal, who is avoiding his marriage-seeking ex-girlfriend, the perky and irritating Cynthie. One thing leads to another and Min thinks Cal is trying to get her into bed to win ten dollars, when in reality Cal turned down the bet. After one date, they decide to go their separate ways, but Fate and the fairy tale have other plans.This story is a sexy and hilarious read with wacky characters and outlandish situations, and yet the irrepresible Ms. Crusie can tie them all together. Look for nods toward excellent music, excellent food, loving people and examples of how you can't overcome destiny. I especially loved the fairy-tale-ish happenings, such as losing a shoe and being \\"woken up\\" by a kiss. Bet Me is definitely my new favorite book, one that I read at least every two weeks, and I can't wait for Jenny's next one!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book started out so good! I was interested in the characters and what they'd get themselves into next. The ending was so contrived and silly - I just kept shaking my head in amazement - it was SO BAD!!! There are no adults ANYWHERE who would do what these characters did in the last couple of pages! How can someone write such interesting and funny characters and then pffffffft in the ending?"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is great! I started it and couldn't put it down til I was finished. I have read all of Jennifer Crusie's books and I found this one to be written in her same funny, sexy style. I especially love her female lead characters, they always seem so real and likeable. This book is a great summer read!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Some may argue about the semantics of novel writing and Crusie's application of them in &quot;Bet Me&quot;, but I just enjoyed her colorful, hilarious characters. She comes through once again with lots of laugh-out-loud moments throughout this book. &quot;Bet Me&quot; definitely leans towards the more light-hearted end of Crusie's collection of novels so far, but there's nothing wrong with that! Crusie is at the top of the game of romantic comedy and REALLY funny dialogue. Another truly enjoyable read. Another Crusie keeper for me!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I loved this book! I read it in an afternoon. I read some of the reviews prior to picking up the book so I was prepared to be disappointed. Crusie has the ability to do humor that few authors have achieved and she came through with this one. I'm a WWII history buff so many of the books I read are pretty heavy. Occasionally I want a light read and Crusie is one of my favorites. Why does she need to &quot;fully develop&quot; all the characters? I don't need an analysis, just a good time and she delivered! Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie is the Jane Austen of Contemporary romance. This is her best book ever. It is a rollercoaster ride of fun, romance, humor, and insight.Calvin is a player, who hasn't got any idea of the kind of woman he wants, as a matter of fact, he's pretty sure he doesn't want one for keeps.Min is a today woman, her mother worries about her weight more than she does. She is independent, has close friends, and is not looking for a permenant relationship.This book has a large cast of quirky secondary characters. Every one is a jewel. I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair.There is not a boring, slow minute in the book.IF you are looking for an excellent way to spend some time, this is it.I loved every character, and the ending was absolutely GREAT!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS. I cannot belive that every reader on here has not rated it 5 stars! What a FUN book! I LOVED Cal. I thought he was sweet, clever, charming, and [very attractive]...and as for Min...Oh My Gosh...She was a riot! The dialogue was unbelievable! I have never read dialogue like that in my life! It sounded so real it was hard to believe that these were only two made up characters speaking and not real people!Im so sad that its over! I am so excited to have found Jennifer Crusie. I fully intend to hunt down and purchase everything I can find that she has put out there... \\"Bet Me\\" is one book that I will be reading over, and over, and over...A DEFINITE KEEPER."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie's \\"Bet Me\\" deals with Min who was dumped by her boyfriend David who made a bet with Cal, (a gorgeous and charming guy who gets any woman he desires) that Cal would not be able to take Min out for dinner and bed her in a month. Cal, however was not interested in the bet but Min overheard bits and pieces of the conversation and she was convinced that Cal was taking the bet. Playing along, she went out with Cal for dinner and soon, Cal seemed to creep into her life. Min was torn between her feelings for Cal and the fact that she thought he was only interested in her because of the bet. In the midst of this, David who was convinced before that Min would not be interested in Cal had second thoughts and tried to win Min back in order not to lose the bet. Then there is Cynthie who was Cal's ex and believed strongly they are destined to be together forever.This book is entertaining and the characters are interesting. Crusie also wrote very well the sexual tension between Min and Cal. However, my only criticism of this book is that, the length of \\"Bet Me\\" is a little long as the entire book deals with the bet and after 200 pages or so, Crusie is still writing about that. I was a little bored and feel that the book could definitely be shortened. Regardless of that, it is still a relatively entertaining chick lit."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"When all your romance novels out there are about your perfect size 8 women it is wonderful to read a humorous love story about a real 'rounded woman'. Crusie doesn't just offer the standard pat romance plot either. Between bets gone bad and overcoming self image problems Cal and Min battle out parents and friends to discover that sometimes 'fairy tales' can come true if your willing to take the risk. I LOVED this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Because of all the 5-star reviews, I thought this book would be a fun, romp-y kind of read. In reality, it's one of those \\"throw the book at the wall\\" experiences, except I was reading it on an E-reader, so definitely did not to break that just because I hated this book so much. I don't venture into this realm of \\"chick lit\\" often, but it's a guilty pleasure, so I thought \\"why not?\\" Here are some reasons:- trite writing- annoyingly contrived situations, like the two protagonists (Min and Cal) caught kissing by Min's best friend, Liza, and she hits Cal with her purse. Who does that? This happens 3 times in the book, and is completely ridiculous.- Min sarcastically calls Cal \\"charm boy\\" to his face because she doesn't want to be swayed by his charm. Yup, that is annoying too. Who says that? Where did Crusie even come up with this term, meant as a put-down?- the food references. Just because Min is \\"roundish\\" she's on a diet all the time, and Krispy Kremes seem to ever be in arm's reach. It's tiring that Krispy Kremes become the short-hand for all things sinful. Hearing about someone's dieting is about as entertaining as watching paint dry. Been there, Bridget Jones.- ugly shoes. Min is supposed to have \\"great taste in shoes\\" and Cal notices. Unfortunately, her killer shoes are bedazzled with plastic cherries, floppy flowers, and plastic fish. No guy, no woman would call these 'great shoes.\\"- Cal chides her about being a risk-averse actuary who probably has a plain black cell phone. She in turn thinks that he is one of those guys that needs to have a \\"bell and whistles\\" type of phone. I read that this book was published in 2010, but was written a lot earlier than that, but please, EVERYONE has a smart phone now, and even before that, phones were getting sleeker. Crusie's editor should have red-flagged this point, because it's just a stupid point in the book that makes you question the writer and her lack of inventiveness here.- two-dimensional, annoying parents who are not developed at all- Crusie write a line about \\"her bra was so sheer it was probably illegal in several states.\\" Last I heard, Victoria's Secret does ship to all 50 states, so not sure what this line even means. Lazy writing.- Min is not a very sympathetic character because she distrusts everyone, all the time, but this distrust is meant to endear us (the readers) to her if only she could see clearly how much Cal is in love with her. Blech!- a situation at the end where Min's ex-boyfriend David calls parents, sisters, and best friends and tells them that Cal is seducing their daughter \\"right now\\" and to get over to her apartment, and they all actually do. She is 33 years old. Horribly contrived scene. Cal and MIN are ALWAYS interrupted and are never alone, which is frustrating, because they never get the opportunity to iron our their differences.I gave it two stars, because I like a smattering of the characters: Bonnie, Cal, Shanna and Harry, the least annoying and best drawn of the bunch."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book was so ridiculous I couldn't finish it. The bar scenes the pick-up lines the author described were so trite and phony I felt like it must have been a flash-back to Studio 54. I honestly don't think the author has ever experienced the bar/pick-up/dating scene. It felt as though she was writing about what she thought it would be like and certainly not from any personal experience. I found the situations so unbelievable I laughed out loud. Do some research next time, Ms. Cruise because believe me you are way off base here. I gave it one star because I liked the cover. Read The Devil Wears Prada or the Nanny Diaries instead."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is every overweight girl's fantasy in print. The author must have pitched this book to the publisher as \\"Plump plain girl lands gorgeous successful man - and I have included much product placement for Krispy Kreme donuts (maybe we can get them to pay us for advertising)\\".The plot: gorgeous successful man asks the woman out on a date to win a bet with his friends. This is the only true note in the book, because, in real life yes, a man like that would never (without some sort of financial/social incentive) hit on a plump, plain, frumpily dressed woman in a bar and ask her out.The heroine is unpleasant and snappish, eats half a dozen donuts a day, doesn't exercise, and then blames \\"her genes\\" for that fact that she is not slim. The gorgeous, successful man loves her because, it seemed to me, she is the supportive Mommy that he never had who protects and defends him.The book was filled with contrived family dramas which are supposed to be both amusing and poignant and end up being neither. He meets her parents and it is a disaster. She is invited to dinner at his parents, and she uses the opportunity to lecture them about what bad parents they are to her new boyfriend - this is supposed to show how 'spunky' she is, but just showed what a supremely rude know-it-all she is. At the end of the book, the heroine's parent's freak out on being informed that their 33 year old daughter might be having her boyfriend over to stay the night, and they run over to her apartment to stop her. From what? Being \`ruined'? What is this, Victorian England? Also, everyone falls in love in a matter of days, and the heroine decides that she doesn't want children because she would never lose the pregnancy weight. It was all supremely irritating."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I always thought that people tended to stay in their own social econonmic level? Not in this fantasy! Cal happens to be partner in his own business, recieved a Porche for graduating high school, parents are loaded, get the idea? Min is overweight, Cal is perfect ~ yeah right. The story is Predictable. Pretty much it's dialog between Min and Cal. I purchased this book because of the reviews, which were positive, boy was I wrong."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This could possibly be one of the most poorly written books I've read! I knew it would be fluff before I read it (perfect for an airplane), but this book hit a new low. It is poorly written, with difficult to follow characters and it's boring, boring, BORING. Save yourself a few hours and find another book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Maybe it's me, but I do not like men who bet, even jokingly, as to whether they'll get a woman in bed. That pretty much blew it for me."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am a avid reader, but in opening this book, the story is so confusing and you can't keepup with all the changes and down right boring. Worst book I ever bought. I flat coundn't finish it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I can't believe I even lasted to page 218 before giving up and tossing this book into the recycle bin. It was predictable, unrealistic and painfully boring. I won't be trying another Jennifer Criuse book anytime soon!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I wish I could say I liked this book...then I wouldn't feel so bad about the $$ I paid for it! But in truth, Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie was a real disappointment. The characters felt so one-dimensional, especially Min's mother, who existed as little more than a one-note cliche. A lot of the conversations read more like scripted banter, but one really stuck out to me as not ringing true at all. When Min and Cal were discussing weight and Cal went on and on about how men love to touch soft cushy women and women don't realize this and worry about being thin. He said something like &quot;women get skinny for women, men don't care about that stuff,&quot; and I was just rolling my eyes! Please, that sounded a lot more like the author's FANTASY of what's true, it was totally oversimplified, but more annoyingly, the whole conversation just struck me as fake. Not to mention, Cal is a man in his mid-30s actually betting with the guys about how fast he can get Min in bed. And this is supposed to be the &quot;hero&quot; of this story?? NOT!!! Ugh, I just could not get into these characters or their shallow lives! If you have an ounce of maturity, I would skip this one."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"As such, \\"Bet Me\\" makes occasional leaps from the inane to the bizarre. For example, when the protagonist sees her sister in her wedding dress, she thinks she looks like a \\"sex-crazed princess on heroin.\\"I'm not sure what exactly a sex-crazed princess on heroin would look like, but a bride isn't what comes to mind.The author would do well to rethink the dismissal of Hawthorne et. al. that appears on her website."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I listen to Jennifer Cruise's books on unabridged audiocassettes because there aren't many choices for romances in this area. Jennifer Cruise's books have never been all that great to me.This one came as a big surprise. I actually liked the female character, there wasn't a sex scene every 20 pages, the story was cute, and the female character wasn't a thin, long-legged Barbie type."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was a great book from beginning to end. I loved it. The characters were great and the writing was excellent. For the reviewer who gave the book 1 star, Cal did not make the bet about getting her into bed. You should re-read that part because I think you missed it. This goes to show that men and women are not all superficial enough to care about weight and looks. It is also about personality which I think that both Cal and Min have in abundance."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Reading the reviews, I was sooo excited about this book. It's nice, silly, typical chick lit, but too many things annoyed me about it.First, it's just too long. The 'ole cat & mouse game only goes on for so long, especially when nothing else is happening in this plot.Min & Cal have a colorful array of friends, but very little character exploration is done with them. It makes you re-read dialogue between them because nothing has stood out between the pack.I recommend the movie \\"Down With Love\\" if you like this book. It reminded me a lot of the movie, only I liked the movie much better.Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy a lot of the book. Min's character is real & great! I really dig that strange cat, Elvis, too. She & Cal are fun to read as they go at it. Their fights are silly & funny, yet witty & intelligent.This is my first time reading Cruise & because I found some really good elements to this novel, I think I'll try her again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have been a fan of Jennifer Crusie since Tell Me Lies, and this book is not up to the par of some of her other novels. Min is just so cranky that I can't imagine why Cal keeps coming back. I also thought that the secondary characters were not as well developed as some of the other novels - Fast Women, for example. In fact, Cal and Harry were the only two characters I really liked. Also, I don't know how Cal and Min could eat chicken marsala so often."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The story is cute, and I laughed aloud a couple of times, but I wish I'd read this when I was about 18. I think I would have appreciated it more then. I'd draw the analogy to a Julia Roberts movie...entertaining, but you're almost dumber for having partaken. At 18 I wouldn't have minded the lack of character development, I wouldn't have minded the cartoonish supporting characters. (...)But at my age (...) I feel like this book was wasted on me because it is a silly and superficial, albeit cute, story. And for heaven's sake, where was Jennifer Cruise on the day they taught conversational writing in school? Playing hooky and stuffing her face with Chicken Marsala? After the first chapter, I was already fed up with the \\"he said...she said...he said...she said...he said...\\" How about \\"he retorted,\\" or \\"she replied?!?\\" (...)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"[spoiler alert!]of course, of course. All the characters are paper cutouts and you know it all in chapter one. Way too predictable. Though this does have the spin of fat girl gets the cute guy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"A great hilarious read. Again, Crusie nailed the characters. It's different from the typical romance novels where the heroine has a perfect body. This one is bigger than a size 8, and is funny and warm. The hero is hot. You won't be able to put the book down."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I bought this to read on vacation... it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. Of course, it's predictable -- in my opinion, all romances are. You know the girl is going to get the guy (or vice versa) at the end. I enjoyed the chemistry between Min and Cal, although I felt that a drop-dead gorgeous guy going for someone (presumably) so overweight seemed a bit unrealistic. That said, the true lack of realism, in my opinion, were all the family members and friends. David and Cynthie's behavior seemed not only not true to life, but utterly assinine. Ditto the behavior of family and friends in the final chapter before the epilogue at Min's apartment... c'mon! On what planet does THAT happen?! I can just see my dad running over to my apartment just because I'm getting hot and heavy with a man... NOT!!Still, I don't regret the read, especially for a vacation."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I didn't love this and I didn't hate it. Maybe it was the fact that they kept eating the same meal over and over and I just wanted to scream arn't you sick of that yet, maybe its because instead of a dog they had a cat and I don't like cats, maybe it was just that Min was not the best and she complained to much. Min is an overwieght woman who agrees to go on a date with Cal despite knowing, or thinking that he is only dating her for a bet. They can't seem to aoid each other since her best friend and his best friend decide that after meeting each other they have found their soulmate and their other two friends are sort of seeing each other to. The story makes the reader question fairy tales, who we see ourselves as and how that determains what kind of life and the hapiness we'll find."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I know this is a trivial matter, but I've been listening to &quot;Bet on Me&quot; on CD over the past day or so on a long road trip. I find the &quot;Min said,&quot; &quot;Cal said,&quot; &quot;Nannette said,&quot; etc. very distracting. In a conversation between two people, even on an audiobook read by one person, &quot;she&quot; or &quot;he&quot; would suffice. Again, I'm not reading it, and in my head it could be completely different, but this lack of personal pronouns is very choppy and distracting to the story.Otherwise, I'm enjoying it.And I'm a grammar snob. Maybe an abridgement would be helpful for the audio version of Ms. Crusie's books."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I picked up a book by Jennifer Crusie a few years ago (STRANGE BEDPERSONS) and it was one of those books that made me shrug. It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, and it didn't give me any desire to dig further into her oeuvre. However, last week I was really, really in the mood for something (1) contemporary (2) light and (3) funny, and Jennifer Crusie was the best name I could come up with.This time, I decided to do it right. Jennifer Crusie has written a lot of books so I browsed around for a while, trying to figure out if there was any consensus about which of her books are really BEST. A couple of titles came up repeatedly - this one, BET ME, and WELCOME TO TEMPTATION (spoiler alert: right after I finished BET ME, I picked up WELCOME TO TEMPTATION and loved it too).I won't recap the plot because it's been done elsewhere - Crusie's strengths are pretty well known, she's very funny, she does great dialogue, she keeps things moving along. I think a few other reviewers have noted that BET ME shows us that she can construct a good story, too. BET ME has great stakes, and Crusie tightens the noose mercilessly, ratcheting up the tension.The difference between BET ME and STRANGE BEDPERSONS was night and day for me. STRANGE BEDPERSONS has the same strengths, yes, but not to this degree. BET ME sparkles. It feels effortless, but has real heart. I turned the last page with that happy, warm feeling that the best romance novels give me. It made me believe that Crusie deserves her reputation."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Thirty-something Minerva Dobbs has lost her hope in men, period. Her mother adored her latest ex David, who appeared to be prime husband material. Instead he dumped her at the local bar with the \\"this isn't working\\" line just three weeks before he was to be her date at her sister's wedding. In Min's despairing state, her cynical, beautiful friend Liza and fairy-tale believer pal Bonnie push her to ask out the good-looking and successful Calvin Morrisey. Meanwhile, Cal is betting David that he can get Min to dinner with him. Before she knows it, Min is off to eat with terminal player Cal. Unbeknown to him, Min overheard the bet, and has her claws out farther than usual in a bid to beat the men at their own game. But after a dreadful dinner of Min's man-eater mentality and Cal's affected charm there's no danger of the bet being on; in fact, they both mutually agree never to see one another again. Fate has other plans, however, and coincidental encounters turn into freak meetings where heat and sparks continue to fly and Cal and Min begin to realize that maybe they are meant to be together after all.Boy, am I loving all these pick-me-up reads, Bet Me being one of the best. Several of my blogging friends have been telling me all year to read some Jennifer Crusie, and I'm so glad I finally did, and at the perfect time too. It hasn't been since my last Julie James book that I've had this much fun reading. Feisty Min and heartthrob Cal are a riot. Crusie knows how to write snappy dialogue and fast-paced stories with plenty of encounters between the two love interests. And with just the right balance of lightness versus substance and quirky secondary characters, I was never bored. From Min's frilly shoes and the subtleties of chicken marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts to the chaos theory and the psychological infatuation/commitment theory, Bet Me is thoroughly entertaining. And the scorchingly sexy conclusion? Almost too hot for me but very rewarding. Like the best romantic comedies, Bet Me was hilarious, engrossing, too sweet to resist and the perfect weekend, girl's-night-in read. I will be recommending it left and right to the all the romantics-at-heart I know."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"When her boyfriend David dumps her three weeks before her sister's wedding, Minerva Dobbs mostly feels annoyed. She knew there was a reason she never had sex with the man. In a quirky show of support, her two best friends convince her (goad, really) to take the gorgeous hunk that she sees talking to her ex by the...horns...to show the weasel up. The only problem is when she gets close, slipping in from behind them, she overhears David betting the handsome beast Calvin Morrisey that Cal can't get her into bed within a month!Min's not a thin, hot redhead like her best friend Liza and she's not a petite blonde cutie like her other best friend Bonnie. No, Min's under no illusions. She's chubby, she hates her body, and the only risk she takes with her statistics-minded self is on shoes that express far more personality than her boxy, conservative clothes. She's just been dumped and she's feeling a bit vindictive after hearing about that bet, so when Cal approaches her not five minutes later, she's intent on making him pay a little for being the shallow, callous jerk he is.Cal thinks Minerva Dobbs is the worst date he's ever had, but he doesn't lose bets he makes. He bet that idiot client of his back at the bar that he could take Min to dinner and by God, that's what he's going to do. Sure, he knows David was drunk, and there was no way he'd ever agree to any bet to get a woman into bed, not even for $10,000, but he didn't hold it against him. He'd maneuvered the man and the bet to take the caustic and snippy Min to dinner (woah, when she smiles at his friend Emilio she's like a whole other person...but she's still snippy) and then he'd walk her home (seriously, how come she's so nice to Emilio? Cal knows he's more charming than Emilio but she's not being nice to him), wish her a good life (oh, wow, she's got the sexiest shoes - and toes) and never see her again (despite the fact that the way she eats food is the most erotic thing he's ever seen).Cal and Min couldn't be more wrong for each other. Cal's a superficial hit-and-run player and Min is a practical actuary who spouts statistics about...everything...all the time, hates her body, and thinks happily ever after is a fantasy for suckers. But they keep running into each other. And despite the pummeling his ego takes from Min's caustic wit...and despite the headache from all the eye rolling that Min does to combat charm boy's superficial smarm, a spark is born...and then flames...and then an inferno. The romp is long and riddled with potential disasters, but it's the most fun either Cal and Min will ever have. Bet me.What a light, fun read this was! I'm not saying that just because chicken marsala is my favorite meal of all times, either, though that certainly didn't hurt. After a particularly dark reading experience just prior to this, I went looking for something that would make me smile and warm the chill from the last book. I found Bet Me and couldn't be happier that I did.Full of quirky, funny characters and zany, endearing situations, I quickly fell for Cal and Min, despite their peccadilloes - or maybe because of them. Cal, the darling, starts out like a superficial (but charming) guy who's tired of the dating scene and just wants some peace and quiet in his life after his last girlfriend tried to race him to the alter. Min is sharp as a tack and intelligent, but her body image sucks and she dresses to hide the curves her mother's been nagging about since her childhood. To say I know someone just like Min - and her mother - would be a gross understatement.Together they're an incendiary mix of humor, heat, and frustration and their evolving relationship is adorable, with deeper undertones that start to show themselves as the reasons for their initial character traits start to become apparent. Crusie does a fantastic job of keeping the message light, but there are a few good messages there for women who put too much emphasis on body image for their self esteem.The message stays light, and the book is firmly entrenched on the more humorous side of romance, and I, for one, am very grateful. For a long book, it read very quickly, as the narrative is butter smooth and the dialogue fast, intelligent, and wickedly sharp. There's not a lot to complain about here if you're looking for a nice bit of brain candy.There are one or two aspects that kept my appreciation for Bet Me in the four star range, like the blow up at the wedding that seemed a bit out of character for Cal and Min so it sort of felt like conflict for conflict's sake instead of organic story development. So, too, a big confrontation scene at the end including both sets of parents, which went way beyond ridiculous. Who acts like that? There were a few other issues similar to those, issues that didn't bother me too much as long as I kept my tongue firmly planted in my cheek, but they did prevent me from rating the book higher.That's okay, though. It didn't keep me from downloading a few other titles by Crusie and it won't prevent me from going back and rereading this one. I enjoyed Bet Me. Very much. And it was just the fun, light romance that I desperately needed when I needed it.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have read Bet Me several times, I have lost count. I have it in hardcover and paperback. And every time I read it, I want to read it all the way through to the end without stopping for anything. This book would definitely be on my desert island list."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is my favorite Jennifer Cruisie book of all time. The characters of Min and Cal are so relatable, so real, and yet their story is like wish fufillment personified. Who wouldn't identify with Min? A slightly overweight, average-looking woman with a great sense of humor, plenty of intelligence, and many of the same self-esteem issues and fears that every woman faces. And who wouldn't want a man like Cal? Gorgeous, funny, sweet, successful, but not without flaws and self-esteem issues of his own. This book had the trademark Cruisie humor, a low-key but fun plot, and enough sweet, romantic moments to make even a cynic sigh a time or two. Oh, and also, if you're a fan of Krispy Kreme donuts, and have perchance, a time or two, fantasized about oh, bathing in a tub of them or being hand fed them by a gorgeous guy between kisses . . . then you have found the book you've been waiting for all your life. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I listened to this book on CD, and I have to say I really enjoyed it. My library did not have a huge selection of chick lit books on CD, so I picked this one up as a last minute decision.I had tried to read a Jennifer Crusie book before, and I really was not keen. This however was wonderful. I do not know if it was the reader, but she certainly did a great job.I loved the romantic tension between Cal and Minerva. I also liked the fact that Minerva was down to earth, but still had a bit of a girly side to her. Also,all the talk of chicken marsala made me try it. I actually had it twice while I was listening to this book (in a two week period).I will definitely give Ms. Crusie a chance again. I am hoping that I will have another good experience.Pick up Bet Me. I think fans of chick lit will really enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I want to add my straw in the wind to say I love Jennifer Crusie's work and I love this book. Her characters are never perfect but always intelligent and witty Bet Me has several themes running through it all nicely woven into the plot and all of which add to the depth and sparkle of the story. I won't write a plot summary, except to say that this is the story of two sets of three friends, who have very different ideas about how men and women find each other and develop loving relationships. Min and Cal, the main characters, develop a relationship, not just in spite of a major misunderstanding, but in spite of having nothing in common to the point that their out look on life is antithetical. Although one of Min's friends, very professionally successful young woman believes in the fairy tale, there are no Snow Whites or Cinderellas in this book. These are all bright, financially independent women. While the Prince, Cal, is rich, gorgeous and successful he needs to be saved as much as anyone, and still manages to enrich Min's life and not with money.One of the men believes that relationships begin and develop due to chaos theory, including strange attractors. There is even a successful writer of relationship books with her own theory of how things develop between people, which leads to hilarious misunderstandings. Ultimately Min and Cal survive the help of Min's Mother's idea of what makes a woman attractive. Cal's family's idea of what makes a person successful, and their friends help and advice. All for the most part lovingly given.Like all of Jennifer Crusie's books, even the early ones, Bet M is a romances in the truest sense of the word. The world does not fall away from the lovers. Their story is underpinned by characters as vibrant and interesting as the main characters and with affection and loyalty they hinder as much as help the journey and from first meeting to commitment there is always a journey."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"About a year ago, a girlfriend handed me this book and on the shelf it went. Every time I chose a book to read, I looked over it...why did I wait so long? What a fun read!Minerva gets dumped at the beginning of the book (good riddance David, you are an idiot.) Then, when her friends ask her to pick up on Calvin she listens in on a conversation that no girl wants to hear. David, the jerk, bets Calvin the cutie that he cannot get Min to bed in a month. So, when Cal comes to ask Min to dinner, it is a circus at its beginning.Her best friends Liza and Bonnie stick around to find out more about this Calvin and they are sucking up to his buddies to find out the juice.Chaos theory happens.The six become unlikely friends and Minerva and Cal decide to be just friends, even though they keep kissing quite often. Throw in a sister who is getting married, a mother who thinks Min should not eat because she is fat, an adorable nephew of Cal's, his exgirlfriend and even David the jerk and you have a hilariously fun book!Will they do the deed and win Cal the \\"10 dollars?\\" Will he love her and leave her as he has done in the past? Every turn of the page makes you smile and think!The hokey chaos theory stuff even makes you laugh a little. Pick this one up for a beach read.

I have read it repeatedly and laugh through the whole story each time."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book, like many of her books was a non-stopper for me. Since I opened the first page I could not put it down. It is hilarious too!The story starts off at a yuppie bar where Minerva Dobbs is being dumped by her bf David. David is dumping her in hopes of giving her an ultimatum to sleep with him (that backfires on him). He dumps her and she goes back to her bff's Bonnie and Lisa who are schoked to learn that David dumped her. Liza (the devils advocate) prompts Min to start looking for a new romantic interest in the bar so she can have a date to her sisters upcoming wedding. After eyeballing the bar Liza spots Calvin (the suit) and prompts Min to make a move on him, or she'll go and get him for her. After Min takes a deep breath and a shot she decided to go pick him up. While she's going up the stairs she over hears a conversation with David and Calvin where they're making a bet that Cal can get Min into bed and outta the bar for X amount of $. She gets really upset and decides to go back to her friends and tell them she doesn't want to pick up Cal.Meanwhile....Dave has just dared Cal to pick up Min. So, he goes and hits on her and the rest you must read! I especially liked the way the two main characters (Min & Cal)would try to get romantic by kissing and her bff (Liza) would always smack him on the head to get them to stop!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie always creates great characters and this book has them too. I didn't find the theme as exciting as some of her other books but it is a good read. Still has twists and turns to keep you reading."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I loved this book. I love that we have a whip-smart heroine, whose vulnerability hides behind a wall of snark. The chemistry build-up, the relationship build up between the two main characters were believable, although to be honest, their eventual coming-together was a bit anti-climactic.Still, everything preceding that was smart, comedy-filled, with enough insecurities and conflict thrown in that it made the sexual tension just that much juicier.The rest of the characters were also interesting, adding purpose to the story. None were superfluous, and everybody had enough back-story to make them fully come alive in my head. Even Bonnie, who annoyed me slightly, had a purpose and therefore still merited her place as Min's best friend.The only thing I can complain about, and why it's missing a fifth star, was the over-the-top ending, where all the cast of characters invade their private space. Everything else before that were still in the realm of realistic, but the ending was just way out there. If that had happened to me, I'd tell everyone to get lost until I was dressed. LOL."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"That describes me when I read this book. Long on reading, short on sleep. At the end of it all, I don't have a bad thing to say about it, except for the formatting glitches in the Nook version (missing paragraph breaks, that sort of thing).I loved the characters--flawed but realistic and adorable. I loved the prose--fast and catchy. I loved the way events spun completely out of control for these two \\"meant-to-be\\" lovers. Also, I loved the cat. And the layers--the way little things came together in the end to create the big picture that created these characters in their present day.I'm sure if I sat down and thought hard about it, I could find something to ding in this book--like maybe that things went on long enough to push events closer to \\"contrived\\" than they should have been, or that Cal's family (and Min's mom!) were just a little over the top. But it's been a very long time since a book kept me up that late, and I don't want to think about that stuff. I just want to grin at how fun it all was!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is a fabulous book because it doesn't try to be anything other than what it is - funny and warm and life-affirming - and succeeds totally in all of that. Gorgeous heroine we can all relate to, yummy hero, laugh-out-loud moments. Occasionally for me Crusie gets a bit too zany and adds a few too many ingredients (e.g. murder) to her stories, but books like this one showcase her true talent."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me was a fun read! I couldn't wait to get back to this book. Cruisie knows how to make all of her characters stand out and demand a laugh or two."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"\\"Bet me\\" is hands down one of my favorite romance novels and Jennifer Crusie's best book. It's quick, witty, romantic and just a lovely read all around. The heroine, Min, is hilarious and her love interest, Cal, suits her perfectly. The banter between the two is laugh-out-loud funny at times and the chemistry seems real, which is a hard thing to pull off in a book. The secondary characters are all really fun and I love how the author managed to weave food and shoes into the story, making them almost characters on their own.I first read this several years ago but it is one of my go to books when I'm looking for a quick read that I know I'm going to enjoy."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"If I had to chose a book to be my best friend, I'd choose this one. I have read it many times. If something horrible is going on in my life, you can bet that it won't be long before I pick up my (rather worn) copy of this. If I have a few unexpected days off (like say, during the recent snow storm)...this is the comfort read I'll be sinking into.Jennifer Crusie's brand of humor is all her own. Every single character is infused with something that makes them feel so real - maybe that is why I love the book so much. The characters feel more and more real every single time I read the book. Kinda like Harry Potter - every time I pick it up I feel like I'm visiting family.Minerva Dobbs is probably the number one character I would choose to be friends with IRL. We have so much in common - she really does remind me of me in so many ways. Which is good, because I wouldn't say no to a Cal if I happened to run into one...maybe she'll bring me luck. I also love the way that she and her two best friends are complete opposites to the point that their personalities clash - that is how it is with me and my friends. We're all so different, if we weren't friends...we wouldn't be friends. haha. I know that doesn't make sense, but I bet you know what I mean.Even though a lot of the book is about Min and her \\"shortcomings\\" and her trying to come to terms with who she is versus what everyone else expects her to be...she is very confident. There is this great scene with Cal...they're in the park...and they start talking about Elvis only to discover that she is talking Presley and he is talking Costello. She says something like \\"Good thing this isn't a date, or we'd have a really awkward moment trying to come back from that one.\\" That scene always sticks with me as an example of being comfortable with yourself and just taking things as they come.It has been so long since I read this for the first time that I don't remember when, how or why I ended up with a copy...I just remember reading it three times in a row because I loved Min's story so much. So if you're a contemporary romance or chick-lit fan and you haven't read this...do so immediately!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me had me laughing out loud through out the book. Crusie has such a great sense of humor, she should be writing scripts. This could be a great romantic comedy. I am forever a Jennifer Crusie fan."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am an enthusiastic fan of Jennifer Crusie and this book is the one that started it all for me. Late in 2003 I picked up an advanced reader's copy of Bet Me without any particular expectations. It was Christmas season, I had had a hard day at the bookstore and I was just looking for something light to read. I remember sitting down at about 9 o'clock, thinking I would read a chapter or so and then being completely unable to put the book down until I finished it. Over the years that have passed since then, I have read everything else Ms. Crusie has written (some of them, like Bet Me, more than once or twice). I can't say enough good things about her work.Bet Me is the story of Minerva Dobbs and Calvin Morrissey. Min is an actuary, a statistician by nature as well as by employment. Short and curvy, Min suffers from a common female affliction - she is convinced her body is unattractive. She's both kind and sensible, sharp and witty, and the only risky thing about her personality is her wild taste in shoes. Cal, on the other hand, is more of a gambler. He comes from wealth, owns his own company, and bets on any and everything. He's Greek-God handsome, incredibly charming and avoids commitment like the plague. Min and Cal have nothing whatsoever in common and good sense would tell you they don't belong together. Fate, however, has other plans.On the very night that Min's boyfriend David breaks up with her (okay, she didn't care that much about him, but he was supposed to be her date to her sister's wedding) she overhears him making a bet with Cal Morrissey. Specifically, a bet that Cal won't be able to get her into bed within a month. A few minutes later, Cal is crossing the crowded bar and asking Min out to dinner. Min is outraged. She knows she should tell him off, but the wedding is only three weeks away. What if she could string him along until then? She could take him to the wedding as her date and then dump him. It would serve him right to be played. The only problem is, Min isn't sure she can keep her hands off him for three weeks. What's a girl to do?Bet Me is a truly romantic story that doesn't rely on sap or sex. There's humor, honesty, mistakes and coincidences galore and Ms. Crusie's wonderful story-telling ability shines through. If I could only keep twenty books in my library, this would be one of them."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book was simply great. Story was funny, entertaining and full of romance and sexiness! I really liked all the characters in the book. Characters were flawed, but very likeable and relatable. Minerva is a regular girl, who is not perfect or thin as a model, she represents the average woman, secure in her career, but insecure about herself and her body image. Cal is your successful businessman, kind, yet flawed where relationships were concerned. Two characters that seem to be opposites. I like how these two characters grow and mature as the story moves on.Story moved fast, very funny and entertaining. The love scenes were steamy and very romantic. One of my favorite contemporary romances, story seemed plausible and characters could have been anyone. I loved that Cal could see who Min really was and viceversa. Beauty does not have to be defined a certain way, and it is in the eyes of the beholder. Very refreshing book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"A great read! I love Crusie's characters and dialog but I agree with another reviewer that this book is even better: smoother, more believable dialog.I like how the main characters met - it felt very real - I even like that at first glance Calvin wouldn't have asked out Minerva. After the way they were 'tricked' into going out, they learned more about each other and became more interested. At the same time the characters become more interesting to the reader and their motivations are deeper and more real.The families of Minerva and Calvin are admittedly dysfunctional, this can be a tired and irritating formula, but I liked the way the characters dealt with them. They suported each other and didn't let their families run all over them.Great cast of supporting characters and lovable main characters with funny, bright dialog. One of the best reads of the year. I can't wait for the next new Crusie! I hope to see some of the supporting characters again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present from my in-laws (of all people). I was a bit hesitant - do they really know what I like to read?! Surprise surprise! They got it right! \\"Bet Me\\" is one of the best books that I've read lately. The characters pull you in and you keep turning pages to see what kind of crazy situation they'll get themselves into next.After reading \\"Bet Me\\" I went to the library and checked out other Jennifer Crusie books. \\"Bet Me\\" got me hooked!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"For months I've had \\"Bet Me\\" sitting on the top of my TBR pile. A good friend just raved about Jennifer Crusie, and since I'd turned her into a Suzanne Brockmann fan, she felt justified in turning me toward Crusie's collective works. So when I finally got around to opening this book, it was with great expectation.I'm glad to say that I wasn't let down. \\"Bet Me\\" was such a treat to read. The humor was wonderful, and I was immediately taken with both the hero, Calvin Morrisey, and the heroine, Minerva Dobbs.Instantly the characters had a chemistry with each other despite the fact that they both tried to fight it through nearly the entire book. What was exceptionally clever is how Crusie brought attention to this connection by using a secondary character - a psychologist ex-girlfriend of Cal's - to list clues indicating if the couple was developing feelings, only to have those very clues show up in Cal and Minerva's interactions with each other.The only problems I had with this book were Minn's mother and Minn's obsession with her weight. Minn's mother was so extreme in her nastiness - in her complete fixation on her daughter's physical appearance and disapproval of same - that she almost came off as a cartoon character. I kept waiting for Minn to turn around and smack the woman, mother or not, especially given that Minn felt no compunction in speaking her mind to every other character. And while it was completely understandable why Minn herself was so obsessed with her weight, it really became annoying that it was such a significant obstacle between Cal and Minn. Cal never expressed anything but appreciation for Minn's figure, yet Minn could not let him forget that it was less than her definition of perfect.Still, it was refreshing to read about a woman who didn't conform to society's (and romance readers') expectation of physical perfection and an amazing, sexy desirable man who loved her all the same. The dialogue between these two was wonderfully real, fast paced and at times, wicked. Once they allowed their passion to run free, the scenes were downright steamy.I've already got a whole stack of Crusie's just begging to be read. I can only hope they are all as good as \\"Bet Me\\"."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"A girl can not have enough good shoes. This book has plenty.

He did great! I could have kicked myself for letting it sit that long in my house unread! I loved the way the main character was so human! Most of the romance books I have read, the women have been beautiful with model thin bodies (yeah, like that really exists in the real world AND she is still single!).

After the worst first date ever they both agree that they should never go out again. But the more they want to avoid one another the more they realize that maybe they shoud give this whole datinig thing a second chance.I heard that 'BET ME' was one of Crusie's first works but for some reason was only recently published and it definitely has the feel of her earlier romance books. Lately Crusie's books have been romance with a hint of mystery wheras 'BET ME' has no mystery whatsoever but is one of her most fun romances to date!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"My sister gave me this book.

Cal was a great catch, and I thought Min was a girl who deserved him.I was not real happy with the ending. I thought more could have been put into what happened to all of them instead of just a few lines. I grew to like all of them, and felt let down on their \\"futures\\". Out of all of Jennifer Crusie books, this was one of the better."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've loved all of Crusie's books, and &quot;Bet Me&quot; is no exception. The characters are well defined, and fun. I laughed and I enjoyed! It's a romantic comedy fantasy where fate just won't let them go until they &quot;live happily ever after&quot;.It's a definite read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"It's been a long time since I had to stop reading for several minutes because I was laughing so hard I couldn't focus on the page. But I did just that several times. Crusie has a gift for getting emotional and sexual tension just right. And Min gets to say things that most of us only think, and then only if we have a sense of the absurd."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I don't think this is the worst Jennifer Crusie book, far from it. It's exactly what all the rest of her books are - fun, exciting, interesting, sexy and funny. This one did remind me more of Crazy for You than any other because the the characters and the entire story is pretty down-to-earth and it's just everyday situations for all of the characters. She describes a life that could be anyone's and often is.Great book. Fun read. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Very witty and clever. I loved Min and Cal's story as well as those of the secondary characters. Cruise's dialogue is sharp and funny. She had me laughing outloud so many times i grabbed a few more of her books."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I love this book. If you're looking for an in-depth review about characters and plot, then this review isn't for you. I will tell you that this book lets you relax and experience a great couple of hours from which you will emerge with a smile. Bet Me has become that one book that you never lose, because you read it so often. Just plain fun."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I bought several copies for friends since i love this book so much. A great read. Unbelievability witty. It would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I think my takeaway emotion from this book was kind of bemused annoyance. To me the plot devices that were issues to the characters never seemed like things that would be issues to me, so I spent most of the time thinking that they'd gotten themselves worked up for nothing. Usually authors make a point to illustrate how these things that are supposed to be irritated irritate the people they bother, but the book depends to much on you agreeing with its characters. It wants you to be like, 'I know, right??'People are 'sassy,' or in this context, 'unnecessarily irritated by everything but pleased with themselves about it.' Mostly it just featured people I could like well enough but just not care to much about. Some conflicts were interesting, but they were ultimately flimsy or resolved fine enough.But then at the end there's this weird doughnut-centric sex scene but then also her parents arrive and...well. For that scene I started out understanding it and by the end it seemed somewhat out of character, and the two leads were so smug where the whole book they'd hated each other so i felt people were entitled to be somewhat surprised they were having doughnut sex at the end.So yes I didn't dislike it and it was enjoyable enough to read but there wasn't really anything I latched onto or loved about it. That's the thing, having read it a few months ago what sticks out in my mind are a few random scenes and a few character details, but the main plot detail that kept them apart and hating each other the entire book has been lost from my mind. I don't know if I'll ever be inclined to read it again myself, but to the voracious romance novel reader I might recommend it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Wow. This book is hilarious!Characters were believable. I felt as if they were people I knew.Storyline was intriguing. Loved the whole betting aspect of their relationship.I read it in one sitting because I couldn't force myself to put it down.Found myself laughing out loud and wearing a stupid grin for most of the book.What a fun read this was.It's one I would read again and again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've read this book many times and still love it. I was concerned that I wouldn't like reading it on my kindle (since I've read it in paperback form in the past), but once I started reading, there were no problems. It's a romantic comedy with sharp wit. Really a great read. Especially if you're tired of reading glamorized harlequin novellas and want some fun. :)"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is my first Crusie book and honestly I don't read a lot of what would be classified as Romantic Comedy so I was up for something new and interesting and this book certainly delivered.It was hysterical. The dialogue was witty and snappy and made me laugh out loud in more than a few places. The characters seemed realistic and I enjoyed the chemistry of the main couple.The plotline is fairly typical of romance, well-known cad makes a bet to bed a less-than perfect 10 heroine, but the twist in this one is that Min, the heroine, actually knows about the bet from the get-go and it's interesting to see how well she handles the situation.Despite being overweight and not as pretty as her sister or her friends, Min is smart, hardworking, and loveable because even though she's playing the typical man-hating b*tch, you can tell she's not really like that. Crusie never takes the anti-male sentiment too far.And Cal is written really well, too, considering technically he's a man-ho but we love him anyway because it's easy to see that he's not TRYING for that. He's just oblivious that he's hurting people, but not because he's self-absorbed. He's got some problems that he's slowly trying to work out. And some of them are doozies.The book starts off well and reels you in pretty fast with it's funny characters. It drags a bit in the middle if I'm being honest and the whole bet thing has a few chapters toward the end where it gets slightly out of control as a plot point.But I'm sold as a reader and I'll definitely be picking up some more of Crusie's books in the future."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"At first you think Bet Me is going to be one of those \`big misunderstanding' books, where Calvin Morrisey accepts a $10,000 bet from Minerva Dobbs' ex-boyfriend to get her into bed within a month. Yes, you read that right, $10,000. And of course you just know that he's going to get her into bed, she's going to learn about the bet, her heart will be broken, and all hell will break loose! Wrong! Well sure, it sort of starts out like that, but that's about it. There's nothing normal or predictable about this book. Drawn into the betting circle, so to speak, are Cal's two friends and business partners, Min's two girlfriends, her ex and Cal's ex, and - well, heaps of other family and friends. The joy of Crusie is watching sane people make a fool of themselves, all done with wry, self-deprecating humour, friendship bonds that are priceless, food (oooooh, yes, the food), animals, and a cheerful thumbing of the nose at all that is sacred in society. Like no-carb diets, for example. Min is a plus-sized heroine and Cal loves every lush inch so much he tries to feed her up. Her joy of all the naughty, forbidden foods is orgasmic for her and him! Gotta love this guy, even when he unashamedly sneaks peeks at her lacy underwear down her top. He develops a shoe fetish, previously unknown until Min walked into his life with her do-me, believe-it-or-not shoes and peek-a-boo toes, and an enormous appreciation for tying her up so she can't have her way with him too quickly. He has a bet to win/lose, and he'll do it in his own time, thanks. There are so many excellent lines in this book that your head will reel, and so many sexy vibes your bones will melt. This is Crusie at her very irreverent best."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The book starts with a well done mis-communication - the bet. David bets Cal that he can't get Min to bed in a month. Cal refuses but says he's willing to bet ten dollars that he can walk out the door with her. Cal's ex girlfriend Cynthie walks up and Cal wants to get away from her. So he tells Cynthie he's with someone and goes to Min. Min overheard part of the bet but not all of it, and she thinks it's a bet to have sex with her. She is angry, but she leaves with Cal because she wants to be rude to him. Their paths keep crossing, and each time she insults him. But at the same time they are kind of falling for each other, but they don't want to. It's a fun set up with clever dialogue.Later there is a fight separating the couple (which follows the romance formula). That too was well done. A third party tells a lie to Cal which he believes. It was believable.Min is an actuary. She's smart and caring. She has a round shape and will never be thin. Her mother has always insulted her appearance and pressures her to lose weight. Cal encourages her to eat forbidden foods, bread, butter, doughnuts. He enjoys watching her sensual love of food. And he likes her looks.A great scene is when Min has dinner with Cal's family. I read this book five years ago and that dinner scene stayed vivid in my mind ever since. I just now did a second read. The first time I read the book I laughed out loud many times. I wasn't laughing as much the second time, probably because there were no surprises, but I still loved it.DATA:Story length: 391 pages.

Genre: humorous contemporary romance."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me is a fun, lighthearted chick lit novel about a big-boned actuary and the charming entrepreneur she falls in love with. Calvin Morrisey is a man who is used to getting what he wants. With his stunning good looks, debonair manner and all-around sex appeal, he has never met a woman who was a challenge. When someone bets him that he can't take sleep with the chubby wallflower in the bar he declines--ever the gentleman. He does, however, accept the bet that he can get her to go to dinner with him.Minerva Dobbs is used to playing second fiddle to her gorgeous younger sister and her slim best friends, but even she is appalled when she hears the suave gentleman make a bet that he can sleep with her. She decides to take the bait and go out with Calvin, but only to prove him wrong.The interaction between Minerva and Calvin is more or less a comedy of errors. They both fight their attraction for most of the novel even as the reader can see them falling more and more in love with each other. Crusie has a knack for conversation and witty banter that is a joy to read. The characters all have distinctive voices and it's not just the same old chick lit novel told over again. There was a spark to this novel that made me read it in about four hours and even when I finished I wished it hadn't ended. This is my first Jennifer Crusie novel, but I look forward to going back for more."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"What a great romantic comedy. I absoultely fell in love with JC's sense of humor in this book. I also had the biggest craving for chicken marsala after reading this book. It was refreshing reading about a not so perfect main character. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Look beyond the cliches. Beyond the \\"plump gal\\" and the \\"handsome hero.\\" These two characters compliment each other. THAT is what makes this book stunning. There are some readers posting reviews who's names i wont mention, even tho i REALLY want to (!), who think that guys that look like Cal don't fall for girls that look like Min. YES THEY DO!! Cal falls for Min because of her personality (despite her initial prickliness) AND because she is beautiful in a soft, womanly way. Min falls for Cal because he is confident and charming (and that is some what because of the way he looks). Once you get inside this book, you will really root for the two romantic leads. Not because one is considered handsome by society and the other plain, but because they are interesting and brilliant people. I wont linger on the plot as you;ll know it more or less by now but I will say that this is an absolutely delightful read and I would have given it 5 stars were it not for the fact that at times these characters talk too much (says me) and i prefer less wordy exhanges. However, the sexy scenes are definetely not too wordy at all! Take a chance on this book. I'll bet you love it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"As a latecomer to the chick-lit genre, this book totally hooked me. Loved the smart, \\"zaftig\\" heroine, the friendship and camaraderie, the critical mom (who is so my mom, and I say that lovingly), and for once, the outwardly \\"not so perfect\\" woman got the man of her dreams."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"What a fun book! This was my first experience with a Jennifer Crusie novel, and I just wish I had discovered her sooner. She is a recommended author from some friends who have never steered me wrong before.I was rooting for Min and Cal right from the start and found myself smiling every time they even spoke to each other. I loved Cal's descriptions of Min's body and how sexy he thought she was. It was very refreshing to read about a hot, sexy, romantic man who was that attracted to a woman who was not a super model. I'm sure those men do exist...somewhere!I also loved the supporting characters. There was not one that was not appealing in some way, even the parents, Cynthie, and David. Tony took a while to grow on me, but in the end, he emerged quite the hero himself.My only complaint is that Min, who is described as fat, is probably about a size 10. Since she was able to very uncomfortably squeeze in to a size 8, she can't be more than a 10, and a size 10 is not fat! No, she's not a stick figure but fat is stretching it quite a bit. Other than that one small flaw, there was nothing wrong with this book. I finished it in one day and will love it just as much when I'm ready to read it again!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie is one of my new favorite authors. Her books are clever, funny and I love it that she's from my home state and writes about the area where I live. I'm also married to an actuary, so this book about an actuary had me laughing out loud. I listen to the audio versions of books and this one is beautifully done by Deanna Hurst. I'm not so crazy about some of the other readers of Crusie's books, but this one is a good listen."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book will always make me think of Krispy Kremes and fun shoes. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Many books have Big Misunderstandings, but none of them tackle it quite like Jennifer Crusie! Min mistakenly thinks Cal has made a $10,000 bet that he can get her into bed within one month. She's wrong, of course, but it makes for some hilarious twists and turns as she stings him along long enough to have a date for her sister's wedding but makes sure he loses the bet.All humor aside, one of the things I love about this book is how body image is handled. Min's family tries to keep her on a diet and tells her she's overweight, so she believes she is fat. Cal adores her just the way she is and works to get her to see herself through his eyes as he feeds her real food. It is beautifully done and truly refreshing to read a book about a heroine that isn't a size 2."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is a terrific book. I BET you will not be able to put down. Crusie does it again. I have read and enjoyed \\"Welcome to Temptation\\" and \\"Faking it\\". This one \\"Bet Me\\" Has been my favorite yet. It makes you fall for the characters and care for them. At the end it even fills in any question you might have had. I loved it. I plan to read \\"Fast Women\\" next, I hope it is this good. Enjoy...."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The only problem I had with this book, personally, is that I can't help but compare it with Welcome to Temptation, which is the best Crusie book out there, bar none, and perhaps the best witty romantic contemporary fiction novel available, period.However, Bet Me has its own charm. Min Dobbs, our plump, witty heroine, is conflicted about accepting the attentions from Cal Morrisey, a red hot training seminar maven who, under normal circumstances, would be out of her league. However, Cal's interest is piqued when Min's smarmy ex-boyfriend points her out and initiates a bet that Cal can &quot;get&quot; Min within a month... and Min overhears their exchange.Crusie shines in the drafting of outrageous characters (this time, in the form of Min's mother, a cluelessly social-climbing barracuda; her and Cal's friends, and a cat named Elvis... not for this particular volume the ever-present Crusie dog... for me, vive la difference!). Characters are the key for this novel, and each one sparks independently of the others. Together, they combust. Min and Cal work out the kinks in their pseudo-but-evolving relationship in the face of considerable and hilarious impediments.As always, Crusie relies on cleverness, wit, and fundamental humor, plus generous italicized thought revelations, to create depth in her story. However, Min's comparative ordinariness is the single most outstanding component of this book; she's round, professionally accomplished, entrenched in a weird family, doesn't want kids... Min is a real woman (finally!); not for this story an impossibly slim, impossibly beautiful, impossibly exquisitely heartstricken young thing who's dying to fall in love with the right man and crank out babies in ostensible sequels that would be too boring to read.This book is not boring.If you like Crusie, this is a great book for you... it's a solid effort of an increasingly mature writer with growing mastery over her genre."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"One of my least favorite plot/device in a romance novel is \\"The Bet.\\" (My other least favorite is the \\"pretend to be lovers until we fall in love.\\" But that doesn't really apply here.) \\"The Bet\\" is just so annoying. It usually all plays out likeShe's All Thatwhere the hero yells \\"I made the bet before I knew you.\\" It can rarely be pulled off well and believable. So, when I first stumbled upon this book in my Amazon Recommends list I automatically shunned it. Then, one of my favorite book blogs put together a list of favorite reads of 2010 and this book was listed. The blogger had nothing but good to say about BET ME, which intrigued me. How can a book with \\"The Bet\\" plot be that amazing? So, I cracked open the story with a huge prejudice that I was NOT going to like it. I was wrong.I won't go into a summary of the book. The blurb does it justice as well as several of the other reviews.What I enjoyed:1. Min--she's a 33 years-old actuary who calls it as it is. She's funny (without all the constant one-liners), snippy, flawed, and real. She's a real woman a few pounds more than thin, much to the chagrin of her mother. She's learning to standup for herself and to be her own woman instead of her mother's ideal. She cuts through the crap and gets down to what really matters.2. Cal--Handsome Cal's screwed up childhood and family life molded his known dating history of \\"love \`em and leave \`em.\\" But, that's more to do with the women he dates than with what he truly wants in life.3. Min & Cal's friends--I loved the diversity of this group of people. They all were fully developed and complimented each other. They added so much humor, insight, and \\"romantic pushes.\\"4. Min & Cal's family--I loved the dysfunctional family dynamics of both families and how that played into the storyline. It cracked me up to see Min's mom trying to butter up Cal's socially elite mother at such an inopportune moment. Hilarious.5. Showing, not Telling--the writing excellently SHOWED us the development of the characters, the development of Min & Cal's romance, the development of the secondary characters. Things weren't spelled out, instead we were given a full and beautiful picture. I loved the subtlety used.6. The Villains--the ex's played a huge role in this story. Even though they were the \\"villains\\", I understood their motivations. They weren't anybody I'd like to hang out with, but that's the point, isn't it? Both were demented in the head in a completely humanly possible way, which made them real and believable. When the villain is cartoony, it makes the story unreal.7. The Betting--what?! I liked the betting? What is the world coming to? Cal and his friends bet over everything. Min catches onto this early on (obviously) and totally turns the tables on them and plays on their bets! How does \\"The Bet\\" play out? Well, it wasn't \\"I made that bet before I knew you!\\" Ms. Crusie totally made it work.8. The Ending--I like my romances with a Happily Ever After. This one delivers with a big smile.What I didn't like:1. The Actuary--I'm not so sure an actual actuary will start spouting statistical information. It wasn't over board, and the information she spilled out pertained to the story.2. Chicken Marsala--it seems to be the only thing these two eat. I know this sounds petty, but really, they eat this EVERY time food is mentioned.I was highly entertained by this book and couldn't put it down. I didn't want to let go of the story and found myself re-reading it instead of stopping. I read it 2 times in 3 days."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"[BASIC BOOK SUMMARY]Curvy, witty. thirty-three-year-old, Actuary Minerva Dobbs is dumped by her self-centered boyfriend. What makes it worse? The bastard does it three weeks before her sisters' wedding, her skinny and perfect sister. And her anal-retentive, passive aggressive, mother will not let her hear the end of it if she shows up to the wedding without a man. This is enough to ruin her evening, but things go from bad to worse. After her two girl-friends convince her to approach an absolutely gorgeous man, Calvin \\"Cal\\" Morrisey, for her escort to the wedding, she overhears her moments-agoex-boyfriend make an anger inducing bet with Cal.The bet? Ex David bets Calvin that he can't get the woman in the grey-checked suit at the bar to go to bed with him. Who is this poor grey-checked suit woman about to be humiliated? Well, wouldn't you know that Miss Minerva Dobbs is. In her anger she devises a plan. She will let Cal pick her up, take her to dinner, and maybe she can string him along as her date for the wedding, and make him really work for a bet he has no chance to win.Meanwhile, Cal is doing his best to avoid his marriage minded ex while he enjoys a few drinks with he best friends, and business partners, after work. But then things go to hell. His irritating client, David, slithers over with his ex, Cynthy, and the pressure is on. He somehow has to avoid his eager ex and his client's attempts to make an immoral bet to get a woman into bed. He's nearly managed to weasel out of it when his ex's presence forces him to compromise on the topic of them bet. To escape the bar and the situation, he takes the bet that he can get the suit to go to dinner and makes his exit, escaping the situation.So these two would-be-lovers embark on their chaotic ride with dinner. Minerva has Cal's \\"number\\" and out maneuvers, out-bitches, his sexy \\"used car salesman of seducers\\" gimmick. Cal thinks Minerva is an uptight repressed woman that he definitely should stay away from. What's the problem? Fate has other ideas. Somehow these two just can't stay away from each other, and if it's not their friends' relationships with each other that brings them together and pulls them apart, it's the interference of their insane neurotic families. Try as they might to avoid each other, they just can't stay away from each other physical attraction and their niggling inner voices, which keep whispering, \\"this one\\", keep complicating things. Fighting their mutual attraction and distrust, these two fight an up-hill battle of a comedy of errors. Sacrasm, sexual-tension, the dynamics of family issues, and the support of friends weaves a hilarious and heartfelt tale of the roller coaster ride that is love.[BOOK REVIEW]Crusie has done it again with her great characters and witty dialogue. What really makes this a book to read over and over again is the author's dry wit, varying cultural references, and her ability to weave seemingly co-incidental events seamlessly. The dynamics of her characters, the ways in which they interact and grow, are real and easy to relate to. There is a concept of fate, and a development of the Chaos Theory that weaves perfectly, and hilariously, into the story in addition to an ongoing theme of fairy tales (with plenty of subtly presented parallels and allusions to such tales as Cinderella).While it is the great characters, with real personalities and issues, that make this a great story, it is especially Crusie's ability to write witty, fast pace dialogue, with individual voices for each character, that really draws in and holds the reader's interest.Another thing about this book that impressed me was that Crusie covered three very different romantic relationships dynamics in this book without cluttering the main love story. Whether you believe in an uncomplicated happily ever after or if you believe in living in each moment, this book is relatable. Each of the main women have their own different ideas about love and are still able to be supportive of another's beliefs, worries, and needs.This is perfect book for a book club, a group of close girl friends, or even the solitary reader who wants to settle in for an evening in alone with a glass of wine and loud raucous laughter. So, prospective reader, order a copy and enjoy, for it is most certainly worth it. Even better, get a copy on audio CD's as well (the reader does an amazing job). This is the kind of book you can read or listen to over and over again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Crusie shines in this modern day fairy tale that makes you happy you read romance. I love all of her books, but this is my all-time favorite! Get ready to laugh!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I'm not a big fan of romance novels. However, I couldn't put this book down and I lost a few hours of sleep trying to find out how Cal and Min were going to end up. Because Crusie writes from both characters' POV, you really root for them because you know what's REALLY going on. Some of the events were a little far fetched, but it just added to the fairy tale part of the story.I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good love story. Be prepared to lose some sleep because you just can't put this book down."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I'm always leery about picking up strictly romance books, because usually a lot of the ones I try reading are too (for lack of better word) fluffy. This one was definatly not like that. Once I started it I didn't want to put it down. Min and Cal's relationship is amusing, as is the shoe fetish going on. I got a little bored during some of the parts where the story shifted to David and Cyn plotting, but it never lasted long. I enjoyed all the different character's outlook on how love works and also the characters were all well wrote. I'm a sucker for fairy tales, so I loved that it was kind of wrote out to be a modern one. I'll more than likely be picking up another book by Crusie soon."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I LOVED this book!! I read it 2 days! I could not put it down! This is the first time I have read anything by Cruise...but it definitely won't be the last! I have since shared this tasty treat with my friends and family, and they all loved it!! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Crusie is the best in contemporary romantic fiction- but you've got to like some laughs; if passionate pathos and despair are your thing, you won't be pleased. Bet Me is at the top of my list of her books, though Faking It and Welcome to Temptation are duking it out for pure entertainment value. Her dialogue and situations are outstanding. Her books step on the edges of suspension of disbelief without ever going near the shores of Dynasty type writing. Her characters are fully rounded with flaws, families and friends that just make us like them more. Reading a Crusie novel is the best form of escapism. She has a fabulous sense of humor and her heros are perfect for being so far from perfect and therefore believable fantasies. She writes a sex scene like no one else. The hero is never virile and unbelievably potent and the gasps usually (initially) come from something stuck in the cushions under the couch. Then they deal. The most unlikely, yet lovely, aspect is that her heros want to talk and figure out how to do better in the future. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"For me, Jennie Crusie has raised the bar by which all contemporaries are judged.Bet Me is another winner. How can you not fall for a guy who loves his lady as much for her faults as for what he sees hiding beneath them. And it's hidden deep.Min Dobbs is like an anti-heroine, she's so tough on Cal, a sensitive, dyslexic hero who sees her weaknesses and her needs and is there for both. Of course they meet on a bet, but that's the best kind of setup in my book. Shaky ground; it's never gonna work; both Min and Cal are certain, but Crusie pulls it off despite their struggle.It was so much fun watching Cal lure Min into his world with tenderness, Chicken Marsala and Krispy Kreme donuts. What a hoot. If you've never read Crusie, you're missing out big time.Bet Me is another Crusie masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"There is NO ONE out there who writes repartee as well as Jenny Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I don't read a lot of \\"chick lit\\" -- but I do love Jennifer Cruisie. Cruisie's wit shines through in her characterization, her dialogue, and her ability to laugh at situations she's doubtless been in, through her characters' eyes.All of that seems missing from \\"Bet Me\\", her latest. I'm told it's an older manuscript that got polished for publication -- but much of what I enjoy about Cruisie's work is missing. There are no really likeable characters here, especially in the parents of lead characters Min and Calvin. In terms of romance and sexual situations, which Crusie excels at - you can get warm reading what Calvin thinks about Min, but you really can't see much real passion from any of the other characters for their various partners. The characters I hated included Cynthie, David...and I was pretty impatient with Bonnie and her outlook on fairy tale lives (although her proposal to Calvin's friend was witty)...and Crusie went on and on about Min's weight, her self-consciousness, and her carb count. Truly, this book was an advertisement for Krispy Kreme donuts and chicken Marsala.Crusie can do much, much better, and I'm looking forward to her next work of original, and not reworked material.2 stars - I really wouldn't bother, if I were you."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"After I read Bet Me, I thought 'been there, done that. ' It seems like the author combined 'Fast Women' and 'Welcome to Temptation,' and threw in some new music (Elvis) and fairy tale stuff. There's the little kid and the baseball game, the three tight women friends, someone gets hit with something, the frozen mother and so on. And speaking of the frozen mother, it would be so nice to see this author portray a woman in her fifties as something other than an ice matron or manipulative or frozen or unfulfilled or incomplete or dead below the waist. When you think about some of her older female characters (Gwen, Liz, Nanette, Cal's mother, Maddie's mother) Crusie seems to perpetuate these stereotypes of the woman over fifty."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I found BET ME to be a big disappointment. Populated by cardboard characters, it lacks charm and wit. I hope she's getting paid by Krispy Kreme because it's mainly a glorified ad for them."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I enjoyed the interaction of the main characters and their friends in this story. Some of the plot wore me out, though."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"After looking over the other reviews, much to my surprise, I realize that the vast majority of reviews of this book thought it was great. I found it to be childish, ridiculous, and a predictable waste of time. I found the characters to all be caricatures of unlikeable personalities. I felt like I was watching a bad skit on Saturday Night Live as Jennifer Crusie tried to add what was supposed to be humor, but read like slapstick shlock (e.g. one character repeatedly whacked the male lead with her purse; there was one scene where all the characters unexpectedly showed up at the same time at the female lead's apartment). I'm sorry I didn't follow my first (and continuous) impulse to stop reading. The end didn't justify having to endure all the cliches, caricatures, and ridiculous scenes."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was one of the most boring books I've ever read. The story line is/could be cute but the writing is horrible. Too many he said / she saids and details that don't help to develop the characters."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"If I had friends and family like Min, I would have told them where to go long ago. I found it hard to believe that a 33 yr. old female put up with so much from them.I usually love most of Crusie's books but this was not a favorite. I didn't like most of the characters and thought they were nuts."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I started the book thinking it would be a great escape from reality. Well, it was and it wasn't. It seemed as though the author was trying to write both Bridget Jones's Diary and Sex and the City...but she didn't quite pull off either. Don't get me wrong, it was a somewhat enjoyable fantasy book, however, I am not going to suggest it to any of my friends."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I've heard a lot about Jennifer Crusie and looked forward to this book because it was supposed to have a \\"voluptuous\\" heroine. The storyline sounded cute and so I waited and watched and finally bought it in hard back, which I very rarely do.I'm very disappointed because in complaining about her size (which Min did OFTEN), she indicated that a size 8 was a couple sizes too small for her. That, in my mind, makes her maybe at the most, a size 12. A size 12 is not a big woman, it's an average size woman.Next, I found myself almost repulsed at how often Cal FED Min, like it was some kind of fetish. Min complained how her mother told her to not eat and then Cal turned around and ordered her to eat (the buttered roll scene?). What's UP with that?I also disliked Cynthie and David and felt those characters were extremely one-dimensional. Sadly, the \\"gang\\" (Bonne, Roger, Liza, Tony) were all just as bad. Then there were the mothers! Can't even begin to comment on them! And let's discuss Diana... what was she so upset about all that time?! The resolution to that question was a waste of our time.I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I didn't and I won't bother reading any other Crusie books. :("},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Let me just say that it is 6 a.m. in the morning. I have a LOT of work to do at our business today, which will be rather difficult as I HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED BECAUSE I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT reading, &quot;Bet Me&quot; by Jennifer Crusie. For the first time in a LONG time, I could not put the book down!I think that it is a crime to have the Spotlight Review rating this only 2 stars!! It is one of the BEST books that I have read all year. I guess that everyone is different, but I can't believe that we were reading the same book.Jennifer Crusie's books ALL have great dialogue, but sometimes her previous books seemed just a little too &quot;dysfunctional&quot; in a witty kind of way. Even though &quot;Bet Me&quot; has its strange moments, it is a captivating book.The dialogue completely submerged me into the characters. The entire time I was reading it, I thought, &quot;My God - that is exactly what people would say.&quot; It wasn't canned or stilted- it was funny, but more believable than any dialogue I think that I have ever read.I hope that Jennifer Crusie will write more books like this. What is truly a shame though is that the first reviewer's views are far from the majority opinion of this book. Sadly, that is what too many people will look at. This really is a book worth buying. I loved the characters and especially liked the addition of the last chapter.Excellent, excellent book."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I just read Jennifer Crusie's new book, Bet Me, in one sitting. I discovered her last year and have read almost every book she's written -- and have been delighted with each and every one. She writes romantic comedies ... really good, funny, heart-warming, witty, intelligient romantic comedies.This one is about a normal girl ... I say normal because she isn't a size two with gorgeous blond hair that catches the light just so & has the perfect job and is the envy of all around her. That's the typical romantic comedy heroine. Not in this book. In Bet Me, we have Minerva Dobbs: a slightly overweight, under-confident, intelligient, hilarious, witty heroine. I laughed throughout this book ... Crusie has a writing style that I haven't seen before. All of her books are romantic comedys, they all have unlikely heroines, and they all have animals. Usually its dogs - but in this one it's a mangy looking cat. Her books have lovable characters -- REAL characters. People you can see yourself actually knowing .... People you can see YOURSELF in. This book struck a chord with me in many ways .... but I loved a scene towards the very end. Minerva is standing in front of a mirror after putting on a dress that our hero has chosen for her and he's trying to make her see what he sees ... a beautiful and sexy woman.If you're looking for a light, warm-hearted read .... Bet Me is a good bet!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Jennifer Crusie goes for it and tells a love story the way it should be told - with total, reckless abandon. In this modern-age fairy tale, actuary Min Dobbs knows handsome Cal Morrissey is a bad risk. He's a habitual lover-and-leaver, and too charming to be up to any good. Cal Morrissey knows that love's a long shot and the best you can hope for is a good time in the mean time - and uptight Min doesn't even look like a good time in the first place. But when Fate steps in to put them together, everyone knows resistance is futile.From delightful main characters to an engaging supporting cast, Crusie hits another one out of the park with \\"Bet Me.\\" Crusie's signature tight storytelling and graceful humor are as present here as ever, but she's added a layer of mythology without apology which creates a thoroughly charming set of characters in a lovely world where fairy tales can come true. It's a good bet that you won't find a better warm fuzzy this year; \\"Bet Me\\" is worth every penny of the hardcover price."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Minn lacks self esteem to go with her curvy body. Her favorite feature is her odd taste in footwear, and the belief that a girl can never have too many shoes. She just broke up with her boyfriend David (though never making the plunge and sleeping with him). The only thing that depresses her about her breakup with David is that she won't have a date to his sisters wedding.While at a bar, her friends goad her into walking up to a cute guy - Cal Morrissey, a serial dater afraid of commitment who just broke up with his therapist girlfriend. As she makes her way to Cal, she inadvertently overhears David making a bet with him that he cannot bed the girl in the grey suit within a month. Being the gal in the grey suit, she's shocked at first, but decides two can play that game, and sets out to make Cal's life miserable for that month (and heck, he'll make a cute date for the wedding). What she doesn't realize is that he didn't take the bet, but rather just bet that he could leave with her (for $10). Though their dinner date is a bust, circumstances keep throwing the two together, and Cal and Minn slowly start to develop feelings for each other - but Minn is still hurt because of the bet. Cal is mystified that his regular charm doesn't work on her - she seems immune. The big question is whether the two can weather the storm and discover their true feelings.With dialogue so witty and fresh that you can really imagine the conversations actually taking place, it'll have you craving chicken Marsala and Krispy Kremes. Despite their flaws, there is great chemistry between Minn and Cal. \\"Bet Me\\" was the first book I read by Jennifer Crusie. After this one, I was hooked on her writing style and sought out the rest of her books. Her writing is so fresh, her characters so quirky and believable, and her novels just cannot be beat."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I couldn't put this book down - after I read it I had to go right back to some good parts. It's standing up excellently to re-reading: it was just as funny the third time as it was the first two.Jenny herself described this as a &quot;cheesy romance&quot;. There is no suspense element, and the plot is not only straightforward, but extensively foreshadowed. These are not flaws, because the writing is wonderful, the dialogue is hilarious, and the characters are interesting, as usual. I particularly liked how true everything was; there are at least six different theories of love and relationships among the various characters, all of which turn out to apply to the protagonists. In recent books by Ms. Crusie there is usually some element a bit over the top; in &quot;Bet Me&quot; it's the fairy tale themes. How many actuaries get to play Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Snow White, a girl who cries wolf, and the Beast in the course of a single story?Crusie writes contemporary romances in much the way Dorothy L. Sayers wrote mysteries, or Lois McMaster Bujold writes science fiction, or Georgette Heyer wrote Regencies. Which is to say excellently well, but with no two books quite alike. In particular, they don't tend to repeat themes. If you like the writers voice, and enjoy watching her grow and change, this is wonderful. It does lead to different readers having different favorite books. This week my own favorite Crusie is probably &quot;Faking It&quot;, but tastes vary. Fortunately it doesn't matter much; they're all very good.If you insist on suspense with your romance, try Jayne Ann Krentz or Nora Roberts instead. If you want a story more focused on a serial heartbreaker hero, try Catherine Asaro's SF novel &quot;The Last Hawk&quot;. If you want a recent fairy tale romance as fantasy rather than as a contemporary, try &quot;The Fairy Godmother&quot; by Mercedes Lackey. If you love &quot;Bet Me&quot; and want more straight contemporary romance, try Susan Elizabeth Phillips. If you really need the same theme over and over, stick to authors like Stephanie Laurens instead.Jenny went on to suggest &quot;... the world needs more cheese&quot;. I'm from Wisconsin, where we heartily agree with that sentiment. Especially when it produces books as wonderful as &quot;Bet Me&quot;."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Okay -- wow, this was good! I have never read Crusie before, so I was expecting just another semi-generic chick lit novel. I've never been so glad to be disappointed!I think this is the most perfect chick lit book I have ever read. It was hilarious, for one -- the one-liners just kept coming the whole novel through. And they were *good* one-liners, funny, smart, sexy, and witty. The characters were fabulous -- well-drawn, quirky, likeable (the good guys), deliciously unlikeable (the bad guys), intelligent, and fully fleshed-out. These were people I wanted to get to know and hang out with, the kind of people I could see myself being friends with. And the plot was utterly absorbing. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. Literally. I stayed up until 9:00 in the morning finishing this thing; by the end, I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open, but I kept on reading instead of doing the sensible thing and, y'know, sleeping, because I just *had* to know what happened next. It's been a while since I've been that caught up in a book. I'm going to have to check out Jennifer Crusie's other novels, because that was really a lot of fun!Oh! I forgot to mention the best part! The overweight heroine doesn't lose weight to win the heart of the hero! Not only is she as fat for the happily-ever-after ending as she was for the beginning, but the hero kept feeding her all the way through the novel because he liked the look on her face when she ate something yummy. I was starving when I finished _Bet Me_ -- people kept eating pasta, chicken marsala, and Krispy Kreme donuts! I've been waiting a long time for a book that said you don't have to be thin to be happy, and actually *meant* it. Thanks, Ms. Crusie!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I have not laughed so hard for a long time. This was my first book that I've read by Jennifer Crusie, but it certainly won't be my last. Crusie makes believable characters with more attitude, and more issues then the National Geographic. I could certainly relate to Min's overbearing mother, and her lousy luck with outfits.. well except shoes. We both have excellent taste in those! LOL.. This book was well written, and it was refreshing to have a main character who wasn't the stereotypical female romantic lead. Min is 33, curvy, and very individualistic. The book was not predictable in any way, and it didn't get bogged down in melodramatics. This is definitely going on my favorite books list!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"If you liked Tracy and Hepburn, Bogart and Becall, Gable and Lombard just to name a few then I think it's safe to say that you will like Cal and Min. Like the preceding couples, they click in a memorable way. And like the archetypes above, they are sexy and fun to read about. Once I picked up Bet Me, I had a hard time putting it down. Not because I was worried about the ending or that it kept me in suspense. Nope, it was just so much fun to read that I enjoyed almost every minute of it.Crusie has matured in her writing and it shows in this offering. Her characters are sophisticated, smart and likable. They are movie material. I always thought WTT was movie material but more in a Farrelly Brothers type of movie. Bet me is akin to Mike Nichol's material. Either is lots of fun and true entertainment but Nichol's films have that touch of something that makes them classics. And Bet Me is like that. It has that certain something where the characters are bigger than the pages and they come right off and on to the stage. All the characters in this book are well written and indispensable. Each shines their little bit of flashlight on the fun and development of the romance between the leads. Whether it's the lesbian neighbor bartender or the ex-psycho- analyst girlfriend who is an almost stalker.Bet Me was an exercise in written foreplay. Badinage type foreplay, where the characters delve into every aspect of each other before giving in to the inevitable. The sexual banter and development of the relationship between Cal and Min is really good stuff and like I said hard to put down. JC really puts a lot into the cultivation of her characters in this book especially the heroine. She is a woman that you can relate to in some ways if not all ways. We all have our physical drawbacks and a person in our lives that makes us feel inadequate. So, Min is a sympathetic character like Brigid Jones was. Min is never going to be model thin and her mother is never going to be happy about that. She has an overprotective dad as well as in appearance, a perfect sister and Min isn't exactly the sweetest person in the world. Min has attitude and she doesn't want to settle. She's not expecting Prince Charming like her friend Bonnie but in a relationship she expects a little endurance and respect. Her ex provided neither.Cal appears to be the consummate playboy type. Gorgeous, well off, buff and intelligent with a reputation as a heartbreaker. A love \`em and leave \`em womanizing male creature with no feelings. Appears is the operative word here. Cal like Min has layers and depths and is not as shallow as he seems to be. He has had to contend with dyslexia his whole life as well as overbearing parents. And though it seems like he can't maintain a long term relationship, it's obvious he has never fallen in love before.The secondaries are great in this book and very memorable. Even the per se villains the exes are well drawn and add just the right dimensions to this book. I was trying to think of my favourite scene in this book and I was running them all through my brain. It was nearly impossible to pick one but if I had to, I would have to pick the post coital scene near the end where everyone and his mother literally show up. Great plotting and excellent dialogue in this book. Bet Me gets an A from me and I really hope it does get made into a movie. There are rumors that there may be one. Wouldn't that be fun."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book is simply a gem. Wonderful book! I admit to being one of the many who did not sleep for an entire night becoz i absolutely couldn't put this book down! Jennifer Crusie's dialogue is sharp, incredibly witty, well-paced, and juz too funny! Characters are also brilliant in that they're developed well and very convincingly. Heroine Min Dobbs is a smart and lovable person with very realistic insecurities abt her weight, while Cal Morrisey is a charming and kind fella with very good romantic instincts. Crusie's writing is juz fantastic, the humorous scenes are laugh out loud funny, and the sad scenes are heartbreaking enough to jerk tears (well, for me anyway, i guess becoz i can relate).Not being a writer myself, I am kinda running out of words to describe how good this book is. But let me put it this way, right after i read the last page of BET ME, i immediately went back to the front cover and started reading it all over again. Juz coz i wasn't ready to leave Min and Cal yet. It is THAT good."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I'm in dissertation mode of my Ph.D. in comparative literature and feel as if I've read almost every book published. Some of those I enjoyed and some I didn't. This book, however, I loved reading.Another reviewer hit the nail on the head when he or she lauded Crusie's dialog skills, which are stupendous.Clearly, _Bet Me_ is not _Beloved_, and isn't supposed to be. So ff you're looking for entertaining, well written purely escapist women's fiction, look no further. Crusie is your answer. In fact, I find her talents light years beyond the current champion, Nora Roberts.Another reviewer complained of numerous, ill defined characters, but I don't see that at all. Just not at all. _Bet Me_ moves along at lightening speed, and I was sad to come to the end."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"actually i didnt read it in english i read it turkish still it was really good i really feel like i'm in the book i love the characters and the love between mimi and cal and now i know its stupid but i've order the english version and gonna read it right away......highly recommended"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"A good, interesting read. Not my favorite of JC's, but definitely worth the read. Can't go wrong with JC books."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Finally I've found a book with a chubby star who doesn't think her body is the most important and horrible thing of her life. Usually, when the main character of a book is a fat woman, story runs around the fact she hate her body, wants to change it, and nobody loves her untill she loses 20 pounds.In Bet Me, the main character is a strong and zaftig woman, Min, who has a good life. Yes, she's overweight, but this is only a problem for her because she has to fit in a bridesmaid's dress. She has the problems all women have with our looks, but she's still sexy, go clubbing and has good friend and even lovers. Yes, she dreams about lose a few pounds, but she likes to eat and hate her mother and is ex boyfriend, whom are always watching what she eats.The love affair between Min and Calvin is full of misunderstandings, and have a slow progress, like practicaly all the real romances. Calvin don't want to fall in love with Min, but it's inevitable for him. He HAS to love her because she's different, not for her body, but for her funny personality.This is a book with strong characters, a funny story, a good amound of strained momments, and a sexy love story. Perfect for a quiet weekend and for today's women without complexs. I loved it."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This book turned me on! I have never read a book that was basically foreplay. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I just finished Jennifer Crusie 'Bet Me' and loved the romance and the underling theme of Donuts. This book keeps a smile on your face with every page. The basic storyline is about two 30+ people who come with baggage but with yelling, laughter and chaos a mature health relationship starts. I loved Min's mother character very real ~ she sometimes steals the show. Take a chance and buy this book - you will enjoy every morsel."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet Me is a fabulous book. Though it had a rough start, it really picked up towards the end. The main plot of the book is about Minerva Dobbs, a practical, sworn off of men, carb counter, who is being swooned by Cal. Cal is a serial dater that always wins his bets. When Cal recieves a bet to try to make Min fall in love with him, his world goes crazy. To make it worse, Min knows about the bet. First, they argue over everything and decide not to see each other, but fate has other plans. Where ever they go, they accidently bump into each other. They each finally realize that they love one another. Min tells Cal that she knows about the bet and he decides to throw it, but Min decides the prize is to great to risk. Ten thousand dollars and true love is too precious to let go."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"Bet me was a lot of fun. This book is about a non-typical herorine, plus sized, a little insecure, but very vibrant. Min is a wonderful character and her cast of friends only add to the story. Min and her current boyfriend end up in splitsville when Min overhears him at a bar betting the gorgeous Calvin(Cal) that first he can't get her to leave with him and second that he can't get her into bed within the month.Min furious decides she'll let the bet go and run things her way. This is the beginning of a wild ride with two groups of friends in an all out girl vs. guys battle of the sexes.This was a wonderful romp and I look forward to more of Ms. Crusie's work!This is an excellent summer read or any other time, but right now it was just what I was looking for!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This was a very funny book. Move over Janet Evanovich whose books lately have gone downhill. JC's humor in this one is excellent. Repartee excellent. No so svelt Min meets gorgeous Cal and puts him in his place. His thoughts are sooo funny and the whole book is not mean spirited. Thought all the characters were very good especially the Mothers. Very entertaining and worth the read."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is my 1st Crusie novel and I liked it... didn't absolutely love it the way I have some other \\"chick lit\\", though.I liked the sexual tension between Min & Cal that builds up throughout the book. It makes the physical act that much sweeter and more fulfilling for the reader when it happens. The food obsession and carb count that others have complained about parallels this point and is also today's reality. It's all about carbs these days and denying yourself guilty pleasures like bread and Krispy Kremes. When you finally allow yourself these luxuries, you appreciate them in a new and special way.The first chapter, although essential for understanding the bet, doesn't grab your attention. Once you get past that though, it begins to pick up and hooks you in. I also agree that there are some unlikeable and meddling peripheral characters, but they are necessary for the conflict in the story and sometimes add humor to the scenes. One *minor* thing that bothered me while reading this was how Crusie shortens the character's names: Min & Cal, in particular, but it also extended to include Cyn and others. As if these characters didn't have dreadful enough names to begin with.All in all, it is a fun, enjoyable read. Just don't take it all too seriously."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"When is the next Jennifer Crusie book coming out? She is one of my favorite authors and I was sorry to see Bet Me come to an end."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I loved this book and finished it in 24 hours! But when I stopped to reflect on what made the book so great all I can think is I laughed out loud and I actually snorted. It wasn't my proudest moment, or very lady like, but I was alone so I figure that's okay. I think what I liked the most was Crusie wrote complex characters but didn't hold the readers hand while over explaining them and killing their uniqueness factor by putting a neon sign over their every trait.If you like cute romance with funny characters and a complicated story, definitely pick this up!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"\\"Bet Me\\" is my favorite Jennifer Crusie.

The characters are wonderful and funny and the friendships are very similar to my own. The entire time I was reading this book I thought \\"how is this not a movie?\\".

Her writing seemed too choppy and disjointed to me, and I honestly wondered why people enjoyed her books so much. I picked this one up thinking I'd give her one more try, and wow! I'm so glad I did. This book is laugh-out-loud funny, with a fast-paced plot, excellent characterization, and great dialogue. Others detailed the plot, so I won't go into it in my review, but did want to mention that the too-frequent references to the heroine's weight got to be a little too much at times. That wasn't enough to ruin the story for me, though. It's not a keeper for me, and not a reread, but I loved meeting the characters so much, and it provided so many chuckles, that it deserves 5 stars from me."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is Jennifer Crusie at her best--meaning, this is a wonderful romance novel! Good characters, great dialogue, just plain out fun!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I can't believe that I just discovered Jennifer Crusie last year! I really, really enjoy her novels and her heroines! They are intelligent, full of personality, realistic, human, and (most importantly) never skinny, over-highlighted, complaining \\"it\\" girls. In a literary world full of the woeful tales of starving, depresseed, and delusional heiresses, Jennifer Crusie is such a relief to find.Bet Me is about Minerva Dobbs and her attempt to find Mr. Right without losing her integrity and self respect. I would talk about the plot more, but you, if you enjoy romances, all you need to know is that you should just read it. Minerva is an incredibly likeable character, and the writing and the plot are just hilarious! This is a romance for intelligent, witty women who want something more literary that Harlequin and less glossy than Jackie Collins or Danielle Steel."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"I am a crazy Jennifer Crusie fan, and this is by far my favorite.

It was what I was expecting, light, fluffy, easy on the brain, but it also surprised me by being more. Great dialogue, great characters, a plot that has more twists and turns than the Danube river (not that I have any idea what I'm talking about there!) this book when down smooth and easy.This book reminded me a lot of Good in Bed by Jennifer Weiner, in that our heroine is on the heavy side and she's been burned by a guy and is decidedly NOT looking for love. But in walks Mr. Right and she's knocked for a loop she wasn't expecting. And he's just as surprised as she is, since he wasn't exactly looking for her either. Misunderstandings, bets, chicken marsala and lots of laughs insue as these two do everything in there power to stay away from each other. The sexual tension is hot, the love scenes hotter, and with a wicked cat named Elvis with a penchant FOR Elvis (as in Presley) this novel definitely seems to have it all. Highly recommend for a great distraction from the real world."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is a good book by J Crusie. Her writing is light and funny.

But not the bet that Min thinks he picks her up on.Both Min and Cal know that the other is THE ONE, but fight tooth-and-nail to avoid consciously admitting that small detail to themselves. Fate conspires against (they believe...for, I believe) them, maiming them a bit each time they deny the rightness of their love.The secondary characters (Bonnie and Roger, Tony, Liza, Emilio, and Shanna) truly add to the story, and keep up the flow of wonderfulness going.I have read it, re-read it, and will continue to re-read it until I no longer have sight or hearing or breath in my body!"},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"The story line, guy makes a bet to get girl, seems over done... but the aurthor runs with this story line and leaves you laughing. It is by far the best book i have ever read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Bet Me","review":"This is the first book I've downloaded from the local library and listened to on a combination of CDs and iPod (depending on where I was). Prior to this I'd only read one Jennifer Crusie book, and wasn't too impressed with it.This book was much better than I expected. It explores traditional gender stereotypes about relationships and portrays two non-perfect people: Min, an overweight career-minded woman who's frightened of being hurt in relationships, but needs a date to her sister's wedding; and Cal, a relationship-scared learning disabled business owner who has been told his whole life that he's damaged goods and is scared to commit to anyone. The story also amusingly features their best friends, family members, and acquaintances, including two exes set out to destroy the main characters' blooming relationship.Bet Me was a terrific \\"read\\" and I was sorry to have it end. I may just read more Jennifer Crusie after this. (Although this book may have been merely a break from her usual fluff.) Whoever the audiobook narrator was, was also good, as she was able to nimbly articulate both male and female characters' voices."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":". . .with some flaws which limit it's appeal.Noted Christian composer Patrick Kavanaugh has done a good job in presenting his thesis; namely that many, if not most, of the great composers over the last 400 years, were men of spirituality -- even if not always completely orthodox in their expressions of that spirituality. As far as that goes, the point is quite valid.However, at times, Kavanaugh seems to be stretching his thesis to include less obvious examples (Schubert, for instance) when more obvious examples could have been used. (However, he does do the musical world a good service by rehabilitating Wagner and demonstrating that while he was a man with many faults, he cannot and should not be held responsible for the actions of Hitler!)Also frustrating was Kavanaugh's habit of ascribing specific internal motives to several of the featured composers. In addition, there is a strong anti-Catholic bias in the book which I found distasteful. Those composers with Protestant backgrounds had their Protestantism emphasized, while those with Catholic backgrounds had their Catholicism minimized and even ridiculed. For me, this was unnecessary and intellectually dishonest.This being said, I would still like to see another volume. Many, many other composers come to mind which could fill such a book. And hopefully, some of the anti-Catholic bias could be filtered out."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"As both a classical music fan and a Christian, I was initially excited by this book. A quick perusal before purchasing let me know it would not be an in-depth exploration, but brief biographical sketches of the composers. While the author did a good job of providing a balanced presentation of the facts (see the chapter on Chopin), the book suffers from a kind of redactive shallowness that comes from attempting to look for genuine Christian faith in two-dimensional biographical material. The weakness of this approach is that it looks for certainty about individual faith from the sociocultural milieu in which the composers lived, where spiritual language was the norm. It is important to note that, while the author uses &quot;spiritual&quot; in the title, he means &quot;Christian,&quot; or so it appears by his attempt to reconcile the unorthodox beliefs and conduct of men like Wagner and Beethoven with orthodox faith. The small postscripts at the end of each chapter that linked a character trait with each composer was trite and did not add any value to the book. I tended to skip them. Finally, there were some disappointing omissions: Vivaldi, Schumann, Mahler, Arvo Part and John Tavener come to mind. All in all, an interesting but unremarkable read."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"\\"People of faith\\" will likely be the most interested in these mini-biographies of the great composers that focuses mostly on the spiritual (mostly Christian) aspects of their lives. In that light, this book helps fill-in some of the personal faith aspects of each composer that are rarely expounded upon in depth in the other biographies. Kavanaugh's distillations here extract many of the most personal conversations and writings of these composers in an attempt to \\"reconstruct\\" their inner, spiritual life. And while some of the common lingo in the letters written in 18th/19th century Europe did indeed contain more neutral and polite \\"God talk,\\" most of the direct quotes go way beyond that to reveal deeply personal and theological thoughts about what that composer felt about God, faith and the relation to their musical lives. Kavanaugh cites Brahms as a notable example who supposedly revealed very deep theological thoughts and personal beliefs to writer/friend Abell, who published them finally in 1955 after years of avowed silence (\\"Talks with Great Composers\\"). Many will also find the author's account of Chopin's last years particular touching as the great poet-pianist embraced the faith within him that had faded to a flicker amidst the hedonistic Parisian lifestyle of the 19th century. Other composers listed here will appear to some readers to be somewhat of a stretch regarding the presence of a genuine faith in God and love of mankind in their lives. But, again, Kavanaugh presents other, more hidden aspects of their lives not common in other biographies that are worth hearing.However, trying to really understand the inner life and faith of a person - any person then or now - is a tricky proposition. It is tempting to extrapolate and make simple conclusions about a complex person based on a few words in a letter, and Kavanaugh might do this at times. But, other times the original writings Kavanaugh quotes seems to more clearly reveal a deeply spiritual person that might not have been apparent to others then or now. Overall though, this book is very revealing and presents a rather unique and detailed account of the spiritual lives of these great composers. As such it is a useful adjunct book on the topic. One caveat: given that the author's perspective here, you will not find any discussion on other religious or spiritual leanings outside mainstream 18th/19th century European Catholic/Protestant faith but will need to consult other sources if that is your interest. Other highly recommended books for general study of the great composers are (1) \\"The Gift of Music\\" which gives excellent biographies on 36 composers and also gives some Christian perspective ... and (2) \\"Lives of the Great Composers (Schonberg) which is one of the legendary references for the study of the composers and musical eras but reads more like a good novel than an academic treatise."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"This was a neat little book for folks that like classical music. It gives us something of the personal and spiritual sides of great composers, as well as short summaries of their musical careers. It was good to know something about them besides their names and music, and to get some nice tips on great music you might not be familiar with.I found that Mozart was not quite the consummate party animal he is portrayed as in \`Amadeus', the movie, at least not for his whole life. The author, Patrick Kavannaugh, asks us how each of us would like to have our lives put into biographies for public consumption. I know I would have to pass on that. I found that Haydn was happy and friendly, just like his music. Bruckner was a little hard too know, but well worth the effort to do so, just like his music. Folks like Beethoven, Wagner, and Liszt were very spiritual, though you don't hear much about that, and would not suspect so.It was also surprising to me that most of them were Catholic, but I guess that makes sense since the Catholic Church has always been a great patron of the arts. Certainly, Mozart's Requiem and Beethoven's Mass are two of the greatest choral pieces ever written.The book was a little gem for those of us who like classical music."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"As a teenager, I don't usually don't get that excited over history. But this book changed everything!! A subject that had not previously been of interest to me became a fascination. Not only am I anxious to listen to the music these great composers wrote, but I am also starting a quest to find and read all of their biographies! You have to read this book--it's the best!!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"I purchased this book to expand my families appreciation for classical music. We are beginners, at best, and it's hard to know where to start to broaden your understanding. This book was VERY insightful. It is one thing to listen to the music and attempt to appreciate it, but to understand the perspective of the composer and the purpose of major pieces puts everything in a new light. I am really pleased with this purchase."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"I used information from this book as a part of my weekly Piano Theory classes this past summer. Each week we studied and listened to music from a different pianist/composers. This added real-life understanding of the composers, as opposed to data and factual information from standard reference sources. After the summer classes were over, I gave copies of this book to each student as a gift. The composers came alive for them, and they learned about them in a personal way."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"This book looked very intriguing when I saw it on the shelf at the library. It contains short biographical sketches of twenty of history's greatest composers, concentrating solely on the aspect of their spiritual beliefs, and how those beliefs impacted their music.There are definite strengths and weaknesses to this book. It's quite easy to read, and offers some interesting details about the lives of these fascinating musicians that weren't covered in any of my music history textbooks. The citations and bibliography are very thorough, which I enjoy in a book of this nature, because it lends credibility and points in the direction of further reading about the composers who most piqued my interest. It's also an absolute gold mine of quotes, providing fodder for many a Facebook status update!Kavannaugh also devotes time correcting popularized misconceptions about some composers. For instance, we encounter a much more historic portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart than his unflattering depiction in the movie Amadeus, which won 8 Oscars in 1984 (including \\"Best Picture\\") but was notoriously bad history.On a whole, though, the book missed the mark for me. I had high hopes for a book that would demonstrate how the beliefs of composers of all spiritual persuasions and levels of devotion were manifested in their work. Many of these men were very conflicted and troubled... how did their devotion to God (or lack thereof) impact their music? Is there an observable difference between the work of devout Christians and the work of, say, someone who devoted his life to one of the Eastern religions? These are questions that greatly interest me.Unfortunately, the author chose instead to write a very superficial book, attempting to fit each of these composers into the mold of Christian orthodoxy. We are led to believe that all twenty musicians in this list were Christians, and this is meant to inspire those of us who are Christian musicians to take pride in the Christian heritage of our art.I, for one, believe that we have all the inspiration we need, without having to exaggerate this heritage by giving a rosy and inaccurate picture of great composers who were more than likely not true believers. After all, it is our God who is the Creator of music, and the giver of every good gift! What else do we need? Upholding as Christian examples men who had profoundly unbiblical ideas about God such as Richard Wagner and Frederic Chopin tarnishes the testimony of true followers and lovers of Jesus Christ such as J.S. Bach and G.F. Handel.A quick and interesting read, but take the author's words with a large grain of salt."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"Kavanaugh well researches a difficult topic, that a making an assessment of someone else's faith, let alone that of great music composers.Oh, sure we all know about Bach, Handel and Mendelssohn, but for me at least not Haydn, Schubert, Liszt, Dvorak.With equal grace he presents the results of his research, without really making final judgment on each composer, but rather laying out the evidence he has discovered. Seems that many of greatest had touch of both believing and not at times, and who doesn't. Just shocked, as author predicted most would, as the inclusion of Wagner. Only heard that he was God opposed conductor, so to hear of spiritual side for Christ was startling and fascinating.The intro to each composer is well done, and suggetions for music listening for each also make this truly pleasure. Numerous notes allow all that wish to delve further a ready bibliography to begin.Especially liked Hadyn's response to certain church types who thought his music too ebullient: Since God has given me a cheerful heart, He will forgive me for serving him cheerfully.\\"Also, the humbleness and piety of Dvorak was refreshing.Well written, read with relish. One to reread."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"This is a great book for my Music History class in a catholic high school. The brief biographies are interesting and inspiring. Many composers as well as artists have suffered with psychiatric disorders, or were considered eccentric, or otherwise &quot;different&quot;, but that should never discount their belief and faith in God. The positive and spiritual changes they made in life are more meaningful than the sins they may have committed, especially being closer to God just before death."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"Wether or not you are a Christian, you will enjoy this book.

It has an admirable goal: the spiritual side of music, the virtues of believing composers. But,the writing is awful. Its hard to read, hard to digest--its written so poorly. Kavanaugh is possessed by the unconscious drive to end, and begin!, every sentence with a preposition; and to deaden the reader with his passive voice.111: \\"The boy who would one day astound the musical world with his great opera Faust was born in Paris' Rue de l'Eperon on June 17, 1818. Gounod's father, a successful painter and lithographer, died when the boy was only five. His mother was a remarkable woman, a renowned painist, an excellent businesswoman (she managed her husband's lithography business after his death), and a fine mother, by her own son's words. In the introduction to \\"Memoirs,\\" Gounod, ...\\"Who's the boy? Mother of the boy or mother of the boy's father? So Guonod is the boy. Grammatically, we're left completely in the dark.There's yet another weak-point which makes the book about the boys with parents a pain to read:176: \\"Perhaps the reason Ralph Vaughan Williams was so attracted to the simplicity of English folk songs is found in the composer's own inherent unpretentiousness. He was never one to put on airs, even after he achieved international fame and was the toast of royalty and high society. Vaughan Willams' personality was unchanged by either his circumstances or the company of dissimilar people. His many friends always knew where they stood with him, and their affection for him was enhanced by his native simplicity of character.\\"or ' Vaughan Williams was a forthright man, an upright man, simple, sincere, unpretentious, untainted by his worldly fame'--simple, straight-forward, you could say--or would say, if you could!I certainly enjoy the unpretentiousness of toast, as I'm sure you do too, but this is quite unnecessary.Setting readability aside, the book about the boys with the father and Guonod's mother, though never edited, is a great find for someone looking for lists of religious music; Kavanaugh has a very sensitive Musical ear."},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"I believe that everyone, especially Bible believers, need to study and be acquainted with the great music that is part of our Western Cultural tradition. Unfortunately, the great composers were not always great men, and learning about them from a purely secular standpoint can sometimes present students with issues of a perverse nature which many parents would prefer be put off until the child is more mature. Furthermore, one item that is often overlooked in many musical studies is that many of the great composers were men of deep religious conviction who were guided by their faith in God as they worked.Enter Patrick Kavanaugh, who holds a doctorate in music composition and is director of the Christian Performing Artist Fellowship, with this book which profiles twenty composers, from Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frederick Handel, and Franz Josef Haydn (how could he miss Antonio Vivaldi?) to Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, and Olivier Messaien with emphasis on their Christian beliefs. Each chapter contains some biographical details, the essence of which is not what they did but what they believed, along with some suggestions for recommended listening. We used this book, along with Jane Stuarta Smith and Betty Carlson's The Gift of Music as the core of our homeschool study of music history and literature. Kavanaugh says, \\"I hope this book will shed light on an important but so often overlooked subject of music history: the spiritual beliefs that underscore these composers' contributions to Western culture.\\""},{"Title":"Spiritual Lives of the Great Composers","review":"It's been a few years since I read this book, but at the time I was reading it, I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much, that I actually remembered the name of the book, and ordered it for my daughter who is now old enough to appreciate a book like this. She is playing the viola.The thing that I liked about this book, is that it brought out the nature of the lives of the different composers. They all had their struggles. Some were more religious than others. Bach was very religious, and Handel of course. What this book helped me to realize, is that the classical composers were more religious than most of us realize. Many of them, if not most, were Christians. They lived during a time in history, when the church had a lot of political power, and that power was used wrongly too much. But, they were still able to recognize the truth in Christianity, and I feel that because of this, God furthered their talents in music and blessed them. I feel like the Classical era of music helped to bring the people of the world, into a different place spiritually, so they were more able to hear what the Holy Ghost might say to them. This music brought the Holy Spirit into the world more abundantly and prepared the minds of the people for greater truth.The composers had challenges in their lives. They had weaknesses and some of them did quite a bit of sinning. But, they had faith in the power of beauty, and their music is beautiful and brings a sense of heaven to the listeners. I think there are some exceptions to this. I think some of the Russian composers were very disturbed, spiritually, and I think their music reflects this. It reflects the confusion and darkness that Communism brought to that country. I went to concert in Moab, Utah, one time. They had a bunch of Russian music being played. I didn't enjoy it. It was all disitant and not easy to listen to. It didn't make me feel good or happy. I don't believe those composers had the Holy Ghost with them, and so they weren't able to produce good music. But, on the other spectrum, look at those composers who did have the Holy Ghost, and what they were able to produce. Studies show that children get more intelligent just by listening to classical music. It creates more order in their minds.I think this book brings a sense of hope to the reader. It brings us hope because, even though our lives are hard and sometimes we don't feel the greatest about our relationship with God or who we are, we can remember that these great composers also weren't perfect. But, just look at how they blessed the world. They had a gift, and they used that gift to bless the rest of mankind. None of us are perfect either, but if we recognize the spiritual gifts that God has given to us, and use them to bless the rest of mankind, God will bless us and make us greater and better. It all comes down to recognizing God for what He has given us-personally, being thankful, and realizing that when God is in our lives, we are better for it. Christ brings hope to the world.

Butterworth obviously was told to write some chapters, and WEB just stuck them in to make it look seamless. I don't know what's worse: That Griffin didn't aptly teach his son how to be an author, or that Butterworth fells so entitled to his father's readership that he didn't bother to learn. I will never buy anything with Butterworth's name on it, and if that comment by the other reviewer is true - that Butterworth is just a publicist for the Boy Scouts, then he should be ashamed of himself, trying to fill his father's shoes without ever having worked as a writer or even as a journalist."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"As usual Griffin is the greatest story teller of all time.

The story was disconnected, characters weak in their development and lacked any form of tempo. I can only hope that the fault lies with the co-author. The only alternative is that my favorite authors are just getting too old. I saw this in my youth as C.S. Forester, Alastair McClean and Graham Greene lost their touch. Maybe it is I that is just too old."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I'm a great fan of Griffin, but not a great fan of authors collaborating with others, even their family. It seems too much like wanting the sales without the sweat. In this case the plotting is good, but the flow, rythm and tricks of the trade that Griffin brings are lacking. It's proof once again how good Griffin's work is and how sadly in this book he is missed. Too bad."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Griffin has been one of my favorites for years. This book however is a sad disappointment from such a wonderful writer.

This latest extension of the \\"Men at War\\"series is a complete disappointment.It seems contrived, very weak, and incomplete as opposed to the page turners normally published by the author."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This was nothing but an attempt to cash in on an old series he abandoned twenty years ago. At least a third of the characters were left out (what is happening with Jimmy and Cynthia?) and it was just a short, contrived dissapointment.

A waste of time and money."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I've read ALL of the Griffin novels and normally keep checking with Amazon for new releases. I immediately bought \\"The Saboteurs\\" even before it was released. When I received it in the mail, I immediately thought something was wrong. The package was not as bulky as it usually is with Griffin books. When I opened the package I immediately noticed the book was about half the size of a normal Griffin book. That should have been the first clue. I finished the book, and felt that I was robbed of the other half of the book. The story ended aburptly and that made the book a waste of time........Sad."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I've read a great deal of Griffin's novels and have enjoyed his writing but I was most disappointed in Saboteurs. He builds great characters only to unceremoniously and quickly kill them off leaving you to wonder why he spent so much effort telling you about the character. The title characters are sacrificed seemingly early in the story. About 20 pages from the end, as a second story develops, one wonders how it can possibly take place in the remaining pages. It doesn't. Instead of the great storytelling one expects, the writer breezes over the storyline to a rather abrupt conclusion. I'm sure there's a sequel in the works, but I won't be buying it."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"All Griffin books are pretty much the same, and I've read them all. This one lacks a cohesive beginning and a decent ending. It's like they cobbled it together out of other stories, parts deemed not good enough for past books. They were right. The resolution of this story, both of the saboteurs and the Sicilians are laughable, and implausible. I'm glad I got this one at the library, because if I paid any money for it I'd want a refund.This is for die hard Griffin fans (like myself) and even then, not for all of them. At least I got some sun at the pool when I read this."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"After 20 years, this book clearly shows that the master of military fiction/history has allowed the torch to be passed to his son and clearly posses little if any of his dad's skills. From the basic story, which is o.k. to the descriptive tools (weak at best), the story ends with nothing. It just ends, as though the author had something else to do and didn't have the courage to say good bye to the listener. It's horrible. I really hate to see this book and having waiting for a new book every year or two for many years, I now dread another (which I'll buy as well I'm sure). Any reader, who has followed any of his five series, will be greatly saddened by this book; I'm sorry for the great writer, William Butterworth, we've come to know and love as \\"W. E. B. Griffin\\")."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I have read and in many cases reread 28 W.E.B. Griffin novels. I've grown accustomed to his usually marvelous blending of historical fact and pure fiction, tight plots, believable characters, powerful narrative: thrillers in every sense of the word.Thus I am saddened to report that \\"The Saboteurs\\" possesses none of the qualities listed above. It is, in fact, boring.Griffin has excelled at running several stories at once in his various military series. Such simultaneity helped push breath and life into his characters. In \\"The Saboteurs,\\" co-authored with his son, William E. Butterworth IV, there are only three primary plot lines and each of them fails.There is the Major Richard Canidy, an unbelievable hotshot OSS operative who is supposed to rescue atomic scientists from various parts of Europe. Gone is the vitality of earlier Griffin military characters. Instead Canidy isn't even a cartoon character. The authors apparently kept running into brick walls, so they used a simple plot device when they lacked a bridge: Canidy goes to the bathroom. Eight times, by my count, within 130 pages. (I stopped counting.) Perhaps there is a hidden message here: Canidy has an overactive bladder; he drinks too many diuretics. Whatever, his visits serve no purpose and are, to put it mildly, puzzling.Trying to add historical color, Canidy becomes involved with the 1940s Mafia with a backstory about J. Edgar Hoover. Here, Griffin makes a major error when he claims that Hoover made his reputation battling \\"mobsters\\" in the 1920s and 30s. Not so. Hoover wouldn't even admit to the existence of the organized crime (the \\"Mafia\\") until the late 1950s. Rather, Hoover went after bankrobbers like John Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde, who had no connection with organized crime. This kind of mistake is unthinkable for the Griffin of yesterday.None of the characters have the memorability of those in earlier works.Another backstory is the infiltration of German saboteurs into the United States. This plot line never quite makes it. The Germans are feckless. Griffin never brings this story to the point of interesting the reader: you know that one way or another the Germans will be captured or killed. No suspense there.Much of this novel is given over to describing the decor of various locales (i.e., the pattern of the wallpaper in Canidy's hotel room); pouring coffee, wine and Griffin's trademark single malt Famous Grouse scotch. These devices in moderation served Griffin well in earlier novels, but here they are excessive, boring and add nothing to the story.In Griffin's earlier novels, there was always a sense of danger: some of his characters put themselves in harm's way and didn't return or suffered substantial injury. In \\"Saboteurs\\", there is no apprehension for any of the characters: the story is so slim that you know no harm will come to them, lest the book end abruptly in too few pages.It pains me to be so negative about a W.E.B. Griffin war story. As noted, I've enjoyed 28 of his works. But \\"The Saboteurs\\" is worlds removed from Griffin's work. The dedicated fan might want to pass it by to avoid disappointment. Those unfamiliar with Griffin would be well advised to start with his earlier works: they will keep you entertained for years.Jerry"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"WEB's books are always a mixture of great character development (we CARE what happens to those people), history, and action. This book was almost all character, some history and the barest taste of action.The character portion was abysmal. No real development on any front (except one minor cliff-hanger), lots of cameos and recaps of past novels in the series and paper-thin newcomers (who certainly won't be in future novels).The history was based on one fact and a lot of fiction around it. One has to suspend normal levels of disbelief in order to accept the coincidences.As for action, the major event promised throughout the story takes place in the last 20 pages. Butterworth seemed to be in too much of a hurry to cash his advance check. His father would have taken 200 pages to make that portion real and exciting.If this were the first Griffin that I'd ever read, there would never be a second. As it is, I'm so enamored with the various series I'd probably give Butterworth one more chance. However, I'll buy it used or take it from the library, rather than rush to pre-order."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This was the weakest of all of the W.E.B. Griffith books that I have read. I think the co-writer of this book was really the primary writer on this one since it really did not feel like Griffith's other novels. The character development was lacking and the \\"heroes\\" of this novel were really by-standers throughout the book. I never really felt involved with them and they were never really involved in coming up with the resolution. The resolution was through the stumblings of the villains and not anything positive by the \\"heroes\\". I felt that the \\"heroes' were not even the main characters of the book. Overall, a very poor imitation of Griffith's past works. PLEASE write the next one yourself!!!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Don't waste your time nor money on this \\"short story\\". Griffin, sadly, is going the way of Tom Clancy and his Op Center fiascos. Using his name to foist another writer and this book upon his loyal readers reeks of greed. As a devoted fan of Griffin, I never hesitated to buy any of his novels, but this ends that knee jerk faith. Once the excessive descriptive verbage is stripped away, the plot and story line is simplistic and uninteresting. This is a sad departure from entertaining books such as The Corps."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Big, big disappointment. Not up to standards. Just ends with about a half dozen subplots unresolved. I assume the son wrote this book--at least that's what I choose to believe. If Dad wants these series to continue--and we readers hope he does--then find yourself a good co-author and don't have your son continue. At a minimum, get him a good editor."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"As a long time reader of Griffin, I would say this is his poorest by far. I have read and re-read the Corps and Men at War series several times and always feel warmed by the characters each time. I felt let down by this effort. I can only hope that Butterworthless wrote this while Dad was out of town. The characters are barely tollerable much less believable, the plot very loose and the ending should have taken another 200 pages. I really he hope he gets back on track."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I am a great W.E.B Griffin fan. I have enjoyed most every book up until now. It was difficult to follow at first when the time line went from Feb to Mar then back to Feb without any real reason but to follow the two story lines. When my wife mentioned that this book must not be as good as all the others because I keep putting it down, I had to agree. Most of the others kept my interest and they were real hard to put down.The plots could have been more exciting. The Germans could have been more interesting. Fulmar could have started back at the beach where the young man Coast Guard man went missing. Then at the bar when the bar tender/friend was killed after thinking things were not right. But this was once stated and moved on. Investigation into the crime was not started it was just assumed they were out there doing bad things and that the FBI or the OSS would catch up with them. Then to have two blow up in a train and two shot by the Mafia because they didn't pay... boo hiss the OSS didn't have anything to do. Then to start with the Sicily thing and the yellow fever but then dont' say to much about it once Canidy got there, then throw in the nerve gas right at the last, that was lame. What happened to Oh whatsher name in England???? Ann or is this where the next story picks up. She is safe and Canidy meets up with her again and bangs her again and leaves and she gets blown up again.... (what a future plot) Then meeting up with the Mafia in Sicily, after all the research and worrying that there would be trouble, Canidy walks in get the professor and walks out. Not too much of a plot there. Why not some adventure, some misunderstanding... and then let Frank come into the picture and help. Geeee I almost want to change my name to Butterworth so I can help W.E.B with his next book. I am sure it would be better than this one. (The key is with all these bad reviews, no one is going to want to buy our used books.)Better luck next time Griffin. I too will read the reviews before I buy the next one. I bought this one on preorder, now I wish I hadn't.Hope this helps anyone who reads this."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I have read all of Griffins books and have enjoyed each and every one. This \\"book\\" is a complete joke. The promised story about Sicily is an afterthought at the end of the book. There is no character development and subsequently I didn't really care about what happened to them. Of course because nothing really happens we don't need to care what happens.Griffin should be ashamed of himself for putting out a piece of junk like this with his name on the cover."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Prior to purchasing this book, I first read the other reviewers' comments and was all set for a major letdown. Unfortunately, I wasn't disappointed.I first got turned on to Griffin's works with the Badge of Honor series. I had grown up in the Germantown section of Philadelphia - home to the 14th District, scene of many of the antics of Matt and others in that series - and many in my family were cops. I myself was a police officer for nearly 12 years, and these books really resonated with me, particularly the settings in neighborhoods and places that I'd long since left. I moved on from these books to the Brotherhood of War series and was initially quite pleased.However, while reading one of that series, I detected many errors and discrepancies with characters and locations, leading me to believe the novel was \\"ghosted.\\" I'm sure it was, hence the \\"correction\\" novel, \\"Special Ops.\\" The most glaring example was the consistent reference to Camp Mackall as \`Camp McCall'. Anyone who ever served any time in Fayetteville knows what the reservation's name is and what goes on there. So, whether his son, WEB IV, or some other author ghosted it, it was pretty obvious it wasn't the original.I next moved on to the simultaneously published Corps novels, and again enjoyed them quite a bit. In particular, the McCoy character is the \`everyman' we all long to be, but most of us cannot. The satisfaction received by living vicariously through a fictional character in a series of books we enjoy is particularly relishing. However - and speaking of eating something with relish, another of Mr. Griffin's pet phrases - there are many problems that show up in this series, too.I've read all of the series books many times over. As an author myself, and former network television producer, I find crisp, clear writing stimulates me to do my best, so I read other works a lot. But each time I pick up one of these books, something else, to be quite frank, peeves me off.There are numerous - far too numerous that any copyeditor worth their salt would miss - errors in spelling, names, locations, dates, ranks and many other seemingly arcane details to be excused. How, for example, does Ken McCoy move from having a sign outside his home in Tokyo reading Cpl. McCoy to being Capt. McCoy within a few pages, even before his pater familias Fleming Pickering has heard the story of McCoy's being \\"kicked out of the Corps\\" in Book IX? Other examples, of which there are many, have names transposed, and even one character talking to himself! And whatever happened to the years 1943-1950? There was a lot of good stuff, interesting times and even better human interest-type plotlines left go when he jumped from the Gobi Desert to Korea.And so it was with some trepidation that I first picked up The Saboteurs. My anxiousness to read another great story - trying hard to forgive the mistakes, as the \\"yarn\\" was a good one - gave way to despair rather quickly. Caniday, a character I'd come to like, although he could have used more development once moving to England, has descended into hell, suitably redecorated as a bathroom, according to many other readers. I found the storyline not fragmented as much as a series of short vignettes which, while seemingly related, really never gel let alone weave together. In short, the book became boring to read and a disappointment to own. I'd rather have borrowed it from the library and spent my money on something else more worthwhile.While we're on the subject of problems, I was wondering if anyone else picked up on the fact that Final Justice in the Badge of Honor series seems to have moved forward thirty years in time, even though the characters only age two years or so? Laptop computers, high technology, NSA-like erasing software with multi-gigabyte drives? Yet the originally books took place in the 1973-1974 time period, when computers were not on the desktop yet - and the smallest mini's were literally still the size of a large executive desk. While it makes for an interesting detective story, particularly with the reliance - as often is the case - on high technology to aid in solving a crime, there really is no place for it in this novel, and I believe it was a device invented by whoever ghosted this book to cover for a lack of plot development. Matt Paine has become the Jim Kirk of the Philadelphia Police Department, \\"spreading VD throughout the city\\" as it were.It's a shame to watch a revered sports hero hang on too long, unable to play up to the standards they and their fans set for them. It's just as big a disappointment to see a favorite author begin that long, slow descent into oblivion. A good ghostwriter, son or not, should be able to follow the \\"bible\\" of the series and produce a seamless continuation.Where is Franklin W. Dixon when you need him?"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I can see where Griffin attempted to shore up the writting in this book but the plot was weak, not sharp, and drifted.

However. if you just seek a penny dredful style potboiler, this is for you. It will do no harm and has some nice references to the Johnson light machine gun, one of the few places to mention it.

It is rich historical ground to play with and they have done it well. Sure, there were a few spots where things moved a little slow, (I can think of several hundred pages of Winds of War or Shogun that were like that) but I think it is obvious that the authors are building a lot of background for things yet to come.Local detail is rich, characters show that usual \\"WEB\\" touch that we all love, and I suspect his son's involvement is a harbinger of great team work to come.So don't listen to the critics here. The problem a highly successful author such as WEB faces is the benchmark set by some previous absolutely exceptional work, which makes it difficult to achieve recognition for what is nevertheless a darn good book such as this one.

Griffin book and loves them. He is his biggest fan. He said the book was fantastic."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"W.E.B. Griffin and his son, William E. Butterworth IV, have collaborated on a fast-paced novel about the heroes of World War II, a return to the popular Men at War series. \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan is the head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and has the job of networking his agents to the best of their abilities. The action moves around the world, in chronological order of events, from Sicily, London, New Jersey, Texas, Oklahoma, New York and Algiers. Major Richard M. Canidy is the first agent Donovan has to reign in from overzealous proceedings in his recent past. Canidy went solo on a mission to Hungary and now must face the consequences for his rogue actions.Timing is important in February 1943. German U-boats have sneaked into Atlantic waters, wrecking havoc close to American shores. Highly trained, Hitler's SS units have been successful in landing agents in the United States to detonate bombs in areas of high civilian concentration. These enemy saboteurs will make their presence known and instill fear in the public. Canidy, his boyhood friend Eric Fulmar, and agent Stan Fine have been called in by Donovan to locate and eliminate the suspected saboteurs. Canidy's summons, however, carries the undertone of rebuke for his Hungarian escapade. Canidy fully expects to be assigned a desk or, worse, to be fired. But Donovan has a different agenda for his rogue agent.The authors profile real personalities of the times, alongside their fictional agents, to bring the reader directly into the story. The well-documented rivalry between FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and the OSS office is on display in THE SABOTEURS. Hoover soft-pedals the explosions on American soil to contain terror in the public. Hoover's harassment of citizens with possible anti-government sympathies is played against the tactics of the OSS, a direct-action approach. An FBI agent suffers embarrassment by Fulmar's superior physical ability in one comical scene.Canidy's assignment is to invade German-occupied Sicily and to evacuate a scientist, Dr. Rossi, whose life is in danger. The doctor's colleagues have been infected and murdered with a deadly Yellow Fever virus. Before Rossi is deposed likewise, his brilliant mind can be used against the Germans; he has knowledge about developments in atomic fission.Canidy finds himself aboard a vessel owned and navigated by mobsters from New Jersey, fishmongers who conceal illegal activity by legitimate business on the Atlantic loading docks. These Mafia personalities are well-developed characters and do elicit sympathy during the read. The mob's heyday is colorfully drawn, with historical accuracies about well-known, incarcerated mobster leaders. Canidy is at their mercy in order to land successfully on Sicilian shores.Female characters round out the list of players in the story. Ann Chambers is the love interest in Canidy's life, a string constantly pulling him to London, her base of journalistic operation; she's the missing equation in his quest for happiness. A German actress beguiles Fulmar and becomes a target in his hunt for the German saboteurs. One of the same Germans being hunted by the OSS himself falls for an American, a prostitute abused by her employer.THE SABOTEURS is a compelling story based on real tales from World War II and is dedicated to their memories. Any reader who relishes pages from history will enjoy this return to a successful premier series. The one regret is that the book is too short. One thirsts for more and hopes that Griffin and Buttterworth will compile and release many more.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Consistent with all of his previous works of well-researched historical fiction, Griffith and an Editor/co-writer deliver another tale about the origins of the CIA during World War II--this time focusing on both German sabotuers in the states and U.S. serviceman starting to address the Nazi War effort with their own resistance in Italy. This is the continuation of the stories of Dick Canidy and Eric Fulmar, friends from childhood and heroic even if somewhat superficially sketched. As is true with most of his heroes, they share a toughness and a devotion to doing what is right while not missing opportunities to enjoy themselves. This time their stories interact with J.

Please!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Despite the 20-year gap \\"The Saboteurs\\" is a good return to the Men at War Series, and thus to OSS heroes Richard Canidy, Eric Fulmar and the others, all of whom became known to W.E.B. Griffin fans when he wrote, in the 1980's, the first four books of this series under the pen name Alex Baldwin.The Saboteurs, co-authored by Giffin's son, William E. Botterworth IV, begins prior to the invasion of Sicily. And, as usual with Griffin's books, weaves often little known historical events into the stage for advantures of his fictional heroes. Because this book deals in Sicily Mafia mob bosses in the U.S., as well as many other real and fictional personalities, become players in the adventures of our fictional OSS heroes.I hope this is not the end of this series.Ed Evanhoe, Antlers, Oklahoma"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"When my father-in-law died I inherited a lot of his books. As I began to read the folks who were his favorites W. E. B. Griffin really stood out. The first books I read were the Men At War Series, and I really found myself wanting more. The Saboteurs is an excellent return to those characters.It picks up at the completion of the previous series mission to bring out a nuclear scientist and sets the stage for a new series. Canidy prepares for an operation in Sicily and Fulmar chases a group of German saboteurs in the states. Much of the story revolves around the characters Fulmar is chasing, and the underworld figures Canidy is dealing with, The plot moves well, and leaves the reader wanting more. Its definately a \\"You gotta sit down and read this one\\" novel.This is a great read for a guy when he goes to the beach and wants to distance himself from his wife/significant other's copy of Under the Tuscan Sun. A really good read, highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I loved the series 20 years ago and this is a good return.

This book was a big - and I mean BIG - disappointment. I don't think WEB actually wrote anything in this book. None of his style is there. As for the story lines, I felt cheated by all of them. If this book was written by IV, then he needs to start his own series, and let WEB continue writing - alone - books in his series. If there is another in the \\"Presidential Agent\\" series, I hope IV stays out of it. Otherwise, it will be another series that comes to a very disappointing end.By the way, I paid $9.99 for this book new ...

After reading so many good books by Griffin in this series, this is a sorry excuse. There is no consistant plot line and after setting up the adventure in Sicily for the entie book it takes less than 10 pages to occur. There is never any account on how the hero gets his man.

I normally read his books very quickly, usually completing in a week or so looking for every opportunity to get in a chapter or two. However, with this book, I could not get myself interested or excited to read it. It dragged so much and there just wasn't any suspense. Some parts were anguishing to read and I *gasp* found myself speed reading through parts so that I could move on to another book. I cannot recommend it. I do however recommend his earlier series of, \\"Brotherhood of War\\", \\"The Corps\\", and \\"Honor Bound\\"."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This was a real letdown from W.E.B. Griffin and William Butterworth's previous efforts. It had way too many subplots going that never were tied together. When I was 7/8ths of the way through, I knew that I had been duped!! Really a disappointment!! If they are thinking that I'll buy the next one to see how it all came out, I think I'll wait and borrow a paperback edition from someone. It doesn't deserve shelf space in my library!!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I was so disappointed with this book.

This wanders around ultimately gets lost and is a waste of time and money. Obviously he did not proof the final book. Next time I'll wait and buy a used copy, YOU keep your money,"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"This book reads as if it's only half the story. It's literaly half the length of Griffin's other books (about 250 pages vs. a typical 500 pages). It reads as if Griffin was forced to tack on a quick ending in order to meet a publication deadline. What happened? My guess is that this book was largely written by his son who is a new novelist and perhpas a slower writer than dad. He could not finish the book on time, so the publisher made him quickly come up with an ending for the half finished book so that it could go to press on time."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Did Griffin really put his name on this??? I was ready to quit reading it four times, but continued because I bought it and at least wanted my money's worth. And I think I should have been paid to read this! Butterworth, what on earth have you been doing for your 25 years as a major newspaper and magazine writer/editor? This is insanely bad writing! As a man, do you really care what the wallpaper smelled like? I mean, come on!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I bought the book, read it and then sat down to write a review (never done this before). Then I thought I would read what other people thought of it. I was very surprised to find a few (very few) who thought that it was a good read. I am WEB's greatest fan...read them all. This is awful...not worth the paper it is written on. Flowery descripitons of every detail do not make a good book. There really isn't a plot or story line...there is nothing!!! No doubt about it, someone else wrote it. Sorry for the son, he just isn't able to carry on the grand tradition. Major dissapointment!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Before reading The Saboteurs, I re-read The Secret Warriors and The Soldier Spies. Only the used names were the same. Unfortunately, the characters were not and the story was highly unlikely. A poor attempt of one my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Having just finished re-reading the entire Men at War series before reading this one I have to say it is not much different than the first four books in the series, or his other series. There is a lot of detail, obviously for some too much, and as often happens in Griffin's books the ending is rather quick. But maybe that's the charm of his books, you don't spend 15 pages on a dog fight, but on the way the OSS or the military works. Let's remember the first book in The Corps series was great but was really a build up to the START of WWII and the rest of the series.I'm not willing to give up on the series yet. Maybe I should not have read the reviews before the book since I then tended to look for too much detail. To me this book is really written like his other when it comes to the ratio between background, action, personal lives, etc."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I cannot help but think this book was cranked out to just meet some deadline. We have all the usual Griffin characteristics such as several of the primary characters having more money than some small countries. All of the women are beautiful. The lower-ranking officer bumping the higher-ranking officer off of a flight. After reading these same scenarios in many of his other books, I'm getting a bit tired of them. And maybe that is how the book was written- just grabbing a handful of existing scenarios, shuffling them around, and write a bit of new dialogue to fill in the gaps. This book also demonstrates another recent characteristic of Griffin's books, namely the entire book is a build-up to some pivotal climax. Yet the climax itself is maybe a page long and extremely anti-climatic.I will agree these are never meant to be classic literature. But would it hurt to have someone else read the book before it is sent to the publisher? Then maybe we wouldn't have to read about the taxi driver putting the cab's transmission in Park. I really doubt many taxi's had automatic transmissions in 1943."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I have read just about everything W.E.B. Griffin has written, and at least twenty of them I've read twice. Having been a huge fan of the Men at War series and Dick Cannidy especially, I was SO happy when this book was released. Unfortunately, I have to say that I wish I'd been left with the memories of an excellent writer, because the reality of this writing is that it is boring, repetitive, spends far too much time on every single detail with little time spent on the actual plot, and an utter disappointment. We all get older, and sometime talent flags as we do - but this book would have been better had it never been written."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"So far I have been disappointed by the latest books of Robert Parker, Jack Higgins and Clive Cussler - all former favorites of mine, but they seem to have lost their ability to write a good story. And now Griffin seems to be joining this list with this book. As one reviewer put it, this story which begins with some promise goes nowhere. Hopefully this is an aberration for Griffin from his past books because it is the first of his works that really is not up to his usual standard.It remains to be seen if this is so when his next book appears.The only reason I give this book 3 stars is the insight it has on J. Edgar Hoover's mindset in dealing with presidents and other federal government agencies. I am a former FBI agent who served under Hoover. Griffin has Hoover just right in this book."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"The development of so many new characters (who mostly die by the way), starting several new story-line threads, and the abrupt ending without solid conclusion left me feeling like they rushed this one to market. Even so I thought it was an enjoyable romp and hope to see more of the main characters and some plot resolutions.Take your time and keep writing. By the way you should get Ann out of the house using the spunky British gal who digs people out of the rubble."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I generally avidly devour Griffin's books, but this one seemed to lack a little something - hard to define, but the characters weren't quite as sharply written, the dialogue lacked somewhat and, when it came time for the action sequences, they were frustratingly skipped over in a couple of instances. Granted, most of his series have left a lot of the combat out of them, but this one was a big hole in the book. Also, it's getting to be a bit annoying when the tragically rich lead character loses the lady love of his life - See Col. Lowell in the Brotherhood of War series, Detective Payne in the Badge of Honor series, et al."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I am a great fan of Griffin. I've read every one of his books, many of them twice or more. I been concerned that he's getting old and the supply will stop. Apparently, he's addressed this issue by bringing in the kid. Unfortunately, the kid can't write. While emulating the old man's style, the story is boring, incomplete, and tedious. There really is no story. An excellent first chapter is never wrapped properly. We spend the whole book setting up our hero to go into action on Cypress, except it never happens. Such a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"There seemed to be an inordinate time to set the various scenes--sometimes too detailed.....This is not a typical WEB Griffin."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Griffin was the last of the authors I would buy hardcover editions when they were released - no more! Co-authoring has changed the pace of Griffin's story-telling as it has to other top selling authors."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Disappointed with this effort. This is the first time that a book in one of his series did not live up to expectations. Hopefully, the next one will."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"As a avid fan of WEB Griffin its sad to report that this is not his work. Its a collection of pointless prose. The story line is absent, without destimation. There us no romance, honor, tension, clausable actions or solutions. Names of previous charcters are used but they are shadows, not real characters. The best I can say is that the type is big and the pages few."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"As the professional writers have already spilled the beans, I'm giving nothing away to say that the two parallel plots :German spy/saboteurs at work in the U.S. and American agents setting up the invasion of Sicily by means of co-opting members of the mob is the core of this book. Griffin again falls back onto the FBI OSS rivalry and the old boy net of FDR's government. The vision of the military and intelligence services as a playground of the rich and well connected, which has some grounding in actuality, is again overplayed. Those unfamiliar with the history may be a bit confused - but WEB fans are familiar with this internal conflict by now. The problem with this novel is that it stops abruptly half way through the central events. I fear what we have here is a set up for numerous shenannigans as Patton and Monty race to Palermo in a forthcoming \\"Invaders\\" or some such novel. Ah well, if the tale had been finished, this would have been a great beach book. I'll wait until then and give it two stars for now, but reserve the right to add some more when I see the next half. Meanwhile, if you are going to buy this book, and if you are a WEB fan you probably will, try to negotiate half price."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I've always enjoyed these W.E.B. Griffith books and looked forward to this one, but alas, it wasn't to be. This has different story lines that never seemed to come together. It's like a series of short stories within the same time frame, but by 3/4 of the way through, they still hadn't come together, and I flat gave up on this book. There are too many other books to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Like a few others who have posted here, I am not one to leave reviews, but this time I felt a compulsion to speak out after reading the newest novel with Griffin's name. I am sad to see so many negative reviews, but at least I now know I was not in some advanced state of dementia when I read The Saboteurs. Never has a Griffin book taken me so long to finish, and unlike every previous novel where I have always been sad to reach the end and read the last page, this time I was disappointed that I had read it at all. I have always accepted there would come a day when the novels would end. After reading this novel, I would prefer they ended vs. evolving into this new style.I was pleasantly surprised to see this out of cycle release on the book shelf, as I am used to maybe one release a year usually in January. Since it had been a while since I had last read the adventures of Donovan's men at war, I decided to pull the previous four novels off the book shelf and re-read each one to get up to speed. Then I began the Saboteurs, and quickly realized the author of this novel was not the author of the previous four. Had this been my first Griffin novel, there never would have been a second. Whereas WEB made you feel as if you were a fly on the wall watching all that occurred, his son moves the wall out of the mansion and into the outhouse.Case in point, WEB would make you personally feel the potential loss of a certain reporter in London, have you worried and make you ask your friends if they had seen her. The author of this novel barely gives it a side note, and then almost never mentions it again. And when it comes to the sexual liaisons Butterworth, um... less is more.I could go on, but in reading all the other one star reviews, just about everything I wanted to say has already been covered, and unlike Butterworth I do not feel the need to go on ad nauseam about things that no one wants to read.I have to assume Butterworth will read these reviews, probably be stung by them, and hopefully learn from them. I will give the Griffin Dynasty one more chance, and hope the next Griffin novel is a return to the glories of yore.Wilson Meloy"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"Having read and absolutely enjoying ever other book he has written, I was devastated by the poor overall quality of this book. W.E.B. Griffin DID NOT write this piece of junk!"},{"Title":"The Saboteurs (Men at War Series)","review":"I bought this book because I had read an entertaining WEB Griffin book about a Luftwaffe pilot in Argentina.Unfortunately, it looks like WEB didn't write this book. It is absolutely terrible.There are 2 or 3 plot lines, all of which are pointless.One plot line includes German saboteurs in the US. The FBI and the OSS are after them independently. Who wins? Well one set of saboteurs blows themselves up accidentally. The other set crosses the mafia, and is killed by them. So the entire subplot involving J Edgar Hoover, The FBI, FDR, and an OSS Agent is totally pointless. The mob is involved in another plotline wherein The Protagonist Guy (hereafter, TPG) wants to create an espionage network in Italy. It's really just an excuse for stereotypical mob talk and toughness. After many pages, TPG goes to Italy and doesn't require mob assistance. The entire subplot is thus pointless.In the first few pages of the book, a scientist sees bad things happening around him. In the last few pages, TPG rescues him. The 300 pages in the middle have nothing to do with this scientist. The rescue happens in about the last 4 pages. TPG walks though German-held territory without seeing a soldier, walks into the town, gets the professor, and they walk to the dock. In an unbelievable coincidence, a mob-related fisherman from NJ (whom TPG knows) pulls up RANDOMLY at the dock. Randomly. The scientist and TPG get on the boat. But as they are leaving the dock, TPG finds out that a freighter RIGHT THERE is carrying NERVE GAS. He leaps off the boat saying, \\"If I am not back in 10 minutes, leave without me...\\" (*snort*) A few minutes later, the freighter blows up! (There are apparently no guards and nothing is explained. This whole freighter thing happens in a single page.) But it's been 10 minutes and TPG isn't back! The boat starts to leave! TPG jumps out of the darkness an onto the boat! YAY! And then TPG's pickup submarine arrives 4 days early and picks them up at the wrong spot. What luck!

Sadly, none of these elements were present in this volume. Even the major protagonist , Richard Canidy, comes off as a *sad sack*. This COULD have been an exciting book, considering the element of German infiltration and sabotage in the eastern U.S. Even the young coast guardsman with a buttered sandwich didn't really help much!

Later, after he became famous for his other series such as 'Brotherhood of War' and 'The Corps' they were reprinted under his own name.I liked the series when it was first published, and I like it's continuation here. The story follows the usual Griffin format of several continuing stories with each new chapter continuing one story line. In this book the guys are back in the US (mostly) chasing down Nazi saboteurs who have come in by sub and are blowing things up.How good is it? If you like Griffin's style and stories, this is a good one to read. It seems that his son has joined him in writing. Mr. Griffin went into the Army in 1946, so he has to be about 80 now. Perhaps because of this, the book suffers from some 'new writer' problems. I hope that his sun continues the verious series, not only this one but some of the others as well.

The characterizations are enjoyable to read but the story drags a bit.Griffin is adept at including little bits of history into his stories which are little known by the general public.

So I finally decide to get \`The Gift', seeing that it would be a short read, just to give her books a try. I must say that I loved reading this book, and have already bought other books of hers to add to my bookshelf.5 year old Annie Whittaker died of meningitis, the day after Christmas, leaving a bruise on the rest of the family: Tommy, her brother; Elizabeth, her mother; and John, her father. Each member of the family slowly secludes themselves from one another in their own way. What used to be a close knit family doesn't exist now. Meanwhile, we are introduced to Maribeth Robertson, a 16 year old girl who makes a mistake that would change her life. She runs away from her family and friends, and starts working in a restaurant as a waitress, where she meets Tommy. The two immediately hit it off, but there are a lot of problems standing in their way which they must face.The story is very sweet, and we get to read how Maribeth changes the Whittakers and makes them a family again. Though the ending is a little sad, you feel touched by the story overall. Danielle Steel, famous of writing matters of the heart, does an excellent job in depicting the love between two lovers, between a mother and a daughter, and the love within the family.Whether you are a fan of Danielle Steel or not, if you like reading romantic novels, then this book will be a perfect \`gift' for you."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This story is short, but you wish it were longer.

I've read a lot of Danielle Steele's books and I love all of them, she writes a lot of romance novels and those are my favorite to read that is why I was first attracted to The Gift.This is a book is about two families that have suffered tragedies and are trying to get there lives back. In the first part of the book you meet a perfect and happy family that loves each other very much, when there family is torn apart by an unexpected loss they struggle to stay close.After that happens the book switches settings and you meet a young teenager struggling to get an education that her father says she can't have. This girl is devastated to find out something that will change her life forever. She is forced to leave her home at sixteen years old and has to make a living for herself.The small town she moves to happens to be the town the first family lives in. This is an exciting and sad book as you watch these two families cope and help each other with there tragedies.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was like an emotional rollercoaster, it made me laugh and it made me cry. I would recommend this book to women of all ages; this book taught a lot about family, love and how to cope with pain and how to support each other."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The book, The Gift by Danielle steel is a heart warming book. It has some adventures, comedies, and tear jerking parts. I got hooked on this book and couldn't stop reading it until I was finished. As the book opens, little Annie Whittaker is a happy little girl that her parents could not want more from. Whittaker's are a family of four: John, Liz, Tommy, and Annie. Tommy is Annie's older brother. He was an only child until he was ten. The parents, John and Liz, really wanted another child, but finally after three miscarriages they had Annie. Annie and Tommy got along so well and always loved to be around each other, unlike most siblings. It was near Christmas and the children were excited! At this time they were 5 and 15. One morning, two days before Christmas, they woke up to a town filled with snow. They went outside and made a snowman. That night, Tommy went to tell Annie good night and noticed her head was hot. Thinking nothing about it, he didn't tell his parents. In the morning, Christmas Eve, Annie woke up with a really high fever. They sent her to bed. It was Christmas, and Annie was still asleep. It was always a thing for Annie to wake up bright and early on Christmas. She woke up and barely moved. She fell back to sleep, and they took her to the doctor. There she was put into a hospital with Meningitis, a very futile disease. She died on Christmas and the Whittaker's lost they're only Christmas Gift. After this scene had ended it takes you to the home of Maribeth. She is going to a dance and her father won't let her wear the dress she wants to. At the dance, she gets pregnant. When she realizes that the father won't take care of the baby with her, her parents send her to a nun adoption home to have her baby. When Maribeth arrives there, she is horrified. She leaves there and goes to Omaha to get job. She is a waitress at a restaurant. One night, a guy who is always eating supper there, walks in and stats talking to Maribeth. His name is Tommy Whittaker. They get to know each other better and they become great friends and fall in love. While all of this happening, John and Liz are still very upset about Annie. They barely even talk to each other or Tommy. They never have meals together, and that's why Tommy is always at the restaurant. When Tommy founds out she is pregnant, he tells his parents, and with the parents wanting a child, they are willing to adopt the baby. Seven months later, John and Liz Whittaker are the parents of a baby girl, Kate. After the birth is over, Maribeth, not wanting to go back, goes to her home. She has to go back for school and her worrying family. She leaves Tommy behind but she will always love him and he her."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read, but I simply loved it!! It's a great heart warming story. Although it leaves you wondering about the two main character's future, the book gives me hope... hope that there is a love two people can share, a true love that sees no judgment, just feeling... it gives me hope for the main characters... and it gives me hope that one day I'll just walk into some new place and who knows... lightning could strike... and my life will change for the better. Somewhat perdicable, although I would have preferred a different ending... some stories are wonderful to read even if you know how it unfolds. I hope there will be a sequel about Maribeth and Tommy... a made-for-tv-movie about this would be nice too."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Set in the 1950s, The Gift by Danielle Steel is a touching novel about two separate families who meet and are changed by a special gift. It begins with the story of Tommy Whittaker and his family. They have a beautiful daughter named Annie, whose love changed the family into happiness and cheer. When her senseless death arises, the family is crushed; the loving marriage starts to unravel and Tommy begins to fend for himself, going out to eat by himself and rarely talking with his parents.Then the story switches over to a girl named Maribeth Robertson who has one meaningless experience with a boy, and ends up pregnant. Her father sends her to the nun's and tells her not to come home until she gets rid of it. When she arrives, she hates it there and decides to leave with the money her father gave her to pay the nuns. She takes the train to a city where she gets a job at a caf&eacute;. One day she was working, that is where the two families first intertwine.Tommy walks in to have dinner and Maribeth waits on him, eventually Tommy comes in everyday and he and Maribeth become very close. They share personal secrets about their lives, and become each other 's need that they were looking for. Maribeth becomes very close with the Whittakers and helps to bind the family back together. When the baby arrives, it is the gift to the Whittaker family of a new baby girl and a gift to Maribeth because she knows that the baby is in good care. When Mrs. Whittaker accepts her offer of adoption it is so emotional and uplifting.This is such a touching story that I think is aimed more at a younger audience. It is a lesson to young girls out there to be careful, and a message to the world that a kind person can change a life. I really enjoyed reading this and it is a short read definitely worth a try!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Danielle Steele did an excellent job when she wrote this book. It is a wonderful drama that puts a warmth in your heart, and a tear in your eye. This is a very touching book that covers a very touching subject. Everyone in the family can learn a lesson from this book, and it will bring them closer together. This touching drama deserves more, but I give it five stars."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I really liked this book. I found it quite enjoyable, except I already knew what was going to happen a little while after starting it. Also, it left me wondering what happened to Tommy and Maribeth at the end. Did she come back to visit? Did they get married? I would reccomend it though, because it was a great story."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The author, Danielle Steel, caught my eye right away and held it throghtout this book. As Elizabeth Wittaker (the main character) still believed in dreams, everything had started changing; dreams had definitely left her beliefs. To begin, a happy home was destroyed by a child's senseless death. Nothing had seemed to matter throughtout Elizabeth's life after that.Throughtout this story, I seemed to relate to Annie the most (Elizabeth's daughter). When she suddenly became sick and senseless, I could relate to that. Personally, throughtout reading this book, when Annie was rushed to the hospital, I felt as though something had been the matter with me and I needed a doctor. At that point in the story, Elizabeth had felt that her little girl would nver, once again, wake up; as probably my parents wold feel too.Before reading this book, I had expected to maked a personal connecton, and be able to feel what the actual characters were feeling. Indeed, this book definitely fulfilled my expectations.Throughout the explicit details told during the story between the characters and the true meaning of this book, I got the reality of the book right in fornt of me. I would most definitley read this book, if you had not already!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I listened to this book first on audio. But after I was finished listening, I had to go out and buy the book to read once more. It's definately my favourite Danielle Steel book I have read. The story about a young 15-year-old girl and how she found comfort in a new family is so heartwarming. I definately recommend this book to everyone. Especially mothers and those expecting!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"My mom told me about this book so i decided to give it a chance since I am not a big fan of romance novels. I read this book in a couple days and when I got to the end I cried for a long time. I have told everyone I know to read this book. They all tell me how much they loved it and how it made them cry also. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The Gift ***This is a very good book. The only reason I give it three stars is because I did not like the ending. I was really sad for the main character. Although, she did make a good choice by giving the gift to the one family who took care of her, I was stll saddened."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I'm taking one star off only because this novel wasn't really a page turner. It wasn't the kind of book you just have to finish in one sitting, the way I'd expect to with one of the shorter Danielle Steel novels such as this one. It was very easy to put down, and took me quite a bit of time to finish because the story was so predictable that you already knew what was going to happen and were not necessarily compelled to turn pages.Nevertheless, what I did read, when I decided to pick it up, was somewhat poignant and tender in a very simple and childish way.This novel would be good for teens as it deals with high schoolers who are in love and one teenager in particular, who gets herself into unfortunate circumstances, and then meets up with a sympathetic family that is going through it's own trauma. I can't really go further in describing the plot without giving away the whole story.I think four stars is actually a bit generous. Still, the heartbreaking nature of the emotions the characters experience, even though Steel has a simplistic way of writing about them, provide enough warm and fuzzies which allow the reader to experience heartfelt emotion right along with the characters.Think Nicholas Sparks &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;, even though in that novel, the teens experienced totally different issues. Steel's writing doesn't come close to the thought provoking and efficient nature of Sparks. But, the emotions and the fact that both novels deal with teens make both &quot;A Walk...&quot; and &quot;The Gift&quot; slightly similar."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I don't remember the last time a book made me cry so, much. 'The Gift' is a wonderful book to read. You fall in love with Maribeth &amp; Tommy, as they're falling in love with each other."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I read this book in one afternoon - I just could not stop reading. This book is about a teenage sweet girl that faces an unplanned pregnancy, and her plan to make the best of it.It is a very touching book that I strongly recommend to teenager girls, or any other woman who ever thought of abortion as an option."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I must say, I loved this book. It was so heartfelt and sad at times, yet it picked up where it should and I was smiling through tears.Not really a typical tale here, this one is kinda different. It is based in the 50's, which is new for me. About a girl who gets pregnant by the highschool hero and is left to fend for herself and all the consequences that come with it, including a tyrantical father and meek, timid mother who won't speak up for her. She must go miles and miles from home to find hope and love. What she gets is far more than she could've dreamed. Actually there are two stories here and they get intertwined.~MaryBeth Robertson is alone and 16 and pregnant. Her father has kicked her out until she 'takes care of her problem'. The year is 1950. She has nowhere to go, so she boards a bus and lets it take her wherever. She ends up in a small town 250 miles from her own small hometown in Iowa. She runs into a boy her age who seems distraught and in need of hope and a friend.Tommy Whittaker is suffering from the recent loss of his little sister Annie. Annie died the day after Christmas the year before and the family was torn asunder from it. His parents no longer talked to each other and he was left to deal with his own grief, until he meets a young woman who brings light into his bleak world. Tommy and MaryBeth find hope and love in their short time together and his parents begin healing. Can MaryBeth give them the 'Gift' that will make them whole again? Is she an angel passing through their lives for but a moment?Very heartwarming tale that will make you weepy at times, but happy you indulged.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Im a 15 year old sophmore and i LOVED this book! i though it was awesome! i think that this is deff. made for my age range and that some adults might not like the book because Danielle Steel usually writes about adult relationships. This is a awesome book because i deals with many things that go on in this world today. teen pregnantsy, and sudden deaths.. this is a great book and i highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I really wasn't that crazy about this book. I love Danielle Steel, but I guess I like reading more of her stories about adult relationships, whereas this was focused more on young teenage love, trials, and tribulations. It wasn't a bad book, if you are interested in this storyline, but for me, I prefer her stuff like: Lone Eagle, Irresistable Affairs, etc."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Although I am not an avid Steel reader I thought this book was very good. The grieving process of this family was very realistic. The parallel of a young mother who would also be going through her own grieving process (giving up her child) Mixed together with the hopes and dreams of young lovers. The gift is 'love' encompassing both the joys and the sadness it brings. I found this book very emotive and moving."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"As usual, I couldn't put it down until I found out what happened! I own almost all of her books and eagerly wait for the next!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This was my first book that I read by Danielle Steel and I loved the tenderness of the story. I found a used copy at a thrift shop and thought I would give it a try since the price was right and it seemed short. I was expecting very cheesy romance and lusty situations and got a beautifully written emotional adventure. This opened me up to wanting to read more of her books, which I am currently doing. I highly recommend it, especially for a first time DS reader."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The Gift is a sweet book...classic Danielle Steel book.

He tells her not to come home or contact her mother or sister until she's had and got rid of her baby.When she arrives at the convent she hates it so much she runs away using the money her father gave her to pay the nuns.

The way Steel expressed the characters emotions was one of a kind. I knew the two teenagers would fall in love. I really enjoyed this book!!!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I read this book in one night. I could not even think about putting it down and waiting to finish it!Danielle Steel has once again written a wonderful, touching love story. From the minute that Tom and Maribeth met, I wanted them to be together forever. The unconditional love that Tom felt for Maribeth was incredible. Even if Danielle Steel doesn't write a sequel, maybe we can just use our own imaginations and give Tom and Maribeth a happy ending."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I read this book 3 years ago and have continued every year since. Danille Steel has captured the innocence and not so innocent life of 16 year old Maribeth quite well. I felt I was reading a life story. All the pain and tragety in the book made the ending more real and alive. I give Ms. Steel all the thanks, this book really has an impact."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I loved this book. It is the way I imagine things happened when my older sister, whom I never knew, passed away at the age of 2. I cried when I read this book, as I do with a lot of D.S. books.

I am not an avid novel reader and I have to say that I am hard to impress. This book is about a happy couple with two lovable chidren, Tommy and their little precious daughter Annie. There is nothing else they could ask for in this world. On a Christmas Eve, a terrible thing happened, their youngest daughter Annie died of acute mengingitis. The whole family was devastated and the happy family was shattered into pieces. After months of sorrow, a girl named Maribeth came to their life. She had managed to bring back the happy smiles into their faces. It was her who gave them the most precious gift of all, a baby just like Annie that could bring back the joy and love they once had. The Gift will make you want to read until the end, non-stop. It is a love story, not just about teenagers falling in love, but also a story about a family bringing back love into their life. Danielle Steel makes me want to read some of her other novels hoping to get the same interest that I had with this novel. So if you are like me who hardly reads and wants to read something that will interest them and something they could relate to, this is the perfect book for you. I am absolutely giving this book a rate of perfect 10!!!!!"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"Having grown up with a father who would have died had I become pregnant in high school, I could really relate to Maribeth.This book was extremely difficult for me to read due to my falling tears. I was crying by the second chapter and after that I do not believe there was a dry chapter.After reading the book, I attempted to listen to it in the car while driving on a long trip. I finally ended up pulling over and crying on the side of the road. I know passersby thought I was crazy, but the story is so heart-wrenching I couldn't bear to simply stop listening. To be so short, this book packs the emotion of a full-length novel.Excellent work of art"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I decided to explore the literary work of Danielle Steele by choosing this short novel from my local library. Some may find it a bit mushy but I definitely was hooked all the way through.It was almost magical how the pain the Whittaker's loss of their daughter was mended by Maribeth's arrival in their world. It shows you that children no matter what they get themselves into can somehow still display innocent and trusting for one another. Love truly can conquer all as Tommy certainly looks past the problems of Maribeth and sees her emergence as a calming presence to the loss of his sister and the near destruction of his family. Slowly but surely and certainly happilly, Tommy, Liz and John manage to come together again.I guess one never knows where the missing puzzle to someone's happiness lies. Sometimes I guess one has to believe in magic and Danielle Steele certainly affirms this."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This was the first of Danielle Steel's books that I read. It was very well written and she is a great story teller. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The Gift By: Danielle SteelThe Gift by Danielle Steel is a marvelous novel, which takes place in the 50's. The reason why I feel that this book is so wonderful is because it reflects to our young teens today. I feel that once you get this book in your hands you really can't let go. It's true when people say don't judge a book by its cover, even though it might not look interesting at all. Danielle Steel is one of the best selling authors, and this novel can just prove how creative her work is. It takes place at a happy home, when everything shatters by a child's senseless death. The Whittaker ends up losing her beautiful young child Annie of the sickness meningitis. The family, which includes Tommy Whittaker, Annie Whittaker, Elizabeth Whittaker, and John Whittaker, then is so affected by the startling tragedy that they stop communicating together and the loving marriage of Elizabeth Whittaker and John Whittaker starts to unravel. The story is then switched, introduced is, the gifted 15-year-old- Maribeth. A narrow-minded father who forces her into going to her prom with a repulsive navy blue dress demoralizes her. After one wrong incident that night, Maribeth's life turns upside down. She becomes pregnant and is sent to a convent by her severe father, where she is to lose her baby, if she wished to return home. She escapes the brutal convent and ends up in the little town of Omaha where she starts working as a waitress in a diner. Young unwed Maribeth, and young hopeless Tommy meet one day at the diner and end up falling in love. Their love, so innocent and full of hope, helps to restore a family's dreams. And all of their lives changed forever by the precious gift she lives behind, her beautiful baby girl Kate. I would definitely recommend this book to young teens around the world, who strongly believe in true love. This book teaches the readers that if two people are truly in love, they will pull through the toughest times together but at the end it would all be worth it. Even though it is a story that leaves you hanging at the end, some use their imagination to end it and some readers wait until the continuation of the story comes out. I would also recommend this book, because it reflects on our young teens today. All around the world young girls are having unprotected sex or are fooled by the guy and they all end up getting pregnant. They end up having adoration or a hard time taking care of the child. By reading this book, it takes you through a life of a typical teenager who happens to make a mistake that ruins her life forever. It shows how the life of a young girl distorted because of an unwanted pregnancy. It also shows the readers that things happen for a reason and just when you think your life is ruined, something special comes along. For Maribeth, she met the love of her life, the person that understood her problem and respected her. This fabulous book will keep you on the edge of your sit, just waiting to see what is going to happen next. It is such an emotion book it leaves its readers in tears. The story also gives the reader the idea that miracles do happen. The Gift is one of the best-written books by Danielle Steel because it is a book a lot of people can relate to. A book that is filled with sadness, and hopelessness and then changed into love and happiness. I defiantly recommend it to all the young adults.Critical Review By: Elizabeth Adzhemyan"},{"Title":"Gift","review":"The gift is the perfect example of telling, not showing. The Gift tells the story of carboard cutout characters. A good father and a bad father. A storybook loving family and a PC vision of an unhealthy one.Her cardboard cutout characters are perfect and oh so dramatic, and always, always, always! teary eyed. A cute little doll of a girl dies and no one, Steele tells us ad nauseum, &quot;can bare it.&quot; I couldn't, anyway.This children's story was tedious, clich&eacute;d and trite in the extreme, thus earning its five star rating by Steele's readers.

These people were 16 years old, for heaven's sake, and Steel made them so mature as to be unbelievable. It was sappy. The ending was so unsatisfactory I have to wonder: Is there a sequel? If there is, I won't be reading it."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"I just finished this book, and as much as I liked the story, it dragged on too long, and was horribly predictable. It was not the brain candy many of us seek, built boring and common characters, and seemed to be repeating itself. As soon as you read the back, you already know that she's leaving the baby behind. And what ever happened when Maribeth left? I never found out. But with the predictability, I'd say she married that guy and had some kids. The book didn't really seem to be much about love, probably because the word showed up too many times. It's easy to read, not much thought required. Good for ages 10-16. Can be finished easily in a night."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This is the type of book a person would read if they were utterly depressed about life. Unlike what someone said before, (which was not to read it if you are upset), I think it's the type of book to read if you don't want to hear about never ending horrors or the world gone bad. It's a sweet book. That's really all there is to it. Of course reading about anyone's death is horrible, but you feel at peace in the end like the characters did, because everyone loved the child, and she had the best life possible.Maybe her life was a little too wonderful. At times it was too idyllic, and life was too perfect. But I think it's enjoyable to read a book like that every now and then. Despite how predictable it was, I still finished it all in one night, and despite what most of the reviews stated, I was rather pleased by the ending. Not sad at all."},{"Title":"Gift","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book I have read, and it will be the last. Aside from the sappy, predictable story and elementary use of the language, the book contains (for me, at least) an egregious editorial mistake - Tommy thinking about Maribeth, page 158 of the paperback: \\"But there was something he didn't like to think about, her going back to Iowa and her parents.\\" This would be the same Maribeth who took a bus from Onawa, Iowa to Omaha, Nebraska, then got off in Grinnell on the way to Chicago. The only Grinnell, with a college, on the way to Chicago from Omaha, happens to be the one in IOWA!!I suppose, to some people, this is a small point. However, in my opinion, if you're going to write fiction, make it up. Don't screw it up.And by the way, Grinnell is a very cool town."},{"Title":"Zero","review":"I've seen Lustbader's books around, never read one until I got handed a copy - I had known Japan and Asia were the mainstays of his books. \\"Zero\\" hasn't aged well, written as it was at the tail-end of the fall of communism, 1988. It reads like one of those run-of-the-mill action movies a la Steven Seagal, super-gaijin-turned-samurai with an unnatural understanding of mysterious eastern ways kicking Yakuza butt. Some of the dialogue is pretty bad, especially the conversations between Japanese people. Whenever a Japanese character is surprised they burst out saying \\"Buddha\\"! I'm living in Japan now, and though I'm no authority, I've yet to hear anyone say \\"Buddha\\" when surprised - usually they say \\"kuso!\\" or \\"chikusho!\\" your run-of-the-mill expletives! I thought this was funny. Other than that, I thought the sex scenes were really cool - learned some new words for the female anatomy so this book can't be all bad. If you want a fair, cliched exotic Japan read, this might do the trick on a long trip - otherwise, avoid.

This work contain much less eroticism than his others which improves the quality of the read."},{"Title":"Zero","review":"Picked this book up when I was on holiday in Australia and had nothing else to read. Michael Doss is like Nicholas in the Ninja novels but not half as interesting. The characters are almost as unbelivable as the plot. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Zero","review":"This is a remarkable story that begins with mysterious happenings. It delves into the world of the Yakuza and adds more to the mystery as you go along. I found this book in an old antique store, dusted it off, and began to read. The author does an excellent job of captivating his audience and never letting go. I could not put the book down. I recommend this to anyone who is intreagued by the culture of Japan, as this is where the story focuses on."},{"Title":"Zero","review":"Only the fact that I promised a friend I would read this book gave me the strength to struggle through to the end. It was because of my sense of \\"giri\\" or obligation that I subjected myself to this torture. But reading Lustbader's clich&eacute;d novel you would think only \\"The Japanese\\" know what duty means. \\"The Japanese\\" are like this and \\"the Japanese\\" are like that- Lustbader thinks nothing of describing the millions of different people in a Japan in such insultingly homogenizing terms.Eric Lustbader sets up a Western/Japan dichotomy that serves no purpose other than to reinforce perceptions of Japan as the mysterious, unknowable \\"other.\\" This book mixes post-WWII stereotypes of alluring, exotic Japan with 1980's fear and admiration of economic super-power Japan. Docile women in kimono waiting attentively on their men in tatami rooms and Japanese men ready to take over the world- Lustbader should stick to fantasy writing- for that is what Zero's Japan is- a fantasy world. If you're interested in learning about Japan at all, don't expect this book to teach you what it's like. While most people I've met here in Japan are proud of their traditions, not everyone goes around studying \\"the way of the warrior,\\" wearing kimono, and doing the tea ceremony. In fact the only person I've met here that comes close to fitting that description is an ex-pat from Holland.Not only does this book recycle old clich&eacute;s about Japan, its female characters are a joke. Women want to be men because they crave power and as women they have no power. I could believe it when Jo in Little Women wanted to be a man, but this book was written in 1988. Even though he attempts to create strong female figures, their strength is undermined by his sexist, inane descriptions and awful dialogue.I could go on forever, but I feel like I've already written a book myself. My only plea is- please don't waste the scarce precious time you have in your life on this book. If you're interested in Japan, why not read some books written by Japanese authors? Murakami Haruki, Banana Yoshimoto, Natsume Soseki, Kenzaburo Oe and Yukio Mishima are just a few great authors to choose from. If you really want some samurai action watch old Kurosawa films, they're awesome. I recommend Kitano Takeshi films for more modern yakuza/police stuff. \\"Hanabi\\" is brilliant.Sayonara."},{"Title":"Zero","review":"Micheal Doss tries to get away from all of the violence but after the death of his father he has to find the killer."},{"Title":"W. Eugene Smith","review":"Eugene Smith was one of the greatest photographers of the Twentieth Century. He worked as a photojournalist from the 1930's until the 1970's. Smith was able to elevate his photographs from the realm of journalism into high art. His best photographs use the contrasting effect of light and dark in the chiaroscuro tradition of Spanish Master, Francisco Zurbaran.This volume is part of Aperture Masters of Photography Series. At under ten dollars, there is no better introduction one can find on the life and work of Eugene Smith. The publisher of this volume is Koneman, a German company well known for the high quality of its productions. This book is a good value and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"W. Eugene Smith","review":"If you are interested in photography and want to see a good introduction on an excellent photographer, buy this book. The Aperture edition has most of Smith's important pictures and discusses his personal/professional dilemma, which generally should be read very critically in art books, which informs us of the tension in the photographer, which is the important element of good photojournalism. In photojournalism, the tension should be the informing pointer as to what is going on in the picture.Smith is one of the most important photographers from the 20th century. His influence was great and his work on the photo-essay is defining (e.g. his Life magazine essay on Dr. Ceriani in 1948). His most memorable photo was of Tomoko Uemura with her son in 1972).Other 20th century photographers you may want to discover or learn from are: Eugene Atget (late-19th/early 20th C), who documented Paris for artists, but whose work influenced the existential air of 20th century photography; Alfred Eisenstadt (mid-late 20th C), who, in my opinion, was the father of modern photo-journalism; and Mary Ellen Mark (late-20th C), who captured the zeitgeist of late-20th century better than most photographers, who tended to project meaning onto their subjects, rather than receive them as Mark was and is so adept at doing.Of the many photo books on the shelves, this one is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"W.

I blame the fools who never took responsibility for there kids. I'm an 22 year old man, with a 2 year old son. I love this little boy dearly God knows, and there's nothing that I won't do for him. But if the system is going to take everything from us as far as money, then how do they expect us to live then? I understand the kids need to be taken care of, but the system needs to change. It really does. It's very obvious that some men don't take care of their kids, but the whole court system is blind to what these women are really doing. How many men are tking care of children that don't belong to them, because of some womens evilness. My question, what do we do? Men need to stand up and fight legislation for a change, to make the system fair. If you ask me the women don't really care for the children, it's the money that they care about. Take this scenario if a women already has a job paying enough money, then she recieves a big chunk of your check, it's like an extra income for HER, not the child(ren). The funds go towards new clothes mostly for the money, and expensive appartment, new car, etc. While 90% goes toward the mother, maybe, just maybe the child gets 10%. Here's the solution get educated Fathers and stay that way.

I am always looking for that ONE great book I can give to men when I sense divorce is in the offing and I am sure the woman will take him for all he is worth and use the kids as the carrot to get more and more.Sadly this wasn't the book. What we need is a few wise men who have been thru this school of hard knocks to write a co-op book that gives specifics. A book that would list non-profits and lawyers etc who give a damn about the FATHER. Simply because (contrary to popular belief) Fathers are grieving the loss of the marriage and kids and what the future holds. Fathers need a book that says &quot;I understand I have been there and here are the ten things you NEED to do&quot;. Heck I was able to help my friends better than this book written by &quot;professionals&quot;. GrrrrrrrrrI had a GREAT Dad and have a GREAT husband and as the Mother of a Son even if he marrys a woman we all think is a gift, I will always want him to be educated about his rights. But for now my quest for a book that will help my males friends continues. Let me know if you know of such a book."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"Although I cannot speak for all non-custodial parents (Typically fathers), I can say that when I discovered this book during the winter of 1998, I felt that the author was almost speaking directly to me. Mr. Leving uderstands that our courts and our court-appointed visitation and custody mediators are profoundly gender biased. Prior to reading Fathers's Rights (How very few there are!), I had attended father-support groups for three years, and I had heard some real horror stories, especially concerning problems with denial of visitation. Mr. Leving acknowledges the fact that most mothers do not consider the fathers' visitation right as important-they view these rights as gifts or privileges for them to bestow at their wim. For the many fathers who have had to fight with the tenacity of a pit bull, this book speaks to them. It is further intersting to note that while our society continually decries the absence of fathers, it fails to acknowledge just how difficult it is for fathers to be granted even a modicum of visitation rights, and how equally apathetic judges are when it comes to enforcing them. Indeed, a father who stands on his rights stands on quicksand. It is my belief that if the mothers do not want the fathers in the childrens lives, than the mothers should not have chldren with the fathers. Instead, most mothers enforce the double standard. Unfortunately, Mr. Leving has no advice for the fathers who are poor and must represent themselves as Pro Se litigents. My answer was to go to the local law library and photocopy the statutes on Visitation and Child Support. I then read How To Reprensent Yourself In Court, published by Nolo Press. The modern father needs to become involved with Father Support Groups, and learn all he can about the few legal rights he has. Reading the statutes on visitation is not all that complex. It is also helpful when you do need an attorney that you know the rules of the game. Mr. Leving's book was, for me, a great place to start."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"This book would have been better if it had been called &quot;If You're a Dad, Stay Out of Court If You Can.&quot;With the increase in divorce and changes in way men want to be spend time with their kids as fathers, it's predictable that the number of custody cases will also rise. But little has changed in terms of gender bias. The mother still typically gets the kids, especially if they are young. After my ex took our daughter out of state when our daughter was two and remarried (her third husband), she thought I should disappear and made visitations increasingly difficult. After five years of this, I went to court thinking I could get better visitations, and, at the least, peace of mind by having he the agreement redone. Although I don't regret going to court because my ex was forced to abide by a clearer agreement, I ended up paying more in child support even though my ex made twice what I did at the time, about 15k to my attorney, and had LESS time with my daughter. (I have a Ph.D., a full time job as a prof, no criminal record, no substance abuse, etc., and I had joint custody when my ex left the state. Even though my ex taught one class a semester as a prof, she had our daughter in full time daycare, and even though she described her new husband as &quot;abusive&quot; both to her and to our daughter, the shrink didn't care.) In my state, the court appoints a &quot;guardian ad litem,&quot; a shrink who reports to the court. His or her decision is basically final. You can't take hoim to court and examine him. What happens in cases of conflict, I learned later, is that the shrink always shortens the visitations. So if you are not the custodial parent and a man, the deck is really stacked against you. Thus, I would say that if you can manage to negotiate with your ex out of court, by all means do so. Go to court ONLY AS A LAST RESORT. I had a very good attorney. But there was no way I could win. Moreover, the shrink made a new recommendation each year for the whole coming year, so that cost another 500 each year. The good thing is that it was all worth it in terms of the visitations being made more exact. (In our initial agreement, only th enumber of vistations was agreed to, not their length or their dates.) As my daughter has gotten older, she has begun to see for herself just how how unreasonable my ex is (I decided it was best to let her figure things out for herself rather than comment on them to her). I remarried happily when my daughter was eight, and my wife and I have a two year old son, who my daughter loves. So things have worked out, especially for my daughter and me, but also for her and my new wife, and for my wife and me, because we don't have to communicate with my ex (except about pick ups and drop-offs).In some ways, the court system is a terrible racket. The courts pass the buck to the shrinks, and the shrinks pass the buck right back to the court. Everyone claims to be acting in the &quot;best interest of the child,&quot; but that is just empty rhetoric. So stay out of court, if you can. Present yourself as calm and reasonable if you do go to court, and do not correspond by email with your ex. Also, make sure you research the shrinks. Some of them are very conservative about visitations, others are much more reasonable. And use that &quot;best interest of the child&quot; rhetoric too. Never talk about your own needs. They don't count. Somehow, the idea that a child would benefit from having her father be financially stable and emotionally happy is not an idea that shrinks or the courts care apparently about. Don't talk much about yourself unless asked. Don't talk about your ex, and don't express any anger aout her. Do talk about how much you love your daughter. Cry. Get very emotional about ho wmuch you miss her, how you ar concerned about her. And if you do to court, get an agreement that spells everything out in advance--exact dates, etc, for as long in advance as you can. That cuts down on any need to interact with ex. And of course, never talk to your kids about any conflict over the visitations, even if your ex is, and don't talk to them about your ex either, even if she is the ex from hell. Shield them from the conflict as much as you can."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"First let me say that I have read dozens of books on Father's rights. As someone who has been involved in a long-term divorce and custody action, I felt it was imperative to educate myself \\"outside of the box\\". What I found was that while many self-help books offer good advice and content, none have done so within the context of the American legal system. No matter what is said about good intentions, it always comes down to legal issues in conjunction with behavioral and mental issues.This book is worth its weight in gold. Written by an attorney with vast experience in Father's rights cases, it is a no BS manual for determining your situation and finding a roadmap to its conclusion. Excellent informational content, well-written, and methodically walks the reader through the different phases, scenarios, and pitfalls of impending litigation, whether it be a simple way to craft a parenting agreement or all-out war.I whole-heartedly recommend this book as the single best resource you can find for Father's engaged in divorce and custody issues. Real-world advice that's on target. I have engaged four different attorneys in two states in a three year cross-state litigation case involving UCCJEA, and spent 30k in fees for worthless representation until I found my current attorney. If these professionals had the cumulative experience that was documented in this book, and had they been able to trasfer that information to me in its entirety, I could have saved myself a ton of problems.Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"The author of the book, Jeffery Leving, is a well-known divorce lawyer in the Chicago-area, solely because of his commercials shown between Jenny Jones-esque talk shows. Because of the shady credibility that I associate with these lawyers, I wasn't sure what to expect from Leving's book. I can only really say one thing about this book - WOW! Not only is Leving a great writer, but I believe his advice will be truly valuable. (My husband will be fighting his ex-wife for custody in the coming months.) His advice includes what to look for when choosing a lawyer, ways to deal with the \\"ex\\", how to respond to interviews by court officials and \\"experts\\", and helping your child(ren) through the whole ordeal. I must have highlighted half of the book while reading it! Finally, although Leving makes note of the gender bias in the domestic court system, he does not focus on the issue. That is, where other books whine excessively about the bias problem, Father's Rights addresses gender bias in the courts but then moves on to bigger and more important issues. This is definitely a must-read for any father who sees a custody battle in his future."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"I felt compelled to write about this book after reading one of the reviews on it apparently written by a female.The review yearned for a REAL fathers advocate book written by someone who has been there and lived through the HELL that is divorce, custody and a compete loss of everything that resembled \\"my life\\" - after I caught my wife cheating on me.I read this book during the first stages of my divorce and did not find it overly helpful. BUT, it was the only book that I found that spoke of what was about to happen.I have been writing columns and attending divorce/mens support groups for two years now and am VERY despondent about what I am seeing.Fathers rights is the \\"civil rights\\" story of this decade and it needs to be SEEN and SPOKEN about in the media.I have been on a personal crusade to get groups organized in DENVER and to get any media outlet to focus on men's rights but I get NOTHING back - I have emailed Dr Phil, 20/20, every possible media outlet and all I get back is more stories on \\"deadbeat dads\\" and Women and Domestic violence.Bad news GUYS:We know the courts do not care -We know the laws are laughably biased -We know the media would rather propagate more female friendly stories -But most guys do not ask WHY THIS IS.I see this as Men not taking action. Men avoid support groups because we are supposed to \\"suck it up\\".Men - WAKE UP - Get active.If I cannot get this story on 20/20 or Dr Phil, it is because MEN are NOT the audience.DO men vote, do men get involved in local politics, do men go to therapy to Resolve \\"their\\" issues. And these issues could include \\"how to deal with the powerlessness you feel in the system\\".I am working to put together articles I have written about MY experience -And it was/is horrible:Wife cheats - gets caught - blames me for her behavior. Badgers the police with false charges against me - of which, I have to expend money to fight her.My son (8) has cancer. My wife continued to change appointment times and cancel times.AND GUESS WHAT GUYS:When you get a Child Advocate or Child Family Investigator:The game is:As a MEN, you can never get angry.If the ex plays with parenting time.You cannot get angry.If the ex uniformly ignores Permanent Orders.You cannot get angry.If the MAN gets angry the courts will CRUCIFY YOU.I have documented my experiences and have read most every book (recommend Divorce Poison!!!!!) and plan to get this issue NATIONAL Attention.I am not optimistic at the moment.Finally, men, remember, no matter what transpires - no matter the complete injustice of the courts, lawyers, your ex's horrible wrath -Remember that everything is about the kids.

Unfortunately, most divorced dads after a period of time, do not have the funds for an attorney so we buy books to educate ourselves.Nothing is mentioned about the male who represents themselve in court. How self-serving for an attorney to market himself as the only option.Fortunately, fathers are becoming more aggressive in the protection of their rights. Robert Seidenberg in his book The Father's Emergency Guide gives a divorced dad a better understanding as to what he is up against.Forget about the traditional male role and focus on staying in your children's lives rather than trying to save a marriage. Your ex-wife has plans, you need to have yours as well!"},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"The author of this book certainly does not say anything that is untrue, even given the huge disparity of laws in the 50 states. However, on the front cover, among other things, he says you will learn how to:*Find an effective and empathetic attorney*Avoid unfavorable custody arrangements*Overcome the \\"tender years\\" bias*Remain financially solventTo be quite honest, being the second wife of a man who has been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by a devious first wife who has no moral compass, all I can say is this book must contain magical powers, because that is the only way any of these things are going to happen.First off, as far as finding an effective attorney, forget about it. The author's advice is pollyanna-ish at best. Attorneys are foremost interested in making money, and family law only pays off in volume. Therefore your case will get the obligatory two hour cram session from your attorney just prior to court. Plan on doing any real investigation yourself, and realize you are going to probably have to give your attorney a script of questions to read in court because these people are not \\"out of the box\\" thinkers.As far as avoiding unfavorable custody arrangements and overcoming the tender years bias, remember that judges are generally from the most conservative ranks of lawyers, and lawyers are from the most conservative ranks of society. I'm not talking about \\"conservative\\" in political terms. I'm talking about conservative in terms of conserving and never questioning the status quo, and the status quo is father = cash machine, mother = protector of civilization. Nothing but divine intervention is going to overcome that. Daniel Broderick overcame it, but then look what happened to him. The author of this book misleads you into believing that the system is remotely fair and unbiased, probably because he has been part of the system and cannot see it for what it is.As far as remaining financially solvent, the author completely overlooks the most important factor of all - which state you live in. Some states, such as Texas and New York, have absolute limits of 25% of your pre-tax income put on child support. As much as the courts and the mother of your children would love to pick your pockets for more money, this is all they are going to get. However, if you are unfortunate enough to live in the state of Virginia, there is no limit on alimony or child support and you can wind up with negative income flow, which happened in the case of my husband's divorce and is happening now in the case of an acquaintance and his divorce. In fact, the financial ruin of a Virginia divorce is the reason Aldrich Ames gave for becoming the worst spy in American history.In summary, although I may seem harshly critical, this book is moderately helpful as to absolute facts and a mentality you must take if you are on the road to litigation. However, I subtract two stars because I think it gives false hope to single fathers and their probable future in terms of staying close to their children and not winding up in debtor's prison if the mother is determined to fight. I've been up close and personal with this ongoing problem in my husband's life for the past 14 years, so I think I know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"Our society craves for equal treatment regardless of gender, race, religion, etc... But any father that has been divorced in recent years has found out that equal treatment is only a myth. Sure, there are cases where women have been beaten, abused and abandend, and there should be guidelines that protect those women IF that is the case. But for a loving, caring responsible father with no history of abusive behavior to be disadvantaged because of those bad apples is just plain discrimination. Unfortunately, our children, who should be least impacted by the divorce become the most. They become alienated at the behest of our current judicial system. This book suggests that the court system put the childrens well being well above EITHER parents and offers equitable solutions to consider. As a divorced father of 3 wonderful children, I would consider this book mandatory reading to any father going through a divorce, as well as any attorney dedicated to doing the right thing for our divorced families. If I were able to go back in time, I would have asked my attorney to read this book and comment on it BEFORE I would consider to have him represent me. I found the book easy to read and practicle. I especially like the authors suggestions on difusing an argumentive and vindictive spouse. As the author wrote, &quot;An eye for an eye, and we ALL go blind&quot;. Try professional counceling and stay married if you can, but if that isn't possible, buy his book"},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"'Fathers rights' is a 'must read' along with the other book available on Amazon called FAMILY COURT HELL.

Both books compliment each other-check it out!"},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"The advice this book offers has some points, but a word of caution: Lawyers are in business to MAKE MONEY. I personally find it over-promising, and somewhat confusing, for anyone to call themselves a \\"father's rights\\" attorney, (which sounds very wholesome and innocent), when divorce and custody proceedings, and most lawyers in general are NOT. As such, it is difficult to recommend the book or the author in navigating such highly personal and intrusive matters.As many parents find out after the courts have destroyed their relationships with their children, the right of a parent is fundamental [liberty] interest which should not require a person to go through a lengthy, costly, or intrusive legal battle to protect a God-given right, if there is no finding of 'parental unfitness' on one or both sides, which is irrelevant anyway if a child is NOT in any immediate danger, or if neglect is not real.The contrast is that many parents end up being hard pressed to find ANY lawyer that would make such arguments, in Leving's jurisdiction or anywhere else. The concept of a \\"father's rights\\" attorney to me is what is truly a \\"suspect classification\\", just as a \\"Biker's rights\\" attorney, or a \\"Gay Baby Seal's Rights\\" attorney, etc. Color it anyway you want--at the end of the day they're still Lawyers, most of whom will clean you out without a thought as to the outcome for you, your children, or your case, and do not deserve any special affection or attention beyond that of a used car salesman, or a pan-handler. You have to scrutinize them and show up at EVERY court hearing.Parents are \\"lawyer bait\\" if they do not know the ropes, or how lawyers often separate divorcing parents from their children [and their money] under the guise of \\"helping\\" to protect their rights--as if they have the power from God almighty to protect you, [which they do not, regardless of what you see on TV]. Getting this type of advice purely from a lawyer would be like going to a auto mechanic to ask if they should replace your engine. It's not hard to figure out how quickly the fool and his money will be parted.Do your homework and get solid referrals from multiple sources of people who've worked with lawyers and find someone with a good track record if you absolutely must hire one.Don't be fooled by Snakeoil Salesmen. Most lawyers do NOT want clients to bring up fundamental rights or use of \\"strict scrutiny\\" in unlawful removal of parental rights, which is what typically happens in our trial and appellate courts, because it would in part hurt the divorce industry, regardless of the \\"best interests of the child\\" statute. At the same time, if you show-up without a lawyer, you might as well hang a sign on your back that says \\"kick me\\". It's a \\"members' only\\" club, it's about lawyers helping lawyers, [not children or parents]. Regardless of the outcome, THERE ARE NO WINNERS unless or until you can make peace. If you can't do that--then get connected with your elected officials and national advocacy groups that are working to protect children and parents."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"Purchased this for our son who's going through a divorce where he's been in an abusive marriage.

Neither his book, nor his website, nor his Wikipedia blurb explain his personal marital history.- On the first pages of the book, notice that neither author offers a dedication to a loving wife or a devoted mother.- The anecdotes described in this book would rightfully enrage ANYONE...but do these anecdotes really represent most fathers' experiences? I could probably find just as many stories that highlight the abuses of mother's rights.- Mr. Leving writes that mothers and fathers share child care duties equally in marriage today (page 39 and 40), but in my experience women still do a ton more of the actual physical labor of childrearing and housework, even when women are employed outside the home.- Mr. Leving claims that 70% of abuse allegations during a custody battle are false (page 44) but how can this statistic be independently verified? How can ANYONE be CERTAIN that allegations of abuse are false?- Mr. Leving provides a list of many social ills that befall fatherless children (page 46) but he fails to point out that CORRELATION does not equal CAUSE. Just because two events are linked does provide an explanation as to WHY they are linked.For example, ice cream consumption is LINKED with drowning but that does not mean ice cream CAUSES drowning. More people eat ice cream in the summer AND more people go swimming in the summer, thus, there is a link between ice cream and drowning. You could also say that sunscreen is linked with drowning but this does not prove a cause and effect relationship.- Mr. Leving tries to make it appear that custodial mothers are to blame for a non-custodial father's refusal to pay child support by suggesting that fathers who are happy with their visitation schedule pay on time and in full and fathers who do not see their kids very often also do not pay child support very often (page 48-49). It makes sense that if a father does not care enough to visit his children regularly then he would not care enough to pay regular child support but how is this the fault of the custodial mother?- Mr. Leving seems to justify fathers who simply \\"vanish\\" after receiving custody verdict that makes them unhappy (top of page 81). Is this meant as an indirect threat to custodial mothers?- Mr. Leving seems to provide justification for parental kidnapping (middle of page 81). Is this meant as another indirect threat to custodial mothers?- Mr. Leving seems to think it is okay to let a custodial mother do all the physical labor of raising a child as long as the father retains enough control: \\"A joint legal custody agreement designating the children's mother as their primary custodian may be acceptable - if you retain parental authority and if the children will be spending at least two days a week and part of their school vacations living with you (page 84).\\"- Mr. Leving teaches his fathers how to subtly threaten their soon-to-be-ex-wives. Men can threaten their wives with financial hardship (pages 86 - 87). \\"You can wonder out loud about all sorts of plausible scenarios that may threaten or unsettle your former spouse, and there is at least a chance that those idle musings will someday come to pass. Use of this approach requires a careful, subtle touch. Contrasting what your ex may lose in court with what she can gain in settlement mustn't be perceived as blackmail. So be cautious. Warn, don't threaten (page 91).\\"- Mr. Leving equates being a full-time caretaker with being a \\"child-care slave (page 91).\\"- Mr. Leving encourages fathers to financially blackmail their ex-spouses. Regarding pretrial discovery, he writes \\"Also, the discovery phase may intimidate your opponent by making it clear the size and shape of the ordeal that lies ahead. And the truckloads of paper rolling back and forth could cause the other side considerable expense (page 120).\\"- Mr. Leving fails to see the irony in his statement about using a photo to prove a father's worth as a parent. \\"...or a photo of you beaming proudly in the background as your child receives a school award (page 122).\\" As a custodial mother who has taken hundreds of photos of my daughter's father, I can tell you that I am in less than 1 percent of the pictures because I am the person TAKING the photo.- Does Mr. Leving really believe the following quote only applies to the female gender? \\"A significant number of custody disputes never really end....some angry mothers will not, or cannot, give up their dark dreams of revenge and vindication (page 174).\\"My favorite (neutral) quotes:\\"If you prove yourself to be a strong witness, difficult to discredit or fluster, your spouse's lawyer may think twice about taking the custody battle to trial (page 125).\\"\\"...let the remainder of the litigation process play itself out at its normal pace (a speed halfway between 'unbelievably slow' and 'no perceptible movement' in most regions of the United States) (page 147).\\"\\"The odds that your custody dispute will reach a courtroom are slim (nine to one against on most tote boards.) You, your spouse, or both of you will run out of money or patience. The need to move on will overwhelm the desire for vindication and validation (page 155).\\"If you lose the custody case: \\"Instead of buying your attorney a new Lexus, spend the appeal funds on your children (page 168).\\" I LOVE THIS QUOTE."},{"Title":"Fathers' Rights: Hard-Hitting & Fair Advice for Every Father Involved in a Custody Dispute","review":"There are many useful books on this site to read and study concerning a Father's Rights.

If a husband breaks that contract and has been married many years, the woman deserves 50% of any assets that man ever receives from his sucessess as a business man. My wife put her own career secondary to mine the day we married. She helped me rise to my current status and, if I were to break my marriage vows, I would feel she deserved 1/2 of our assets and 1/2 of my future earnings because she helped me get to where I am today in my career. I don't think she thought of me as a &quot;meal ticket&quot; when she married me 34 years ago. We thought we were MARRIED. i.e. &quot;all for one and one for all&quot; in our relationship. Marriage is a contract and we worked it out together how we would proceed with our life together. I think Mr. Leving has the wrong perspective on marriage to begin with.

I recently faced a tremendous challenge to my parental rights in Texas and found this to be my sole guide. It walked me through some of the rougher realities of my fight and eventual court hearing. The advice is very practical and the insight of how the system works is invaluable. The case studies illuminated what can go wrong and let the reader prepare accordingly if necessary. I would absolutely agree in repeating to other fathers that if you're going through a divorce with children, having trouble with a vindictive ex-wife even after the divorce is over, or in a fight to preserve your fatherhood, then don't miss this resource - your children may depend on it.

Does its sequel, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE hold up, now that we know about the surprises? You bet. Probably the best compliment that can be paid this novel is that although it is a sequel, it stands on its own quite well.TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE carries on the story of Mma Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency in Botswanna, Africa. Once again, Alexander McCall Smith paints an evocative picture of a stable African state that has achieved its independence and modernity after a long journey through colonial rule and early selfhood. In Mma Ramotswe and her fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Smith has an honest lens on the traditional and emerging cultures that still clash, but are determined to reckon with one another. This time out, their stories convey not only Africa, but a bemused look at its foil, America, when Mma Ramotswe agrees to go looking for the answer to an American woman's question: why and where did her college-aged son disappear 10 years before.Unlike the first book, which unfolded episodically, this has two strong plot lines from the outset with attendant subplots. It is to Mr. Smith's credit, that he prefers complications in plot and character rather than red herrings. He employs both irony and symbolism, but in an almost self-effacing way that make their revelation richer. He knows when to let the reader laugh and when to ask tricky ethical questions."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I came upon this book cold at the library, never heard of the author or the series.

It goes quickly yet engrosses one completely. It is a treasure. Has a BIT of the feel of the film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; maybe because of the locale...but also the pure joy and goodness of the people in this story. I can't wait to find more stories of Ms. Ramotswe and her friends."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is my favorite of the 4 Ladies Detecttive Agency books written by A.M.

The characters are all flawed, but this only makes you care about them and their struggles to find justice, love, and a place in a pretty hard world which the main characters embrace with all of their hearts."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a delight -- to find a new author! This book serves up an African cozy -- a heart-felt book about a world the author clearly loves and admires. The heroine owns a detective agency in Botswwana and, as the book opens, has become engaged to a kind gentleman who owns an auto repair garage. Just how kind is he? Well, let's say this book shows us warm-hearted generosity without descending into maudlin sentiment.The mystery itself -- what happened to a young American who disappeared ten years ago -- allows the author to maintain suspense. We genuinely care about the crime and we observe the heroine's search for a solution. At the same time, the detective agency gets involved in a more routine &quot;who's cheating on who&quot; marital case. While the ending is not a satisfying solution to a problem, the handling of both cases demonstrates the heroine's talent for combining compassion with justice.Books in exotic settings often don't work, but this one does -- splendidly. I am reminded of both M.C. Beaton series -- Hamish McBeth and Agatha Raisin -- but this book actually has less of an &quot;edge&quot; and the humor is more subtle. Tears of the Giraffe goes beyond cozy into a sub-genre of the &quot;gentle&quot; book -- not a tear-jerker and always respectful of the characters and setting."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The language is simple, the characters uncomplicated, the plot effortless, the morality is straightforward. It has an innocent naivety as if the story teller is narrating his tale to a child. The adults are addressed by titles and last names, which seems oddly formal in this dusty, sun-baked village in Botswana, but it becomes one more charming quality. Precious Ramotswe is assertive and independent. She takes pride in running her own detective agency and as a child might do simply names it \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\" She also feels satisfaction in having as her secretary a woman who received a mark of 97 percent from the Botswana Secretarial College, a fact the reader is reminded of from time to time. One gets the impression from other characters that she is overweight, but she comfortably refers to herself as a \\"traditional woman.\\" I would love to sit down with her over a cup of bush tea in her home on Zebra Drive and have a conversation. She is absolutely endearing. Having read one other book in the series, I felt drawn to read another."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you have not read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I strongly urge you to do so before reading Tears of the Giraffe. Otherwise, this beautiful novel will seem like a four star effort as you fail to appreciate and integrate the background of Precious Ramotswe into your thinking as it was described in the earlier book.Tears of the Giraffe isn't so much a sequel as a continuation of the events in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. As that book ended, Mma Ramatswe accepted the proposal of Mr J.L.B. Matekoni. In Tears of the Giraffe, the couple decides in which of their houses they will live, picks out a ring and decides about having children. Each event has its unexpected twists . . . including an attempt by Mr Matekoni's maid to derail the marriage.There is less happening at the detective agency than in the prior story. This book involves solving only two mysteries, a wandering wife and a missing son. Mma Ramatswe learns that her able secretary wants to become a detective, and the savvy head of the agency tries out Mma Makutsi's talents with encouraging results.Both story lines focus on questions of right and wrong. As a prospective spouse, what are the right reactions to one's fianc&eacute; or fianc&eacute;e? As a detective, how much may one do wrong to avoid greater wrongs? To one's community, what is owed? To one's employees, what opportunities should be opened? In each case, the suggestion is that all responsibilities must be borne . . . and borne bravely . . . but in a way that is tempered with love for one's fellow people.As with The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Africa itself plays a role stronger than any single character in defining what is thought and done. The strong and distinct atmosphere makes the book more enchanting to those who do not know Africa.The story is strengthened by alternating narrators among many different characters and using lots of dialogue so that each part of the novel is vivid and varied. It's as though six or seven almost unconnected short stories were woven together into a seamless novel. It's an impressive accomplishment.As I finished the book, I wondered how much better off we all would be if we each took a strong responsibility for all those we meet and touch."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am now beginning the first book of the series, which appears to now be 10 books long. I bought this because I found it on a clearance rack in Half Price Books and I love stories about strong women, and I thought it would be fascinating to read a book set in Africa by someone who has lived in Africa. I am also always curious to see how male authors characterize women lead characters. I was not disappointed in this tale on any count. McCall Smith's storytelling is wonderful, humorous, and filled with a lot of heart. His passages were very evocative of a dry, beautiful country which now seems so full of warmth and life to me instead of being just another faraway place on a map. He does not shy away from the dark aspects of life, nor does he skirt the confusions and conundrums that plague daily lives of ordinary people, but he addresses them all in a matter of fact and amusing way so that the result is very uplifting instead of depressing. If you want a read about how awful life is, you will have to look elsewhere. There are certainly plenty of awful things that are addressed in this book and the first one which I am now reading, but he does not stuff you down in the mire, but creates characters who, through wit and will, rise above and make the best of their circumstances with dignity and sometimes aplomb. I applaud this wonderful book and look forward to reading the entire series and probably some of his other series as well."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Tears of the Giraffe is the second book in Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. In this outing Mma Ramotswe is principally concerned with two cases. An American woman seeks her help in finding out what happened to her son, who disappeared ten years earlier while working on a farm in Botswana. Mma Ramotswe's assistant Mma Makutsi, newly promoted to the position of assistant detective, acts as the lead investigator in the second case that crosses their desks: a man hires them to find out where his wife has found the money to send their son to an expensive private school. At the same time big changes are sweeping Mma Ramotswe's private life. She's agreed to marry Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors--a decision neither of them regrets the morning after the decision is made--so there is an engagement ring to think of. Her fianc&eacute;, meanwhile, kind man that he is, finds himself agreeing to do something he fears may threaten the impending nuptials.As usual, McCall Smith's writing in this book is simple and perfect and very readable, the story sweet and moving. His characters are real people, if I suppose idealized, seen as if through a gauze that softens the rough edges. This is not to say that everyone in the series is good, by any means. McCall Smith alludes to the evils of men, both large and small, and Mma Ramotswe sometimes comes up against true wickedness. Certainly she regularly confronts very real heartbreak. But somehow her approach to life and to other people keeps despair in check. Tears of the Giraffe, at any rate, is a beautiful little book. A delicious read.-- Debra Hamel"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith does it again. This charming humorous delightful tale centering on the lady detective,Precious Ramotswe, is a quick read. Using unpretentious language Precious Ramotswe dispenses kernals of wisdom throughout the story. Further, the reader is drawn into the mysteries of her investigations and the careful way in which Precious reads the character of other people. We are now further introduced to her fiance, the mechanic,Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and her secretary, Mma Makutsi. Precious understands the importance of human dignity, and she makes sure to preserve that dignity in both the deserving and undeserving whenever possible. However, she is able to tease the truth out of liars and other dishonest people. She does so without rancor or unneccessary unkindness. She is manipulative only when neccessary. However, she puts the cocky and supercilious in their place while still maintaining her own dignity. In some ways she is very naive and unworldly, but in dealing with human nature she is wise beyond her years. We can all learn a thing or two from Mme. Ramotswe."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" a second installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith, deals with Precious Ramotswe who was now engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the owner of a car repair shop in Botswana. Unlike the first book which dealt a lot more with cases, this installment deals with just two cases. In the first case, an American lady who lost her son in Botswana ten years ago had returned to ask Mma. Ramotswe's help to find out what exactly happened to her son and in the second case, a butcher would like to find out if his wife was cheating on him. Alexander McCall Smith was able to provide more depth in these two cases, more so as compared to his first book. In addition, the author also provided more details about Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni in the sense of his character. Thrown in the midst of this was the maid of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni who felt threatened by Mma. Ramostwe's presence, as well as the new role that her secretary Mma. Makutsi, will assumed.In \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" the readers get to know more about Mma. Ramotswe as well as her fiance, Mr. Matekoni. The author is able to vividly describe their personalities as well as their surrounding. Also in this book, we understand the connection that Mma. Ramostwe feels towards her country and its people. In addition, I enjoy the cases in this book and appreciated the way in which Mma. Ramotswe solved them. She once again proved to be a wise, inquisitive and compassionate detective. For those who are hard core mystery fans, this is not the book for you. However, if you are interested in learning about Mma. Ramotswe and the simple but effective ways she solved her problems, then this is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am so happy she finally decided to get married and chose a well known person for his integrity and kindness. She made it clear though that she accepted his proposal not because she is a woman who needs a man to protect her nor to be his servant NO she was satisfied with her life and her job and hurt from her experience with one failed marriage that was still so fresh in her memory..I love the series because of Mma's character. She wants to change and wants to learn about the modern world and life in the new century but doesn't shun her past .. on the contrary she is proud of her heritage and of her country and what makes it special. Through her investigations, Smith tackles various issues, he states Mma's point of view as the opinion of the learned people and leaders of her country and shows how a foreigner would percieve it... true and simple. He uses simple language, affirms the traditions of the country, draws the difference in behavior between past and present... Africa and the west.It's a funny sad book, clash of culture and modernization. Enjoy reading as Mma unfolds the mysteries of life!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Smith's first book in the series, _No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency_, was enjoyable and easy to read. I found the second installment in the series, _Tears of the Giraffe_ even more enjoyable than the first. The characters continue to develop nicely and the stories held my attention better than the initial book. I particularly liked the introduction of the children from the orphan farm, and look forward to the parts they will play in the following books.The writing style and the stories are simple in nature, with morals that transcend the book. The books are in fact a wonderful advertisement for the country of Botswana, and Africa itself. Great emphasis is placed upon morality, respect and love.I look forward to the other books about Mma Ramotswe and the rest of the ensemble."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Not a word in the many five-star reviews you'll read here is hyperbole - Precious really is precious, and about as endearing and original a character as you'll find in fiction in the last decade or so. But a warning: in the second novel in the series (which starts with The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency), the author takes too much for granted; specifically, he trades on the patience and sympathy readers will feel for his main characters, the wonderful setting and the air of the romantic and exotic that pervades the books. The most dangerous example is the throw-away subplot involving Mr J.L.B.'s ill-tempered housemaid. Jeopardy involving her is cleverly built up, but then carelessly discarded, as if McCall Smith had simply grown weary of this particular subplot. That is a betrayal of the crime writer's craft, and is simply not good enough. This is an isolated failing, but it make one more nervous about borderline cases: at the moment, so many of the simpler plots are used to explore hilarious minor characters, and to allow Precious and her sidekick to show as much caring as cunning. That's fine. What's not so fine is the suspicion that all this may degerate into middle-period Rumpole, that wasteland in which John Mortimer had dumped his most famous creation, with nothing but his own loveable eccentricities for comfort. &quot;Action is character&quot; is an axiom they use in the movie business, and it is worth citing here. At his best, McCall Smith reveals character through action, dialogue and internal musings. Where action is present, particularly in the detective genre, it must surely have purpose and thrust. It must, on ocassion, be puzzling and paradoxical. It must, at the very least, be interesting. Trouble is, Precious herself is so fascinating that, as this tiny little plotting sin reveals, McCall Smith may feel that he does not need to give her very much to do. Should he act on that erroneous belief, he will find his charismatic and sympathetic character becoming - like Rumpole - a bit of a bore."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"You would have to be cynical not to love this book.

In the previous volume, Precious Ramotswe exposes an unfaithful husband, a con artist and a fraudulent doctor, returns a lost child, and agrees to marry Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni.In this novel, Precious inspects the house of Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni and declares it unsuitable for their domicile; they agree to live in the house on Zebra road. However, he is not to store automobile engines and parts within the house.Since Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni will no longer live in his present house after the wedding, he notifies his maid that her job will be terminated at that time. The maid, Florence Peko, is not very good at her job, but she has conditioned Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni to accept what is offered and does not really want to lose the position. Jobs are scarce and hard to come by. If it wasn't for that Ramotswe woman, she would keep her job. Florence wonders how she can get rid of the odious woman.Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni has helped the Orphans Home with mechanical repairs for years. When Mma Potokwane calls for his assistance with an overheating water pump, he drives out to fix it. While he is working on the pump engine, one of the orphans, a young girl in a squeaking wheel chair, brings him some water and stays to watch him finish the repairs. Afterwards, he oils the bearings and frees a sticking brake lock on her chair.Mma Ramotswe acquires an American client who is searching for her lost son. The client had come to Botswana over a decade ago with her husband and eighteen year old son. Her son had found interesting work on a farm commune and stayed behind when his parents left. A couple of years later, the son disappeared one evening and was never seen again.Highly recommended for McCall Smith fans and anyone else who enjoys detective stories set in foreign locales.-Bill Jordin"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Good mini mysteries with Botswana culture intertwined.

I suggest you read the first one to get a full flavor of the chief characters. This one adds some minor characters and continues on with more short stories.I wanted a book that was an easy and fast read but did not require a lot of philosophy or social comment. This book met the bill and more so. I found the heroine charming and believable though some reviews do not.I love the way the author manages to comment on African (at least in this part of the country) points of view on morals and the variety of social behavior amongst the different tribes and the views of white man. He rarely condemns but justifies the heroine's point of view with humor.I am now reading the 3rd book and plan to read more of the series."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I found this novel to be revealing in the sense that one was able to relate to the goodness of the majority of the characters.

The mystery is a bit of sleeper, but that is fine. Because their are all these little subplots happening,( along with a romance going on) along with musings from all the differant characters about what Botswana used to be like versus what the country is like now.( It reminds me of what America was like forty years ago) How woman in Botswana are having a little woman's movement of their our own and trying for their voices to be heard.

Mma Ramotswe has accepted the proposal of Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, and the two are working out the details of just how to combine their households and lives. Precious has also undertaken a couple of cases, one involving a long missing son, the other an investigation of a possibly straying wife. Rra Matekoni also has business concerns, his two apprentices are more interested in watching young women passing by the garage than fixing engines and his good deeds at the local orphanage has offered some unexpected returns.The stories here are gentle ones, more often of everyday matters than extraordinary ones. Straying spouses and other domestic matters appear here, not serial killers or long missing treasures. The ever expanding cast of characters add their voices to these delightful tales of life in this exotic land.Fans of the HBO series will recognize some, but not all of the stories told in this volume.

This is the way to purchase books!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The book was pretty interesting and well-written, with great descriptions of Africa and its culture. The tone is refreshing, and there are several poignant moments. Unfortunately, I don't think Mma Ramotswe is \\"The Miss Marple of Botswana\\" because the story does not have suspense, and the problem at hand is not a real mystery.First of all, mystery books have danger. Perhaps Miss Marple never finds herself in a life or death situation, but at least her murders are usually fresh and not ten years old. As Mma Ramotswe herself admits, the case is \\"stale.\\" I haven't read the other books in the series, so maybe those are more exciting.Also, I would expect a mystery to have clues. My favorite part of Agatha Christie mysteries is looking over the clues and trying to guess whodunit. In this book, they simply look up some old records and rely on \\"intuition.\\" Oooh, how clever!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Yes, there is a nice description of Botswana (nice thoughtful softhearted people all, beautiful land; AIDS? What AIDS?). Even that becomes a bit tedious at times. After first seven-eight times even I did get the idea that a proper Botswana's way to shake hands and to accept gifts is with two hands. It did not have to be repeated twenty three more times. Yet it was the best part of the book. Mystery solving? Well, it goes like that: Mma Ramotswe goes to the place of the crime, and \\"knows\\" how it all happened. Needless to say, she is correct. There goes deductive logic, Watson. And for a coup de grace the subplot: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (I think probably about twenty pages of this short book were filled by endless repetition of \\"Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni\\"; no short names in Botswana? Can we call him Bob?) adapts two poor little orphans, older sister and younger brother. Of course the orphans live in orphanage, and have everything they need, because this is Botswana's way (after all, we are not like Nigeria......), but still no parents. Touching. Not touching enough. Little girl is paraplegic. Still not touching enough. Turns out when little children's tribal mother died in the jungle, the newborn brother was buried with the dead mother, because it is the jungle's way, therefore it is correct, and who are we to judge. Apparently, the jungle way is also to bury the kid alive, rather than to finish him/her off first, and it must contain the wisdom of the millennia. Indeed, it turned to be quite fortunate in this particular case: the little girl (not a paraplegic yet), waits, digs out the brother, takes him to town, and cares for him for four years on the streets. I wonder, why the great tribal elders buried the kid rather than to take him to town, but never mind, may be it was a long walk, and it was raining, and no FedEx drop off box nearby. Then little girl becomes paraplegic, and is picked up by the great orphanage where she and the brother lack nothing. Anybody crying yet? Before accusing me of being so very insensitive, please realize that none of that actually happened. It is fiction, and as such I find this to be quite a bit overdone. And now, for a final politically correct vignette, Bob (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni) is a car mechanic, and (being childless) has a dream that the little former orphan brother will inherit his garage. Noops, not touching enough. It is the little paraplegic girl who is interested and has a talent to become a car mechanic, and who are we to object to that? I bet that eventually she will succeed (but maybe after she becomes a quadriplegic and blind in some subsequent book to make it more touching?). I will never know. I was also told that the series gets better. I will never know myself, either........"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"My comments apply to all three of the authors books. You get no feeling of Botswana at all. People go to lunch at the Presidents Hotel, teenagers have &quot;attitude&quot;, homes have all the usual middle class western acouterments like tubs, sweaters of real wool are appreicated over &quot;polyester&quot;. These are all concerns and needs of a middle class English citizen where the author hails from and not that of a middle class Botswana citizen. This is not the Botswana I am seeing in the news nor does it feel real. Ok the book is fun to read to but by the second one you will be annoyed at its lack of authenticity and forced and phony simplicity."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a coin toss. On one side of the coin, you end up with a true feel of Africa, the pace of the people, their thinking process. On the flip side of the coin, it is NOT a fast-paced mystery. It is predominately about the people and VERY, very slow-paced. Too many words. The 'mystery' is thickly buried within .. you have to dig and dig and dig to discover the what the mystery is ... much less the 'solving' of the mystery. Likeable people."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After reading the first book which I loved I could not wait to read the second in the series and I was very disapointed.

I decided to give this book to charity by the time I finished chapter 4 however.I assumed there would be proper editing in such a popular book, at least consistent grammar and punctuation, but apparently not. The writing style is indeed smooth- so smooth that the narrator, the female detective (a Botswana native), the male auto repair garage owner (& Botswana native), and the windowed American who was married to a diplomat all have the same voice! Excuse me? I prefer characters who are unique, not ones I can't distinguish between.I also estimate that this book has about 20% to 30% more words than needed to tell the story, as it seems Mr. McCall Smith likes to add useless words for the sole purpose of making the book longer. He also uses words that don't fit tertibly well- I wouldn't want my kids reading this and thinking some of these words were being used clearly.Not as much fun as Harry Potter, not as enjoyable as Hemingway, not as insightful as The Alchemist, and certainly not educational. Little better than a bunch of random words on paper.

The No. 1 Ladies Dectective Agency has taken on some new and interesting cases. In this story things are not as clear cut as they seem and Precious Ramotswe ponders the morality of telling the truth, telling lies and in general the imperfection of the human condition. Her insights into the psyche of human nature are all to true. Alexander McCall Smith has again created a wonderful vignette of stories that delight the reader with their simple storyline, yet complex implications into the nature of women, men and children. In this series we get to know several characters more intimately including, Precious Ramotse's fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni. He is a wonderfully rich character that adds much to the story and I am looking forward to reading future installments that include the evolvement of their relationship. I am constantly enthralled by McCall Smith's description of the African continent and it's people and find these descriptions both heart warming and heart breaking. It seems there are many changes ahead for Mma Ramotswe; a new family an assisant dectective and a new husband. I look forward to the continuation of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and the unique insights that Precious Ramotswe has for the readers."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a wonderful, gentle book with mysteries, but with wise words from a wise woman and kind words too, from her kind fiancee. All in all reading this series ( I have read 2) has been a distinct and very different pleasure. The descriptions of daily life in Botswana and of cultural habits, landscape, etc., add to the pleasure and are never tedious &quot;filler&quot; as they can sometimes be in authors with less talent. A definite &quot;feel good&quot; book."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This does not merely live up to the first int the series - it is even better, as McCall Smith's writing skills have clearly improved even more.

So why not do more than enjoy this book but buy 10 copies for friends at Thanksgiving and 10 more at Christmas and see all these splendid books, set in Botswana, on the bestseller list. They are all a joy and McCall Smith is truly a national treasure.

The characters are charming and amusing."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The second novel in this series does not disappoint. We are presented with another cozy mystery, in which the characters and life in Botswana play a much more prominent role than the case itself. In most cases, I would say that this is a drawback, but McCall Smith's writing is so good, that the reader finds himself happily devouring the pages and learning about Mma Ramotswe and her entourage.Not only do we get a depiction of culture in Botswana, we get this through the colorful commentary of the characters. When I read lines like \\"\\"old Botswana morality, as everybody knew, was so plainly right\\" I can't help it but break a smile. The dialogues are truly priceless, and even the thoughts of some characters, such as the evil and conniving maid of Ramotswe's fiance, are truly entertaining.Like I mentioned, there is not much emphasis on the couple of cases in which the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is focusing on, but this is fine. The part that does bother me a little though, and is the reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the main character reaches conclusions without us having any idea of what the reasoning was. For example, she decides someone is a bad person by looking at a picture, or she gets a clear profile of family and work of a woman she meets just by looking at her and what she is carrying. But we never know how she determined this, which is frustrating. I much rather have the logic described similar to what we get with Sherlock Holmes. Anyway, a small defect that overall does not invalidate the great appeal of this book."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Simple and enjoyable book .

Indeed, the two books are utterly seamless, and it'd be a real shame to read this without reading its predecessor first. The book picks up with the engagement of \\"traditionally built\\" Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's sole woman detective, to local master mechanic Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. While the structure is the same as the first book&#65533;a missing son as the central running mystery, and some smaller cases interspersed&#65533;the new couple's relationship is the real focus.So, while Precious is asked by an American woman to find out what happened to her son, who disappeared from a commune ten years previously, she must also negotiate the pitfalls of setting up house with Mr. Matekoni, the acquisition of an engagement ring, and the dastardly schemes of Mr. Matekoni's nasty housekeeper, and the unexpected addition of two foster children to her household. All of which she does with her keen sense of human nature and wisdom. Her secretary/typist is also given increased attention, allowed to take on the case of a cheating wife all by herself.Built into the stories are ruminations of the tensions between modernity and traditional values. There are a number of passages that attempt to capture the essence of Africa, and how that noble vision is under constant assault by greed, corruption, and power. The adventures of Precious and her cohort are a warm antidote to the often depressing news that dominates coverage of Africa in the West. Smith writes in a delightfully fluid and simple prose with pacing that makes the book quite difficult to put down. The series thankfully continues with Morality for Beautiful Girls and The Kalahari Typing School For Men, with further volumes to follow, one hopes."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm an American woman who has spent 12 years living in Africa, and traveled to almost every part of the African continent. When I discovered the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, I could hardly wait to read Tears of the Giraffe. I was not disappointed. I can hardly wait to get to the next books in the series. After saying she would never, ever remarry (in the first book), Precious does get engaged in this book, but continues to pursue investigating her cases while engaged. There are a lot of interesting developments that I don't want to give away. She hasn't gotten married by the end of the book, that is left to us in the third book to find out about.....!I found it interesting that the author is a Professor of Medical law, living in Scotland, but having been born and raised in Zimbabwe. He has published many varied books on many subjects. I think these are his \\"fun\\" books! I also think that part of the reason he has written these books is to show non-Africans what traditional African society is like, especially how it is managing to move into the modern age. By setting it in Botswana, he neatly sidesteps many of the problems found in other parts of Africa, and is able to concentrate both on his story, and on showing us how traditional Africans THINK and act. I found this especially interesting, having lived in several African cultures, myself. I also find the series very uplifting and rewarding to read, in addition to being a good story. I think some of the critical reviews are from people who have never lived or traveled in Africa, and they just don't realize how true-to-life are so many of the episodes-I do not find these books at ALL condescending toward blacks. On the contrary, they are a celebration of the traditional GOOD values found in black African culture (a nice change from what we usually see in the news).There were several things I especially enjoyed about this book. I don't particularly enjoy first-person, male-oriented police detective novels. This is about a woman detective, who had no more qualifications than you or I, but who just hung out a sign, and used her common sense. She ordered a text book from London, from which she learned some investigative procedures. She's very clever. The book is not written as a first person, blow-by-blow account. On the contrary, it is written in third person, and is more about her LIFE, going through her becoming a detective, the cases she meets along the way (which we watch her solve), and what we learn about the society as we go along. I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning to travel to any southern African country. It is a light, humorous book, from which you can learn a lot while enjoying a great story. I found it difficult to put down. I have now read the first two books in the series, and plan to order every single one. I can hardly wait until they arrive in the mail!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith has written over 50 books, from specialized works as The Criminal Law of Botswana, ForensicAspects of Sleep to Children's books. He currently is a Professor of Medical Law at Edinburgh University.Tears of the Giraffe takes us further into the life of the interesting and confident Precious Ramotswe, the owner and detective of Botswana's only Ladies' detective agency. Among her cases in Tears of The Giraffe are wandering wives, the devious and dangerous maid of Mma Ramotswe's fiance and a challenge to resolve a mother's pain for her missing son, who is long lost on the African plains. Mma Ramotswe's own impending marriage to the best mechanic and gentleman, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the promotion of her secretary to the dizzy heights of Assistant Detective and new additions to the Matekoni family, all come together again to produce the second humorous and charmingly entertaining of tales in Smith's series.A enchanting view of life as it is in today's Africa. This mystery is enhanced by the belief and charm of the lifestyle of thecharacters and the plot. A totally fun read for the many fans who wish to escape to a simpler lifestyle, whether you've traveled to Africa or not!I thoroughly enjoyed this book for it's unique and likable characters and exotic setting. The uniqueness of the mysteriesreflect a simpler lifestyle than many of us live and especially expect in a &quot;mystery&quot;. TOTAL ENJOYMENT!John Row"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After stumbling upon \\"The # 1 Ladies Detective Agency,\\" I was so eager to read the sequels that I managed, at great travail, to track them down even before their publication dates in the U.S. Never before have I searched out books so vigilantly, and never before have I written a review.\\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" and \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" are even less strictly mysteries that the first in the series, but they are just as wonderful as \\"#1...\\". Light reading but with a literary bent, the books contain rich characters, uniquely African and clearly depicted. The ones we know well are big-hearted, kind, well-meaning.The main character, Precious, solves the few actual mysteries in the sequels in creative ways that surprise the reader. These sequels, particularly \\"Giraffe,\\" are a bit more about Precious' relationship with J.L.B. Matekoni, a bit less about the detective agency. But they follow smoothly from \\"#1 Ladies...\\" and are equally good. Set in Botswana, the books give such a clear and beautiful picture of that country today that now I would like to learn more about it. If the books are realistic, Botswanians fiercely love their home.Nothing raunchy in any of the 3 books. Terrific \\"reads.\\""},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In the 2nd novel of his series on Precious Ramotswe, the only lady detective in Botswana, Alexander McCall Smith continues to turn the detective genre inside out with some of the best writing you'll see in any genre. Precious is African, female, of &quot;traditional build,&quot; open-hearted, optimistic, and wise, in opposition to the classic hard-boiled cynical American wiseguy.&quot;Tears of the Giraffe&quot; develops the metaphor of a detective as a kind of mother who, by observing the people around her carefully, is at the same time taking care of them. The maternal theme is explicit in this story: the primary mystery involves an American mother looking for a long-lost son. At the same time Precious must cope with the sudden adoption of two winsome orphans by her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Watching out for people, watching out for Africa itself, is a way of respecting it.The style of the book mirrors Precious herself: simple, too-the-point, a fine sense of humor, and very observant. There are some really eloquent even lyrical passages as Precious drives across her belowed Botswana.I again caution that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different. And if you are new to the Ramotswe series, start with the first book (The Number One Ladies' Detective Agency), which will give you important details of Precious' and Matekoni's history.But please read it eventually - you will find no better-written book this year."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's second book of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Tears of the Giraffe, continues to develop the idea of the female African narrative. In the first book, McCall Smith concludes with Mma Ramotswe agreeing to marry an admirable fellow, the mechanic Mr. J.L.B Matekoni. McCall Smith immediately picks up where he left off, pushing the theme of the family. By using two established people, the book challenges the conventional forms of marriage and family in Botswana culture. Mma Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni must, through compromise, decide on a lifestyle that will provide for them. Although they share responsibility, McCall Smith's achievement rests in the fact that his main character, Mma Ramotswe, uses her independence to transform her culture. She uses strength and courage to infuse a modern viewpoint on a culture where female dependence is embedded in its history. By the end of the book, Mma Ramotswe's views become infectious, and her effect on Mr. Matekoni clearly shows the manner in which she has revolutionized an entire way of thinking.Aside from issues of the family, McCall Smith also explores his fascination with the disappearance of the &quot;Old Africa,&quot; and mulls over the issues that modern society's growth comes at the expense of tradition and custom. He considers the status of good old-fashioned hard work. Does passion for one's work still exist or has it been eaten by modernity? Mma Ramotswe's secretary has her own theory. She thinks that the more Mercedes Benz a country has, the worse off that country is. As in this case, McCall Smith often uses characters with a limited point of view to produce moments of humor, but he simultaneously makes poignant observations about conflicting culture. At times, he offers more serious and direct commentary. As a result, the book not only takes the shape of histoircal documentation, but it also serves to instruct, to give hope, and to provide some examples of how to deal with a rapidly passing history. Through his series of books, McCall Smith has found a means to combine the local with the vast. He has invented Mma Ramotswe in order to show that one person can make a difference because Africa is comprised of a collection of individual stories. He craftily weaves these stories together to produce his African history, and in doing so contemplates and applauds the progress of a culture."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This series of African stories is a wonderful read, but an even more enjoyable listen. While reading these books, I sometimes become distracted and skip over some of the rich descriptions of the African landscape and people. But these tapes are wonderful! They are narrated by Lisette Lecat, a native South African, who is absolutely perfect for the job. We took them along on vacation and played them in the car while driving 7 hours. Initially, my 11 year old son made fun of Mma Ramotswe and said the tape was &quot;lame&quot; but by the end of our trip he was hooked on the stories too. Definitely worth purchasing, even if you have read the books. You will finally know how to pronounce all of the African names!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I truly enjoyed the first of this series, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, and wondered if Alexander McCall Smith could live up to the promise of a great series. He has done that with ease, I think. This book is more of a mystery book than the first one, although still far from the classic mystery genre. It contains so much more than just crime solving. Precious Ramotswe's fiancee, J.L.B. Matekoni plays a much bigger role in this book, as does her secretary, and now-assistent detective, Mma Makutsi.The main mystery in this entry is the disappearance 10 years earlier of an American woman's son. There are a couple of secondary mysteries, but the main focus of the book is on the engagement of Precious and Mr. Matekoni, as well as two orphan children.I can't wait to read the third in the series."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency a few weeks ago, and thought it a very good book. This second installment from Law Professor Smith is perhaps even better, and had me chuckling and guffawing at various passages. Strangely, since I enjoy mysteries, there's less mystery here (basically only two plots, neither of them very mysterious) but you wind up not caring because the characters are so much fun.Precious Ramotswe runs a detective agency in Gabarone, the capital of Botswana. She's a &quot;traditionally built&quot; woman with traditional values, too. She's also got a very modern job, working as a detective in Africa, and investigating things. At the beginning of this book, she's accepted the marriage proposal of Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and there are many complications that ensue, especially when some orphans are adopted into the family.One of the writing tricks that the author uses to give the story quaintness is his use of names. You only read Precious Ramotswe's first name once or twice per book. Instead she's referred to as Mma Ramotswe, the Mma apparently being Mrs. in Botswana. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is never referred to as anything else, anywhere in the book, and their respective businesses, the No.1 Ladies's Detective Agency and Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, are both only referred to by their full names. The result is a sort of quaint pride in accomplishment, tempered with a slightly ridiculous feeling to things. After all, there aren't *two* ladies' detective agencies in Botswana.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and will read the third one soon. The fourth I may wait for paperback (or I may not). But this one's definitely worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Here are some of my favorite things about TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE:It contains a little bit of interesting African history, personalities, views and culture introduced in a creative way as we read about Mma (pronounced MA) Ramotswe who goes about her daily life and solves cases in Botswana.There are wonderful passages that cast a different light on Africa - they bring out positive lessons about the continent and its people. I loved passages like this one found on page 55 (Chapter Six - A Dry Place):&quot;Then there was Mr. Mandela. Everybody knew about Mr. Mandela and how he had forgiven those who had imprisoned him. They had taken away years and years of his life simply because he wanted justice. They had set him to work in a quarry and his eyes had been permanently damaged by the rock dust. But at last, when he had walked out of the prison on that breathless, luminous day, he had said nothing about revenge or even retribution. He had said that there were more important things to do than to complain about the past, and in time he had shown that he meant this by hundreds of acts of kindness towards those who had treated him so badly. That was the real African way, the tradition that was closest to the heart of Africa. We are all children of Africa, and none of us is better or more important than the other. This is what Africa could say to the world: it could remind it what it is to be human.&quot;I'm tickled by some of the story details, such as the names of the businesses in the book -- Mothobani Bookkeeping Services: Tell the Taxman to Go Away; Make Me Beautiful Salon; Honest Deal Butchery; Judgment-day Jewellers. Of course, let's not forget The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency! Love those names.TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE is full of special narrative touches that are unexpected, humorous, serious, enlightening, mysterious and moving like &quot;The Boy with an African Heart,&quot; a missing American boy. The solutions to some of the problems are fitting.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"More stories of light mystery, wisdom, and the amazing land of Botswana.

For the uninitiated, Mma Ramotswe is the first female private detective in Botswana. But, to say she's only a private detective is like saying that Father Tim (from the At Home in Mitford series) is just a village preacher.I don't mind that most of the mysteries Mma Ramotswe solves are pretty transparent and not very dangerous. What I love about these stories is the way the author weaves a spell about simple people, living gracious lives, while being kind (for the most part) to one another.At the end of a Mma Ramotswe book, I'm left with a feeling of peace.This is sweet, gentle fiction...set in Africa, but it's universally appealing.I wonder who's going to star in the movie? Whoopi Goldberg comes to mind...or Alfrie Woodard....or Angela Bassett...strong, independent women all....like Precious Ramotswe herself.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Aother charming, lyrical, lovely book from McCall.

In the most challenging one, an American woman whose son went missing ten years before hires Mma Ramotswe to find out what happened to him.There are changes in store for the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency as Mma Ramotswe's secretary is promoted to assistant detective and given her own case.Changes at the agency aren't the only ones. At the end of the first book in this marvelous series, Mma Ramotswe agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Their courtship continues in this second book, and even more significant changes are in store for the happy couple as a result of Rra Matekoni's good deeds at a nearby orphanage.Of course, not everyone is happy that Rra Matekoni plans to marry Mma Ramotswe, and that unhappy person has sinister plans.Another fun book by Alexander McCall Smith, whose writing evokes the cadence of African rhythms and the simple goodness of the Batswana."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the kind of book one reads on an airplane. It's about 240 pages and there's nothing taxing about the plot. There's nothing sad to bring you down. Perhaps there's a joyful reunion to lift your spirits.At the same time one is taught the subtle or profound differences between Botswana and the USA, as well as countries closer to Botswana.Ms. Ramotswe is thoughtful, smart, full of common sense, and an unforgetable character of modern-day fiction. Apart from other detectives who are always unerringly never outsmarted, she is sometimes fooled by an adversary or the subject of her investigations...a purely common happenstance in real life, and she is all the more likeable for it.This is my second read of this series and I will probably read them all as long as the situation is right: a lazy summer afternoon on the porch swing, the aforementioned plane ride, or perhaps during an ill day from work."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm glad to say this is the second in the series and the action follows on \\"The No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.\\" The reason I'm glad to say that is that it means there are three more to come that I have to look forward to. If such were possible, it's an improvement over N1LDA because the separate stories are more closely intertwined. Each mystery presents an ethical dilemma rather than a clue driven puzzle, and each tale has a moral. The primary mystery is about a young American whose mother is trying to find why he disappeared. Several others crop up, and Mma Rambotswe gets engaged to Mr Matekoni, who has been talked into adopting two children.It's written in a very simple moralizing style. I must confess I had qualms about whether Africans were being represented in a condescending way as lovable but childlike, and whether I was being seduced into an idealized sentimental Pollyanna view of Botswana. Janet Malcolm's essay in today's New York Times Book Review has set my mind at rest a little, but even if I can't enjoy these books with a clear conscience I'll still enjoy them."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"You have to read this book just to know the poignant symbolism of the title! I thoroughly enjoyed this book; it was clever in all parts."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;Mma Ramotswe found it difficult to imagine what it would be like to have no people... Many white people were like that, for some unfathomable reason; they did not seem to want to have people and were happy to be just themselves. How lonely they must be...&quot; (p. 180)If you liked the first Precious Ramotswe book and are after more of the same, this book delivers very much that. It has more of a continuous thread running through it as Precious is preoccupied throughout with a single case, the attempt to discover what happened, ten years ago to an idealistic young American son of a World Bank regional manager and his recently widowed wife who now seeks her assistance. It may be tempting to feel a certain mild regret at the introduction of this western dimension into a fictional world which hitherto had been so thoroughgoingly African. But as complaints go, that is about as minor as they come.If there is a bigger quibble, it is this: a good crime story does two things: the mystery and suspense of the investigation should grip us and the characters should engage our interests and sympathies. On the first of these desideratum this book is actually a little weak. It's interesting enough to learn what happened to Michael Curtin but that is not what keeps one turning the pages.What does that is McCall Smith's spectacular success with the second desideratum. The main drama is the developing relationship between Precious, who is imperturbably comfortable with the fact that she is, not fat, but \\"traditionally built\\", and Mr J. L. B. Maketoni, proprietor of Speedy Motors, now her fianc&eacute;, profoundly cautious about the financial commitment of buying an engagement ring but who allows himself to be talked into adopting two children with almost no resistance. Then there is Precious' secretary, Mma Makutsi, who is a little fed up of being a secretary with almost nothing to do and wants to be promoted to assistant detective, and Mr Maketoni's dishonest maid whose position Precious threatens at some risk. It's a compelling and joyful short book about people and the importance of having some of your own."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Popping one of these cassettes into my tape player is like an instant trip to a warm and wonderful land where I am reacquainted with all my old friends. Lecar's reading enhances the gentle rhythm of Smith's prose and helps bring to life these fascinating characters. I am addicted to these stories.In this volume the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency tackles an old murder and a philandering spouse. While hardly unusual issues in the mystery genre. The setting and characters are the real story here. What fun it is to escape into this world if only for a little while. The series reminds me of Lillian Jackson Braun's Cat Who series but without the cats, the endless descriptions of twenty or so town resdents, and the unnecessarily detailed descriptions of the various gourmet foods eaten by the characters.

While in town they encounter Mma Ramotswe.Mma Ramotswe travels to the site of the former collective enterprise. The scheme had not worked out. One cannot grow vegetables on the Kalahari. The Americans have sent rockets to outer space but they still do not understand other people. The boy died but is somehow present Mma Ramotswe intuits.A new client arrives. He distrusts his wife. One must have a working supposition to prove or disprove. It is the suggestion of Mma Ramotswe that her newly appointed asistant detective, promoted from the secretarial position, talk to the maids. It is discovered that there is another man in the picture who is, in fact, the father of the client's son.The plot twists and turns, becoming more interesting on each page. If anything, this is even better than the first book in the series."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Ramotswe is a cool creation.

The conversations between the characters are both naive and highly enjoyable and this is what makes the book tick.I do appreciate the fact that at least very few UK/US writers are moving from their comfort zones and making the detective genre work going with different nationalities and regions. Also, that detective novels from other countries are translated to English and giving it a wider audience.I do think that Indian Market is underestimated/underrated by many due to the anger stemming from India's outsourcing success. This is ridiculous, it is China that is acting the evil Fu Manchu and slowly and surely spreading its poisonous tentacles across the world. China will prove 100 times murderous than Nazis and Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan combined. The fat and abysmally corrupt India will be China's first victim."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Book came quickly and in good shape, as advertised.

It took me a while to catch on to the different kind of writing (the author is Scottish from South Africa?) I liked it very much after I got into it. I really like Mme Precious Ramotswe. I do wish the author would come up with nicknames for people like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. Good story. I'll probably read more."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I now have a problem - I am hooked. After reading the first book of this series I felt I have to keep on going. After reading the second book I will not rest till I read the whole series. I admit that I am now in a better position to pinpoint several flaws which are more apparant in the second book but these have not spoiled my utter enjoyment. This is a quick read which gives you a feeling that you are not only enjoying yourself but also learning something at the same time. At least this is how I felt.In the second book the main focus is still Mma Ramotswe, but a very central part is given to her fiancee, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (and rightly so). Maybe it is easier for the writer to enter into the mind of a man, or maybe he just really likes this guy, as the reader does. He is a kind man, and as one he is easily \\"forced\\" into a new responsibility: adopting two kids, one of them in a wheelchair. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni fears the reaction of our heroine, but she surprises him (Mma Ramotswe reaction seemed a little \\"too good to be true\\" for this reader but things have a nice way of \\"arranging themselves\\" in this book).Mma Ramotswe continues solving mysteries with the help of her loyal secretary, Mma Makutsi, now promoted into the position of Assistant Detective. However, as in the first book I felt the mysteries were not the real essence. The book is really a love song for Africa and the African people (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni for example, wants to give Mma Ramotswe a diamond from the Botswana earth). In this book the writer continues to share with the readers (ignorant in my case) some of the African traditions, way of life, and especially their way of thought.My slight criticism is of the very easy way in which mysteries are solved. Somehow, Mma Ramotswe happens to meet the right people, to get what she wants out of them or to have the right \\"feelings\\". I confess, I do believe in intuition and especially woman intuition, but it seems that this feeling is a little over used here. Mma Ramotswe is surprised that not all people know, like she does, when someone is lying; this is very clear for her. Another issue is the very easy acceptance of feminism and modern ways in spite of a very central theme in the series of preserving the African ways and traditions, be it with Mma Ramotswe \\"traditionally built\\" body or with her thoughts how children act disrespectfully nowadays. I cannot understand how this is settled with the acceptance (even in thought) that there might be a girl mechanic (coping on a wheelchair) running the garage, aas much as I would like it to happen.A great book. Am looking forward for the third."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" by Alexander McCall Smith, Precious Ramotswe has firmly established herself as a detective in Botswana. Although she is not wealthy, she lives comfortably and she derives enormous satisfaction from her work. To add to her happiness, she has accepted the marriage proposal of Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni.In this installment of McCall's popular series, Mma Ramotswe investigates the disappearance of a young American man ten years earlier and she looks into the activities of an unfaithful wife. Both cases are complex and, unlike most detectives, Mma Ramotswe gets personally involved in her client's lives. She even embroiders the truth to protect the innocent. This is a huge step for Mma Ramotswe, since she values the truth above all else. However, she decides to take on the role of a compassionate social worker in addition to her detective duties.\\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" retains the charm and colorful ambiance of the first installment in this captivating series and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe is back in great form in this excellent sequel to \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\". The demand for her services are growing. This time around, she's trying to locate a young American man missing in Botswana for ten years, nobody knows if he's still alive; dealing with the expansion of her household by the acquistion of two foster children her fiance, Mr. JLB Matekoni, was tripped into taking before he knew which end was up; investigating the evil machinations of Mr. JLB's housekeeper, and giving her secretary, Mma Makutsi, a well-deserved promotion to assistant detective.As in the first book, Mma Ramotswe shares star billing with Africa itself, and in her we see the values that mean so much in this vibrant, diverse continent: the attachment to the land, the all-important love of family and neighborhood, the ethic of sharing one's good fortune with those less fortunate, and the homespun common-sense that motivates her daily activities. She's not so much about solving crimes as she is about maintaining the harmony of an orderly existence. For this reason, I don't consider this book or its predecessor as \\"crime novels\\". Alexander McCall Smith isn't a crime writer; he's much more interested in Mma Ramotswe as a personality, and once again he's given us a quintessentially African protagonist in a quintessentially African book."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love the reading of these audiobooks.

The books hold your interest from the beginning, and are over much too quickly. Smith uses an extremely simple writing style, almost childlike, which is why the books move so swiftly. But don't let the simplicity fool you; there's a LOT of meat on those bones, pun unintended. Each story, each nuance and thought is a commentary on people and peoples' behavior in general. The whole cast of regulars -- Precious, Mr. JLB, her new assistant, etc, are engaging people. This is just super stuff."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I absolutely love all three of the books that A.M. Smith has written about the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency! Precious Romatswe is an incredibly brilliant character. Her high sense of morality and respect for others (demonstrated by her following in the \\"old Botswana ways\\") is a breath of fresh air. I also love how comfortable she is with herself, being a woman of \\"traditional build\\". It is so nice to have a book about a large, successful, bright woman. The fact that several cases are solved within each book is a bonus. The cases are not the main part of the book, but only small part of the whole experience. Precious Romatswe and the unfolding of her life hands her is what takes center stage. The descriptions of Botswana make you feel that you are there, and make you long to actually see it. It makes you want to take more notice of your own surroundings. I recommend all three of the books from the Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency to everyone, and cannot wait until the end of April for book number 4!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to discover the Precious Ramotswe stories - of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency - they are gorgeous. Precious like their owner, gently funny, beautifully polite and full of lovely moments.Precious is engaged to Ra J B L Matkekoni, owner of the Speedy car repair service and himself a gentle man. I love the intertwiing of the stories in this. There is the problem of the American woman who lost her son 10 years ago. She knows he is not alive anymore, she simply wants to know what has happened. Then there is the problem of the local butcher who wants to know if his wife is cheating on him with another man. Unknown to Precious she has caused another problem, that of Ra J B L Matekoni's maid. She resents Precious coming into his life and now making her life very difficult. A fiance for Ra J B L Matekoni will spell the end for her life of relaxation. She will have to clean the house, she will not be able to entertain male friends. There are complications she does not wish to deal with. She wants Precious to go away and is prepared to do something about it.These stories are very much about character development and plot. The problems which Precious has been hired for are generally small and not life threatening. The language is beautifully formal in the style you can imagine they speak, and the overall impression is of intimacy - these are concerns which I can relate to they aren't murder and international spy rings. They are small concerns involved mostly in every day life.There are some classic touches in this - the resolution of the butchers problem is classically beautiful, as in the undercover observation of the straying woman.This is beautifully written, it absolutely sings.

Yet, after reading the McCall Smith books, it seems that life there is pretty much the same as here, with the exception of the people being more polite.Quick to read. Easy to read. Fun.

He seemingly just mysteriously went \\"missing\\" one day from the agricultural commune where he lived and worked and no one who knew him had any idea where he had gone. They conjectured that maybe wild anmials had dragged him away or that a whirlwind picked him up, but not one person could say for sure. Mma Ramotswe works partly by feeling and intuition and she feels she may be able to discover what occurred all those many years ago just by travelling to the spot and gathering the vibes of the spirits that may still be there. In any event, Mma Ramotswe wants to help the American woman gain some (I really hate this word) closure. Mma Ramotswe has also lost a child and understands the deep heartache such a loss brings.Interspersed within this story of her detective work is the fact of her romance with kindly gentleman Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and her acceptance of his marriage proposal. Upon her acceptance of this proposal and diamond engagement ring, she doesn't realize that she sets in motion a plan by his maid to do away with her, the woman the maid views as detrimental to her own plans to dominate Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his household.Mma Ramotswe also promotes her trusted secretary to the position of Assistant Detective (while still maintaining her duties as secretary) and she begins to shine as an investigator in her own right. Soon she saves the day for her first client.Add into all of this the fact that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is coerced into agreeing to adopt two orphans before their wedding without telling Precious and you will find that you will love the characters in this book and anxiously await reading the next one."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" is the second novel in Alexander McCall Smith's absolutely delightful \\"Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency\\" series. Although the primary setting is Gaborone, Botswana, the author take the reader along with Private Eye Precious Ramotswe when she travels throughout her beautiful, but desolate native countryside. Mma. Ramotswe, our plus-sized protagonist, who possesses an overabundance of intelligence, intuition, cleverness and a wonderful sense of humor, is presently busy juggling her personal life with her ever increasing success as a detective.She is now officially engaged to local master mechanic Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the most gentlemanly of men. While Mma. Ramotswe presides over her detective agency, and is, in fact, the only female private detective in all Botswana, Mr. Matekoni has entrepreneurial expertise as well. He owns Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. An honest, loving man with an extremely kind heart, he recently went to fix a water pump at a local orphanage, free of charge, and left with two children in tow.Now Mma. Ramotswe has her hands full planning a new life with her fiance and newly found family, dealing with the nasty housekeeper, and building a relationship with her foster children. She also strikes a blow for feminism when she promotes her secretary to Assistant Detective and gives her a case to solve. Then Mrs. Curtain, an American whose son disappeared in the Kalahari desert, enters the picture when she passes through the doors of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency. Michael Curtain had been living and working on a commune, experimenting with systems for growing vegetables in the harsh conditions of the Botswana desert. One night, ten years before, he vanished without a trace. His mother has been searching for him ever since, exhausting every available avenue. The American Embassy recommends Mma. Ramotswe's services, as a last resort. Word does get around! Although the \\"cold case\\" does not look promising, our lady detective takes the job. I think she empathizes with the woman's pain and sense of loss, as she once lost a child of her own.Mma. Ramotswes spirit is luminescent. Ultimately, she is a good woman, a really decent person with a kind heart. She loves her fellow man, but most of all, and most inspiring, is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"Author Alexander McCall Smith's narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style.

To do that would limit the scope of the book. Beyond the mystery or mysteries to be solved, this time revolving around an American woman searching for her long lost son, there is much political and social commentary which can be both humorous and touching depending on the circumstances. Told with a simple, direct style, Precious Ramotswe becomes even more endearing in this book, and her supporting cast of characters like her fiance Mr J.L.B.

Truly a don't miss!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I really am enjoying this series so far. The stories are very simple while at the same time they read as monumentally as end of the world thrillers. It's a real achievement to tell such quiet tales while pulling the reader in and keeping them at the edge of ones seat.Perhaps the best thing about these #1 Ladies Detective Agency books is plainly how it allows for an outsider, an American, to see Africa through the eyes of one who knows and loves their land. I realized while I was reading these books so far that I have never really thought of Africa in any other light than The Gods Must Be Crazy/Colonial superiority mindset, or through the lens of the evening news. I have long thought that Africa is a never-ending series of disasters akin to one of the levels of hell. Reading such a relentlessly positive and upbeat take on Botswana will surely help change ones opinions of Africa if you have not been there like myself.At the same time, I have to judge this story on its merits if I am going to be fair with my review. If I were to set this tale in the States for instance, would it be as engaging? I don't think so. I would give the mysteries and stories with in this book only a couple of stars. The originality of the writing and the unique mystery protagonist along with the setting and place on the other hand deserve five stars. So head into this book not expecting Agatha Christy. Instead think of it as if you were reading \`A Year in Provance' and that this other travelogue book were laced with an amusing mystery or two.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Tears of the Giraffe is the second book in the No.1 Ladies Detective agency series. Once again, Precious Ramotswe is back solving crimes along with her newly-promoted secretary. As in the first book, the descriptions of life in Botswana, Africa are wonderful. Africa is more like one of the characters than just the location of the series. The writing is so lyrical that I've been tempted on more than one occasion to pack up and move to Botswana myself. A beautifully written book, and I'm looking forward to reading the third installment in this series."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith is one of the most delightful and charming mystery series ever written. In Tears of the Giraffe, McCall Smith begins where he left off with book number one, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.Precious Ramotswe is engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni , and it is amusing to see them wade through the minefield of a couple preparing for marriage. The must choose a ring, decide how to combine households, and deal with a jealous and recalcitrant maid. Two foster children appear on the scene to make things even more interesting.Mma Ramotswe is the only female detective in Botswana, and she opened her agency to make a living and provide assistance to her fellow Africans. Precious is not necessarily well educated, but she has an abundance of common sense, logic and intuition. She can sense where a long dead person is buried nearby, and can tell when a person is lying just by looking at them. It is fun to watch the self-deprecating Precious match wits with a Duke-educated college professor-and win. When Precious is stumped, she relies on her \\"bible,\\" The Principles of Private Detection by Clovis Andersen. The cases she takes on are not much different from those of an American detective, including infidelity, missing persons, etc. But sometimes, solving the moral dilemmas presented by these cases is more difficult than solving the cases themselves.Tears of the Giraffe is also a book about love. There is not just the love between Precious and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, but also their love for their fellow Africans and Botswana. While written in modern times, it is fascinating to read about life in Botswana, and how Botswana differs from her African neighbors.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is not your typical mystery series, and Tears of the Giraffe is simply enchanting. I have already started book number 3, Morality for Beautiful Girls."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In Tears of the Giraffe, Mma Romatske has a new mystery to solve.

I'm hooked."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In Alexander McCall Smith's second book in the series of the exploits of Mma Ramotswe the only &quot;Lady Detective&quot; in Botswana, he again delights us with Mma R's simple but elegant solutions to her detective work. Each of her adventures are well illustrated and wonderfully narrated. And yet, Smith gives us more in this book than in his first with respect to the cultural elements of Botswanian society.He clearly points out the traditional Botswanian approach to life versus the modern day approach. The loss of certain values within the society are elucidated. And the reaction of those who still hold to more traditional values is described.And yet, once again, Smith paints a truly wonderful and revealing picture of a proud country, that sees itself on the leading edge of Democracy in the African continent.

I enjoy them -- they're clever and sweet. But they're not too exciting, and at parts a little slow. I'd like to see heavier plotting in terms of the mysteries -- they're almost a sidebar to the story, rather than the main focus. One thing I really appreciate is the author's insight into human nature -- Mma Rotsawe is sort of an African Miss Marple.

L. B. Matekoni, will live (whose house is better)? whether or not she should promote her stalwart secretary to Junior Detective, whether she should get a diamond engagement ring, and most of all, what happened to a young American college man missing for 10 years, whose distraught mother has come to beg Ramotswe's services.This book is no less than perfection.

The only biographical flashbacks reference the honored Memory of her long-deceased father; thus the sequence of events is easier to follow and the plot reduced to a brief time span. Her fianc&eacute;'s movements are chronicled in greater detail, as readers' attention shifts between the engaged protagonists. Maketoni reveals both his love for her and his genuine compassion for those in need--while secretly longing to train a competent and eager successor for his automotive repair shop.Although the couple is not married by the conclusion of the book, there is plenty of activity to capture the reader's interest. An ambitious secretary seeks to advance to assistant detective; a vicious maid learns the harsh lessons of betrayal; a womanizer is drastically reduced in his self-esteem. Then too, various moral and ethical dilemmas are raised by the conscientious women of this All-female detective agency, as theywrestle with their obligations to the Client versus those to the Law. As in the debut novel there is also an underlying mystery, which increases literary tension throughout the chapters dealing with both the engagement and other cases.A grieving mother begs for justice or failing that--information to put closure on her son's death. Emancipated Botswana--a region remote to most Americans--is depicted with compassionate respect and optimism by an author who grew up appreciating this continent and its struggle to emerge as a modern nation, while retaining traditional values. The book's unique title is explained at the very end: How much can a giraffe--or a human being for that matter--truly give? Smith's African characters give their all to the delight of readers the world over, revealing the universality of the human condition."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This wonderful book takes the promise of the first in this series and turns it into a fully realized novel.

Gentle humor, kindness, unique culture, truly good and decent values, yet human mistakes... this book has everything required for a wonderful read.

After reading it and becoming intrigued with Precious Ramotswe and her life in Botswana, I was eager to read the next book and find out what happened to this clever lady detective. Tears of the Giraffe was equally enjoyable, and I found myself chuckling aloud at some of the situations described by Smith. For instance, the scene in which Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is caught \\"red handed\\" as he and the children are finishing a photo session is amusing. So is the image of the unscrupulous maid getting her just desserts.The author brings in some serious situations as well, and the reader will find her (or his) heart involved with the American woman in search of her son. Then there's the moral dilemma of the butcher and his fashionable wife and child. Precious and her secretary-turned-detective shrewdly solve these and other cases, and the developing love story between Precious and J.L.B. adds a delightful side story.."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was the first book in this series that I have read.

Then there is the problem of the local butcher who wants to know if his wife is cheating on him with another man. Unknown to Precious she has caused another problem, that of Ra J B L Matekoni's maid. She resents Precious coming into his life and now making her life very difficult. A fiance for Ra J B L Matekoni will spell the end for her life of relaxation. She will have to clean the house, she will not be able to entertain male friends. There are complications she does not wish to deal with. She wants Precious to go away and is prepared to do something about it.These stories are very much about character development and plot. The problems which Precious has been hired for are generally small and not life threatening. The language is beautifully formal in the style you can imagine they speak, and the overall impression is of intimacy - these are concerns which I can relate to they aren't murder and international spy rings. They are small concerns involved mostly in every day life.There are some classic touches in this - the resolution of the butchers problem is classically beautiful, as in the undercover observation of the straying woman.This is beautifully written, it absolutely sings. I have fallen in love! Totally in love with this series!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Another great book in the series.

BETTER THAN EXPECTED"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Once again McCall Smith has demonstrated his compassion and love of Africa and its people, with Precious Ramotswe solving the disappearance of an American man in the Kalahari desert, amongst other problems both at work and in her personal life. Smith manages to convey the simplicity and complexity of Africa in this delightful novel. And for those readers who are interested to read more about this fascinating continent, once they have finished all these Botswana novels, I recommend A TELLING TIME, by Glynnis Hayward, which tells a gripping tale set in South Africa that will have them turning the pages."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A real yawner! It didn't help that the characters names were too difficult to remember."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Two people review:Hers - This is my first McCall Smith book, and I have hurriedly gone out and bought the other two of the series focusing on The Number 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The reason is simple: this was a wonderful book! It is entertaining, charming, enlightnening. It taught me lots about customs and manners of Botswana. It described the climate, the flora, the preoccupations of common, regular people. And it reminded me of the universality of human experiences. All of this with a good sense of humor. I don't remember another book in the recent past that delighted me to the extent of a perpetual smile while in the process of reading. Five stars and fireworks!His--This reminded me forcibly of Tony Hillerman's gentle detective stories, in which his hero has to negotiate between local and ancient customs and the newer and more aggressive manners of the prevailing society in the US. The formal narrative voice and the formal manner of treating persons both announce that the human creature is to be honored and revered, even if he is slightly disreputable. The emphasis upon morality and ethics in the detective trade is refreshing for those jaded by the commercially driven culture which reveres the bottom line. The entire novel, with its apparently naive point of view about those norms taken for granted in the Northern hemisphere, seems refreshing in its innocence and its enduring wisdom. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Three cheers for Alexander McCall Smith! For he has written a gentle humorous book that brings us face-to-face with the dignity, strength and courage of the Botswanan people--- and by extension the human race. But never fear, dear cynics, Smith loves Botswana, but it IS love, not infatuation. The Botswana of TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, while peopled with exemplary individuals, is plagued by the usual human amalgam of crime, poverty, disease and injustice.In TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, the second, I believe, of the series, we become further acquainted with Mma Precious Ramotswe, the owner of a detective agency in Gabarone, Botswana. The reader follows her through the ups and downs and conundrums of her personal and professional life. A missing child, a grieving mother, a young employee, a dishonest maid, a beloved fiancee and two orphaned children are some of the key characters in this African tale. I very heartily recommend this book to those readers who like a gentle mystery. Read it and Botswana will become more than a place on a map. Read it and you will smile."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Here is the second in Smith's acclaimed new series about the only female private investigator in Botswana. Although more episodic than his debut volume, it maintains the latter's quality with its lyrical style, careful pace, and rich evocation of culture, country, and characters. (I am inevitably reminded of my all-time favorite detective writer, Dell Shannon, who invariably kept one major-case thread running throughout each book while cleaning up assorted smaller ones--sometimes humorous, sometimes grave-- along the way.)We find Precious Ramotswe newly engaged to her longtime friend, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and in the process of promoting to assistant detective her loyal secretary Mma Makutsi. The emphasis is more on the couple's domestic affairs--the search for an engagement ring, the decision as to which house they will live in, and Mr. Matekoni's thoroughly unexpected acquisition (his bachelorhood notwithstanding) of two foster children--than on casework, but there is still a wife's faithlessness to expose, the fate of a long-missing young American to determine, and Mr. Matekoni's vindictively jealous housemaid to deal with.Like Shannon, Smith skillfully blends the humanizing details of his characters' private lives with the work they do, and although the New York Times called Mma Ramotswe &quot;the Miss Marple of Africa,&quot; to me she seems more like Mrs. Pollifax (another old favorite). At least two further titles are in the wings. If they're as good as this one, they'll be well worth the reader's time."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Last week I finished reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and just last night I finished reading the next one, Tears of the Giraffe.I am so tickled to have discovered another author whose work I just love. My entire family is now reading these books by Alexander McCall Smith and everyone is loving them.It isn't often you come on a book quite so fun, so interesting, so well constructed, or one that really moves you. These books are doing it to me, in spades. Tears of the Giraffe follows the lady detective, Precious, and it expands, introducing more characters, all ones that feel real, ones that are easy to care about. These books take place in Africa, in Botswana, a place that this author is putting on the map. I write too...and I am always looking for authors who can write books that are fun to read, books where I have to keep turning pages, but especially books with characters that I give a damn about. Tears of the Giraffe has it all but I would recommend that you start with the first one, No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and take it from there. Best bunch of new novels for the Summer of 2003!"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After reading Alexander McCall Smith's first book in this series &quot;The #1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; I felt I had to read the following books as well because they are so enjoyable.&quot;The Tears of the Giraffe&quot; reads almost like a fable allowing us to determine whether or not lying for good or bad reasons can be wrong. It is an interesting delimma. I absolutely enjoy the way that Smith writes his characers. Precious Ramotswe, her secretary/assistant Mma Makutsi and her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni are immediately likable and often shyly funny in the way that they interact with one another. This book brings two orphan children into Mma Ramotswe's life and leaves a door open for the next installment.The ending of the book is left with a wonderful fable-like suggestion about baskets being woven from the tears of a giraffe because that is all they have to give us. We can all give something no matter how small or insignificant it may seem and Alexander McCall Smith has given us a true treasure here."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What a superb story McCall Smith tells in Tears of the Giraffe, and how beautifully he tells it. His No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is fast becoming one of my favorites. Simply told, gently written, and charming in its descriptions of the people and places in the Botswana of Precious Ramotswe, makes McCall Smith's approach to storytelling unique and refreshing.Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only woman detective, and owner of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. However, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni's maid, Florence Peko, is not at all happy with the news and conjures up some plans of her own for Mma Ramotswe. The main plot surrounds Mma Ramotswe's search for the son of an American woman who had been missing for ten years. The woman, Andrea Curtin, does not expect her son to be alive, but she does want to know what happened to him. Mrs (no period) Curtin's husband is now dead, and all previous efforts to find her son have failed, so she pays a visit to the agency. Add to that the troubles of Mr Letsenyane Badule who wants to know if his wife is having an affair, and we have the thrust of the book. Then there are the orphans, two of whom become very important in the lives of Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Its simple, straight-forward language, and its portrayal of the qualities of the Batswana (refers to the people), kept me enthralled. I was particularly struck by the fact that Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni were always referred to by this formal reference. More familiar forenames were never used. My only concern in reading this book was whether or not I was pronouncing names and places correctly-places like the Makadikadi Salt Pans, the town of Molepolole, and the names Tlokweng, Letsenyane and Sonqkwena, to name a few. If you read it, you will love it.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The title, we learn on the last page, refers to doing what one can, for giving whatever one is able, to help the larger world. Giraffes in the Kalahari can offer only their tears. Our betrothed hero and heroine, the stalwart Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni and the shrewd Mma Precious Ramotswe expand their hearts-and in turn ours-when they adopt two orphans. Nothing turns out exactly as expected, either in this series or in life. And that's not necessarily a letdown. I absolutely loved this book! It made me laugh and cry. Beautifully, lovingly conceived and crafted. Unmistakably, the Scottish author found (or found again) his own heart in Africa."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE the wonderful sequel to THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY, Mma Ramotswe, the strong, feisty, proud but compassionate lady detective (the only in Botswana, maybe Africa) faces new challenges both in her life and in her work. Upon her engagement to the kind, reliable mechanic, Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, she ponders a possible move, negotiates the purchase of her engagement ring (diamond, of course!) and suddenly finds herself a new mother of two children. She is also called upon by an American mother to resolve the mystery of her son, who disappeared in the desolate Kalahari Plains many years ago, and track the modern, 'wayward' wife of a honest butcher.Like its predecessor, this book is not your typical \\"who dun it\\" detective story- in fact, the detective element figures in this story even less than in the first novel. Mma Ramotswe only solves two cases- actually, she solves only one, as the other is solved by her able, newly promoted Assistant, Mma Makutsi. Rather, the novel focuses on developing solid characters (apart from Mma Ramotswe, we get much more insight in this novel into the characters of Mr. J.L.B Matekoni and Mma Makutsi) and highlights life in Botswana and the views of its proud people.Unlike its predecessor, this book has more of a focus on ex-pats and development workers, which I found interesting as an ex-pat development worker in Africa. Mma Ramotswe comments that Ex-pats often do not have good manners (ie, would shake with one hand, leaving the other hand free for 'mischievous activities') and do not understand simple, obvious issues such as the fact that the dead are always with us. Ex-pat development workers, although well-meaning, are always coming up with bizarre, idealistic theories and schemes. They are always giving advice, always trying 'to change the world.' But, as Mma Ramotswe says, vegetables just were not meant to be grown in the Kalahari desert! Furthermore, \\"Africa needs its own solutions.\\"This novel also focuses on moral issues: Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B Matekoni both lament the loss of 'the Old Botswana morality' which promotes hard work and a respect for elders. Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi struggle with moral questions such as, does the end justify the means? Ie, is it okay to lie, manipulate and blackmail to get a desired, even just, result? The novel ends on a beautiful note, suggesting that in order to heal after loss, compassion, understanding and reconciliation maybe more important than strict justice."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mr. Smith does it again! And this time round its better than the first book in the famous Botswana private eye Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. Set in Botswana, Africa, Mr. Smith weaves a simple yet extraordinary tale of simplicity, love, roots and a dash of mystery.The essence of Africa is beautifully captured in a simple 227-page read that ends even before you've begun to savor Africa's aromas and tastes. After reading the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe, I've had the yearning to drink the bush tea that is spoken about constantly in the book. I might want to add that you must read its predecessor before tears of the giraffe - as both the books are interlinked and entwined as the river is to the sea.Something about the plot now: We are treated to various mystery cases in the course of this book. An American mother wants to know what happened to her teenage son in the Kalahari Desert and why did he disappear from the face of this planet. A butcher wants information on his wife and her on goings with another man. There are more tales that give this book its beauty of language and the craft of writing.Mr. Smith takes us on a roller-coaster ride through Africa - its people, their beliefs, the simple life they still lead mingled with technology and new-found ideologies. Africa - in the heart of the world is an unusual place - full of brightness and brotherhood.We are introduced to Mma Makutsi (Mma Ramotswe's secretary) in a new avatar of a junior detective and her first case. We are further lead to Mr. Maketoni - the fianc&eacute; of Mma Ramotswe and the problem of the orphaned children he has to take care of. Will Mma Ramotswe take the children in? Will the American mother find her child? Read this awesome book to find out..."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If &quot;brevity is the soul of wit&quot;, then McCall Smith has a huge soul and endless wit. In this second volume of Botswana intrigue, he carries forward the characters established in &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot;. Mma Ramotswe maintains her role as &quot;traditional&quot; Botswana lady in both girth and personality. Her fiance, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, however, gains in stature, revealed as a man of small confusions and immense strengths. A few worthy [and unworthy] supporters flesh out the cast. Overall looms the figure of an American mother seeking Mma Ramotswe's aid in tracking down her lost son. A decade of searching revealed nothing. Can she actually succeed where so many others have failed? And in so few pages?With a marriage offer given and accepted, Mma Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni enter a new level in their relationship. Both have houses and businesses. Will there be a clash over priorities? Both have domestic and business staff. How will those people be dealt with? Finally, distant and faintly present, is the question marriage inevitably raises - what about a family? McCall Smith deals with all these issues as he follows the interacting threads of the lives of the lady detective and gentle-hearted mechanic.Through it all radiates the presence of African traditions. How to greet people. How to offer and accept gifts. How to present solutions to a client's problems when none of the options avoid hurting someone else? When isn't it a sin to lie or even blackmail a person? These aren't simple questions at the best of times and in the society of Botswana, they loom as an ever-present reality. Clearly, McCall Smith is intimately familiar with these and other aspects of African life. Yet, while his characters live in a different world, their problems and approach to life are hardly alien. Still, there is a reason for a giraffe's tears - a reason we all need to learn.

First of all, it tells believable stories about everyday people, a land, and the foibles of humanity. It does that very well, but then a lot of books do that. There was something else. When I started reading the books there was something different that it took me awhile to figure out. Then I did figure it out. I noticed when I finished reading a chapter or two, in either one of the books (both the first in the series and then this one), I felt good. I felt calmly energized, optimistic, and hopeful about life.How many writers can do that? This is a book that makes the ordinary extraordinary.

In addition, there are beautiful descriptions of Botswana, and Africa in general, making the reader feel and \\"see\\" the settings, and appreciate the beauty of the place as the characters do. They do not want to live in America or elsewhere--they are proud of being African, and Botswanan in particular. In a simple yet poignant way, I felt humbled as an American who subconciously senses somehow that America is the center of the universe. These are such charming reads, and I am finishing my eighth in the series, and awaiting the ninth!

The respect Mma Ramotswe finds in her interchange with an American woman searching for her long disappeared son, something as simple yet significant as a properly supported handshake, convinces her of the sincerity of the mother's quest. And, roundabout, for that is the way of Mma, she faces the other complications of her life, including becoming engaged to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. Through the disheartening experience she has with the belligerant and deceitful maid of Matekoni and her surprising discovery that he has adopted two children, one of whom is handicapped, without even discussing the matter, Mma faces her personal challenges while quietly pursuing the leads that finally bring her to a solution.The characters in this second in the series of Precious Ramotswe novels are the key to enjoyment. The corruptness that she encounters is wisely handled by a traditional African woman of not too many years. Her interaction with her future husband and his new children, an acceptance and even joy, let the reader understand that she and he have a lot to share and are comfortable in doing so. (Even though her need for a diamond ring surprised me, she still demonstrated great good sense in the final choice, a ring with a diamond from African soil.) Their ability to live life to its gentle fullness, in a traditional Botswanan way, brings forth chuckles and smiles and an good-all-over feeling upon completing another book.

Smith hands us some quirky and charming company in an exotic location, although the place is hardly romanticised. I thought he may have pushed the feel-good thing a bit too far with the positively saintly Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni and the near perfect orphan/daughter, but somehow he got away with it - c'mon, why not let your readers enjoy a happy ending now and then. I haven't spent any time in Africa to know, but the settings and disarmingly (to Westerners) open dialogue felt authentic. Despite some ugly content in a continent that's suffered more than its share of poverty, disease and brutality, the book still manages to be gentle and affectionate. This is part of its apologetic purpose: if you think AIDS and corruption is all there is to Africa, think again.In terms of solving a crime, Mma Ramotswe leans more on her virtually supernatural empathetic skills rather than brilliant deduction or wild car chases: she can tell by glancing at a ten year old newspaper clipping who must be guilty by the look in his eyes, and just needs to talk to a suspect to instantly know whether or not he's lying. But the pace of the investigation, with enjoyable diversions along the way, is well measured, and strikes a nice balance with the greater strength of the character's personal lives and interactions.A nice way to spend an hour or two."},{"Title":"Tears of the Giraffe: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Great reading.

Western historian David lavender never hides his sympathy in this powerful chronicle of Chief Joseph's &quot;flight toward freedom&quot; in 1877 to avoid reservation life. This is a really sad story filled with overlooked possibilities for compromise, understanding, and tolerance. Lavender considers the Nex Perce War the final betrayal of a long and once-promising relationship between white explorers, fur trappers, Christian missionairies, and the tribe. Chief Old Joseph, father of the more famous Chief Joseph, even converted to Christianity for both spiritual and practical reasons. Peaceful coexistence and friendship with the new settlers was his policy. Greed, cultural intolerance, and racial hatred eventually doomed those possibilities for Nez Perce. Although Chief Joseph developed a reputation as an Indian Napeleon for his brilliant fighting tactics, Lavender emphasizes that Chief Joseph continually sought to avoid war. Chief Joseph's simple hope was to have a reservation that would allow his people to live in their traditional land and stay close to his father's grave in Wallowa Valley, Oregon. The United States military commanders of that time, however, demanded the tribe move. This compelling account of the Nez Perce's failed 1700 mile exodus to join Sitting Bull in Canada captures the cruelty, mindlessness, and viciousness of 19th century America's expansionist policies. Chief Joseph's eloquent words, especially when surrending after a blizzard just a few miles south of the Canadian border, accents the pain and injustice."},{"Title":"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy","review":"I am a huge David Lavender fan and when I found this work on Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe I was quite interested to read it. Lavender's works are noted for their rich attention to detail, pithiness and eloquence. But pithy this work is not.What sets the Nez Perce apart in Western history is their amazing war with the US Army, over 1,700 miles of mountain terrain, where they defeated the Army's efforts at every turn until their final capture 40 miles south of the Canadian border. Initially ordered to report to a reservation, this was an extraordinary bid for freedom. Their war is one of those David and Goliath, against-all-odds stories that all Americans love where the underdog not only beats his antagonist but whips him mercilessly. Without this event, the Nez Perce would have been a small, non-descript mountain tribe, barely a footnote in US history, quietly eliminated by Manifest Destiny and local settler avarice. It is this, their amazing flight for freedom, which everyone wants to know about and that everyone identifies with. It is this, their amazing strength of character, which everyone understands when we hear the words Nez Pierce.For the author then to spend 250 pages of a 349 page book on the 70 years of tribal history that preceded this event is quite disappointing. Tribal history, no matter how engaging, is not why people buy this book. We buy this book to learn more about the actions of a truly admirable people who refused to go quietly into banishment for the outrageous crime of simply being Native American.Unless you are looking for the complete history of the Nez Perce interface with migrating Americans, you may find yourself frustrated with this work. The author simply takes too long, 70% of the book, to get to the point, the significant backbone of Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce people. But if you do stick with it you will get to know a most remarkable man and a fine, indigenous American people who will earn your deep and abiding respect."},{"Title":"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy","review":"First off, contrary to earlier reviewers, this book has NOTHING to do with the Lewis and Clark expedition. Out of the 350 pages in the book, they might be mentioned a half dozen times and one might want to get Lavender's &quot;The Way to the Western Sea,&quot; if interested on Meriweather and William's trip.Instead, &quot;Let me Be Free,&quot; is on the Nez Perce tribe which lived in Oregon's Wallowa Valley until it was forced from the land in the 1860's. This is a great book if the reader is interested in a century's worth of history about the tribe but I'd suggest something else if the intent on reading this is solely learning about Chief Joseph's tragic flight from the US military in 1877.I originally got into Lavender's works after reading his fantastic book, &quot;Bents' Fort&quot; which is about the trading family of William Bent in SE Colorado. I had no interest in the subject but was recommended the book and I fell fully immersed into it because of Lavender's detailed writing-style and ability to create real identities to the historical characters instead of just giving names and dates. He has the same writing style in &quot;Let Me Be Free,&quot; and will never shy from a unimportant but lighthearted side story. The writing is anything but dry.The first half of LMBF is on how the tribe lived and existed, its neighbors, and its relations with the first whites to reach Oregon. Lavender has a contentious understanding of the western Native American tribes and writes in a fair and unbiased reader-friendly style and includes the correct names and terms the Nez Perce (Nimipu) used.The last 100 pages cover Chief Joseph's (Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kehht's) flight and includes a fantastic map in the front for the reader to follow the tribe along on its failed march to freedom.The book fails to get five stars from me because I was most interested in the Nez Perce march and it just took too long to finally reach that subject in the book. It reminded me of &quot;Undaunted Courage,&quot; (Ambrose's book on Meriweather Lewis) where there is no much buildup to the expedition that once the reader finally reaches it in the book, it falls a bit flat. However, if anyone is interested on the Nez Perce tribe itself, you won't find a better book. Any Western Oregon historians would also immensely enjoy this work."},{"Title":"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy","review":"At the outset let me state that if you are looking to learn about the Nez Perce or Nimi'ipuu (the currently official tribal spelling was previously spelled Nee-Me-Poo, while Lavender used Nimipu in \\"Let Me Be Free\\") you are much better off reading other older, more reliable and valid books. If you can obtain a copy of \\"The Nez Perce Indians\\" (Garland Publishing Co.: 1974), a compilation of documents about the Nez Perce submitted to the Indian Claims Commission, is one of the most authoritative books on the Nez Perce available. While \\"Noon-Nee-Me-Poo\\" (1973) written by Alan Slickpoo Sr. (a tribal member/historian) and published by the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho, is, in my opinion the best place to start, it is fairly difficult to acquire. Hence, I would strongly recommend Alvin M. Josephy Jr.'s \\"The Nez Perce Indians and the Opening of the Northwest\\" (1965; 1997), which is currently available through Amazon. Lucullus Virgil Mcwhorter's \\"Yellow Wolf - His Own Story\\" (1930; 2007), also available from Amazon, is less rigorous than Josephy's book, but is an outstanding, highly readable biographical account. Lastly, also available from Amazon, there is the more \\"romantic,\\" less reliable historical (fictionalized) novel \\"From Where the Sun Now Stands\\" (1962; 2000) by Will Henry (pen name for Henry Wilson Allen) that is very easy to read, far more interesting than this book, \\"Let Me Be Free,\\" and will present the basic story for you.That said, I am now going to write a fairly \\"academic/intellectual\\" review of David Lavender's \\"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy,\\" that will most likely rile those who really like the book. But I strongly feel that a \\"honest\\" review must be made. I have read and researched the Nez Perce for over 25 years, spending time at all of the locations discussed in the book, including several treks through the Wallowa mountains in Oregon. I have also taught courses on the Nez Perce and much of the \\"history\\" included in this book. As such, I can only speculate that the University of Oklahoma Press keeps this book in publication because it sells well, and because David Lavender is a two time Pulitzer Prize nominee and a respected historian. However, if \\"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy\\" is an example of what is passing for history today, we as a society, in my opinion, are loosing all sense of history. I would be embarrassed to cite this book in any paper I wrote. I have not kept current on books published since 1991, which is why I bought this book, due to health reasons. Finding the book recommended on an Amazon list, recognizing Lavender's name, and deciding to look into what has been written about the Nez Perce (I will use the commonly used name for them in my review) since 1991, I decided that \\"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy\\" would be a good place to start. Unfortunately, I found the tomb to be so difficult to palate that it has taken me weeks of sporadic reading to finish the book. Why? Because, as indicated in the title of my review, \\"Let Me Be Free\\" is riddled with sophistry (misleading, cleaver reasoning that is a fallacious argument), innuendos (hints or sly remarks, usually that are derogatory and/or insulting), stereotypes (fixed or conventional notions or conceptualizations broadly accepted as fully accurate or truthful), and hypothesizing (presenting unproven or unprovable notions, concepts, or theories). Perhaps more disturbing for me while reading this book was knowing that other readers, who have not spent time reading other materials about the Nez Perce, would be \\"attracted\\" to \\"Let Me Be Free\\" for the very same reasons I found it problematic.In Lavender's first endnote for Chapter 19, Evasions, the author overtly elucidates his sophism: \\"My elaborations are assumptions based on the Indians' war psychology. Nothing else satisfactorily explains the Indians' roundabout march during the early days of the flight.\\" The historical fact is, we will never be able to \\"accurately\\" document any explanations for the actions taken by those who never bothered to explain their actions. A less overt, but inflammatory and stereotyping example can be found in the next to the last paragraph of Chapter 13, A Touch Of Gold: \\"Many Nez Perces profited also. A few mined. More acted as tenders to the growing number of pack strings that carried supplies to the scattered camps. The greatest number took up farming, as Spalding had tried so hard to get them to do twenty years earlier. They learned something of a cash economy, using gold dust and minted coins to purchase white-style clothing, blankets, household implements, and prepared foodstuffs. They also learned to drink liquor, many of them with the unquenchable thirst that is characteristic of Indian alcoholics.\\" Most readers will gloss over these statements without giving it a second thought. Yet did all Nez Perce fall into one or more of these categories? No! Other histories clearly show that many Nez Perce remained as isolated from the non-allied tribal nations as they could, and maintained their own cultural ways. More to the point, were these really \\"profits\\" for the Nez Perce, or were they \\"profits\\" as non-Nez Perce would like to conceptualize them as being? Lavender is cleverly relying on readers stereotypes to validate his conclusions, that many other historians (and non-historians) would argue are false. Lavender's ultimate spin relies upon the stereotype of the \\"drunken Indian,\\" one that is accepted as \\"truth\\" by most everyone--Indian and non-Indian alike. Ironically, Lavender admits elsewhere in \\"Let Me Be Free\\" that \\"drinking\\" was limited to a small number of Nez Perce, and that (Chief) Joseph (I use his commonly used English name, not his Nez Perce name, so readers of this review will know who I am talking about) in particular, did not drink alcohol.In Chapter 13, A Touch Of Gold, one can also \\"see\\" (albeit, they must be willing to read the words and not the stereotypes) examples of Lavender's innuendos. In describing the (Wallowan) Nez Perce during the winter of 1859-60, Lavender resorts to idyllic and romantic descriptions that hold within their deeper context, derogatory and demeaning \\"hints\\" or remarks: \\"...Young warriors searched for round, unshatterable stones they would wrap in rawhide and attach to handles as war clubs. They made magical whistles from the hollow bones of cranes. They practiced war, riding concealed like buffalo hunters on the sides of their horses....\\" Note that everything describes the Nez Perce as \\"war-like\\" people; or, more subtly, preparing for war. Outside of \\"paintings\\" I have not seen or read about hunters riding on the side of a horse to hunt buffaloes; indeed, such an act would be incredibly difficult and irrationally dangerous. Also note that the whistles were allegedly \\"magical whistles,\\" not just whistles. (Lavender doesn't even bother to elaborate on how the whistles are magical. Maybe, because he wants the reader to use their imagination or stereotypes to self-explain). Other examples of Lavender's innuendos can be found in his choice of words. Nez Perce men are usually called warriors, combatants or some other \\"loaded\\" word rather than men. When Lavender is generalizing, or not trying to \\"positively\\" portray the Nez Perce, he utilizes many terms varying from \\"non-treaty Nez Perce\\" to \\"mobile red village;\\" although he also uses generic words like \\"Indian\\" and \\"enemy\\" as well. Yet, when Lavender want the reader to empathize, or he is trying to pen a \\"positive\\" portrayal, he uses the word \\"Nimipu\\" (as spelled by Lavender) to refer to the Nez Perces. Similarly, in describing criminal acts, white women were \\"...repeatedly raped--a common form of dominance and revenge...,\\" while \\"Indian [Note: not Nez Perce or Nimipu ] women were violated;...\\" Of course one could find evidence to argue that rape was not \\"a common form of dominance and revenge,\\" but I don't have the time to locate it. The point here is, Lavender's innuendos attach different emotional images to a criminal act that are dependent, based on Lavender's writing, on the perpetrator's \\"race.\\" That is, white women are \\"raped,\\" Indian (and by implication, specifically Nez Perce) women are \\"violated.\\" While the two words are implied to mean the same thing, they elicit nearly diametric emotional images when read.Lavender's reliance on stereotypes is so resplendent, I could write pages citing examples. However, I feel compelled to cite a few examples. In Chapter 18, Blood For Blood, Lavender injects the following two stereotypes: 1) \\"Vengeance, any Indian would have agreed, did not have to be confined to the perpetrator of a wrong; even remote associates could be made to pay;\\" 2), \\"Like most American Indians, they were prey to their own mercurial emotions. Seldom guiding themselves by long-range considerations, whole villages were given to responding, under stress, as erratically as a flock of quail startled by a falcon.\\" In Chapter 22, Hanging On, Lavender states: \\"Apparently [Note: author is also conjecturing here], a few of them [Nez Perce] had crept into the compound with the stealth that Indians practice from childhood.\\" Like all stereotypes, there are \\"grains\\" of truth in these statements; but for the most part they are images people have been \\"taught\\" to believe as \\"truths\\" for all members of the group (in this case \\"Indians,\\" or Nez Perce).Lavender's clearest example of \\"hypothesizing\\" is to be found in Chapter 19, Evasions. While the first sentence of the paragraph overtly makes it clear, I have included the first \\"hypothesis\\" about the Nez Perce and how they \\"might\\" be thinking: \\"Conjecture now. The embattled Indians [not Nez Perce] had always seen the volunteer units associated with uniformed soldiers. So they thought at first that Howard's troops were somewhere close by. But he had not appeared when the whites clearly needed him. This must mean the army was not nearby....\\" As with Lavender's stereotyping, his hypothesizing is too rampant and essentially pointless to edify. Indeed, while Lavender has endnotes, they are sparse and often erratic; he seems to selectively use \\"sources\\" that suit his purposes at the moment, even though Lavender may denigrate the reliability or validity of that source at a different point in his story. As such, it frequently is difficult to clearly identify when Lavender is telling us history and when he is telling us his hypothesis about something.All of this is not to say that \\"Let Me Be Free: The Nez Perce Tragedy\\" is a totally useless book. Lavender does present aspects of Nez Perce customs in ways that may help the reader better understand the events and people of the period discussed; although better and more accurate maps would have greatly enhanced the book. Again, as my title suggests, Lavender's writing style, arguments, conjectures, stereotypes, etc., create a story that is most likely appealing to those who do not care for \\"pure\\" history and/or have accepted many of the stereotypes about \\"Indians.\\" If \\"Let Me Be Free\\" helps readers to have a better understanding of what Lavender calls \\"the Nez Perce Tragedy,\\" then I must applaud the book with one caveat: please balance this story with more reliable and valid information from another source; that is, please don't let this be your \\"knowledge\\" base for your understanding of the Nez Perce \\"tragedy\\" and people.For me, an interesting, perhaps ironical, aside to \\"Let Me Be Free,\\" is the fact that throughout the text and notes Lavender is constantly questioning the validity of remarks, comments, or orations attributed to (Chief) Joseph. Yet, in the final chapter, An American Tragedy, Lavender freely uses quotes (without proper notation, I might add) attributed to Joseph. In particular, he quotes a speech Joseph made at Lincoln Hall in Washington, D.C. I don't want to over write this review by quoting the whole speech; rather I wish to point out just one sentence that is pertinent to the author's title: \\"Let me be a free man--free to travel, free to stop, free to work, free to trade, where I chose, free to choose my own teachers; free to follow the religion of my fathers, free to think and talk and act for myself--and I will obey every law or submit to the penalty.\\" Clearly, Lavender has taken (out of proper context) Joseph's words for his title, \\"Let Me Be Free.\\" But note that Joseph, according to Lavender's own quote states \\"Let me be a free man...\\" Why the omission of words? Why does Lavender rely on words that he overtly questions as being said by Joseph for the title of his book? I will not pretend to know; nor will I conjecture. I only offer this aside as a point of interest for thought or discussion.Please Note: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks."},{"Title":"Barrayar","review":"To start with, if you haven't yet read Shards of Honor, the first novel in the tales of Miles Vorkosigan (even though it doesn't actually feature Miles, it's about how his parents met), STOP, go back and read it before approaching Barrayar. You'll be glad you did. These two novels, written seven years apart, tell one complete story arc. How that came to be is an interesting story.Shards of Honor and Barrayar form the beginning of the Miles Vorkosigan series. (Bujold's novel Falling Free takes place within the same fictional universe but, being set approximately 200 years before Miles' birth, features none of the series' familiar characters. Eventually you'll want to read Falling Free, but it doesn't matter when; you can insert it into your Bujold reading experience anytime.) Shards of Honor is Bujold's first novel (not merely the first novel she ever sold, but the first she ever wrote, thus disproving the axiom, \\"All first novels are unsaleable trash\\"). She begins writing it in December 1982. In mid-'83, having worked through the Shards material and about a third into what would eventually become Barrayar, Bujold realizes her manuscript is becoming too long to submit as one book (the \\"wisdom\\" at the time being a thin manuscript is more likely to be picked off the slush pile than a thick one). Bujold finds a logical breaking point for her tale (Cordelia's arrival on Barrayar), puts it in final draft form, and mothballs the partially finished \\"rest of the story.\\"Bujold submits Shards and begins working on another book, The Warrior's Apprentice. She's about halfway through that when Shards comes back rejected with an editorial suggestion she tighten it up. She finishes Warrior's, then cuts about 80 pages out of Shards, giving her two good unpublished novels. In 1985, around the time she finishes her third novel, Ethan of Athos, Warrior's makes it over the transom at Baen, and suddenly she goes from unpublished wannabe to successful novelist with three books (Shards, Warrior's, Ethan) SOLD. Shards is published in 1986.Fastforward to 1989. Bujold has written four more books, Falling Free, Brothers In Arms, Borders of Infinity (a short story collection), and The Vor Game. Then the program-book editor of Philcon, a long-established SF convention in Philadelphia, asks Bujold to do a short story or outtake to donate to their program book. Remembering the unfinished novel fragment of years before, she troops up into her attic, retrieves the pages, reads them and decides to complete it as a novel. After all, it's already a third finished, right? And in 1992, Barrayar won the Hugo Award for Best SF Novel of the Year.Shards of Honor stars Captain Cordelia Naismith, commander of a survey team for the Betan Expeditionary Force, and Captain Aral Vorkosigan, victim of a mutiny on his Barrayaran warship. Both stranded on an unexplored alien planet, officers on opposite sides of the Betan-Barrayaran War, they reach an agreement of honor: they will trust and rely on each other for survival as they travel across a planet seemingly intent on throwing all its resources into killing them before they can reach Aral's ship. And then there's the little problem of overcoming the mutineers.... In the process of their adventures, Cordelia and Aral fall in love.Barrayar deals with her first experiences on that planet, leading up to the birth of her and Aral's son Miles (though there is an epilogue showing Miles at age five). Both Shards and Barrayar are told from Cordelia's perspective. Thereafter in this series Miles, with very few exceptions, takes center stage. Never again will Cordelia be the main character. But for these two books she emerges as one of the most well-realized, loving and vulnerable but still tough-as-nails female SF protagonists ever.The next book in the series you'll want to read is The Warrior's Apprentice, which picks up Miles' life at age 17."},{"Title":"The Comparative Advantage of Agricultural Production in Southern Kyrgyzstan (Paper Series (International Fertilizer Development Center), Ifdc-P-32,)","review":"We were looking for the information about agriculture in Kyrgyzstan.

Cheap and Easy!,)","review":"It is pity to see all the legacy refrigerators going to waste. You can see the appliance store back lots filled with them and garage mechanics selling fixed ones for $150 in the WantAds.This excellent book with lots of illustrations beats out books from Time-Life, Masters, OEM mfgrs, and others. The author has already been there and done that...he doesn't need a big publisher masthead and lots of high priced editors and photographers.Refrigerators are really quite simple but there are some trouble-prone areas which includes icemakers. It has good detail diagnostic flow diagrams so you can determine which subsystem or component is bad.In my case for a 20+ year old Frigidaire with top mount freezer intended to be used in an office, where a new one costs about $600. This fridge cooled great at first, but after about 1-2 weeks would not cool or freeze any more.With this book, I easily diagnosed that a defrost heater was burned out, p37. With its good illustrations, was able to take apart the freezer section, lift the evap coils, and find the heater. Described it (1\\" dia x 17\\" long) over the phone to a appliance parts store. Picked it up for $27, and voila! it is still running after 3 months.I read this book from the local library and also saw another book by the same author, \\"Refrigerator Repair Under $40,\\" ISBN 1-884348-00-9 which has about the same content. Highly recommended, would not been able to save this fridge without it."},{"Title":"Cheap and Easy! Refrigerator Repair (Cheap and Easy! Appliance Repair Series) (Emley, Douglas. Cheap and Easy!,)","review":"This is a fine little book that will help one to diagnose and fix many common problems with a refrigerator. It is written for readers with no experience fixing refrigerators (or any other appliances). It clearly describes symptoms of problems, and what to listen and look for to narrow a problem down. Simple, but helpful - if you can't fix the problem after reading this book, it probably means an expert is required, or that the problem can't be economically fixed.And, the author, a former repairman, also provides a general explanation of how the various systems in a refrigerator work, so that one is not left to blindly try to diagnose a problem without understanding the function of the parts. This can help one to decide if the malfunction is worth fixing, or whether it's finally time to go buy a new refrigerator.In my particular case, this book was a big help. My machine was not keeping food cold because for some reason the compressor motor did not seem to want to start. Yet when it did run, it produced cold enough temperatures. Hmmm... The book described some symptoms that sounded very similar to what I was experiencing, and with some more testing and observing (no electrical test equipment was required) I was able to narrow it down to a $10 failed part in the motor starting circuit. I replaced it and the machine ran fine - and I was saved the cost of a service call or a new refrigerator. But in the process, I also learned enough so that I now know that this problem is likely to recur, and that when it does, the same fix might work, or there will be something else (that I learned in the book) that I can do that might fix it, or that it might finally mean that I'll need a new refrigerator. But the point is, I won't have to go out and spend $2,000 on a new machine, wondering if it was really necessary. I'll know at that point that I've \\"tried everything.\\"The book is easy to read, and one can easily skip the sections on specific systems (e.g., ice-makers) if they happen to be clearly not related to the problem. No expertise is required to benefit from the book; all one needs is an active mind, a willingness to do some detective work tracking down a problem, and some simple tools like wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers and wire cutters. (It helps, too, to be curious about how electro-mechanical things work, and to be willing to take things apart.)Finally, I now have a better appreciation for how my refrigerator works, and all of the things that it has to do to keep my food cold. I know what's going on when it makes different noises. This big box in the kitchen, that quietly hums away doing its job, is a wonderful bit of engineering: one of the many pieces of technology that improves my life over what it would have been like 100 years ago.

It seems that Christine is pulling out all the stops and stating that Alex Cross is a lightning rod for danger, which puts his son at risk.This is a very exciting tale, between the FBI pursuits, bureaucratic hijinks, and various near misses...while on the periphery, the shadow of the custody battle looms.Until the very last page, I wasn't sure how this would end up, but I knew I had to keep reading. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this particular Alex Cross adventure,The Big Bad Wolf (Alex Cross), it wasn't one of the best. Therefore, the four star rating."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"He lost me with this Alex Cross book. I'm really getting tired of Alex's guilt trip and him doing nothing to fix it.

You must read London Bridges to resolve the Wolf storyline."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Amazon.com makes shopping so easy and fun! My books arrived on time. All books were in good or better condition than I thought they would be considering the price. I will continue to use this site and avoid the hustle of going store to store hunting and save my gas!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"It's a fact that most terrible books are terrible for one of two outstanding reasons. \\"The Sword of Shannara\\" stinks because it's such a blatant ripoff. \\"The Stand\\" fails on account of being a disorganized mess. What makes \\"Big Bad Wolf\\" so stunning is that its badness knows no limits. Patterson fails in every single area of writing. Other than Robert Newcomb, I cannot think of any author who is so completely and totally unaware of the most basic rules for good writing.The chapters are only two or three pages long. That's two or three pages of large print with generous spacing, so the actual text of a chapter is really worthy about one page in a real book. Within that page, there's virtually nothing. The writing is more like a plot summary than an actual plot. The narrator merely recites the events that occur, without the slightest trace of development. There is no subtlety, no care, no building of suspense.The characters are utterly and totally worthless. Alex Cross, the protagonist, never displays the slightest trace of any emotion, and has nothing remotely resembling a character trait. He is able to breeze through any event without any reaction whatsoever. He has no personality, no flaws, no hopes, no ambitions, nothing whatever to indicate that he's a human being rather than a robot programmed to be bland. Bad as he is, the other characters are worse. The other FBI agents have no purpose whatever, but merely exist so that Cross can be annoyed by them. The villains are pathetically lame and about as frightening as a hamster. The victims of the crimes are portrayed in such a bizarre, manipulative manner that there's no way to have any sympathy with them at all. The entire book is a wasteland, seeming populated by zombies.The plot is worse than the characters. While any author might stretch the truth a little, Patterson puts it on the rack and tortures it without mercy. We are supposed to believe that a criminal mastermind could and would sneak into a maximum security prison, break every bone in a mafia don's body, and sneak out without being noticed. We are told to assume that a novice FBI agent would be pulled out of training after a few days to direct the Bureau's biggest case in the country. We need to believe that a small child can crack world-class security codes, that a kidnapping could be carried out on a crowded boardwalk with nobody noticing, and that one man could run every criminal enterprise in the country for years without the police noticing. Frankly you'd have better luck floating Mt. McKinley with a helium balloon than suspending enough disbelief to take \\"Big Bad Wolf\\" seriously."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I think Patterson needs to take a vacation then return and write the way he did in Kiss the Girls which was the first Patterson book that I read.Cross as an FBI agent is in the loop, then out of the loop, etc. etc. without any explanation of why or who is doing it. You have to suspend your disbelieve as things just do not happen this way even with the worst of investigations. Wolf, the master villain, is unstoppable but never any explanation of how he does all the things during the story. He breaks every bone in a prisoner's body in the middle of a maximum security facility with no explanation of how it is done; just that the prisoner is found the next morning.Can you believe that Wolf drives by in a limo and takes a shot at the FBI and their prisoner and then the chapter ends and nothing is ever said about the shooting, a chase, road blocks, etc.This is another \\"best selling book\\" that should have been 200 pages that was stretched into 390 pages with generous margins and 117 chapter breakes generating a lot of white space.There were so many unexplained actions through out the book that I was not surprised that the end of the book had no ending. By this time I didn't care who the Wolf was or who his FBI \\"mole\\" was, guess those items and more will be in the next book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Kidnapping is not unusual to top law enforcement and certainly not to the FBI.However James Patterson has thrown a curve ball at the general kidnapping scenario. There are no threats or ransom demands of any kind. The several victims so far are gorgeous drop-dead model types that have no ties to the underworld; at least they had none before they were snatched off the street in broad daylight.A man and woman are watching Mrs. Elizabeth, Lizzie, Connolly, gorgeous mother of three daughters, as she exits a fashionable Atlanta department store. Lizzie Connolly wrestles with her packages as she walks directly toward the parking structure.The woman quickly walked past Mrs. Connolly, turned and put the victim in a vice like grip as the man placed a chemically laced cloth over her face. Lizzie Connolly screamed and kicked until she was rendered helpless by the chemical substance and dropped to the concrete floor. The kidnapper's placed the unconscious woman into her own station wagon and blithely drove out of the parking structure, changed to another car just blocks away and the abduction was complete.Alex Cross, old time law enforcement but new and in training for his current job with the FBI. Cross is called out of class to the chagrin of his training officer, and assigned to the kidnapping case for reasons of his unique expertise.There were no ransom demands or death threats for the several kidnapped women; law enforcement was stuck without a motive in the case. Rumor and innuendo provide only vague clues that seem to point toward the Russian mafia.An unidentified sinister figure called Wolf, one time KGB and high up in the Russian mafia here in the states emerges as a potential but elusive target. At the same time Wolf was put on the FBI's most wanted list, the kidnapping for ransom case moved into a white slave investigation.James Patterson has fashioned a who-done-it mystery with enough twist's and turns to keep the most avid mystery buff guessing until the very end.Tom Barnes author of \`Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone,' \`The Goring Collection,' \`The Hurricane Hunters and Lost in the Bermuda Triangle.'"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Well after reading the previous books in this series and really not liking Four Blind Mice, I have to said this book probably ranked just above that one. Even though the book was a quick read, I don't really understand what's going on. The book takes you from NY, to DC, to FL, to TX, to CO then back to DC. I felt that Alex would eventually connect with \\"The Wolf\\" only he never did. I didn't like how the book ended with Christine and Little Alex or with the Wolf. Other than the ending, I have to say the book was a quick read, I still love all the same characters. I hope that John Sampson joins the FBI with Alex, that would make for some interesting writing. All in all the book wasn't totally bad, but really not one of my favorites that in a year I'll remember reading."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I think that Patterson has finally hit bottom! It started with the Ladies club and now has ended with the Wolf. I guess you can't go on forever...."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Far from his best work but I enjoyed the book. The thought that someone would sell another into slavery pissed me off enough to make me more intreseted in the book then I otherwise would have been. Though, the suprising plot line that pissed me off was the Little Alex story. The thought that that woman comes back to destroy a happily united family really threw me. I mean its one thing if she wanted to share custody but she doesnt she wants to take him back to Seattle with her. What a weak and conniving woman! I really hope Alex gets to keep his son. The fact that the Alex Cross series has now been diverted to &quot;Baby Momma Drama&quot; is ridiculous. I wish Christine would have stayed far away where she belonged."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Being time challenged between work and grad school, I found this rare opportunity for pleasure reading to be somewhat entertaining. The short chapters made the books one that is easily picked up for a brief five or ten minute reading session. However, the plot was not very believable and the ending was very disappointing. If I had known the ending would be so poorly put together I would not have chosen this book; I get so little time to read for pleasure so I would definitely have chosen something more worth my time."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I love the Alex Cross character, but in this book, he seems to be losing ground - or is not as interesting as he once was. I see this happening with more and more bestselling authors - their work goes from excellent to mundane at best. Come on, Mr. Patterson, give us the old Alex Cross. The plot was good, but it's been done before."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Mr. Patterson's in a tough place. He's developed a pretty good lead character in Alex Cross and used him effectively in a number of books. Unfortunately, it seems like Mr. Patterson's bag of tricks to make Alex Cross interesting are getting thin. He may have joined the FBI, but the change of scenery doesn't change the dynamic very much.As a result, the main thing that differentiates one Patterson book from the next Patterson book is the quality of the villian that Alex Cross is determined to outwit. Some of the villians, like the couple in &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; are good. Others, like the vampire killers in &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; are just silly.In this case, I would give the &quot;Wolf&quot; a &quot;B.&quot; Although the idea of a Russian mob mastermind is a new twist, Patterson has already used a kidnapping/murder theme before. This book is O.K., but doesn't add anything particularly new or memorable to Mr. Patterson's collection."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad Wolf unabridged was great. Thanks to production and performance. It made a slow book move."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I loved this book until the last 20 pages. That's when I suspected Patterson DID NOT WRITE AN ENDING! Then, I reread the book jacket and final pages searching for a clue as to whether this will be continued in his next book(s). Nothing! Alex Cross does not solve the crime and his personal life is a mess. I recommend NOT buying or reading this book until the ending is written. Then you will be able to enjoy Pattersons twists &amp; turns."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson continues the Alex Cross saga in this thriller. I think Patterson does a great job of drawing the reader into the mysterious and frightening world of the Red Mafia, which I hope he'll discuss in more detail in the next book. I couldn't help but feel, though, that he failed to &quot;connect the dots&quot; and provide adequate transitions between parts of the storyline - especially towards the end. It's almost as if certain chapters were deliberately inserted to fill unintended gaps. Overall however, the novel holds true. It's a fine example of Patterson's work, which is unquestionably amongst the best of our day."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I think Patterson's point to this novel is that some stories don't have a resolution and you don't always win. Personally, I prefer the conflicts I read about to come to a conclusion. Any conclusion would be good."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I invested my time and energy into this book. I spent 3 days reading it from cover to cover. I was into it....and then at the last line of the book...I don't think I've ever screamed in horror before like I did yesterday. Why?! Why did it have to end that way?!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I purchased this book just from reading that line quoted above while waiting at the supermarket. It was so offbeat and perfect for the character, and the context that it was used, that I was intriuged and wanted to read the rest.The premise was pretty scary, but the rest of the book was somewhat less so. This is my first book by this author, and I'd give it a solid 3 stars. Good but not great. I'll be looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This was my first James Patterson novel and it was a real page turner, the suspense was intense, I hated to see the novel end, I was wanting more."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers that this is not the best of JP's books , but even so, this book will keep you reading, it is a very fast read and you will be interested in each page, the story about the Red Mafia could be real; anything in these days could be real.The book has some unsolved murders that I think is just to give the Wolf more power. Why didn't they use Elizabeth to know exactly who the Wolf was?The end is kind of sad with his son and very sad about what happened to the Wolf, but remember not all the endigs are happy."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf was a little disappointing to me. I felt like it needed to be more thrilling, and it just didn't quite make it.There's a diabolical killer on the loose. And linked to him is a &quot;Couple,&quot; that buys and sells men and women for ransom. The first character abducted in the story is Liz Connolly, an wealthy woman who is held hostage by the Wolf. Others are picked up and held, some of them killed, while others survive.Alex Cross is trying to get the killer to communicate with him so he and his FBI pals can nail him good. But within the book, this is disappointing, as they never seem to get the right person doing the killing-very strange.Alex is having problems on the homefront along with all else. His ex-girlfriend, Christine, who is little Alex's mom wants custody of him all of a sudden without warning. And she is hiring a lawyer to do the dirty work.The book was good enough to see what was going to happen next, but not Patterson's best."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"A dozer. This book is lackluster; severely lacking in both character and story development. Seems to me that Patterson has decided to rest on his laurels and churn out drivel for his fans. My advice: don't waste your money on this. If you want to read it, check it out from your local library...then you won't feel so ripped off.For other reviewers--please resist revealing the ENTIRE plot in your reviews. Sheesh, it would be nice to have at least ONE surprise left while reading. (Although in this particular book there's not much &quot;plot&quot; to reveal.)"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf, by James Patterson, is a fast-pace, action-packed, interesting story, that had me eagerly turning the pages."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I found the switch from police officer to FBI Agent interesting and the spotlight on Alex Cross being portrayed in a different light made it especially fascinating. I tried to be objective when it came to Alex losing custody of Little Alex but it was very heartbreaking. Hearing about Nana Mama and the kids is always a refreshing twist. I can't wait for the next book to come out. Thanks for many hours of entertainment."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Welcome to the world of Alex Cross. He is a man that has a new job with the FBI that may very well be the most challenging and compromising of his career. Oddly enough, his family seems to be in some terrible danger. How can a man concentrate on a team of kidnappers that are picking up high standing people for a possible sell into slavery when the mother of his son wants to drag him into a custody dispute? Not to worry, Patterson takes this tale to new levels with fast paced action as he moves Cross through the entire scenario without getting bogged down in the small stuff.However, the mysterious Wolf is just a little too farfetched to carry on with. Former KGB men now need to turn to mobsters in an attempt to make a living. For me there were some loose ends on this angle that needed addressing. Hopefully we will not be strung out on this one, as the series is sure to continue. Recommended reading for those that enjoy the Alex Cross series."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I enjoyed this book much better than many of James Patterson's more recent books. Alex Cross is working for the FBI in this book and has access to many more resources but at the same time has many more limitations but Alex Cross and his predator known as the Wolf are great characters and had me hooked."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"this book was a fun read, but the ending did leave something to be desired."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"What a disappointing book. I kept reading just to find out what happens, but the book ends without an ending.The various popular culture references come across as clumsy attempts to hook the reader. Very little character development. No real resolution of the major problems raised. Plenty of disturbing descriptions of creepy extreme BSDM people in action.All in all not worth the time to read. I guess that popular modern fiction writers can get away with cranking out drivel and still take the money to the bank. Don't let it be your money!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Well now, he certainly seems to be the big bad wolf. No one can stop him,maybe it will take the 101st Airborne. I found it a good mystery with more to come, it left you with a wonder of who it is and a desire for the next story. A great author and always readable. I look forward always to his next novel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Being a Patterson fan and especially an Alex Cross fan, I was disappointed with the latest novel The Big Bad Wolf. The formula writing is just too obvious this time- or perhaps it's time for a break. Alex Cross has been inducted into the FBI where he is unceremoniously taken out of his training classes to solve a kidnapping case (\\"white girl\\"). This of course, ruffles some feathers at the FBI. AGENT DR. Cross without following any FBI protocol, creates enemies and friends during the course of the story.There are a ring of sickos who \\"purchase their fantasies\\" online in white slavery operation. The leader of the sickies is the Big Bad Wolf , an elusive character so evil and sinewy that you'll never know his identity. It's believed that he's Russian mafia and former KGB. There are many twists and turns. There is also a brief cameo of Craig.I was mainly disappointed because the book was great all the way up untill the last 30-40 pages. After that, what a let down. It's mostly entertainly, a very quick read, will keep you involved and then at the end- slam the pages in your face. My reaction was \\"JP, you're strickly writing a tv movie script\\" , no more character development than this?\\" . Things just get wrapped up in a package too quickly. I wanted a bit more character development. I was also disappointed b/c some of the plot (pulling an FBI trainee out of class to solve a case, recruiting a nemesis felon for assistance, etc.)reminds me of another author who shall remain nameless.It moves you right into sequel mode- no answers until the next book.It has a rushed ending, almost as if he wrote it on deadline day. The book seems unfinished to me. I have no problems with reading series- in fact, I like series. I would just like for the first in a series to encourage me to read the next. I don't care about reading the next book. What was he thinking?"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Women are disappearing. It's happening all over the country, and it appears that the women are targeted specifically. The FBI are brought in, and that brings in Detective Alex Cross. Alex has left the DC Police Department and is being fast-tracked in the FBI for a top position. He soon discovers that the women are being ordered as if they were on a menu on a secret website for very rich, very depraved men. The women are kidnapped and sold to these men as sex slaves.In addition to the perplexing case, Alex has other issues to worry about. He is separated from his new love, Jamilla, who is on the West Coast while he is on the East. And a former love, Christine Johnson, has reappeared in a move that bodes trouble. She is the mother of Alex's youngest child, the baby also named Alex. Christine walked out of their lives a year ago to go find herself after a brutal crime, and now she is back and wants custody of Alex.As Cross works the case, he discovers that the mastermind behind the kidnapping ring is a Russian man known only as the Wolf. The Wolf is never seen, but his intimidation extends to everyone he has any contact with. Anyone who talks about him at all is brutually murdered with no questions asked. That makes tracking him down and stopping his spree more difficult than any other search Alex can remember.Big Bad Wolf is a fast-paced thriller that reminds readers why they love James Patterson. The action is non-stop and heart-pounding. The reader is caught up in the action and also becomes involved in Alex's family concerns. This book is recommended for all mystery readers."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I was beginning to feel bad that I had not read any Alex Cross novels so I started with this book. Maybe I started in the wrong place. I am really disgusted by novels and television shows that seek to get inside the mind and motivation of a sick psycho killer. The crimes get grosser and scarier and the victims dumb and dumber. I would much rather spend more time with the victims and their reacclimation to family and friends than the comings and goings of the Wolf. And it really irked me that he was not caught in the end.Much more interesting was Alex's view of the FBI and his feelings about the transition from the police department to the FBI. Patterson could have done more to explore the strenghts and weaknesses of both groups and the tensions present when trying to work together. That familiar \\"trust no one\\" was not sufficiently explored and the bad \\"good\\" guys just seemed to be recycled.I was very confused by the Alex Cross family man and lover scenario. He did not seem to be particularly good at either and his children unusually forgiving. I can only assume this situation was developed in an earlier book and is presented in this one as a given. What were quickly described as part-time tasks are full-time jobs in my house. Even a smart and savvy grandmother has trouble keeping up with teenagers and their busy school schedules, not to mention their social lives. Cross appears only marginally involved with his family, and then only with the good parts. An example is his relationship with a woman who lives 3,000 miles away. Who couldn't maintain a relationship that only requires a half hour a day? And that by phone. It is the daily routine with my husband that causes friction.I am reading the next Alex Cross book just to put an end, I hope, to the Wolf. But after that I am leaving Patterson and too cool Cross behind. He needs to develop a soul before I find him more interesting than the criminals he is tracking."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad Wolf leaves you, as another reviewer said, &quot;wanting his next book right away.&quot; That's because Patterson doesn't end this one. I've read all of Patterson's books and with the exception of the &quot;Thomas Berryman Number,&quot; and &quot;The Jester,&quot; they've all been at least decent, and in most cases, damned good. I don't remember Patterson ever ending a book like this before. I don't mind cliffhangers on TV when I know I can probably find out the ending next week. But when someone eagerly anticipates an author's next book, they deserve more than this. &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; feels rushed, like Patterson was on deadline to get it out and the editor didn't want to wait for re-writes. Come on JP! Your fans deserve better!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson did not play fairly. This book is not even close to being complete.The story also has significant flaws. The Wolf demonstrates he has the ability to get to any perceived threat. However, he allows Alex Cross free reign.The story was also very choppy.Patterson continues to stick to the same boiler plate when writing these novels.Alex Cross neglects his family; someone in the FBI is a turncoat; his family is in mortal danger; higher authorities undermine Cross's attempt to resolve issues.With that being said, I now have to wait for the next installment of this novel. I would not read this book until the next one is completed. Waiting 6 months to 1 year for the remainder of the story is a real turn-off."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I think Stephen King is just jealous because James Patterson can still write. The Big Bad Wolf was a little slower than some of his other books but it was still ten times better than the last few books King has done. I look forward to every Alex Croos book Patterson will give me."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I think Patterson must be getting a wee bit greedy. This book was left totally unresolved on two major fronts. You're not getting me to buy another one, Mr. Patterson - your next book, I'll be checking out from the library! Other than a complete lack of resolution, it was a good, very fast read, but SO not worth almost $30! I'm force fed reality tv if I want to watch network tv (which I don't, since it's mostly moron tv, if you ask me); I will not stand for it in a book in which I want to escape. I realize many things in &quot;real life&quot; are not neatly wrapped up, like they USUALLY are in books, but this was ridiculous. It's like Patterson NEEDS us to buy the next book to find out what happens next. Thank goodness for JK Rowling, who I'm going back to next!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Told that this would be the best Alex Cross book, I eagerly plunked down the required money and began to read. At page 164 I felt like I'd been ripped off. James Patterson, I believe, has lost it. He doesn't know who he wants his audience to be. This book might appeal to teenage girls or older women. This is less a thriller than a story about Alex Cross and his troubles as a single father. Boring! This is a slow paced story that finally picks up speed just as the FBI is ready to close-in and close the case. James Pattersons best books were his first, the first Alex Cross book and the two recent books he collaberated on. After reading this I feel he just loaned those two young authors his selling power and stuck his name on their books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I just finished this book and as always I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book. Excellent thriller and suspense, I jsut can't get enough of James Patterson!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Having read all the Alex Cross novels in one fell swoop, I felt I was \\"Alex Cross-ed Out\\" and took a long rest from Patterson in general, and Cross in particular. But finally, I felt ready to come back to the fold, and I'm glad I did.\\"The Big Bad Wolf,\\" while not the best in the series, is fast-paced, suspenseful, and--I must warn readers--extremely, graphically violent. As Cross trains for his new FBI job, the worst of all the violent, deadly criminals he has ever faced, former KGB agent and now Red Mafia leader \\"The Wolf\\" is engaged in vicious slave trading--of young, beautiful men and women in every major city in the country. By the time the FBI realizes that the kidnappings form a pattern, most of the hostages are tortured and dead. Cross is raised from his rookie position by the FBI Director himself to lend his expertise to the case.On the home front, worries about Little Alex's mother Christine coming back to claim the toddler are worrying Alex and Mama Nana (who is more disapproving than ever)--but the Wolf case is starting to eat of all of Alex's time and energy, as always.There is a fine, fast ending to the book, and it is all very satisfying if not vastly over-violent. I am ready to read the next two in the series, and glad I came back to join Alex in his crusade against evil."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson's \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" is the 9th in the series of Alex Cross novels. It is a solid addition to the group but some of Patterson's fans will find themselves somewhat unfulfilled by it. (Perhaps, that's why #10 in the series, \\"London Bridges\\", followed closely behind.)Former Washington P.D. detective Alex Cross now finds himself as an FBI recruit who's suddenly thrust into the middle of an investigation involving a White Slavery kidnapping ring operating across the country. Patterson quickly glosses over why Cross, a mere recruit (or \\"FNG\\", as the Fibbies refer to him), would be so invaluable to the case that he is catapulted into the case over hundreds of other qualified FBI agents. Cross immediately begins to see patterns that the other agents don't pick up which portray him too much as a \\"Superman\\" to this reviewer. If the reader can get beyond that then he or she will find a above average plot.Patterson introduces us to one of the most nebulous, cold-blooded villains he's ever created, a former Russian KGB agent known as The Wolf. The Wolf, as readers will come to find, is not as vividly drawn as most of Patterson's characters, but I think this is by design. Without revealing too much of the plot, let me suffice to say that the reasons for this will be discovered near the end of the book.Cross continues to try and balance the responsibilities of fatherhood with his FBI career in \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\". New developments to that part of his life add some flavor to the inner workings of the novel. Both his former and present lovers factor prominently in the book, but on opposite ends of an emotional spectrum. Unfortunately, Cross' friend and colleague, John Sampson, barely receives a mention in the novel. Some other rather odd and colorful characters (especially some of the members of the White Slavery ring) are introduced along the way and help with the interest level of the novel.A very interesting ending keeps this from being a rather mundane read. (I actually did find myself wanting to skip over some of the details in the middle of the book which I've never done in a Cross novel before.) Once again though, Patterson hooked me in the end and caused me to look forward to the next installment of the series.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thought this novel would be a good in-between read. Usually, I select what I believe to be challenging novels, scholarly fiction.How I enjoyed this suspenseful tale! Alex Cross is a realistic, dynamic protagonist with a personal life, children and a past to resolve. He is also a student, a new FBI agent who hasn't learned the ins and outs of the bureaucracy. Cross is pulled out of class to hunt down and entrap an international godfather of the Red Mafiya, the Wolf.The Wolf snatches and delivers beautiful women, and men, from shopping malls and college campuses to be delivered to psychopathic members of a secure internet chat service. Cross has to find these innocent, tortured victims before they are murdered by their captors.This book caused me to lose sleep many-a-night because I couldn't put it down. This is my first Patterson novel and I guarantee it won't be my last."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson shows why he is at the forefront of the writing trade with this timely, thoughtful, and interesting story! Big Bad Wolf, is in my openion, the best of many books written thus far by this author who continues to shape today's modern-day thriller enviornment.From detailed character development, to a complex, but easy to follow storyline, to the expected colorful and engrossing writing style of the author, I am sure readers everywhere will enjoy this thriller that takes you across the globe.Needless to say I am a big Patterson fan."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Like Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone, Alex Cross is one of those characters that continues to be enjoyable to read, long into the series.What I didn't like about this book was the way it ended. I don't like when books aren't wrapped up in order to force you to buy the next installment -- I'd buy it regardless of knowing who Wolf really is. I didn't see Sphinx's identity coming...it would've been awesome if he'd turned out to be Wolf.And the Christine stuff...ugh. The woman abandoned her kid, and she can just waltz right in and take him away from the only family he's ever known? Call Alex what you will, but he's definitely a loving father who takes care of his kids and raises them the right way. That part of the book really turned me off.If you want to read an author that's given up effort and is coasting on his name, pick up Stuart Woods' Stone Barrington series. Ugh."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Alex Cross novels, much like Robert B Parker's \\"Spenser\\" stories, is a victim Patterson's own success. The series starts well, but as the novels are pumped out, the bad guys become bigger, while our hero becomes more heroic. As noted by another reviewer, the chapters are a paltry page and a half long. This gives the illusion of a \\"real page turner\\" but what it truly does is waste paper. The other \\"pager turner\\" device deployed is ending most chapters with a lingering question or an exclamation, complete with italics. Without those, the story doesn't move well. The basic plot is fine. The coincidences and the happenstances (a 13 year old hacker comes to the rescue) are not imaginative. The internal struggles of Dr. Cross are forced. While there are action sequences, complete with gunfire, I never sensed that Dr. Cross was in danger. I only read the Cross stories out of habit at this point, but much like the Spenser novels, the early books are the best."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson's books have all the attributes of the best pulp fiction: grisly murder, rape, tension, and a flawed but intriguing lead character. The villian, Wolf, is believable and genuinely unlikeable; the crime of human slavery is worthy of a bestseller and Patterson treats it with respect. The plot moves quickly and there's no need for a second reading--it's pretty linear and not hard to keep up. This isn't a slam, by the way. A good, fast-paced novel is a rare find and probably hard to write. But oh, so easy to read!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"First, let me praise the audio recording of this book.Both actors were fantastic. The first-person reading of agent Alex Cross was phenomenal and the other characters were also skillful and convincing. Audiobooks have come a long way. This was full-fledged theater.Now, the book itself. Yes, it was cheesy. Yes, it was a bit dopey. But did you expect otherwise?It kept my interest, it was fast-paced, it was everything I expected it to be.Was it filled with cliches? Yes. Did the descriptions of Cross's family life grow tiresome? Yes. Was the ending contrived? Sure.But it's not like you pick up James Patterson to read great literature."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Okay, this is not the best novel Patterson ever wrote, but it's still pretty good. It has his trademarks written all over it with the same characters, violence, and plots, but then, that's why we read him, right? Would also recommend Roses are Red, 2nd Chance, McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood, and Brown's Angels &amp; Demons."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I normally would not take the time to write a review but in this case, this book is so bad I felt compelled to write.This may be the worst audio book I have ever listened to. I dozed off for a couple of hours in the middle of the book and didn't miss a bit of the non-plot. I can't believe I spent that much time actually listening to the whole thing. This is one of those performances that makes absolute silence sound pleasant.Patterson seems to have become a soap opera writer. I've been a big fan of the Alex Cross series and have read every one. I would have never imagined that I'd be buying into a B, no, a C class soap opera script. While nominally a detective story about his fight againts the Red Maffia after joining the FBI, most of the time was spent describing all of Alex's personal problems, ranging from his self-doubt about joining the Bureau to NannaMamma's lecturing to his problem with his ex-girlfriend and her lawyers.Meanwhile the detective plot rambled all over the place and lacked any credibility. The antagonists could seemingly move from coast to coast in an instant (chapter) without any interference from law enforcement even though they were wanted. What happened to all that security (SIC) at the airports? They could sneak in and out of federal SuperMAX prisons at will. They could set up a sniping nest on the grounds of Quantico. Someone's imagination gone wild.Possible spoiler, if this book could be spoiled anymore.The worst part, if I can pick a worst part from all the bad, they don't even catch the bad guy and most of the good guys get killed or injured.To go along with the horrible book is the awful audio production. This one had all the fad components that is making me start to dislike audio books. Multiple, boring performers, bad sound effects, and playhouse music - just like a cheap soap opera. There are some hugely skilled performers out there that can make a plot come alive. None were present here. Maybe Time-Warner realized this book was a dog and called in the B team.The more I think about this book the more I wonder if Patterson even wrote it. It just doesn't fit his style. I wonder if he had some flunky employee ghost-write it for him? In any event, this one was so bad that I'll never waste any more time nor money on Patterson."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"of time and money!! I surely will not even be tempted to buy his next--he doesn't get better, he gets worse! I'd bet the reading level is maybe--4th grade."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Life is just too short to waste time reading a poorly written novel. The writing had no depth, the character interactions were shallow. The story just plodded along with the stilted gate of a robot. Crap, crap, crap and another heaping serving of crap. It was a struggle to read the first third of the book. I kept hoping maybe the next chapter would be better, possibly the next page. But it never got any better and I finally had to put the book down.I had been a Patterson fan for a long time and religiously read every Alex Cross novel that he produced. But I have noticed a rapid decline in quality in his last couple of novels and frankly I think this will be the last Patterson novel that I will ever read."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"As someone else said, Patterson just missed with this book. Another unsatisfying ending, with the bad guy not getting \\"his,\\" and the good guy getting the shaft. Needed another hundred pages or so to bring a few of those strings to a good ending. Probably going to be a \\"Bigger, Badder Wolf\\" in the future. Hope it ends better."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"touched another subject with intelligence, intrigue, action, and keeps you turning those pages till you're done...great book!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I found this to be an interesting Novel. After reading some of the other reviews, I was taken aback, due to the fact that J.P. is an author in demand. His demands I am sure are great to get and keep the pace up, so reviewers need to ponder that for a bit before their written attacks.As far as the FBI advance from &quot; former DC street cop&quot; let's not forget that the Alex Cross Character is also A DR., a forensic psychologist. His profiling for the department and his help to the FBI, allows him a different rank. Ask or research, you'll find that sometimes Shmo's can advance in center elite field's just by, well, who they KNOW?This book will obviously have a sequel. The book was great, although I would like to see A. Cross get little Alex back. J.P. should also make the Christine character have to relocate to DC for regular visitation. Use her as an example of, You should not abandon your child and think you have some right to, out of the blue walk in and disrupt his life. I hope there will be a positive conclusion to that part.I would recommend this book to thiller fans."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This in not great literature - but it is entertaining."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I'm an avid fan of Patterson and Cross, but when I finished this one I immediately checked Amazon to see if the &quot;sequel&quot; was available yet so that I could read the ending. The Wolf was a scary villain but I was disappointed in the lack of character development of his &quot;accomplices&quot; and the victims. I'd given previous &quot;Cross&quot; books 5 stars, so I WILL continue to buy Patterson's books!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad Wolf is the second Alex Cross novel that I've read from Patterson. Hence, my point of reference is not the same as that of long-time Patterson readers, many of whom speak disparagingly of his latest effort. From my perspective, the Big Bad Wolf had the makings of a good detective novel - an evil antagonist, a growing list of unsolved abductions, and a cerebral detective who remains relentlessly in pursuit. For me, the pages went quickly. Nothing in this book will keep me from picking up future works (and continuing to go back to earlier efforts that I have not yet read."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"While I am trying to get caught up on my technical book reviews, I haven't given up recreational reading. And I just finished one that I enjoyed... The Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson. This is part of his Alex Cross series, where the main character is a cop going head-to-head with some nasty killers. This latest installment has Cross training to become an FBI agent, wondering if he made a mistake by leaving the DC police force. His reputation precedes him, and he ends up on a case involving kidnappings for possible slave trading. The mastermind of the ring is a Russian Mafia leader nicknamed the Wolf, and Cross has to hunt him down before more people are kidnapped and killed, including members of the FBI trying to bring the criminal to justice. And just to keep the character development going, the mother of his youngest child shows up in his life seeking to get custody back.Perhaps not the best Cross novel that Patterson has done, but enjoyable nonetheless. The ending is a little less than satisfactory, in that there's not the resolution you would expect. I'm expecting a sequel titled something like \\"Blow Your House Down\\" in a year or so..."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This book offended me more than anything else. I love James Patterson books, but these last 2 Lake House and Big Bad Wolf were awful. I will never buy another James Patterson book. I might check one out from the library but I will never spend a dime on one.He seems like he's doing a job he hates by writing this lastest piece of trash.I think he needs to take a break, breathe and come back and write the way he did in Kiss the girls.Do not waste your money on this book. I read it in 3 hours and was pissed off the rest of the day that I spent 20.00 on the book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This is the first Patterson book I have read. I checked out the reviews on Amazon, and had it recommended by someone as well. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed.The best thing about the book is pacing. The chapters are very short, and so it is easy to keep plugging along. That is probably the only reason I finished.I can't see that Alex Cross really grows as a person or changes due to the roller coster he is on. He is who he is, and things just come at him. I prefer characters who grow and change in response to what life gives them, whether good or bad.The Wolf is this uber bad guy who is mysterious only in that he seems to be able to do what he wants whenever, and is never fully revealed. He is a cardboard character, plain and simple.Incidental characters are given a quick, telling (not \\"showing\\" us with creative imagery) description, and do what they are supposed to do. Nothing interesting about them. The character who disappears initially and kicks the story off is lost in the garbled ending - no exploration of what really happens.I'm not afraid to read books with profanity, but he seems to litter the f-bomb around just to sound tough. Not impressed. Use the GIFT of language to portray the characters' street cred next time, not just that they cuss well.Overall, I won't bother with reading more from this author. There's much more interesting, well-written work out there."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"After this book, I'm of the mindset to not read anymore Patterson. This was my 4th Alex Cross book, after Roses are Red, Violets are Blue, and Cat and Mouse. I loved Cat and Mouse and Roses are Red, Violets are Blue was just OK. But this. THIS piece of garbage is horrible. Everything just falls into place for Alex. He's handed every clue/suspect on a silver platter. The fact that you don't really find out who the Wolf is, is really annoying. I'm tired of Patterson selling half a book for full-book price. Sell one book as two, make twice the money. Well, he won't be making any more of mine. At this point, I don't CARE who the Wolf is or who his FBI \\"mole\\" is.Most unbelievable part of the plot...when they catch \\"Sterling\\" and the Wolf drives by in his limo and shoots at the FBI and cops. The chapter ends, and you hear no more about anyone chasing the limo or even mentioning that they were shot at.My recommendation is save your time and money. If you want good investigation stories read Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson has gotten lazy, and worse, disrespectful of his readers. Stephen King - infamous for treating his own readers like undeserving children - described the Alex Cross series as &quot;dopey&quot; and after choking down &quot;Big Bad Wolf&quot; I have to concur; it continues the downward spiral of the last few additions. It's almost as though Patterson is coming up with titles to match his nursery rhyme-themed series and then feels trapped into writing a story that will - sort of - match it. As a bedtime reader not looking for deep spiritual fulfillment or intellectual stimulation, I appreciate Patterson's one-and-a-half page chapters, but I can't support the fact that he no longer writes in complete sentences, only in staggering bursts of phrase which wear one down and reverberate in a &quot;buh-buh-BUMP&quot; pattern in one's head.A couple of books back when Christine gave birth while held prisoner in an island cave, I rolled my eyes. When she conveniently left the baby behind to &quot;find herself&quot; and because Alex's job was too dangerous (huh??), I snorted derisively. Now she sweeps back in and reclaims the child as though she'd never left, and the courts says, Yeah, that sounds right. Alex is no longer - as far as this book is concerned, a psychologist, and his new status as an FBI agent has him alternately treated like a newbie grunt and then suddenly he's in charge of every operation without finishing his orientation. The &quot;Wolf&quot; is described so inconsistently and with such comic book immortality that he is surely one of those escaped villains from Krypton in the &quot;Superman&quot; movie. If you are able to finish this novel - it'll only take a couple of hours - you'll be astounded with all the loose ends and the unabashed corruption of Alex Cross's once-high morality. He doesn't get laid in this book. Maybe he'd behave better if he did."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross is back, only now he is in training for the FBI in Quantico. And it's just in the nick of time because women are being abducted in different cities and are suspected of being sold into sexual slavery. Orchestrating all of this is a former KBG operative called The Wolf. He is cunning and ruthless and will be Cross's biggest challenge to date. Will Alex be able to convince the experienced FBI agents to trust the \\"new guy?\\" Will he want to remain with the FBI or will he decide that he never should have left the Washington PD? And will the reappearance of Alex's former lover and mother of his child spell trouble?This installment is mediocre at best. The pages turn, but not because it is good, but because it is an easy read. It is enjoyable to continue to follow the Cross family, but this novel has no meat to it and at times is almost boring. Each individual piece of the puzzle seems to fit together too neatly. It is also completely unrealistic that Alex would be granted the open access and lead position in the investigation while still technically in training for the FBI.I am going to stick with Patterson because of my history with his books, but I hope that this is only a temporary setback."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Another good fast-paced Alex Cross novel that I read in one sitting. Although not the best I've read in the series, it's enjoyable just the same. Can't wait to read what comes next with Alex and family. Hopefully he'll bring down The Wolf, get his son back and bring Sampson on board."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Now this is what I'm talking about!!! This book remind me of the old Patterson & how he use to SHOCK and WOW the heck out of you. Now Alex is in the FBI he's called the \\"FNG\\", in other words \\"The F****ng New Guy.\\" Even though he's a very experienced and a famous cop, he still has to start from the bottom and work his way up. He get's no special treatment. He's on a case which involves slavery of beautiful well to do women. This mysterious Wolf is behind it all. I was mostly shocked because I didn't expect certain outcomes especially when his baby's mother come back into the picture. That was some pretty heavy drama happen there. But there was one thing I didn't like in the book. If you shot someone point blank with a rocket laucher wouldn't you die or get affect by the blast. Well, other than that, I was truely entertained and I felt Patterson should stay to his roots of writing a great suspenseful novel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This was my first James Patterson book. But, since I liked the &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; and &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; movies, I thought I'd give it a try. Especially since the books are usually better than the movies.I have to say I really enjoyed his style of writing. I unfortunately already had the character of Alex Cross pictured as Morgan Freeman, but that's okay, there wasn't any detail to describe him in this book anyway. Smooth read, easy to follow, not too much detail to bore you. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read some of the early Alex Cross novels.My only complaint, like everyone else, the ending. I read this thing religiously and towards the time the back pages started thinning out, I began to realize the end was going to disappoint me. Just seemed like he ran out things to write or lost his storyline. I'm not giving up, though. I still loved reading it and he has the right to end his books however he wants. They are his books, we just love to read them! 4 Stars ****"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have been an Alex Cross fan from the first book I read but like some of the other reviewers I found it frustrating that there were so many things left hanging.It is a great read but gets frustrating at the end when you think it is over.... but it isn't. Like Roses are Red, it ends with many loose ends that need to be tied up in another book. It almost seems as if he was in a hurry to finish the book and only touched on things that should have been covered more. My only hope is that it doesn't take two years before the next book comes out.But as I said, it is a great read and you will thoroughly enjoy it. Many twists and turns that will keep you interested from the first page."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I truly cant understand what has happened to this author.

People who like books fast and simple should be able to breeze through this in a few hours, if that is what they want. Certainly his characters and writing style will make that easy, but not enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Talk about a top-flight twosome - Peter Jay Fernandez and Denis O'Hare give flawless voice to the latest spine-tingler from ever popular James Patterson. The author of 20 books, Patterson is at the zenith of his powers. The same might be said of the two readers.A New York based actor with numerous Broadway roles to his credit (Jelly's Last Jam, The Merchant Of Venice) plus numerous standout television appearances Fernandez lends eerie suspense to his vocal portrayal.Tony Award winner Denis O'Hare gives another award winning performance with his on-target characterization.Devotees of Patterson may recall that his charismatic hero Alex Cross has a new job with the FBI. Although Cross worked with the FBI many times in the past he's now officially on board - just in time to face one of the most daunting villains imaginable.Well-to-do- men and women have been snatched, perhaps to be sold into slavery. Washington, D.C. streets are no longer safe. As if that weren't enough of a challenge he's about to be locked in battle for custody of his youngest son.With Wolf (the man behind the kidnapings) Patterson has created one of his most unforgettable miscreants to date - a major challenge for one even as savvy and street-wise as Alex Cross.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have to say that this has to be the most disappointing Patterson novel I have read as of yet. It starts out good enough....but about halfway through....Patterson just seems to lose the whole story...and the reader along the way. I think part of the problem is that Patterson is simply having a hard time coming up with a new formidable foe for now-FBI-agent Cross. Of course, what Patterson comes up with (the Wolf...a Russian mafia boss) just isn't convincing. I think this comes from the fact that the guy is Russian....and Patterson just doesn't go into the Wolf's background and associates quite enough. Unlike the other Cross novels, the foreign-ness of the bad guy just takes away from the plot. As you are reading, you have to think about the adversary. Patterson is asking the reader to have a little bit of intellect as they are reading. Not to say that his readers are dumb....NOT AT ALL...it's just that most read Patterson for pleasure. No one expects to have to do research into a fictitious mob faction before they delve deeper into the plot. Overall, the book suffers because of this flaw. Plus, the side plot of Little Alex and Christine/her lawyers could have been more emphasized.I recommend reading some of Patterson's other Cross novels first....like THE BEACH HOUSE...KISS THE GIRLS...or ALONG CAME A SPIDER. They are much better than this one. If Patterson can't develop Cross' character better as an FBI agent, maybe he should send him back to the DC police department. I hope the next novel will be better. Plus, we need a decision on Alex's girlfriend: will it be Molly at the FBI or Jamilla??!?!?!? That is the only tantilizing cliffhanger in this novel. Otherwise, I will hope for things to be better in the future for Mr. Cross...and for Mr. Patterson to come out of his writer's block."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf to me left me kind of disappointed, since I am a kind of new James Patterson fan, but with The Big Bad Wolf, I was glad to see Alex Cross back in business, he is now in the FBI, and he is given a case where people are being kidnapped and being sold for sex slaves, and one of the main people running this operation is named The Wolf, and he makes a lot of money doing what he does best. So now, he runs this high-secure website, and a 12 year old girl breaks the code to get into the website and into the chat rooms where they make requests for slaves. So Alex takes advantage of this, and he goes after The Wolf, but who is the Wolf? Mr. Patterson does not say, nor do we know why he is doing this...so a lot of questions left unanswered when I finished this book. There is NO ENDING! It just stops, in the middle of the action like there is going to be a sequel, but we dont know. So now....Alex Cross thinks he has got the wolf, but it is not him! it is one of the Wolf's men, but then he gets killed in the end, and that is it! Nothing. The story is great, and it just drags on the end like he wanted to get done with the book so he could start 3rd Chance, and he is coming out with another book like Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas (which I thought was just perfect), but we just got to wait and see what Mr. Patterson is going to do with the rest of this unfinished tale."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This was the firstime I have read something by this author and even tho I don't know much about Alex Cross (series) before this one, I still liked it.

While I am aware that there are a number of critics out there who feel that Big Bad Wolf is poor, I disagree. With Big Bad Wolf, Patterson does an excellent job of engaging Alex Cross in a new and captivating chase.Big Bag Wolf opens With Alex Cross completing the FBI Training Academy program after finally making the decision to switch from the Police Department to the FBI after numerous previous pleas to do so. At this point, Alex is now once again the \\"rookie\\" on the team. And, yet that doesn't stop him from going to the head of the class, and the agency.Wolf refers to the bad guy Russian mobster who is ruthless in his pursuit of new conquests. One of his little sideline hobbies seems to be brokering attractive American women he arranges to have kidnapped. And, that's the case Alex is determined to solve.Patterson is masterful at his engaging and brief chapters that say so much in a short period of time. I enjoy his writing precisely because it is not mind bending.While Stephen King might want to be as unprofessional as to characterize Patterson's fiction as dopey, I am not sure if they are looking for a heavy plodding tome to wade through for my leisure reading. Ironically, that's what I used to find myself doing before I stopped reading Stephen King altogether. James Patterson does a nice job in Wolf and I look forward to his next Alex Cross installation.A Happy Patterson Camper!Daniel J.

Can't wait til the third book comes out next year."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big bad wolves have a long literary history. James Patterson's newest Alex Cross novel has a human wolf that is more cunning, dangerous and lethal than any of his namesakes. &quot;An improbable murder story told about the Wolf ... had made its way into police lore and then spread quickly from Washington to New York to London and to Moscow.&quot; While no one knew if the tale was true, &quot;it was consistent with other outrageous incidents in the Russian gangster's life.&quot; He was linked to one particularly gruesome murder that took place after he visited an Italian don in &quot;the high-security supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. The next morning Augusto Palumbo was found dead in his cell. Nearly every bone in his body had been broken ... a method used in the Moscow underworld ... known as zamochit ...[that] signified complete and total dominance of the attacker. The Wolf was boldly stating that he was now the godfather.&quot;He rises on the horizon about the same time Detective Cross has turned in his Washington, D.C. shield, to enroll in the New Agent Training program &quot;at the FBI Academy in Quantico. Sometimes called 'Club Fed' ... [it] was turning out to be a challenging, arduous, and tense program ... [that he] liked.&quot; At forty-two, Cross was the oldest trainee. The new director, Ron Burns, who was thought to be a rebel by the old guard, was willing to bend a few rules because he wanted Alex on his watch; thus, he made an offer Cross couldn't resist.His first assignment is to solve the mystery behind the disappearances of white, blonde, attractive upper-middle class women. They had begun to disappear in alarming numbers, never to be seen or heard from again. The women have vanished with no clues left behind and no witnesses to their abductions. The first bit of information presented to Cross is in a seminar focused on psychopaths. &quot;Even though [he] was familiar with some of the material [learned when he earned his Ph.D. in psychology, he] found himself jotting down [many] of the forty 'characteristics' of psychopathic personality and behavior.&quot; As one of the leading investigators assigned to the case, he felt an adrenalin rush as heady as any he has experienced as a detective.But things are not as smooth as Alex had hoped. His immediate superior is resentful and angry about Cross's reputation and status above the other rookies. And on the home front, Christine, his former lover and mother of his son, decides to reappear. She had abandoned them all a year before, so Alex knows his family may be threatened. As she tries to ingratiate herself into the Cross clan, she makes it clear that she wants custody of the little boy --- and she is willing to do anything to get it. Alex, his children and his mother are devastated at the possibility of losing the wonderful child who had become part of their family.At times THE BIG BAD WOLF seems a bit of a stretch for the reader. The cutouts between worldwide law enforcement agencies and the Wolf defuse the suspense when they laughingly admit they are not who they pretended to be. The abductions, carried out in broad daylight, mostly in shopping malls, will send a chill through every woman who has ever walked to her car without thinking who may be following her. The notion of a white slavery ring, which is the basic premise upon which the plot rests, sounds far-fetched but overall it works and at least makes for an interesting read. After all, how many readers think about suburbia as the showcase for crazy men who are willing to pay millions to fulfill their fantasies with stolen women?James Patterson is such a prolific writer, and Alex Cross is such a familiar character, that fans, and those new to this series, are bound to enjoy the latest addition to the Alex Cross/Will Lee novels.

I was so disappointed in the lack of development of this book! It had a weak premise, the characters lacked development, the actual &quot;dirty deeds&quot; were not even entertaining much less interesting, and even the personal story line of our favorite detective was, again, under developed. It was almost as if James Patterson had a ghost writer who just didn't get the personality of the key players nor the angle of suspense that Patterson himself has been known to deliver. I can't imagine anticipating the sequel. I know that as a loyal fan I will probably read it, if for no other reason than to hope that the return of the core Cross family will be more developed and realistic than in this book, but I look forward to the book after that when this story can be put to rest and, hopefully, the true James Patterson will again emerge."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross is back in the ninth book in the series. This time, Cross is hunting for one of the most evil villains he's ever pursued.The Wolf is a criminal mastermind. He's a kidnapper. He's a madman. He's a murderer.His game is simple. See someone you want to make your own? The Wolf can make it happen. For a modest fee, the girl next door or the guy at work can be all yours.But the Wolf doesn't just fulfill everyone else's fantasies. He also fulfills his own.That's where we run into Cross, who's now training in the FBI. He's pulled from his training and yo-yo's back and forth between trying to capture a killer and trying to keep his FBI superiors happy.As he tracks the Wolf and tries to balance his new career in the FBI, he's also slapped with the most difficult problem he's ever faced in his personal life. He could lose custody of his son.Little Alex's mother wants him back. And she's prepared to take the legal route, tearing the little boy from his father and siblings.Alex Cross has definitely taken a path readers won't expect. Fans familiar with the series might see this book in the series as one of the most heart-wrenching. Not only do we see Cross struggling in his new career track but he's also fighting to keep his family together. The ending is not only unexpected but leaves the trail wide open for Patterson's next installment in the series."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thought it was good but a little dissapointing the way it ended. Like another reviewer said, not to thought provoking but fun to read. Scary to think that things like this actuly happen though..."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I totally agree with Sebastian Fernandez' review below. It was great to read Alex Cross again and Patterson leaves you wanting more and disappointed that we will most likely have to wait another year (or more). I did miss Sampson, who was barely mentioned, and I fear will get boring now that he's married.I think Alex needs to move to San Francisco! Thorougly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The amazing thing about this author is that he can take a series and continue to twist and turn with new shocks everytime!! Anyone who has read the Cross series will not be disappointed with this book!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have read each and every James Patterson book in print. I have always been partial to his Alex Cross Books and was ready for another when The Big Bad Wolf came out. I bought it the first day of release and had read in its entirety by the next day. I found it to be the best of this series because it was a book that kept me totally interested from beginning to end. It was full of plots and twists and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. I was truly glad to have Alex back in my company for two days of suspenseful reading.I was very disappointed in the review by Stephen King and I wonder if he is just jealous of Patterson's talent and large following of readers!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Another great book. I didn't want to put it down you want to find out whats next. Good twists and turns. Didn't like the ending though I hate being left hanging. I hope the sequel comes soon. I will definitely read it. Great book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This book was exciting and full of suspense! The details kind of reminded me of &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; (one of his best) with a very different twist. Patterson did leave me wondering, &quot;What just happened,&quot; after a few chapters, but I still could not put it down - page after page, I NEEDED to know what happened next! The ending, like a few of his novels, was a bit disappointing - again, it left me thinking, &quot;What just happened?&quot; But all in all, the book was great. I was able to finish it in about 12 hours, and I have a toddler who doesn't like when I read! I can't wait for James Patterson's next book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wold was my first James Patterson novel but it won't be my last! Very exciting. I like that in books of this nature! Super Read!!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Avid readers of James Patterson have been wondering lately if he'd lost his touch. The last two books in the Alex Cross series (Violets Are Blue and Four Blind Mice) were average at best, and some of his other works (The Jester and The Lake House) were downright atrocious. Fortunately, Patterson is back in true form with The Big Bad Wolf.At the end of Four Blind Mice, Cross left the Washington D.C. police department to pursue a career at the FBI. This is where we find him at the beginning of the book. Not long after his orientation, a major case begins brewing. Someone with ties to the Russian Mafia is kidnapping women all over the country, possibly forcing them into prostitution and slavery. It's up to Cross and his new team of agents to find these women before it's too late.Wolf contains all of Patterson's trademark twists and turns, and the last 50 pages are simply mind blowing. Never before have 400 pages flown by so quickly. He delivers yet another cliffhanger ending, leaving readers waiting in suspense until next November when the next book in the series will be released. Definitely worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I truly cant understand what has happened to this author. This book is so bad in every way; a simple plot, poor characterizations and dialogue filled with cliches. I cant even remember why his early books were considered good and why I enjoyed them so much because none of that remains. People who like books fast and simple should be able to breeze through this in a few hours, if that is what they want. Certainly his characters and writing style will make that easy, but not enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I should by have paid attention to the rating 'What A Waste Of Time, by A reader from Vancouver' this book was not only a waste of time but a total waste of money. The 'no-ending' is so terrible that it leaves you sick because you know that it is about the author writing and you buying another book to figure out...James Patterson what happened to you? You were a favorite....less then one star...sad James, sad."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"but I can't find enough good in this novel to give it more than ONE STAR!Once again Patterson takes a story that could be great and totally bombs it. Typical Patterson novel with the typical cliches involving women and blacks. He had to throw in his sexy no personality FBI agent who can shoot bad guys while on one knee or do the totally played out \\"we traced the money transfer to an account in the Cayman Islands\\" routine.All the while our ultra antagonist Wolf walks around with a 24 hour erection, breaks necks as if he is breaking a pretzel and uses lines such as \\"I'll huff and puff and blow their house down\\".Are there any other detectives in the realm of Patterson other than Alex Cross? I mean, let's get real. The FBI and even the NYPD have squads/teams whatever you call them that are solely dedicated to oranized crime, specifically 'Russian Organized Crime.' Why would the FBI or NYPD have a burned out detective like Cross step in a play superman when I am sure that other agencies already have years of files and wiretaps on Wolf and his crew. I really don't know. And if the Wolf is so powerful, why not just rub out Detective Cross. If Soneji was such a geek and almost was able to take out Cross, I'm sure these guys could have made him disappear from the face of the earth with ease.I leave my review with two scenes in Big Bad Wolf because I feel that together, they sum it up.1. Cross notices that one of the suspects has a den with a bed in it at his house and that the bed is not made. Cross comes up with the incredible thesis that the unmade bed in the den is implausible proof that this 'subject' and his wife are having problems with their relationship. Because of these problems he has his wife killed.2. Cross is pursuing a few players from the Russian Mafiya that are shooting at him. The one has blonde hair and is running along at a fast clip. As he's getting shot at Cross still has the time to think to himself how he remembered that \\"Great Russian athletes, some former Olympians, were recruited into the Mafiya\\".It's elementary (school reading) my dear Watson."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This one started out great. I was excited that Alex transferred to the FBI. The story line was right up his alley, a la &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;. The Wolf is a true psycho. He would pat Casanova on the head with one hand and stab him the back with the other, literally.But I am somewhat disappointed at the end result When I got to the end, all I could say was &quot;What the f**k?&quot; For starters, where the connection between Judge Connelly and the Wolf's Den. Patterson is is known for keeping the reader guessing as to whom the culprit is, but this one just does not make sense. And then, there is this roundabout as to who really is the Wolf. First it was Pasha, and then it was some guy that Kyle Craig informed Alex. What in the hell would Alex ever believe what Kyle Craig says is beyond me.The return of Christine was horribly written, I expected that she wanted custody of little Alex, but the whole storyline was just weak. I practice Family Law and I would never let my client go to a pretrial conference without me. The fact that Alex went alone was borderline malpractice! Also, the fact that Christine got an ex parte order for temporary custody without Alex having the right to a hearing was also ridiculous. I find it hard to believe that a judge would let Christine take Little Alex when she has been an absentee parent. I would think that Little Alex would have placed in foster care until the issue was resolved.All I can say is..James, you?ve got some explaining to do!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"THE BIG BAD WOLF was a big bad let down for me. The first 338 pages were good. They built up tension and mystery. It was a typical Alex Cross novel. Then came chapter 102 and it all went downhill. That's when one of the captives of \\"the Wolf\\" attempted an escape. The whole escape plan was illogical. I'd go into this more, but I don't want to spoil too much. Then Alex Cross, who is suppose to be this ultra smart detective and one of the FBI's rising stars, makes the stupidest decision in the history of the FBI. Instead of staying with the person suspected to be \\"the Wolf\\" who he has been chasing the entire novel, he runs off to check on a fire, leaving some other agents to look after the suspect. Sheer stupidity.If you're a fan of the Alex Cross series as I am, you'll probably want to read this one. It is an obvious set up for a future book, or books. It has your typical Alex Cross shenanigans in it. There are some returning characters that are nice to see. John Sampson only gets about half a breaths worth of mention though. There are the usual captures of the main villain only to find out that it's not really the right person. But, what was missing for me was the ending. This book had 338 pages worth of decent set up, some chapters that were poorly thought out, a couple of suspicions raised, and no payoff at the end."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT. IT'S FAST PACED, AND YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALEX CROSS BOOKS. I HEAVILY RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf?Well...probably no one, because Patterson doesn't develop him or invest him with much genuine, convincing menace at all.Colourful, yes, but not really scary.The Wolf in question is a powerful and vicious Russian gangster, the latest dragon which Alex Cross must slay. All across America, people are being bought and kidnapped. It's a sort of white-slave ring open to the highest bidder. And, who is operating this? The Wolf, of course, a \\"terrifying\\" mystery-man and huge undiscovered stain on the name of justice. Throw in twists, murders, Cross's new experiences in the FBI where he now works, and you have a typically riveting James Patterson book. Oh yes, and Alex Cross's family is, shockingly, in danger again too. But, this time, not from death... (It's quite a decent sub-plot, actually, but it's as severely underdeveloped as only Patterson can accomplish.)One of these days I will see sense and stop buying Patterson's books. I mean it. They're bad. (After all, if you ever tried to think of them \\"seriously\\" you'd laugh so hard your sides would require sewing back up.) But, I expect it's about as likely to happen as your average person saying \\"I really must put in more time at the gym\\" and actually doing it. And why? Because his books - the Cross series in particular, which remains my strong favourite - are so jolly entertaining. Indeed, The Big Bad Wolf is excellent. Prime Patterson. Very fast, very snappy, very very enjoyable. I loved it. The series is firmly back on track, I feel. Or, at least, as much back on track as it is ever going to be considering Patterson's style and that this is now just easy pop-fiction for the undemanding time-starved masses and always will be. It's all cheerfully - and also ineffectually - dramatic (when he uses exclamation marks after a statement, you find it hard to stifle the chuckles) and very implausible, and also at times woefully underdeveloped. Sometimes I get the feeling that if Patterson developed everything more, his books could be just as entertaining but also much more worthy and far better than merely \\"very entertaining\\". Instead, the plots fly along and his characters (who could actually be quite interesting) are reduced merely to proper-nouns and pronouns. But, this isn't going to change so I must stop complaining and just enjoy it. This style is here to stay, and as it is it works adequately enough.Patterson fans should really enjoy this one - eve if it's end is a little too quick and open-ended. After all, it has everything. A killer, Cross, his family, heartless killings, twists, and even issues with Cross trying to fit in with his new job at the FBI (Once again, if only these issues were explored more fully...*sigh*) Even the quality of the writing has improved a little again. Normally, you'll find yourself jolted along by a proliferation of simple sentences, but not so here. I spotted several (yes, several!) compound and complex ones as well this time! It's formula is almost exactly the same as any other Cross book, but don't let that stop you. As I've said, James Patterson is not for you if you are looking for anything more than a simple, entertaining story, but if that is what you're looking for, he's your man. His books are my very guilty but very pleasurable pleasure."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"What a disappointing book!James Patterson has done such a poor job of writing this book, that you wonder exactly what he had in mind. The dialog is banal and full of cliches. The plot is unbelievable. The characters are one dimensional. Even the ending resolves nothing. It just seems to be setting you up for the next book in the series....The main character, Alex Cross, is incredibly cliched and unbelievable.He is a bright young police officer, who happens to be black, who takes a job with the FBI. So far, this could actually happen in real life...But Patterson has decided that Cross will be a super human, so...- He was an honor student who hold a Phd. From John Hopkins.- He was a Psychiatrist,- He was also a police officer- He then decides to join the FBI- He doesn't have to attend FBI orientation, because he is that good- He plays the piano beautifully- He is an ideal father- He is the perfect husband- Every woman he has ever been with is stunning. And brilliant.- He can leap tall building in a single bound. Well, you get the idea.The plot itself is almost incomprehensible. The characters are thin, and one dimensional and their motivations seem incomprehensible. For example, at one point a CEO for a very large corporation, and a very rich man himself, somehow decides to become \\"the money man\\" for sex slave ring. So he can pick up a few thousand extra bucks? And make himself a target for the \\"Red Mafia?\\" This just doesn't make sense.Cross has an ex-girlfriend named Christine who abandoned their child because \\"she wasn't emotionally ready to be a mother.\\" Well... she comes back to claim their son, and inexplicibly wins a custody battle, despite no mention of it in the book. Until it is settled. You would have thought that a super dad might have shown up for that hearing!I honestly think that making black characters into \\"super humans\\" is just as racist as making them subhumans.Maybe Patterson is playing to some collective guilt, or he just wants to be fashionable.... but he needs to treat black characters like they were real people, and not as cartoon characters. It matters little that Patterson makes his lead into a superman. It's still a racist thing to do.This book was written on a Junior High School level, and is aimed at very gullible readers. All the dialog is banal and cliched. All the characters are weak. The plot is simply illogical.I felt cheated."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I guess the last book I read with Alex Cross as the lead character was Kiss the Girls. That had some believability, this one is nonsense. How can a well know author put his name on such trash!! Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Before reading this book I read some of the reviews posted here. I was a bit skeptical, so I read the book. The reviews are dead on for the most part.This book is a quick read (2 days to read), so it does keep you interested, but I believe that Mr. Patterson has used the unknown assiliant idea one time to many. Other than this flaw (won't call it a big flaw or a small flaw) the book is like the usual Patterson novel. Quick, suspenseful and enjoyable to read.If you want something that wraps up nice and tiddy at the end this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Once again, Patterson creates an interesting plot (although not nearly as exciting, surprising and original as many of his earlier Alex Cross books) -- but, also once again, he has become too willing to settle for mediocrity in his writing style. At best, his characters are superficially developed and the dialogue he has his characters speak is barely serviceable and credible. Further, he has gone way overboard in Big Bad Wolf in regards to the writing gimmicks for which he has become known. If you feel you MUST read the latest Patterson, be willing to forego most of the qualities you would normally look for in a good book -- and a good writer. Expect nothing more than a book that will provide light entertainment. Personally, I'm annoyed at myself for buying Big Bad Wolf, as it is just the latest exmple of Patterson knowing that his fans will plunk down their hard earned money regardless of his being increasingly less willing to provide them with the quality he made sure he provided when he was building his reputation. Big Bad Wolf is likely to be the last book from which Patterson will receive any of my money. While I'm not keeping my fingers crossed, it would be nice to see Patterson return to showing interest in having &quot;quality&quot; associated with his works rather than &quot;quantity.&quot; His &quot;paint by numbers&quot; formulaic writing approach has enabled him to spew out 3 or 4 books a year, and thus become an industry unto himself, so to speak. It's probably naive of me to expect him to sacrifice some of the &quot;green&quot; he is raking in in his &quot;quantity vs. quantity&quot; approach to writing -- but I can only hope. As I said, however, I'm not keeping my fingers crossed."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The novel moves at a quick pace with alot of action.It not thought provoking but its definitely a FUN read."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am a subscriber to Maxim magazine, and in the most recent issue they published the first chapter of this book. I was hooked at first read. I went out the same day and purchased this title and got so much more then I expected. Wow!!! I am not an avid reader at all, but this will get me back into reading for sure. I cannot wait until this book has a second coming, there is so much left for the imagination to run wild with. This is the best read I have had in many years and have not been able to put the book down since I purchased it. I am reading it a second time now just to relive the suspense and thrill. You can feel the vile creature that the Wolf is through out the whole book, as well hold compassion for his victim and the victim of his co-horts. Also a great sub plot involving the Cross family. Love it..........BUY THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I believe this book to be Mr. Patterson's return. It's sad to say but many of us fans have been dissappointed in his recent books. But this book took me back to the first book I read of Patterson which was Kiss the Girls. There's an element in The Big Bad Wolf, sad but I can't name it. Maybe it's the atrocity of the 'bad guy'. Or maybe it's that 'human' quality that Alex Cross is given back by the writer. I believe it was taken from him in Four Blind Mice, a story which wasn't a story, but a paycheck. Of course, the Alex Cross series has been Patterson's finest. If he includes this same element, if he builds this nostalgic quality of HIS writing, then his other series (Women's murder club) and the other non-series stories he has in his future, will not dissappoint."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I enjoyed a book with chills and sapence and this was the book. It talks about people moving in to old haunted houses which they notice different things happening. They feel the ghosts of the past of these people who lived in these houses through-out America. Watch-out because peoples animals will stair up at the ceiliing. During these stories it tells about the history and a story abuot these people who now are ghost. You better watch-out were you move to and better asked the people about strange voices you may hear.I would rate this book 3 stars because of the quality and what goes on during the story. But over-all the book is pretty good."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson has yet to let me down! I listened to the audio cd version and credit should also be given to the narrators/readers. Peter J. Fernandez is wonderful as the voice of Alex Cross, but my heart skipped a beat every time I would hear Denis O'Hara as the Wolf. I was surprised by the twists and turns of the story. Just when I thought they had caught the Wolf, some wicked twist completely threw me off track. The ending leads no doubt in my mind that we have NOT seen the last of the Wolf and I can not wait until the next novel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson used to write good novels.

I am the most perfect life form to walk this earth since the crust cooled enough for oceans to form. I have academic degrees out the bazootie, I am beautiful, more fit than an Olympic athlete, and I play jazz piano on the porch late at night and my neighbors never complain. (I never miss a note) Woman salivate at the very sight of my footprints. When I break wind, crowds rush to savor the fragrance. I have three kids. MIT repeatedly sends delegations of Nobel laureates to kneel and beg my big son to be president of their school, but I feel he should lead a normal teenage life. My daughter is even smarter and more beautiful. Every December we have her stand in the front yard instead of putting up Christmas decorations. People flock from miles around to bask in her glow. My little baby boy is so cute that he has been barred from the DC zoo; last time he visited, two elephants, four giraffes, a hippopotamus, and a whole herd of zebras died of diabetes, he is so sweet. My mother is the greatest fount of wisdom and home cooking that this world has ever been fortunate enough to host; we have s&eacute;ances so spirits can ask her for advice. However, a member of my family is guaranteed to undergo a terrifying, life-threatening disease in each novel, but they always manage to pull through. Whew! That suspense can knock your socks off.My job is, I'm a cop. My boss thinks I am a stupid idiot and always gets in my way as I ruthlessly track down evil genii (see how smart I am? Did you know the plural of genius?) When I finally track one down, I am apt to beat him to a pulp, shoot him sixteen times through the head, handcuff him, pour acid down his throat, weight him down with a refrigerator full of lead, and throw him in a shark feeding frenzy, but he will come back unharmed in the next novel to continue his depredations, because he is aided by an evil supergenius locked up in an ultra-security penitentiary.

It's not fair to plunk down money for a hardcover and find that the book doesn't end, that it is clearly setup for a sequel. To me, that is cheating.What is also cheating is that he simply isn't writing as well as he can anymore. Someone else commented that this feels like a first draft, and I agree. And I'm so disappointed because I really liked his earlier books, this man clearly has talent, but he doesn't have to work as hard anymore, his books will still sell.What I have noticed about this book and his more recent ones is that the pace is faster, but at the expense of believability and character depth. Everything is surface level, cardboard people doing wildly implausible things. His supervisor at the FBI is very antagonistic for the first half of the book, which you think is going somewhere, but then he just drops that story line.I'd rather have one book a year from him that is really good, than multiple books that are bad.All I can say for this one is wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Ok, so was it just me or did the end leave you thinking, weird?

Glad this was a library book and not something I had bought."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"You have try to understand what Patterson is doing. He isn't attempting \\"great writing.\\" It's suspense fiction, and is supposed to use a direct and powerful style. If the style was more elaboate it would get in the way of the plot. Having said that, this isn't his best book. The Wolf is an intersting character or could have been if more developed. But the premise of someone abducting sexy women to be used as sexual entertainment has been done so many times, it isn't an orginal plot. It does have the usual Patterson intensity, though, so many people will find it exciting. His novels are sort of dreamlike and he said they aren't meant to be taken seriously as reality driven stories. Just a more violent version of a cartoon, or maybe a puppet show. Anyway, careful on your way to grandmother's house, because there are a lot of Big Bag Wolves in the wolrd, and one will surely bite you some day."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I had always enjoyed reading James Patterson novels, hearing someone else reading it to me was a special adventure."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This is my first James Patterson book.

I enjoy being educated when I read a novel and Mr. Patterson did an excellent job of the Russian mob or whatever they are called. The Wolf fella was a bit over done.

My favorites are with Alex Cross and The Women's Murder Club."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"If you are an avid reader of thriller, you would be disappointed with the book. The plot has been used by many in the past except James Patterson has used the new media - the internet as the basis for conducting the abduction.This is the first time that I have read a book by James Patterson. He has a distinctive style of writing short chapters so that the reader could read and stop at will. However, in this book, the events have turned for a sudden twist after three quarters through the book. A lot of unexplained events took place that were without rationale based on how James Patterson have built the characters and far too many things were unanswered. How could the representative of the Wolf, who was so ruthless and fearless surrendered so easily? Why did the Sphinx hate his wife to trade her in? How did the lady light herself on fire to be saved? What has the cocker spaniel has to do with the plot?I feel that James Patterson should expand the book if necessary. No reader would mind that. There are books that contain thousand of pages and these are still best sellers. And James Patterson should remove unnecessary distractions like the cocker spaniel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This is an excellent example of James Patterson's writing.

But my favorite subject was stealth and tactics. I think this is a great book for you if you want to learn about the Green Berets or if you just want to learn how to be silent and deadly."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The long awaited next book in James Patterson's Alex Cross series is back with Alex now beginning his FBI career after being recruited by the new director Ron Burns. Readers of the series know that Alex has decided it is time to leave the Washington PD and continue his career elsewhere. Despite Alex's trepidations about bureaucracy within \\"The Bureau\\", Burns has convinced Alex that his police instincts and profiling skills would be incredibly useful as Burns tries to achieve the seemingly impossible task of eliminating both the bureaucrats and cowboys from the FBI's ranks. This is typical James Patterson, mostly two to four page chapters, a rapidly developing plot, minimal character development, and a clever villain with a violent streak. In juxtaposition is the pull of Alex's family, Little Alex, Jannie, Damon and Nana Mama as well as his long distance relationship with Jamilla Hughes.While Alex is involved in his FBI intake orientation and training, a series of widely scattered and very unusual unsolved abductions cause Director Burns to involve Alex in the case, creating enmity within the ranks (including from Alex's superior) due to the special treatment that he receives. There are no ransom demands, and Alex and his associates believe that the victims are being sold and traded as part of a white slave ring operated by wealthy individuals with bizarre and illegal inclinations. When two particularly high profile kidnappings catch the attention of the media, pressure increases on the FBI to solve the case and (not unexpectedly) a few clues create the suspicion that a shadowy figure (THE WOLF) whose existence has never been verified by the FBI is at the center of this kidnapping ring. He is reputed to be a former KGB agent who now is head of the Red Mafiya in the US, but there have been no clues to his identity or location. A few breaks create momentum that eventually makes Alex optimistic that they are on the trail of THE BIG BAD WOLF, but of course you know the villain will create several instances of misdirection and layers of reality for his pursuers to fight through. Meanwhile, Alex's personal world is rocked by the reappearance of Christine Johnson (Little Alex's mother) in DC and her desire to become a part of her child's life despite her (temporary and understandable) abandonment of him given the turmoil that a previous case of Alex's had caused in her life.This is a fastmoving, intricately plotted very fast read - you would be surprised at anything else in an Alex Cross story. And you have the \\"pleasure\\" of seeing Kyle Craig continue to play a (very peripheral ) role in Alex's life. The background element regarding the need to reform the FBI echoes the daily headlines and rings true. While the thread regarding Christine is interesting, there is much less involvement of Alex's family than in several of the other books. There is a great degree of violence, including the sexual incidents which are an integral part of the story, but in most cases the descriptions are very brief, and in only a few cases is there nauseous detail. Besides the obvious pursuit of the WOLF and the discovery of his real identity, the biggest mystery that the reader faces is whether this is a self contained story or whether it will simply be the first installment of several stories regarding the necessity of unraveling the several layers of the WOLF's identity. (You won't find out until the last ten pages.) And at the same time it is not clear whether Alex's complex relationships with Jamilla and Christine will be resolved. The factors that kept this from attaining a five star rating were the even more than usual number of loose ends to the story and the complete lack of any character development at all. I was especially disappointed at the minor role of Lili Olsen, a fourteen and a half year old (\\"going on twenty-four\\") computer genius whose abilities to hack into web sites help Alex despite the skepticism of his associates. She seemed a wonderful character with a lot of potential, but with the exception of one memorable line she simply disappeared as the story plunged forward.So when you want a quick read for a short flight or a rainy day, you will enjoy this if the Patterson formula appeals to you. But don't expect much detail, and be ready to suspend your belief about the plausibility of many of the events. Certainly not his best, but much more enjoyable than many for me because of the lack of gruesome detail contained in some of his other books.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"i really wanted to like this bookYou know I am not a whimp when it comes to reading books based on adult subjects.

That is often the case, especially after reading the back of the next book, the whole story line of Alex Cross, his personal and professional life is so well written that I can never tired of it. Each book is a chunk of his journey and like I always said, best enjoyed in order. His life is a journey, not a destination and people who only read one here and there will really miss out on the big picture.So Cross is finally in the FBI...but he's still using his street smarts and his DC cop ways to get information and never stops trusting his gut and his senses. His private life has settled nicely, the kids are doing well and his new relationship seems to be off to a solid start, but ghosts from the pasts are back and they want something form him, a part of him that will hurt to give up. On the work front he's stuck chasing someone very dangerous and deadly, someone called The Wolf, who's part of the Russian Mafia, someone who doesn't want to be found regardless how loud his conquests and atrocities are. Missing women are someone connected to a prostitution ring, one that leads to the Wolf. He's very tricky to catch and seems that one on really knows who he is as there are many crooks who are willing to protect his identity with their lives. There are some cool chase scenes and the usual suspense and now the distrust. After the discovery of the last mastermind, Cross feels that there are fewer people that he can trust than before and sooner or later one of them will get to him through phony friendly connections.

I'm usually very comfortable telling people that I liked a book or didn't like a book, and leave it at that. That is, I'm not usually one to qualify my opinion and say something like \\"I enjoyed it but admit it was kind of junky.\\" But I'm going to do something like that here with \\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" because, yes, I found myself quickly turning the pages and eating up the story, yet at the same time was telling myself that the story was all over the map, lacked subtlety and depth, and just wasn't very good. But, sigh, I really did shoot through it, and that definitely says something about a writer if he or she can produce that \\"gotta see what happens next\\" effect in a reader.Maybe this is a case of a writer being really good at telling a story but not so good at creating a solid tale to tell. In other words, what we may have here is a book featuring four-star DELIVERY of a story but only an actual two-star story. So what does one do? Average it out and give the book three stars!Oh, and in case I don't get around to reviewing it on its own, the sequel, \\"London Bridges\\", is exactly the say way: great pacing, economy of prose, etc., but not so much in the \\"memorable story elements\\" department, either.

It was the perfect book for a long airplane flight.Dr. Alex Cross is back, but this time, he has decided to switch over from the Washington, DC police force to the FBI. While still in training at Quantico, he gets called in on a case by the director, Ron Burns. White women have been disappearing all over the country. But until the beautiful, young wife of a federal judge is kidnapped, nobody has fit all of these cases together. Dr. Cross is just the man for the job. Unfortunately, some agents within the FBI aren't happy that Cross is now one of them. Rules were bent and jealousy abounds. It turns out that the kidnappings are actually being orchestrated by The Wolf, a former KGB member and a member of the Russian Mafia who is now operating in the US. Unlike some Patterson books, this one is a bit open-ended and I predict that we'll be seeing The Wolf in future books.The switch from the police to the FBI is an interesting one. While Cross usually worked well with the bureau, he's getting to see the flip side of the coin--one that often makes him angry. When he expresses his frustration to the director, Burns tells him \\"I don't blame you after what's been happening. The Bureau runaround, everything you were warned about. You have to understand something, Alex. I'm trying to turn around a very slow-moving ocean liner. In the Potomac. Trust me for a little longer.\\"As with most Patterson books, this one has elements of disbelief. But you won't find a better summer read."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Will the real James Patterson please stand up? Most Patterson loyalists have been waiting for this moment. When will the real Patterson emerge again? We've had glimpses of the greatness and BIG BAD WOLF (&quot;BBW&quot;) is no exception however, Patterson seems to just fall short time and again. It always seems worth the read just to determine if the magic has returned. Regardless and like most Patterson fans, I'll continue to buy and read his books until I tire of waiting for the real Patterson to stand up.Early in BBW, the Wolf, a renegade Russian mafiya soldier, is introduced to the reader. In something of urban myth fashion, the Wolf has gained underground notoriety as a ruthlessly cold killer without face or name. One particularly telling tale revolves around the Wolf's encounter with a jailed U.S. mob boss. As the story goes, the Wolf is able to walk into a 'super-maximum' security prison in Colorado to speak with jailed mob boss, don Augustino &quot;Little Gus Palumbo.&quot; Ostensibly, the Wolf has a proposition for Little Gus. The Wolf completes his business and walks out off prison grounds undeterred. The next day, Little Gus's body is found in his cell with virtually every bone in his body broken. Those familiar with Russian mafiya tactics know this as \\"Zamochit.\\" The urban tale became reality and the universal underground came to know that the Wolf's reputation was well deserved.At the end of the previous Cross iteration, Alex had just joined the FBI. As BBW opens, Alex is in the early stages of training at FBI headquarters. Given his impressive law enforcement background and experience, Alex is finding much of the \\"newbie\\" work and training quite rote however, ever the good trooper, Alex presses on and doesn't complain openly. Alex's theoretical training soon becomes on the job training. Alex is called in when the wife of a prominent judge is kidnapped in the parking lot of an Atlanta shopping mall. Unbeknownst to Alex, an underground, internet-based cabal of twisted individuals \\"places orders\\" for human slaves. This woman seems to have become the next victim of this perverse group.Alex is whisked from newbie orientation and flown to Atlanta. The Director of the FBI wants Alex on this case. Alex soon learns of the case and the fact that this isn't the first unsolved disappearance; to the contrary, the FBI has recent unsolved disappearances in several other states. The puzzling and troubling aspect of each of these disappearances is the total lack of contact, no ransom demand and no reappearance of the missing person. After a tip, the FBI is able to track down the two-person team responsible for the Atlanta kidnapping. The two turn out to be low-level associates in the Russian mafiya, Slava and Zoya. But, neither can shed any light on the whereabouts of the judge's wife as they are both found dead...Zoya, by means of Zamochit.The plot thickens when Alex and his FBI team run on to 14-year-old computer hacker Lili Olsen. It seems Lili, a modern-day Kevin Mitnick, has hacked her way into a secure chat room called &quot;The Wolf's Den.&quot; Lili clandestinely observes the dialogue between such aliases as Sterling, Mr. Potter, Sphinx, Marvel, and, of course, The Wolf. The dialogue centers on buying individuals with certain characteristics and attributes. However, the talk quickly descends to the depths of sickness when the discussion turns to disposal of these \\"slaves\\" and their willingness to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for their next minion.BBW has all the makings of a great Patterson offering. The storyline is brilliant however, where BBW falls short is character development and ultimately, climax. The reader has peripheral glimpses of the characters in this book, other than Alex, his kids, and Nana Mama. If Patterson had taken the time to truly allow the reader to see inside the characters, to know them, this novel would have been fabulous. Instead, it became a middle-of-the-road novel written by an author who used to write great novels. And, one of my great pet peeves of Patterson in his Cross novels, Alex always seems to find some personal tragedy in the midst of an intense investigation. It gets old. You want to scream, \\"When does Alex ever winOverall, this is a very readable and worth reading book. It is still not the Patterson of old but it is a reasonable offering."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have been disappointed with the last few Alex Cross books, and I suggested that James Patterson should retire Alex Cross as he was becoming a superman. Well, in this book there is still some superman to Alex Cross, but seeing Alex in training at the FBI and in a small office and being talked down to was a refreshing change of pace.The character of Wolf was the best villain that Cross has faced off against yet. There are many twists and turns in this one, and that will keep the pages turning. I also enjoyed that Patterson threw in a &quot;family crisis&quot; that really did not revolve around some type of attack at his home. All in all this book was very fun to read.As always with Patterson, if you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. Patterson's writing style if fast and sort of choppy. This is another of the famous 150 page books jammed into 400 pages. Some people may not enjoy a 2 or 3 page chapter, but I think it makes you want to read that one more chapter before turning off the lights.Overall, much better than the last few Alex Cross novels, and a fun, light, quick read!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Avid readers of James Patterson have been wondering lately if he'd lost his touch. The last two books in the Alex Cross series (Violets Are Blue and Four Blind Mice) were average at best, and some of his other works (The Jester and The Lake House) were downright atrocious. Fortunately, Patterson is back in true form with The Big Bad Wolf.At the end of Four Blind Mice, Cross left the Washington D.C. police department to pursue a career at the FBI. This is where we find him at the beginning of the book. Not long after his orientation, a major case begins brewing. Someone with ties to the Russian Mafia is kidnapping women all over the country, possibly forcing them into prostitution and slavery. It's up to Cross and his new team of agents to find these women before it's too late.Wolf contains all of Patterson's trademark twists and turns, and the last 50 pages are simply mind blowing. Never before have 400 pages flown by so quickly. He delivers yet another cliffhanger ending, leaving readers waiting in suspense until next November when the next book in the series will be released. Definitely worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and I can state that this is easily the most unrealistic, poorly written pieces of literature that I have ever read. This is likely one of the three or four worst books I have read in the past ten years. The characters are cardboard thin, there are plot gaps so wide you could drive a truck through it and a complete and utter failure in simple logic by the characters that was maddening and frustrating (*SPOILER WARNING* -- for example, if the CIA operatives could identify the Wolf, and were used by the FBI to eliminate one suspect, why didn't the FBI use those operatives to confirm the identity of other suspects?).My biggest complaint is that Patterson's villains used to be at least marginally grounded in reality (i.e., Soneji). Now, beginning with Kyle Craig and continuing into this novel, his villains are so far beyond the norm that I find them to be more in line with comic book super-villains than interesting characters for a novel (not leastly due to Patterson's infatuation with catchy nomikers, i.e. &quot;the Mastermind,&quot; &quot;the Wolf,&quot; &quot;the Sphinx,&quot; etc.). Without getting into too much detail, it appears that Alex Cross will need to be bitten by a radioactive spider in order to solve this case, since the Wolf is unstoppable by walls, hordes of armed policemen, or armed FBI agents in the middle of a secured facility (all without any explanation of how it was done). Move over, Alex Cross, this is a job for Superman!I cannot stress enough how disappointing this book is. While Cross is still a fine character, that is due to Patterson's much better earlier novels, which I would recommend, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone unless you are someone who obsessively must read every book in a series, in which case I at least recommend that you wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"to keep listening to Patterson's audio books. I have despised his books for years, but unfortunately, my library resources for audio books are very limited and I travel a lot.\\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" is about as bad as it gets. At the risk of repeating previous reviews, I must say that we'd be hard put to find a more amateurish, unsophisticated, boooooring writer of best-selling fiction. The only thing Patterson has going is a pretty good imagination for a general plot. It's all downhill from there.You will not find one original sentence or phrase in any of this guy's books. The descriptions are hackneyed and bring to mind 5th grade schoolwork. All characters are one dimensional and stereotypical.The protagonist, Alex Cross, is the most perfect human being to have ever lived. We know this because we're hit over the head with it over and over again, especially at the beginning of the story. Everyone throws compliments at him like confetti and superlatives abound. Of course, he takes it in stride because Cross is also modest. Perfect cop, perfect father, perfect son, perfect boyfriend. He must also be extremely lucky, since in this book he is able to bypass FBI prerequisites to get hired, skip most of his training, work on a major case, and get promoted all within a week or two. Wow!Not only is the hero a saint, but his children are well-behaved, beautiful and brilliant and his mother is the grouchy grandma with the heart of gold.Now, the victims are duly frightened and the villains truly villainous. \\"The Wolf\\" manages to murder his ex-wife at a large crowded party and escape without trouble or detection. For some reason, no one in the police or FBI is able to guess the identity of the killer. Huh?The holes in the plot (and I use the word generously) are too numerous to count. Some of the backstories are hinted at, but never followed through properly. But some things are just blatantly silly and unintentionally funny.\\"The Wolf\\" holds a kidnapped sex-slave in a closet, while living in a multi-million dollar mansion. What, he couldn't afford a whole room? The victim knows him as \\"The Wolf\\". I guess he must have introduced himself before he raped her. But at least we know that there must lights in the closet because the victim has seen The Wolf's very private tattoos.The dialogue is amateurish and ridiculous. The scenes between Cross and his family are nauseatingly saccharine. Listening to the cliched \\"thoughts\\" of the victim (and others) is worse than any soap opera on TV. I wish I could remember an example from the tape, but I found myself laughing out loud when I was supposed to by sympathetic. Patterson has no clue about how women think.I could go on and on with the faults of this book (and this writer, in general), but it would require reading or listening again and I don't have the stomach for it. Let it be said that Patterson would not know a lyrical, originally-phrased sentence if it bit him on the nose. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.There are hundreds of writers out there in this genre who could write rings around Patterson. Unfortunately, the average reader can't tell the difference. May I recommend Dennis Lehane, Robert B. Parker, Lee Child, James Lee Burke, Eric Handler, and the list goes on."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"'The Big Bad Wolf' is the 2003 edition to the Alex Cross series. It is also the best Alex Cross novel in years. 'The Big Bad Wolf' is the story of how Alex Cross joins the FBI and is thrust into a case involving the abduction and slavery of white, usually rich, suburban women. Along the way, Cross is frustrated by the politics of the FBI and faces turmoil at home when the mother of his youngest child returns to D.C. to seek custody. The reason for improvement can be traced to several sources.First, James Patterson actually had Cross do some investigative work. In the last several novels in the series, Cross tended to stumble upon leads and just wait for the 'bad guy' to screw up. In 'The Big Bad Wolf,' Cross puts his doctorate in Psychology to work. In addition, he follows his instincts and follows leads that not every one else had thought about.Second, Patterson seemed to put more thought and effort into this novel. In past novels, Patterson seemed to be living off the reputation of earlier novels in the series, such as 'Kiss the Girls' and 'Along Came a Spider.' More recent novels featured villains that were always one step ahead of the police without any real great tricks until Cross stumbles upon them. In 'Big Bad Wolf,' Patterson created lairs of intrigue from the beginning and lets them unfold throughout the novel instead of just springing them on the reader. In addition, a portion of the story takes place in Dallas, Texas. Since I live in the Dallas area, I was pleased to see that he did enough research to at least get most of the details of the area correct.Third, and this is a very minor spoiler, the 'bad guy' of the novel is not some high ranking government official or someone close to Cross. This theme had gotten redundant in recent novels in the series. This is not to say that there isn't betrayal present in the novel, there is, but its not exactly what you expect. In this regard, the novel is not as 'cookie cutter' as the few previous novels.My one complaint is that while a lot of effort seemed to have been placed in the first 3/4 of the novel, the last 1/4 of the novel seems to have been rushed. I'm afraid this is because he had written one novel, and then he decided to split it into two parts to save himself the effort of writing another Cross novel in 2004. This is only my suspicion, and I hope it is not played out with a lack luster follow up.While good, this is not the best novel in the series. Patterson's first two installments, 'Kiss the Girls' and 'Along Came a Spider,' are still the best, and have proven to be a tough act to follow. As mentioned earlier, this novel harkens back to those in feel and the effort put into it. Not everything was tied up neatly at the end of the novel, and I expect the next installment in the series will continue the story. As with all the novels in this series, it is quickly paced (with three and four page chapters), and it is full of pop-culture references. I recommend the novel for fans of thrillers and detective fiction."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson has thrown any attempt at character development, descriptive imagery, or even comprehensible narrative segues out the window in his haste to get from &quot;action scene&quot; to &quot;action scene&quot;; BBW reads more like a hastily-written screenplay than a novel. The books in this series have never been masterpieces from a purely literary standpoint, but it didn't matter because Patterson was a great storyteller; now it seems that that's fallen by the wayside as well. The split perspective and false endings are wearing thin, there are minor inexplicable plot threads appearing from and disappearing back into the ether, and the glut of false trails, haphazard and seemingly random conclusions, and superfluous characters makes the book seem disjointed and crowded, not more suspenseful or interesting. Also, Cross isn't really doing any detective or forensic work; what leads or breaks he gets are from people who are willing to talk, which is really what makes me wonder if Patterson is getting lazy, bored, or both. I want the old Alex Cross books back, the ones that took longer to write than to research; BBW was a real disappointment."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Well if Four Blind Mice was bad -- The Big Bad Wolf is pure trash. I've read all the Cross novels, but in this one, I didn't care if he lived or died or found love or treated his kids how they should be treated. He wasn't a character, he was a name on the paper. I cared about nobody in the book. And nothing ever really seemed to happen ... I thought it was just a slow start, and perhaps it still is (since the book is set up to have a sequel). If you're an Alex Cross fan, read it because of that reason -- but do not expect it to be an Alex Cross novel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This book started off so well-- i couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. Without giving anything away, I would just like to say that the ending was a HUGE disappointment and I felt as if nothing was ever solved. It just ended. Nothing was believable, you have no idea why the things that happened were happening and so many other story lines are left totally unsolved. I am so frustrated with this novel that i had to write a review :("},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"At a time when legitimate talents of the genre only make the best seller lists for a few weeks, hack work by Patterson just keep hanging on. First off, forget the Publishers Weekly review (have you ever read a bad review by these shills?). The characters are styrofoam. The plotting is pedestrian. The author continues to reveal himself as a woman-hater in his fiction. If you want great suspense, go for Harlan Coben. If you want clever writing, try Robert Parker. But please, save yourself the time and the money. Skip this piece of nonsense."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"You know you just threw this book together.

Come correct next time. Peace"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"One of my favorite characters is Alex Cross and I can't wait until Patterson pens a new adventure.

When will the next one be released?This was enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"What has happened to James Patterson? The PR, on this book, professed that it was going to be the best Alex Cross story, yet. ....it wasn't! I guess it serves me right for paying attention to PR! I didn't understand why the inclusion of the custody suit was handled the way it was...was this supposed to satisfy readers who want more of the detective's personal life included in the story? The ending is one of Mr. Patterson's well known tricks for supposedly making you want to buy his next book....I won't even borrow that one, the way I did this one. James Patterson is capable of writing really well....I wish he would try doing it, again. (Alone, without a co-author!)"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The only thing wrong with this book is that it ends in the middle of the story. It's not that there are some threads that naturally continue to the next installment of the series. The STORY of this book just ends. Is that what people call a surprise ending? Was it time for a paycheck so Mr. Patterson shipped a work in progress? I feel cheated."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Good thing James Patterson wasn't at my house when I finished this book. I have never been so angry after completing a novel. Be careful when people say this book is &quot;fast-paced&quot; or &quot;an easy read&quot;. It absolutely is. Only because the writing is at a grade schools level at best. There is no character development or scene development. It is as if you are reading a first person account from a robot. The only reason I kept reading it was I hoped it would improve. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!! I wanted to mail it back to the publisher. If you enjoy descriptive literature you will be sorely disappointed. And you will feel like a sucker for purchasing it. Just like I did."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross is back, and with a brand new nemesis; his nickname is Wolf, and no one seems to know his true identity. All that is certain is that he is fearless, very dangerous, and Russian Mafia. In addition to a host of other illegalities, he is also involved in the disappearances of many women nationwide--and the disappearances look as though they may have connections to White slavery (hence the case's nickname--White Girl).But there's not just murder and mayhem here. In addition to trying to track a killer, Alex is adjusting to life in the FBI--and all of the red tape that accompanies life as a federal agent. He misses the gritty street action that made his career on the DC police force the success that it was--and he is resented by many in his new federal home for the preferential treatment that he receives. To further add to the confusion, ex-love Christine Johnson is back--ostensibly for their son,little Alex. Having left the boy in his father's care well over a year ago to live in Washington state, she has apparently succombed to her maternal instincts and has decided that she wants him to live with her.Patterson, as is the case with all of the Cross novels, does not disappointment. Just when we think we know who the Wolf is, we realize that we don't. There are also quite a few surprises that will certainly leave the reader breathless--and wanting for more. I feel certain that the Wolf and Mr. Cross will meet again--sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Lake House was one of the few books I've ever dropped in the middle and just forgotten about. I read Big Bad Wolf (what a rotten title, it brings to mind the stupid Werewolf books by Cornwell of late) in a few hours and came to a couple of conclusions:1) Patterson is great at developing sketches of characters I'd like to read more about (ie. Lili the hacker). In fact, Patterson has a world of great characters now in the \\"1st to Die\\" Murder Club gang and the Alex Cross books.and 2) Patterson has apparently become too big to allow a decent editor to help him. When the Wolf tried to assassinate Sterling under the noses of the FBI and Cross pushed Sterling behind a car to save him.... how could that be dropped? A big old limo tries a drive-by shooting with the cops all over the place and nothing happens? How could the threat to Cross' family be dropped (the threat to his family is even in the book description). As someone else mentioned, in a house full of cops, why was it Cross who had to break down the closet door? And then, to top it off, the identify of the Wolf was changed on us in a cheap cheat."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I swore after reading &quot;When the Wind Blows&quot; that I would not give James Patterson another chance. He used to write such wonderful thrilling books. I can't believe the same man who wrote &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot; is writing his recent books. I feel like one of the other readers who was angry over the bits of plot being suddendly dropped and never heard from again. I don't understand, if Alex thinks the real Wolf is still at large, is his family suddenly not a tartget anymore? We are led to believe that the Wolf will destroy anyone who has negatively crossed his path. What about a few words at the end as to how the Connely woman has faired her enormous problems of late, what was the deal the Sphinx made, what about that 14 yr. old girl who hacked into the sight, what about Nooney?My biggest problem of all though is how idiotic this book makes the police and FBI look. Every suspect they surround with all of their FBI powers, suddenly gets away ??!! Why does is come down to the very end before an FBI agent thinks to take out a kneecap to capture a suspect alive ??!! Do they not watch TV ??"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This is the last book i will read from James Patterson .I was glad the book was on loan and i didn't have to pay .Don't waste your time with the latest addition of Alex Cross.If you like a book that starts half a page down or ends at half a page up than this is the book for you and i alsolike the way Patterson doesnt finish the book,this way you can buy the next unfinished book he writes ."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"After reading the last Alex Cross based novel (Violets are Blue) I was very, very disappointed (if you read Roses are Red first, then Violets are Blue is useless...but that's a whole different book). Big Bad Wolf offers twists and turns and it helps if you know some about Alex Cross before reading this novel. I had read all 23 of Patterson's book so there was no way I wasn't going to read this novel--good or bad. It turned out to be good. Very good.The short chapters keep it quick and it's near impossible to put this one down. Twist after twist keep you guessing all night long. There is, however, one problem with this book: it ends and another Patterson book doesn't come out tomorrow!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I feel this is probably the best James Patterson book yet and I've read them all. From page one this book keeps you enthralled and on the edge of your seat. This book would make a great holiday gift for someone you love!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am a fan of James Patterson's. I love his Alex Cross series of books and get very excited when a new book in the series is released, but lately, I've found his books to be less than engaging (even though I'm still going to buy them). After finishing &quot;The Big Bad Wolf,&quot; I went back and looked through all my other Alex Cross books, to see just where Patterson's talent and skill started to disappear. I believe it began in &quot;Roses are Red,&quot; which also boasted a horrible hanging ending like this novel.And his novels can't really be considered novels much anymore, more like novellas. The type is (created word coming up) gynormous, which allows him to fill 400 pages very easily, when if written in normal style, the work would probably not hit 200 pages. Not to mention the multiple uses of italics to convey sometimes entire paragraphs and the hilarious use of exclamation points!!! I just don't believe I can take an author seriously who relies on exclamation points (!) to convey emotion. Exclamation points (!), to me, have no place in the prose of a work. Use of (!) is acceptable in quotations, but in prose? &quot;Come on!!!&quot; (I put that last sentence in quotations so I could justify myself.)And now we arrive at the issue of plot. Some reviewers have pointed out that the plot of this novel is fast-paced. They can't possibly have read the same book that I did. True, the sections involving the kidnappings, the Wolf, his accomplices, and the other men from the chatroom are engaging and make the reader want to know a little more about the villain, but the sections involving the FBI are slow and drawn out; the one exception being when Alex and his partner are chasing Sphinx, but even then, the revelation of Sphinx's identity is a bit of a betrayal to the reader. (SPOILER AHEAD) If Patterson had planted little clues when Alex met Brendan Connelly, then the reader wouldn't have felt cheated (like I did). (END SPOILER) That tidbit aside, I did think the plot was interesting. Sure, it was a bit far-fetched, but how many plots of mystery and suspense novels aren't?Now I want to address my largest complaint of all, and then, I promise, no more complaints. My biggest complaint? The lagging holes. Okay, I get that the Wolf's this sadistic, insane man who will kill anyone that gets in his way, but could there have been a little more depth to the character? (SPOILER AHEAD) When he's first introduced, he's introduced as the Wolf, and Ari Manning (his name in America), and as Pasha Sorokin (his given Russian name). If all that was true, then why, once the FBI found the Wolf/Ari/Pasha, did he deny everything: him being the Wolf, him even being at the house in the first place? (if I'm wrong, I apologize, but that's what I understood) If he weren't the real Wolf, wouldn't Alex have recognized that it wasn't the real Pasha or Ari or whoever he was when they apprehended the man at the store? And then Pasha, or whoever, says he'll give up the real Wolf, only to have himself blown to bits in a hilariously bad open ending. So, if Pasha weren't the real Wolf, then why did he call himself such? And if he simply wanted to be the Wolf, and pretended he was, then does that mean the reader never actually saw the real Wolf? That's a bit disconcerting, when the real villain doesn't even appear until the very last page. And one more thing, when the Wolf shot at Alex from the limousine and Alex dropped to ground to avoid being shot (somehow he knew), why was that not addressed in the next chapter? I'm sure the FBI would've destroyed a passing limo in which someone was firing a gun at an agent. If the gun were silenced, then why wasn't there any reference to that, and just how did Alex know -- that never was addressed.(END SPOILER -- I know, it was a long one)All in all, though a few parts were disappointing, the book as a whole was pretty good. Never did I want to put the book down and not finish reading it (if only because I feel a need to finish a book once I start it), and I really do like James Patterson's work (the Alex Cross series and the Women's Murder Club series being my favorites -- which leads to another problem: Patterson's work was especially great in &quot;1st to Die&quot; (I wonder if he had a good ghostwriter?) so why can't he continue to do that in the Alex Cross books? I know, I know, I said no more complaining, but I lied.).If you like James Patterson and can forgive his simple sentences and sometimes mediocre writing, then you'll enjoy &quot;The Big Bad Wolf.&quot; It's a nice addition to the Alex Cross series; I just hope that the next book will tie up these loose ends with a bit more of a bang than did &quot;Violets are Blue&quot; with the Kyle Craig/Mastermind case.Also Recommended:Anything by Jeffery DeaverAnything by Chuck Palahniuk&quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; by Dave Eggers"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I'm a Patterson fan but was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Who is the Wolf? Who is the FBI mole? Who is Marvel? Was the sniper after Alex? How did Alex know the Wolf was shooting at Lipton? There were so many things unexplained that I felt like I wasted hours in reading this book. Alex was billed as a long wolf himself but he never went after the Wolf by himself. I was getting worried when I was running out of pages with no ending in sight. Sure enough, the pages ran out and what a stupid ending. Chapter 116 through Epilogue needs to be rewritten. What a joke!!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I enjoyed this book but the ending was disappointing...just hanging I felt like i was at the end of the movie and they left it for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Hmmm, I wonder if Mr. Patterson plans to write a follow up to this novel? Could he have left more things unresolved? The Wolf, the sniper, little Alex, his new love interest, and those are just the ones I remember. The book was entertaining, but I felt mislead. I don't have a problem with leaving a small opening for sequels, but what he has done here is written half a novel. I can only assume &quot;Big Bad Wolf II&quot; is around the corner."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson contains many of the same elements that law-enforcement thrillers frequently include; a brilliant protagonist with a tragic past, a few equally brilliant collaborators, a very bad bad-guy, resistance from within the \\"system,\\" and well-intentioned but incompetent coworkers. A prolific writer, Patterson's subject matter for this novel, the sexual slave trade, has a high squeamish index. Recent newspaper articles highlighting the enormity of the global slave trade, (estimates put the number at over 1 million women and children) and the proliferation of Internet porn site, (now estimated at 1.3 million sites) make this a timely, if unsettling subject matter. It will get you half-way to San Francisco."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson is one of my favorite thriller writers...but I have a difficult relationship with his work. All the Alex Cross thrillers are great (especially the early ones). The Roses-Violet books were great. I also really liked his recent non-Cross novels as well (The Beach House and especially The Jester, which I hope he writes a sequel to). Four Blind Mice was just horrible, definitely the weakest Cross novel. The Lake House was not only Patterson's worst novel ever, it was also one of the worst novels I've ever read. While Big Bad Wolf is a huge step up from Four Blind Mice, Patterson just doesn't write with the creativity and wit he did with the early books (esp. in regard to his recent villians, who are laughably over-the-top and dumb) and Cross is not a three dimensional human being anymore so much as a cutout popular-fiction archetype. I also really hate how Patterson brings in old characters for a few sentences throughout the whole book (his ex-partner Sampson, his kids who pretty much are only around to complain he doesn't spend enough time with them, and Nana, whose job now it seems is to pop up every few chapters and instill Alex with advice and guidance then dissapear again. These recent dissapointments do not take away from his early work. If you are reading this review and have yet to read a Patterson book, get any Alex Cross book written before &quot;Roses are Red&quot;."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross outdoes himself as the FNG at the FBI. Disdaining the bureacracy of the fibbies, he uses his street smarts to undo a white slavery ring. Patterson provides another great read in the Alex Cross series. I always envision Morgsan Freeman as Cross since his lead in the Spider film."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson books are very entertaining trash that is fun and quick to read.

This is not the elegant prose of Patterson's earlier novels that completely drew you in and made the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Unfortunately, this offering felt more like a first draft."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Jame Patterson's greatest talent is pushing the plot along. There is little wasted space. The main exception to this is his annoyingly bland efforts to give his hero a real life. This is a life filled with stock characters, political correctness and interactions that do not ring true. I wonder if Patterson can \\"hear\\" what real families say. Pushing the plot is one thing but in this offering in particular there is little connection between the hero's insights and detecting skills and the \\"capture\\" of the villian. He discovers no clues. There are just \\"breaks\\" in the case and he is simply an observer. Of course \\"capture\\" is an illusive concept and the villian is captured at least twice and is never quite the right guy. But again, there is no reason for this. In a well written mystery the reader should be able to look back and say \\"I should have seen it coming.\\" Not here -- it's seat of the pants writing."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I was really aggravated reading all the poor reviews of this book! I'm glad I bought the book in an airport book store for something to read. I had read all the other Alex Cross books and hadn't seen that one yet, so I was excited and bought it. If I had relied on the reviews here, I would not have bought the book and would have missed out on one of Patterson's greatest books in the Alex Cross series! What is wrong with people these days?

I personally just can't wait till the sequel comes out - Mr Patterson, don't keep us waiting too long....HURRY!!!! :)"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"As a long time fan of James Patterson. I am extremely disappointed. While I have enjoyed his last few novels that DID NOT involve Alex Cross, I am having to say that I wish he would give Alex Cross a much needed vacation. If he can't come up with a better story plot than what this Big Bad Wolf book had, then maybe James Patterson should take a vacation also. The book ended horribly, obviously leaving it open for another book but I will not be rushing out to buy or borrow the next &quot;wolf&quot; book which will inevitably be on the book shelves before we can blink. I have one thing to say.. BIG BAD BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I've read every Patterson book to date, and am a big Alex Cross fan. This, however, is ridiculous. Big Bad Wolf makes little pretense at being anything other than the introductory chapters of a novel. It does not stand on its own, having little development other than the now-obligatory (and blatantly predictable) &quot;fake-out, wrong suspect&quot; scenes. The Kyle Craig two-booker was interesting. This is just a ploy by Patterson to get 40 bucks for one mid-length novel and a lot of filler."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I was very disappointed with this Alex Cross Novel. It reads like Patterson quit on the last half of the book. The action just doesn't match up with the plot. Everything happens too fast and too easy.

Just when it seemed like Alex was finally going to get him, surprise! The guy they apprehended was not the Wolf after all. He seems to be the toughest and most ruthless criminal Alex Cross has faced yet. The next novel in the Alex Cross series always picks up where the previous one left off, so I am looking forward to the next &quot;Wolf&quot; book. I was disappointed by the fact that Christine was awarded custody of Little Alex. I was hoping that Alex and Jamilla would finally get together, but not in this novel! I did miss some of the interaction with John Sampson. Hopefully we'll see more of him in the next novel. I'm not sure why there are so many reviews that were negative. I thought the writing was clear, and I wasn't confused by who any of the characters were. I plan to read 3rd Degree next...I can't get enough of James Patterson's books!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"After the total fiasco of The Lake House, I was looking forward to getting back to Alex Cross.

I'll wait for the paperback (second-hand at that) and save my money!This book was not as bad as The Lake House, but it wasn't all that good. Short, choppy sentences; lots of italics; no depth to the characters. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs; you can just read the first and last sentence in a chapter and pretty much know what's going on.I like books that &quot;take me away&quot; -- this book was one that I just wanted to get away from!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Wow, I looked over other reviews and it seems people either really loved or hated this book. Some of the \\"hated\\" reviews were by those who are reading Patterson for the first time. Please understand, while each book can and does stand alone, this is an ongoing story of the life and times of Alex Cross, former detective, now a FBI agent. There is a history behind Cross and his family. Before you judge too harshly, maybe it would be a good idea to read a few of his newer novels to get an idea of just who Alex Cross is, where he comes from, and how his family and friends interact.I found this to be a great book. Once again, Patterson left me on the edge of my seat. The action and suspense were great and the characters took on lives of their own. There are plenty of plot twists and the ending is huge.Someone is kidnapping people to sell to collectors. Any and all fantasies can be fufilled if you have enough money. Cross, new to the FBI, is assigned to find the \\"Wolf\\", the man believed to be responsible for the human slave trade. At the same time, Cross is trying to deal with his own personal crisis at home.Patterson delivers another solid performance. I can't wait to read the sequel to find out if the Wolf is captured and what happens to Cross's personal life. So if you love the Alex Cross series, you will love this one. If you haven't read any before now, do yourself a favor and pick up a couple so you can understand where Cross has come from.

This book in particular is the worst yet."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"this is a disappointing book. gets all mushy with alex cross joining the FBI etc. i am used to fast paced thrillers from patterson, and this is not one!!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Don't get me wrong, if you're a huge Alex Cross fan you'll be on the edge of your seat until the very end of this book (which is disappointing to say the least). If you're new to Patterson or the Alex Cross series I'm sure you'll find a more entertaining ride elsewhere.Alex Cross battles the most fearsome killer he's ever met (what, again?)...yes again. It seems that every new Alex Cross he fights a more fearsome villian. When reading this book its easy to see where it first starts to go downhill. The plot is engrossing but the characters are completely unbelievable! At first glance, the Wolf seems like a believable character, as well as those he works with. But as the book carries on the Wolf, mainly, becomes more and more unbelievable as a character. He has no developement...like say...Gary Soneji (Along Came a Spider, Cat&amp;Mouse). The Wolf continues Patterson's trend of &quot;Super-Villians&quot;, if you will.The plot and story of the book isn't too bad. The Wolf hires hitmen to go out and kidnap innocent people off the street...who have been purchased at an online site called &quot;The Wolf Den.&quot; The story is full of plot-twist as well.Alex Cross fans will find this to be a bit different from the past novels. For one, Cross is no longer with the Washington P.D. but now with the FBI. However, this continues Patterson's slide into how his character can be unbelievable at times. Cross is indeed a smart man but that doesn't mean he has to be perfect, as Patterson has now created him to be. However, Cross is still a great protagonists, but if you been with Alex Cross since &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; you'll definitely notice change.Not to mention if you're new to the Alex Cross series, this book actually won't make much sense. Patterson makes references to other books in the series. Nothing big but you'll find yourself scratching your head if you haven't read 'em.Lastly is the ending. If you don't like cliffhanger endings, don't read this book, you'll be left with unanswered questions at the end (and because of Patterson's &quot;formula&quot; you'll have to wait several books later for the conclusion).Overall, I'll give the book 4 stars. The MAJOR problem with this book are the characters. Totally unrealistic, unbelievable characters. So if you're looking for a thriller to scare you, this isn't it. &quot;The Big Bad Wolf&quot; isn't such a bad book afterall."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Is this what Patterson does best? This was my first book written by him and I read it because everyone else on my vacation was reading it. It was uneventful, illogical, and just plain unbelievable. It failed to excite and entertain. I will be hard pressed to pick up another Patterson book when there is so much more better written material out there!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"What is Alex Cross up to now that Kyle Craig is behind bars? Well he has decided to join the FBI. While he is having a bit of an unorthodox initiation training into the force he is pulled off of a couple of cases.Someone is out there kidnapping housewives and other unsuspecting middle class people without ransom, or any other clues. The person who is behind this is a new \\"bad guy\\" in the mix. He is known as the Wolf and he is a very dangerous former Russian who rules with an iron hand.Can Alex find him and those in his organizations and stop the kidnapping before more people are hurt?While this audio was unabridged at times it felt like Patterson had left out some parts. It may be that this book felt like he is setting up a new series and didn't spend as much time on his characters as he normally does. But, it might have just been my impression.Though I still enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Contrary to what some of the other readers expressed, I thoroughy enjoyed this book. And am now annoyed that I have to wait to find out who the &quot;Wolf&quot; is in the next book.I really hope he writes it fast.This was a fun book to read, lots of plot twists and interweaving of story lines and characters. Keep it up Mr.Patterson."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thought the premise and writing, amateurish and stunted. A master criminal, controlling billions with a global empire, is personally running a low-budget, kidnapping-for-sex business, which would not have covered the overhead? Patterson wisely had half of the cast speaking in broken English so that complex sentences were not necessary. Seems as though everyone is looking for their serial bad guy to compete with Hannibal Lector, but there aren't enough writers like Thomas Harris to go around. It's just the next movie script. Let's hope for a great director."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I won't waste my time on this one. Needless to say, this is an author more interested in feeding the apparent insatiable appetite of Alex Cross fans than creating a compelling story. &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; and &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; were novels written by a promising new writer who cared about his craft; wanted to create a character that would live on for years to come. &quot;The Big Bad Wolfe&quot; is so sloppy and unsatisfactory that I had to go back to make sure I hadn't missed something. This one made me sick. See ya Alex. I don't care about you any longer."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have to agree with those who started with the first Cross story. Patterson gives us nothing new as to who Cross is. He has been robotic in the last novels. The &quot;split&quot; novel of Roses and Violets seems to repeat itself here with an unsolved crime and a bad guy on the loose..... to be continued. Ican only give it one star because its a Cross novel but very little else. I'd rather he abandon the character than toture him to death with these less than honest efforts. Robert PArker has kspt Spencer fresh and entertaining a lot longer than Cross has been around."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross has decided to join the FBI at a time when a villain called the Wolf is running a white slave operation. At the same time, Alex's former girlfriend has returned to challenge him for custody of their young son. He is removed from his FBI training and is put in the middle of the search for the Wolf, presumably because of his extensive police training and experience. James Patterson balances these intertwining plots in Alex's personal and professional lives with a deft hand. His short chapters keep the action moving, and Alex's family scenes show his human side. This book should please Alex Cross fans and should gain some new ones for James Patterson."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"One of the best experiences you can have on a Friday night is to curl up with the newest James Patterson Alex Cross serial killer hunt and read all night long.

It was one of those reads that you don't want to put down (as are most of James Patterson's novels)."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad Wolf had a sufficient amount of tension and moved along at a nice pace, but what it suffered is that neither the plot, the situation or the characters were remotely believable. The Wolf is an ultra shadowy Russian mafioso who is invisible, omniscient and omnipotent. He can do anything he wants, any time he wants, and has no limitation on reach or resources. He's not a credible character. If you look at the history of law enforcement, the law officers know who the bad guys are, but they often can't build up enough evidence to arrest and convict them. The Wolf is built as this hands on character, who gets in the middle of all of this shady business, but nobody knows who he is or what he looks like. The plot disintegrates into ridiculousness by the end, when The Wolf has all of these impersonators and just when it seems like they are going to nail him, guess what, it's not The Wolf. I wasn't buying any of it, and although the story was reasonably entertaining, it wasn't very good.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I read the spanish version of this book. I was very surprised but in the wrong way. Patterson is very famous due his capacity to write best sellers. Apparently, the Alex Cross saga is his most affortunated serie. However, the book (in Spanish El lobo de Siberia) is full of clich&eacute;s and resources recommended for apprentice writers only. Using the simile between one of the victims and Claudia Shiffer to give an idea of the character is over used. Same thing happens with the nick name of Dragons' killer to give us the image of Cross for the FBI people. Cross does not have a failure in any role of his life, this is unbelivable. Finally, I think that is a betray of the author to hidden information to justify the final and the openness to prepare a second part of this saga with the Wolf. I respect Mr. Patterson for his 80 millions dollar contracts, not per this book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"if you have followed the path of Dr. Alex Cross, you will enjoy this book. a typical Patterson book that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you enthralled until the final page."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I highly recommend the Alex Cross series. James Patterson is a master at shocking twists that will knock you out of your chair! Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Excellent. You will not want to put the book down. It is amazing how James Patterson's characters evolve. You never know how it is going to turn out."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf by James Patterson was written in 2003.The main character of The Big Bad Wolf is Doctor Alex Cross, andthere are many adjectives to describe his character. Doctor Alex Cross isa determined person. He is determined to find out where all of the womenare after they are kidnapped. Alex Cross is a very brave detective. He isvery brave because he is trying to hunt down and arrest The Wolf, one ofthe most notorious of all mob bosses. Aside from that, Alex Cross is adetective, husband, and a father.There were two conflicts in The Big Bad Wolf. The first conflict isthe fact that the girls are being kidnapped and killed. The secondconflict, which is a major conflict is the Wolf. He is the Russian MobBoss. He is very dangerous and notorious for killing many innocent people.I would recommend this book to adults and high school students. Iwould recommend this book to people who like mysteries. Another reasonwhy I would recommend this book is because it is a short book to read,but it is still interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book to kids underthe age of twelve. This book is very violent, some sexual parts, and somevulgar language."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I enjoyed this book, it captivated my attention more than, the last Alex Cross book i read, \\"Violets are Blue\\" I think i may even go back and purchase three blind mice."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have read a few of James Patterson's books before, but this one made him one of my favorite authors. The tale is written in such a way that you can't put it down. The way that Patterson switches perspectives make for easy reading. This is definitely one for my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad wolf is another great suspenseful novel by James Patterson. Big Bad Wolf is another Alex Cross novel. In this book Alex has joined the FBI, and before Alex has finished his classes at Quantico he is assigned to a case that deals with the kidnappings of people to be sold as slaves on a type of internet black market known as the Wolfs Den. This is when agent cross encounters the Russian mobster with and member of the red mafiya only known as the Wolf, but in a normal life is a very successful buisness man with plenty of cover and money. Throught the book its mainly Detective Cross searching for leads as two why these kidnappings are happening. Just like other Patterson novels the chapters are short making you want to continue to read. Also a very important event happens in this book dealing with Alex's family. Without spoiling the ending, you can clearly tell a sequeal is eminent."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Big Bad Wolf, $7.99 US, will find you rooting enthusiastically for Alex. This ninth installment in the Alex Cross Series, penned by James Patterson, finds Special Agent Cross engaged in an unfathomable battle with a steely Russian mob figure -- a predator known only as the Wolf -- whereby he vaults from state to state in his official FBI capacity, desperately bidding to save the life of an abducted suburban mom and several other endangered captives. When lives hang precariously, can Cross cut red tape and avoid the bureaucratic inertia of his Bureau cohorts?Across the USA, men and women are being kidnapped in broad daylight, never to be \\"heard from\\" or \\"seen\\" again. There are no discernable commonalities or patterns in the disappearances, which leads Cross and his team to deduce that the victims aren't being seized for monetary ransom. So what's going on? Americans are being bought and sold (slave trade) domestically, by organized crime, for massive profit, that's what! Can Cross put an end to this misery of human trafficking? What personal toll will be exacted on Alex for daring to bring down The Wolf?Drawing on your heartstrings is something Patterson is expert at. Listen to him sympathetically describe Mrs. Elizabeth Connolly, 37, who is the victim abducted by two of The Wolf's underlings from Phipps Plaza in Atlanta for an exorbitant $150,000 fee. \\"\`Mom' (what the target was labeled) was sexy in the wholesome, clean-cut way of many upscale American suburban women. And she did resemble the supermodel Claudia Schiffer. That was her undoing.\\" Patterson makes Lizzie an Everywoman, (career sacrificed for her husband the Judge, and three daughters) and yet she's atypical, stunningly visual in her appeal.Writers like Patterson are at their peak when they're heaping fresh and devilish problems upon their protagonists. So it seems very realistic when Alex's class supervisor at Quantico, Gordon Nooney, wants to hold the \\"rising star\\" down by tossing barbs at him, by baiting him, bringing up his past troubles and demonstrating he's clearly upset at the special considerations that have been extended to the FNG. I wish I could say that James didn't telegraph where he was going with this particular character, but it was very obvious from early on in Big Bad.One of the more interesting characters Patterson has ever dreamt up -- Lili Olsen -- left quite an impression on me. A precocious teen hacker from Dale City, Virginia, Lili's managed to crack the encryption on a secure chat room where murder and kidnapping are being discussed openly by at least six people who appear to be making \\"purchases\\" of some sort. The agent that fielded her original call screwed up, so FBI researchers Alex and Monnie Donnelly take it upon themselves to do the follow-up. Lili's return in future Cross would be favored!Long hours spent away from his home base on the \\"White Girl\\" case also inflict some damage on Alex's personal life, when former girlfriend Christine Johnson makes a sudden reappearance to seek full custody of Alex Jr. in the middle of the SA's first important investigation for the FBI. Threats against the Cross family eventually trip Alex up. When Christine is given temporary guardianship of Alex Jr. in the final chapter of the book, and flies away to live in *Seattle, I promise you, all of Patterson's longtime readers will shed some crocodile tears.Fans of Alex Cross will delight in the new direction Patterson has charted for his hero by removing him from that somewhat limiting role in D.C. and developing him into a federal agent. This tactical move seemed overdue, and it guarantees more globetrotting adventures and more inner turmoil for the venerated detective. Patterson fans recognize the FBI job Alex has garnered makes for better reading, and it's kind of enjoyable watching Alex get dumped on (deservedly so) for piling dangerous career responsibilities on his \\"already crowded plate\\" at the expense of his loving family."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"If you are a Patterson Lover, and have not grown tired of the \\"I am Alex Cross and all my friends are either crazed killers who I am tracking and don't know it...or I have a ton of problems and yet still manage to solve the crime\\"...this tale is for you. After a much needed break [I had decided that I needed to give Alex Cross a little rest and enjoy some of Patterson's other works,like the winged people....now that was interesting and I enjoyed it] I picked up in the series where I left off....Big Bad Wolf. Unfortunately, after reading it I felt a little out of sorts and had to ask myself the question...\\"just what do I think of this novel?\\" I really had to search within myself and decide what was it that I just didn't get? Or is it that I got it, but wasn't sure if I liked it?Well for starters we still have the ever present Alex Cross, who has left the DC PD and decided to go Federal (FBI);then there's \\"Mama Nana\\" or whatever he calls his mother, who quietly states the obvious;his friend, Sampson who makes a cameo appearance and states that he is expecting a child; his absent girlfriend (Jamilla) who appears to be a little too mysterious for my taste at first, but appears periodically throughout the thriller (encouraging phone calls no less, hope she doesn't turn out to be a killer); Kyle (his psychotic ex-friend who use to work for the FBI); and a few others. Patterson also introduces new characters, like Monty (FBI computer expert, single with kids) and Mahoney (an eager partner who loves the excitement of having a partner who is willing to think out of the box....so I am sure he will either ultimately be killed or be the crooked FBI agent that is being paid off by the Wolf). Unfortunately, most of my rating is based solely on the love I have for Patterson's creativity and not so much about my love of the book. Although there was A LOT of potential (I loved the mystery surrounding who the Wolf really is) it was a little confusing. Patterson spent the first have of the novel introducing a sadistic, kidnapping couple and killed them early on. He introduced a concept of white slavery among the rich...which was interesting, but then it seemed forced by introducing so many other \\"bad things\\" that the wolf was involved in....it just all seemed a little FORCED. Oh and another thing, because I am not in love with the character of Alex's baby's mother, Christine, I did not enjoy her reappearance after being absent for over a year. I didn't care about her as a character and wondered why she was coming back. It just seemed that while Alex was trying to solve his first case while joining the FBI, he just didn't need the drama surrounding his exgirlfriend's decision to claim their son. Of course I know, and you will too when and if you complete it, that the whole book is set up for the sequel, but I am not sure that I want to read it. OK, I probably will!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"For ages 15 and up. FBI Agent in training Alex Cross is back in the award winning novel The Big Bad Wolf by: James Patterson. There is a crime spree happening all across the U.S. Women in their early 30's to early 40's with very good looks are being abducted and no one ever hears from them again. They are being purchased for a lot of money. The culprit is a man named the Wolf a very rich and powerful Russian who is now known as the \\"Godfather.\\" One of the Wolf's signature moves is to break all ot the bones in the person's body. He is kind of leaving his mark on the people he kills. This book should be read of course by people who like mystery books, but it has some language and scenes meant more for people above the junior high level."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"A pervious reviewer hit it on the nose. Patterson can't write. It astonishes me that he's a best seller, considering the putrid crap that he produces. A 4th grader with a crayon could put together a more compelling storyline. Steven Segall movies have better developed characters.Try a decent thrill writer like John Le Carre."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross is back, and at his best. At the request of the Director, he has joined the FBI. His Quantico training gets interrupted by a case though, involving a string of missing beautiful, rich women, who have been kidnapped with no ransom and are feared to be part of a slave trade. At the core of the evil empire is a Red Mafiya figure known as \\"the wolf\\", who's the baddest man on the planet. Will Alex survive the personal dangers involved with stalking the wolf? Will his family?Like all Patterson books, this one is a lively read, full on rapid fire action in micro-chapters, and laced in sometimes unnatural profanity. For example, at one point we meet a 14 year old computer hacking genius, who upon first meeting our hero, rudely replies to a nice question with a profane remark -- seemed out of character to me. Be warned - Patterson doesn't tie up all the loose ends at the end of this book, as I'm sure he anticipates some elements of this story to flow into future Alex Cross books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This book is a great continuation on the story of Alex Cross. For a moment I thought after 4 Blind Mice that was it..but reading about his transition in the FBI gets one to know the character even better and follow him as he accustoms himself to new procedures. Apart from that, The Wolf is one of the best foe's I've met and his way of being leads into the mind of a true psycopath. I can't wait to read London Bridges where I'll get reacquainted with the Weasel and the Wolf. James Patterson promises a definite suspense thriller on that one!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am a big fan of Jame Patterson's Alex Cross series and was hooked from reading &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;. However I am getting tired of them ... almost as tired as his plotlines. This novel had no real ending (I am presuming that this is to encourage us the read the next novel) and I certainly did not get as involved with this story as with previous ones.Alex Cross' situation has developed slightly, what with his relationships and joining the FBI and that was welcome, but I miss the strong bond with Sampson which seems to have gone in this novel. It simply feels empty and like Patterson has lost his bite. I will definitely think twice before buying the next one."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"AS USUAL, I ENJOYED JAMES PATTERSON'S LATEST.

Now Alex is back, with a new job and a whole lot of trouble, personal and professional...In this novel, James Patterson keeps you guessing and artfully weaves his story line through twists and turns that will keep you turning those pages and the coffee pot going.This might be one of the best novels I've read for a while, buy this one - you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson's writing is an insult to one's intelligence. I couldn't finish this book (a Christmas gift) it was so bad. The fact that he is a &quot;bestselling author&quot; is proof of the dumbing down of American society."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This one is so bad that is should not only be banned but every copy seeked out and destroyed!Well, that may be a bit of an overstatment, but this one is a real stinker. Once upon a time James Patterson had the ability to write a mildly entertaining novel with the catch being a white man writing in the first person of a black man. This worked well enough to gain him a modest reputation and even get one of his novels on the large screen.He has now entirely run out of remotely believable plots and apparently the ability to handle dialog. Page after page of his ridiculous converstions with \\"Nanamom\\" made the book so tiresome that one was forced to speed read through it just to see if any thing of interest happened...it didn't.Of course, there are the gruesome murders and rapes that JP seems to have a fondest for.The basic plot is that a Washington detective is so coveted by the FBI that they let him write his own rules for attending the accademy, thereby giving him page after page of driving back and forth from Virginia to home with a \\"Nanamom\\" trite conversation in every chapter. An Example, \\"Nanmom, you really like that cream and strawberries.\\" Yea, right.In his last few books he has resorted to an irritating style of making every chapter a page and a half long! This would destroy any flow that happened to exist, which in this case none does. It does accomplish two things, makes a modest book look a whole lot bigger, justifing the price; and makes it a more difficult to spin the pages in an effort to get through it.Do no under any circumstances buy this book and if someone offers it to you for free, politely decline.It is very discouraging to think that trees were killed so \\"Big Bad Wolf\\" could be printed."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Description everything of russian in this book -jargon, dialogs, sex life, food is ABSOLUTELY wrong !

This is the first Patterson novel I have read and I admit that it was truly entertaining. The title was the first attraction, then the brief synops on the back was the clincher to buy it, but having finished it, I now see why so many people read Patterson. I really enjoy the brevity and movie like snap shots. Purists probably do not care for that approach, but I believe Patterson understands today's commercial reader, and he hits the mark with his style.As for the book, the only drawback was that since I hadn't read his first Alex Cross books, I didn't have the background I should have. The story contained prior events that I was not aware of, but it doesn't adversely affect a newcomer to Patterson at this stage. Although I feel compelled to read \\"Pop Goes the Weasel.\\" The Big Bad Wolf is one bad mother...(shut your mouth) I'm just talkin' about the Wolf. Some of the scenes were incredibly unrealistic, but fiction is what it is.If you've never read a Patterson novel with Alex Cross as the character, do yourself a favor and read one.

James Patterson is one of my favorite authors!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson can keep us turning pages, but don't expect a satisfying conclusion from this book. Instead, imagine turning to the last page and finding \\"TO BE CONTINUED\\" in all caps. Although the last page doesn't read that way, it might as well. This is clearly the first in a series of at least one additional book that will feature Patterson's latest antagonist, a particularly nasty Russian Mafia boss who calls himself \\"the Wolf.\\"As part of the Alex Cross series, our protagonist finds himself at his new job - he's finally agreed to go to work for the FBI - and on the trail of the Wolf. Cross is initially sent to investigate a series of broad daylight kidnappings of grown men and women. Slowly, it becomes apparent that the abductions are connected, and the victims are being sold in a bizarre world of white slavery, apparently masterminded by this individual who calls himself the Wolf.As I said previously, expect few - if any - plot details to be resolved in this book. It reads more like half a book, with this being clearly the first half - and a distinctly unfinished half at that. From the Wolf's true identity, to a child custody battle, to Cross's relationship with Jamille, to whether Cross can decide whether he likes his new job or not, to whether his new boss is friend or foe, we simply have to tune in to the next episode to see what will happen. Even then, Patterson may choose to drag it out for another book or two. I'll say this: it's a good way to sell more books. I just don't know if it is a good way to satisfy readers. Personally, I ended up feeling duped.According to Patterson's website, the sequel to this one is called \\"London Bridges.\\" The few reviews I've read aren't too good, so I'm not sure if I'll read it or not. The only thing compelling me to do so at this point would be to resolve the story started in this book - not the quality of the story itself."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"At first when I pickup the book was because I want to find the types of brooks that James Patterson write, I the fist two pages and I like the book, then I did some research about the character of the wolf on other books in which refer it as a killer with out scruples. This book is more about Alex Cross and how he is making the transition from the Washington DC police in to the FBI and how he get involve with the biggest case of his career at the same time he try to keep his family tougher, but the trill did no finish; looks like the wolf will be came back on the future in other book."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Normally, I'm a big James Patterson fan and I love Alex Cross. However, this book didn't grab me and keep me wanting to turn the pages like most of Patterson's novels. Grant it, I realize it was written in 2003 and I'm a little behind with reading Patterson's novels, but this one I have to say is just average. I thought the plot was a little far-fetched, but at the end it got a little better. It's hard to imagine persons and events such as plotted in this book could actually happen, but then again we all know it's a crazy world we live in and, I guess, big bad wolves do exist.I picked this book up (used)in a book store, so I got it at a decent price.

I actually threw it to the floor in disgust when I was through reading it. The writing is simplistic and there is no character development. The sentence structure and vocabulary are right out of an Elementary School level text. The only reason I even finished reading it was to have some closure and so I didn't feel like I had wasted my time by reading the beginning. Well, I certainly didn't get the closure I coveted. I wanted to mail the book back to the publisher in protest but I don't want to waste anymore of my money. If you enjoy richly developed characters and a plausible storyline you will not be happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Alex Cross returns in Patterson's latest thriller, the Big Bad Wolf. As with all Patterson novels, they are easy and quick to read. In this thriller, Cross has joined the FBI and his involved in searching for who his behind a bunch of kidnappings. The FBI and Cross are soon on the trail and have several hit and misses as they try and find kidnap victims before they are killed and try and find those involved in the kidnapping scheme.Although part of the novel involves Cross's personal life, it isn't as dominant as in recent efforts. Most Patterson villians seem to be smarter than those after them, but the Wolf actually is believable as a super criminal.A few complaints: Patterson never includes enough details of anything, so just read and go with the flow and don't think you missed something, because you didn't. Also, the conclusion is incredibly frustrating. This book isn't worthy of a sequal, although it'll probably have one.Patterson still throws in the required twists and turns, yet he has lost the ability to make me care about the characters in his novels."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Across the country men and women are being kidnapped but not for ransom.

A Russian organised crime lord who calls himself The Wolf is fast making a name for himself. Attractive women as well as a few men are being kidnapped and sold as bedroom slaves to those with enough money. Some are showing up murdered after their masters have had their fun. Alex is still in FBI training but is asked to take a major hand in the investigation much to the disgust of some of his superiors in the FBI. Meanwhile Christine is back and she wants her baby (little Alex).This is not the greatest Alex Cross novel, but fans of the series probably will not be too disappointed. It is a worthwhile read, and a lot better than most other authors work. You don't get deep enough into The Wolf's mind as you did with the Weasel, Mastermind and other villains from previous novels for my liking but he is still a character I would not want to encounter in real life. This is not a bad read but I would read some former titles in the Alex Cross series if you have not done so first before this one."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This is definitely a MUST Read! I first started reading James Patterson'sooks recently, starting with his latest, Beach Road, which is definitely my favorite by far. After reading Beach Road in less than a few days, I decided to read more of his works, including, Honeymoon, The Beach House and also The Big Bad Wolf. The Big Bad Wolf was more or less original with definitely a surprising, yet unsettling ending. James Patterson, no wonder why he is in the Fobes Top Million/Billionaires, he deserves it and I hope that he does not stop writing any time soon and the movies definitely have to make more movies from his novels. The ending of this book is somewhat origibal/unexpected - Read and you'll enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This was my first James Patterson book. I have to say, given his popularity, I had expected a lot more. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy it either. It was a quick and easy read, perfect for fluff reading on my lunch break when I didn't want something so intense I couldn't put it down.It is exciting and action-orientated, with a quick plot and likeable main character. Again, this also being my first Alex Cross novel, I liked the character enough to thumb through the other books in the series.I don't know how this compares to other Patterson books, but I would consider it an okay book in an interesting series."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"For the most part I like the Alex Cross books but please let's change just a few things - can't his children do something wrong just to prove they are normal. And he has fallen in love AGAIN that means that she will be in peril by the next book and probably dead in the one after that. Good thing that his perfect children don't stay attached to these dead girlfriends. And the subplot about Christine well for goodness sake she loves her baby and now that she isn't having nightmares any longer because Alex got her kidnapped for a year and the maniac is still on the loose well let her have some peace. Baby Alex (already following the the footsteps of his perfect sibs) will be just fine even if he is raised someplace other than DC. Amazing that Kyle has so much freedom in a super max prison. Yep I think the formula is wearing thin behind every corner there is a conspiracy, Alex doesn't seem to realize how much danger he constantly brings to his home and family, and though he wants to catch the bad guys through countless red herrings he is never quite at the goal line. Oh yes the Wolf seems to me he shouldn't be hard to spot since he sounds like a gorilla in a well tailored suit who leaves bodies and bloody noses wherever he goes. Alsoi if he is so vicious how did the 14 year old hacker escape his wrath Hmmmm ?"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"My first taste of Alex CrossI was very impressed... My goal here is not to give too much away for those of you that will read this book. Its starts out with a kidnapping in broad day light at a shopping mall. The case turns out to be all about white slavery. Only the pretties of the pretty are being abducted and sold into slavery as play toys for sick rich men with way to much time and money on their twisted little hands... {I figured out right away who set the first woman up that was kidnapped and why...but that is where it stopped for me... I was left guess the rest of the way through much of the book, which I liked!!!! What I don't like is when I have a book all figured out by page 60... That did not happen here!!! At least not for me.}Quite a few twist and turns for Cross as he starts training classes for the FBI but is unable to finish because he is put on the slavery case called, white girl. Which manages to piss off some higher ups within the bureau. Another turn of events happens when his ex-fianc&eacute;e comes back into the picture requesting full custody of their child Alex Jr. His youngest son that Cross fondly calls big boy...As the case progresses and more men and women are being abducted Cross and his team think they know who the identity of the Wolf is. The goal of the Wolf is to be the only and only god-father and he is making a point to kill off anyone that threatens his plans. Which included FBI agents and the like.Ok people I'm going to stop right here before I say way too much!!!! I recommend this book. Great read but the ending left me a bit sad and very anxious to read the next installment of Alex Cross..."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson does it again! From the first page to the last page this book leaves you sitting at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. Alex Cross truly is a star cop...I enjoy reading about both his career and his personal life challenges. I'll be one of the first to read the next book in the Alex Cross &quot;series&quot;."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Once again Patterson brings Alex to new places and meeting new people making the story interesting and keeping me reading."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This came quickly and in good shape. I really lime the Alex Cross series so i Love getting my books from here. Thanks."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I told you that you would be hooked. You are buying this book aren't you? You won't regret it. Oh, put the coffee on, it's gonna be a long night."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"All James Patterson books are great reads. We are in the process of going back and reading all of them. Haven't been disappointed yet."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"It is a book that you can not put down. The twists and turns in the plot will keep you quessing."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The Big Bad Wolf was an excellent example of James Patterson's expert writing! Exciting book! One you won't want to put down!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"this is just another example of James Patterson's great writing. I am trying to read the whole Alex Cross series and am doing a good job. This book was great, loved the story line.. I am working on Pop Goes The Weasel now and going on from there. Recommend all of them..Can't put it down....Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The book is fast paced, never dull & really exciting. The Alex Cross character is very interesting, tough but gentle to his family members. I have loved all of the Alex Cross books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"another patterson hit. He is one of the best I have ever read. his writting just draws you in. I always hate to finish his books but the next one is waiting."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Patterson's Alex Cross series is one of my favorites and with this book my love for his books continues. I have bought two more kindle editions to continue the saga."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I've been a fan of patterson's books, but if ever there were a book that was simply published to make some dough, this is it. I love to read, and rarely feel cheated by a book, but a very thin plot, lousy characted development and almost zero real excitement actually had me ticked off when I read it. I will certainly not buy another Patterson book in hardcover. It's a waste."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This book reads like Patterson gave little effort to write a novel at the same level of most of his others. If it is possible to &quot;phone in&quot; a writing, he did it. If is as if he faced a deadline for fulfilling a book committment and just slapped this together. Vert disappointing."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"The characters, except for the hero, are so shallow you can barely see them, much less feel them....the ending is totally set up for a sequel....there are too many people, too many places, too many situations for anything to be fully developed....the anatagonist can do anything anywhere to anybody and never even have pursuit...I found the whole thing preposterous...."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"As Alex Cross embarks on his first case as an FBI agent, readers can't help but wonder how many, \\"worst killers\\" the poor guy has to catch before he can take a vacation to sort out his dysfunctional personal life. Ironically, his dysfunctional relationship with his \\"baby mama\\" is possibly the most entertaining part of the novel. Unfortunately Patterson misses the mark with this novel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"In THE BIG BAD WOLF, new FBI Agent Alex Cross, is challenged by an evil organization that is kidnapping people that are than sold into slavery.Certain people seem to be targeted and they are then stalked and eventually taken by a team of two people. Young men and women are disappearing all over the country and the FBI is convinced that a large well run organization is responsible. They think it is possibly headed by a former Russian KGB officer, and mobster, know as the Wolf.In this story the Director of the FBI has recruited former D.C. Detective Alex Cross to help in the investigation. Cross, who has a background in Criminal Psychology and a reputation for solving many cases, is somewhat disappointed in the way the FBI operates and he is thinking that maybe he should have stayed with the D. C. Police. This book really kept me interested and I'm hoping for a sequel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"In James Patterson's latest Alex Cross novel \\"The Big Bad Wolf,\\" Alex has just begun working for the FBI. Hoping the FBI will offer a more flexable environment and give him more time with his family, Alex is optomistic. However, Alex is quickly involved in a kidnapping case which is part of a white sexual slavery ring. That ring is operated by a Russian mafia boss called The Wolf. Alex is in a race against time to save the kidnapped women and catch The Wolf, before its too late.I love James Patterson. Patterson's novels read so quickly and move with such a dynamic pace, that the reader is sucked in immediately. I found this book to be entirely enjoyable and totally worth the read. I am not sure why people have been so harsh in their reviews of it. I highly recommend it and cannot wait to read the sequal, \\"London Bridges.\\""},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Those of you familiar with James Patterson's fast-paced style will loved this book and finish reading it in less than a day, like I did and I don't consider myself a fast reader.I'm not going to go into the plot, except to say it's interesting and typical of Patterson, very imaginative. Patterson is plain spoken, and he doesn't bore his readers with details but gets on with the action so that the reader is constantly entertained.Patterson also leaves you wanting more so I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel \\"London Bridges.\\""},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This was the first Alex Cross novel Ive read and I loved it. I just could not put it down I had to know what was the Wolf gonna do next. I have not read many other Alex Cross books but I will now. I just picked up Kiss The Girls and cant wait to read it. I know alot of Patterson fans were dissapointed with this book but I was not. I was however dissapointed in the sequel to this book London Bridges. He could of done better with the sequel."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"When Alex Cross finally agrees to leave the Washington Police Department to join the FBI, he has to go through a probationary training course, despite his expertise in crime solving. He can see that the FBI is stuck in a rut of old training methods, working strictly by the book and that, in his opinion, they need much more hands on street experience. Around the US and even around the world, young blonde women are being kidnapped to order by a gang of Russian Mafiya types with plenty of money and the necessary muscle to purchase these women \\"to order\\", by degenerates who want them as sex slaves. The list increases to include youths who are used and murdered to satisfy the criminal lusts of these madmen. Alex uses his years of hands on experience to help secure the freedom of several of these women, using people with great knowledge of computer hacking to enter the chat rooms of these monsters, who include well known and respected businessmen.At the end of the story, and obviously presaging his next novel, James Patterson reintroduces Christine Johnson, Cross's former fiancee and mother of his baby son Alex, who applies for and is granted custody of the child."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I had mixed feelings after having finished Patterson's latest Alex Cross adventure, Big Bad Wolf. It's actually half of a good book so perhaps 2 stars would be a more appropriate rating. The book was at its best when it dealt with Cross having to deal with his new position in the FBI and with putting up with the FBI politics. He has to take courses on subjects he could very easily be teaching. Cross' newest nemesis, Wolf, is very interesting and enjoys the cat-and-mouse game with Cross and is very good at it.Where the book fails is when it attempts to deal with Cross' personal life. His romantic interests and his child-custody battle come off as overly pretentious at best. The only interesting thing here is when his personal life gets integrated with his professional life. Patterson should stick to Cross \\"the detective\\" (now FBI man) and downplay Cross the family man. I first became interested in Cross because of his ability to analyze a situation and read things into it, as a result of his street background and education, that are missed by others. If I'm looking for syrupy plots (and I am not) I'll watch a soap opera.Patterson's writing style is simplistic but well paced. Since my favorite genre is hard science-fiction, I enjoy this style as it allows me to give my brain a rest between books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"As with all James Patterson novels, I read this one in a day. I was anticpating this novel because Alex Cross has left D.C. police and joined the FBI. I thought the Wolf was pretty terrifying, but not any more than Kyle Craig or Gary Soneji. The book eluded to the fact that this was Cross' toughest case yet, but I don't agree. I was very let down by the ending. I hurried through the book only to find that the Wolf escapes. If the wolf is as dangerous as he sounds, with him on the loose, Cross may be dead before we get to the next book! This book was a page turner (aren't they all) but disappointing to say the least."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Although I enjoyed reading the book, the ending ruined the whole thing. I feel cheated. The ending left me hanging like a soap opera. Is this some ploy to get me to buy his next book? I would have bought it anyway, but now, I'll have second thoughts before buying any more of Patterson's titles. I wish I read the reviews before buying this one."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am an avid reader of Patterson's novel &amp; love the Alex Cross series. I loved this book up until the end. There was no conclusion. Hopefully Patterson is continuing this book and the battle between Alex and the Wolf. It was a page turner from the start. I would rate it as one of my top 2 Patterson books aside from Kiss the Girls, of course."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I look forward to the Alex Cross novels. I enjoyed this book until the last couple of chapters. Did Mr. Patterson have a plane to catch? What happened to the ending? Maybe the publishers left it out of my copy of the book?"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson is one of my favorite writers, but this one was a huge disappointment. It was a messy amalgam of many of his previous books -- the escaped victim a la &quot;Kiss the Girls,&quot; the threat on Cross's family, a la....well, all of the Cross books, the help from a former bad guy...and the undecided ending. If this is the first of a series, then it doesn't enthrall me enough to pick up part 2. I am very unhappy to say this about Patty, but it's the truth."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"First off, I think it's pretty pitiful that Stephen King in his EW column had to lower himself to call a fellow writer &quot;dopey.&quot; Maybe King's jealous that Patterson is so successful. At any rate, there have been ups and downs in the Alex Cross series, but BIG BAD WOLF has more than enough of good moments to validate the continuance of this series.What makes this work is Patterson's trademark short chapters; his terse dialogue, and his understanding of Alex Cross and his family and friends. The addition of Christine Johnson coming back to reclaim her son adds an additional emotional tension to the book. Patterson gives Alex some good supporting characters in Monnie, the FBI computer hacker, who helsp tremendously; his long time friend John Sampson, who is going to be a father, and a nice array of despicable villains. The Wolf? Who is he...we have to wait until the next novel. Typical of Mr. Patterson who so floored us when we find out who FBI agent Kyle Craig was. Oh, yes, Kyle's in this one, too, as vile as ever.I liked this book; for those of you who have given up on him, shame on you."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"If we were to rank this effort against the great Alex Cross Novels it wouldn't even be in the same ballpark. The Villian, &quot;The Wolf&quot; is totally unbelievable and in my opinion Comic book fodder. No intensity like &quot;Along Came A Spider&quot; and &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot; and I found myself shaking my head with disappointment at the end of many chapters.Patterson is throwing out lightweight drivel and expecting us to buy it. I guess I did &quot;buy the book&quot; but this is more like Sidney Sheldon, soap opera junk.Where have you gone &quot;James Patterson?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Although this entry in the Cross series may not be one of Patterson's strongest, the suspenseful flow of the text still keeps me wanting to turn pages.Patterson did a good job of building the &quot;Wolf&quot; into a formidable adversary, and gave a solid plot foundation for Cross to do his thing. I appreciated the new environment for Cross....I liked the integration and introduction of Cross in the FBI and welcomed new character developments, although many of these were weak in some cases. I look forward to seeing these develop more in future releases.I was not dissapointed in the lack of a solid conclusion, rather, I am looking forward to see where all these leads. Bring on the sequel!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"James Pattersons' Alex Cross books were good for the first 3 or 4 volumes in the series. Now, they all feel the same and they are really very shallow as far as the depth of character or plot development. Very little substance, but I suppose that's all they are supposed to be. Oh well...."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"With all the twists and turns that James Patterson put into the latest installment of the Alex Cross series, I feel that\\"The Big Bad Wolf\\" was not exciting enough. Perhaps it's because of the typical James Patterson formula - short chapters, lots of plot twists. For me, this felt more like a ho-hum read. The plot is somewhat compelling - a man named Wolf coordinating the abduction and the selling of adults into slavery. There are a couple of surprising twists in the end but mostly it all feels formulaic. The one thing that helps the book are the members of the Cross family. They are likeable and endearing but they take up a small portion of the book. Finally, would I recommend this book? If you're a die hard James Patterson fan, pick it up to learn about the latest Alex Cross caper. If this is your first James Patterson read, I recommend \\"Along Came the Spider\\", \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Cat and Mouse\\". These James Patterson novels, all featuring Alex Cross, are far more exciting and don't feel formulaic, especially \\"Cat and Mouse\\"."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Product in condition as stated, great shipping times, secure packaging. Would purchase from seller again."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thought this book was really far fetched. Parts of this book are wonderful and very entertaining. Other sections of the book just do not seem accurate. I realize this is a fictional book, but I really think with a little more editing this story would have been great. I enjoyed reading the description of the kidnapping at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta as it seemed very accurate and scary down to every minute detail. On the other hand, the chat room crap seemed a little far fetched although who knows there are plenty of sick people in this world. I just do not really believe there would be people willing to pay money for other women in such a fashion, but who knows as maybe there really are people out in the world like mentioned in this book. I hope I never encounter them!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I've read quite a few of James Patterson's novels and most of them are grade A entertainment with some solid plot twists, great action, good mystery, suspense and some pretty evil villains. This time Patterson's outdone himself with the Wolf. This character is evil concentrate. The callous nature in which this villain executes people is enough to make your skin crawl.Once again, Patterson does a good job of mixing the personal and professional life of his main character Alex Cross. This time around, the woman he had baby Alex with suddenly reappears in attempt to reclaim custody of the child. The side story adds a nice dimension to the plot.If you can put up with a few gaping holes in the story (i.e. the Wolf seems to have 20 other people sharing his identity) which fit a bit too neatly for them to be plausible, then you will enjoy the Big Bad Wolf. As a friend of mine once said, I go to the movies to be entertained, the same should be said about Patterson's books."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"i loved this book, but i do love all of james patterson novels and love the alex cross stories. it was suspenseful and i could not put down the book until i was done."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"It started out good (as most of Patterson's novels do) and then it went down hill. I think that Patterson has taken Alex Cross as far as he can. It's pretty much unbelievable that the \\"FNG\\" of the FBI can just be thrust out onto the streets to solve the Wolfe kidnappings. Here's hoping Patterson can build on the Wolfe's character because he doesn't seem all that big and bad yet."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels that Mr. Patterson faithfully pumps out of his novel machine. While they are certainly enough to keep your attention, I find myself growing weary of the 100 chapter eye candy.In this installment, Alex finds himself on the trail of not one, but two villians of previous books: The Weasel and The Wolf, planning worldwide destruction for questionable motives.I have found the plot has become too predictable: Villian emerges, Alex chases, almost catches; Alex finds love, ends in tragedy...time for new book. I may have to go back and read \\"Jack and Jill\\"....."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"For someone who's never read an Alex Cross novel, I wasn't sure if starting with The Big Bad Wolf would be a good idea for fear of missing out on inevitable references to past novels. In spite of the few references made to Cross's days on the Washington, D.C. PD and his relationship to his ex-wife Christine, for the most part I was totally in the clear and able to thoroughly enjoy an intricately woven tale of suspense, murder, deceit, and intrigue.The book moved quickly and practically read itself -- based upon both the compelling nature of the harrowing suspense as well as the 2-4 page chapters that seem to end just as you start them. There exists, however, some holes in the storyline that, based upon Patterson's proclivity for churning out novels like there's no tomorrow, most likely stems from the fact that he was facing an imminent deadline and was forced to finish it perhaps before he was ready.I won't give anything away, but how they catch some of the bad guys left me shaking my head as to the plausibility of the storyline. That being said, the book still was enjoyable and incredibly suspenseful.Contrary to popular opinion, it is The Wolf (his lovely affinity for zemochit and all), and not Alex Cross (the unrealistic supercop Patterson that makes him out to be), who makes the book worth reading from the start. The sick and sadistic Wolf, in short, makes for a compellingly evil antagonist that undoubtedly keeps the pages turning."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I was disappointed with this one. kind of got the feeling, it was to keep us going to the book store to buy another James Patterson novel.I will say that he definitely makes up for it in the &quot;3rd Degree&quot; Awesome reading. I couldn't put it down. I'm here to tell ya, I'm a 330 pound football offical, exterminator by trade, and I got more than one tear stirring up in my eyes reading this one. I got really attached to the charcters. This &quot;3rd Degree&quot; is a MUST read."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"2 1/2 StarsI have read every one of Mr. Patterson's books and have loved them all. However, The Big Bad Wolf was a bit of a let down for me. It felt as if a lot of the details were left out. I was also very disappointed in the ending. It seems as if there will be a sequel to this book, if there is I hope it's a little more exciting and less predictable."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"A slight dissapointment with hopes for a more faster paced sequal. Too many &quot;what if's&quot; were left in the story and the whole chase ends unlucky. Not as fast paced as his other books. A more look into Cross's life and how his transigiton to FBI is being affected by the Wolf case. I recommend it to Patterson fans."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Once again, James Patterson pulls you immediately into the story and doesn't let you go. The Wolf is a Russian Mafioso involved with a Internet chat group who has men and women abducted for the sexual pleasure and perversion of moneyed clients. Alex Cross in on the case again, this time joining the FBI and getting a little breathing room to travel cross country at will. Though this is an interesting and needed development in the life of Cross, I felt Patterson could have done a better jobof providing detail in Crosses short time at Quantico.Instead of spending some time with Cross at the academy and getting into the FBI culture, Patterson explains that Cross was told by the FBI Director to go to class when he could and graduate. Totally unrealistic for an organization known for not bending over for anyone. I felt Patterson missed a real opportunity in not exploring Quantico and the resources at the FBI academy. But, now Cross is working as an Assistant Director in the FBI, without paying his dues. That should make him real popular.Anyway, Cross does his usual bang-up detective work and puts a stop to the Internet kidnappers. All except the Wolf, who remains at large. I look forward to the next episode and further developments in the Alex Cross saga."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"This novel is your basic James Patterson product. Short paragraphs - little fleshing out of a story - lots of twists and turns in the hunt for a brutal killer - just interesting enough to keep you reading - but fairly thin gruel. Alex Cross, the ex-DC homicide cop who joined the FBI in Four Blind Mice is earning his spurs as he joins the hunt for the Wolf, a member of the Russian Mafiya who has plans to be the godfather of all organized crime. What initially has the FBI's attention is the kidnappings of white women who it turns out have been &quot;ordered&quot; by wealthy patrons who have designs on them. Why the Wolf would be involved in such an activity when his designs are so much larger is never explained. Patterson also brings a custody battle over Little Alex in to the story which does little or nothing to advance the plot, but perhaps he needed a few more chapters. He has done better and hopefully will again."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Very quick and easy reading- hard to put down! The story did end very abruptly but there will definitely be a sequel. I thought the plot was similiar to other stories- but that is why I love Alex Cross. I liked him being frustrated in his new position in the FBI. I wish there would have been some additional details with his personal life instead of completely business. The return of little Alex's mother helped make the book more personable."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thoroughly enjoy the Alex Cross books as a rule. This is the second time that Patterson has elected to stretch a story into 2 books. It is very disappointing to have a book be so intense and just come to a dead halt at the end. I think that it would be good customer relations if he would at least identify that his book is the first of two. Overall, Patterson has been one of my favorite writers, but with books like this I am starting to think otherwise."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"Patterson's latest is typical of his best work: furiously paced short chapters; an edgy plot that keeps the pages inexorably turning; and thrills and chills galore as the scary action rarely pauses for us to breathe. And for Alex Cross fans, it's good to have him back, even though this book marks the start of his FBI career, a start that wobbles a little bit. For good measure, some family stuff is worked in, especially a surprise visit from Christine Johnson, little Alex' real mother, who seems to have custodial intentions despite abandoning the kid for more than a year.The plot, about a ruthless Russian Mafia type (&quot;Wolf&quot;, now operating here) who seems all powerful, is more than adequate to sustain entertaining reading til nearly the end. However, some of the untidy turns of events, especially the loose ending, will cause chagrin and disappointment to many readers, regardless of whether a sequel looms (seems likely). We predict most will enjoy this fast read and tolerate the shaky ending in anticipation of more to come. We might have preferred another 50 pages or so to just wrap it up and give some closure to an otherwise good story. Enjoy, but be warned."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the initial Alex Cross novels, but this was a resounding disappointment. Patterson seems to have evolved into an author who no longer cares about the quality of his writing. If you can accept the premise of the F.B.I. recruiting someone from a city police force and immediately jumping them over seasoned veterans to a position of dominance, then, perhaps you will be readily able to accept the many other unlikley aspects of this novel. Rather than contributing to character development, Patterson's subplots involving Cross's family and friends seem manipulative and shallow. His long distance romance is like a teenage view of love and separation. The most manipulative facet of the entire book is the ending which seems to have no motivation driving it other than an effort to get readers to buy the next epsiode when it comes out. It shouldn't be a long wait-it can't take much time for Patterson to type a book of this quality."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"What A Terrible Book!It started off very promising, but the style of two pages, new chapter, two pages, another chapter throughout the book is very annoying (313 pages - 119 Chapters In the Soft Copy Version).It appears that the author was very rushed, and completely lost track of what he was writing about half way through the book, tried for a big finish - and utterly disappoints - I am all for unexpected endings, but this one was purely wrong!Worst Read Of This Decade! Do Not Buy This Book!"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"A man and a woman abduct former Atlanta reporter Elizabeth Connolly from her home. The victim is the ninth in two years kidnapped by this team, who do little to hide the crime. Instead, the brazen duo takes the victim in public places with their horrified families as witnesses. Several homicides have been associated with this deadly team. The FBI believes that this notorious pair works for the Wolf of the Red Mafiya, Pasha Sorokin who sells the kidnapped people on a white slave commodity market.No longer with the Metro DC police force, the FBI assigns trainee Dr. Alex Cross to investigate the snatchings because the brass believe his unique approach to criminology is needed to break the case. Alex begins making the round picking up tips from his myriad of DC sources. The abductions and collateral murders continue as Alex gets closer to catching the felons, but soon a tip hits home that his family is now a target.THE BIG BAD WOLF is a well written exciting action packed police procedural that hooks the audience from the moment that Elizabeth is snatched in Buckhead's Phipps Plaza as she was already purchased by a client. Bringing student Alex to run the case in spite of his record with DC Metro seems hard to accept especially with the hard nosed agents basically bowing to his greater wisdom. Still once that stark leap is made, fans will enjoy Alex Cross, FBI Agent in Training battling the Wolf and his pack.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"I am a great fan of all James Patterson books. But my favorites contain the detective/psychologist Dr. Cross. Alex Cross is again the main detective in \\"Big Bad Wolf\\" when Cross joins the FBI. I love the crime mysteries and also that you get to know Alex Cross and his family which is something I look forward to in each of the books he is featured in. There is Mamma-grandma who raised Alex and then his two small children as well, who have lost their mother. With each novel Cross finds time for a new love interest but it never gets in the way of his crime solving addiction aided by some police and FBI mates. Solving crimes is what Alex Cross is about and the tougher the criminal and the more unsolvable a case appears the more he is determined to solve it. The police and FBI colleagues you get to know as well as his family make you feel like you know them all. I think I've read almost every Patterson novel where Alex Cross is at the center of crime solving, but that's not to say I like his other books any less. I just like, for now, the blend of family, their involvement, and police and FBI friends you get to know. You wonder how he does it. You will try, but won't be able to solve the crimes Alex is assigned. Page turners, all of them. Thank you James Patterson."},{"Title":"The Big Bad Wolf","review":"When we join Alex Cross in \`The Big Bad Wolf,' by James Patterson, he was just beginning his new job as an FBI agent At the Training Academy in Quantico. Much like the agent Clarice Starling in \`Silence of the Lambs,' Cross would have an abbreviated training session. An important case required his participation.The wife of a judge had been kidnapped, making the case fall under FBI jurisdiction. There were similar, prior abductions that now required the FBI to investigate. At first, agents called the case \`White Girl' because of the victims, but even that would change when a couple of male college students were kidnapped. Investigators expanded the case to some sort of sex-slave / sex-trade type of crime.They received a big tip from a teenage hacker who wandered into a security-protected chat room with a number of sexual deviants under a variety of handles: Sterling, Mr. Potter, The Art Dealer, Sphinx, Marvel, Master Treker, Louis XV, and Tosca Bella. Tracing these perverts were an important part of the case.While Alex Cross had captured his share of social miscreants, he was tabbed for the case because his new boss, Ron Burns, wanted him involved quickly. Cross still lived in DC with three children, one a newborn, and his Nana Mama. His friend from the DC Police force John Sampson made a cameo appearance, but most of his personal life revolves around his family and his long-distance relationship with a San Francisco homicide detective, Jamilla Hughes.His ex-wife Christine wasn't in the picture at the outset of the novel, having escaped cross-country to Seattle from DC with some personal issues. Out of the blue, and after a year of not hearing from her, Cross receives a phone call from Christine, asking to visit their son, Alex Jr. Cross had no problem with that, but her subsequent phone call was a meeting with her lawyer, demanding full custody.Do family courts really do this? Do they award full custody to the mother who has been out of the picture for a full year after one visitation? Do they allow the mother to move three thousand miles from the father for that custody? Particularly when the father has shown himself to be a good parent?That's one of the personal trials of Cross, while trying to find his way with new working friendships at the FBI, under a new boss and a new set of working rules. Personally, I found the case of Cross having to fear loss of custody somewhat unauthentic.That air of authenticity was missing in several other situations. How can a master criminal leader who is known and feared by many be unknown to the FBI? Seriously, no one knows who the Wolf is? There's also a missing small detail on page 273. Every hockey fan knows that assists are always announced with the goal. Unassisted goals are specifically announced as such.What about the way Chapter 44 is written? For about five paragraphs, it appears as though the FBI found Benjamin Coffey. Not only was he not found, he was going to be killed.One doesn't expect a masterpiece of literature from James Patterson, but the novel should flow better than \`The Big Bad Wolf.' With this novel - and his next, London Bridges - Patterson ran into a slump with the Alex Cross series."},{"Title":"Power Parenting for Children With ADD/ADHD: A Practical Guide for Managing Difficult Behaviors","review":"This is the easy how to/step-by-step book that I have seen.

While not what I expected there are some great things here. It would've been easy for the authors to simply satirize the current administration, but they've done some serious research. Hidden beneath the jokes is some scary factual information (most sources are in the back of the book). Don't miss the bit about Rumsfeld and Aspartame (better known as Nutra Sweet). Also surprising is the 9/11 section. Instead of jokes, it contains around 80 questions that have yet to be answered about the 9/11 attacks.

Du Boulay's is a spiritual experience. During her 150 miles of travel (including getting lost), du Boulay considers whether it is the arrival or the journey that is most important. She relates the historical and cultural significance of landmarks and towns, churches and their namesakes across Hampshire, Surrey, and Kent as she follows the ancient Pilgrim's Way to St. Thomas a Becket's shrine in Canterbury Cathedral. And of course she tells the story of Becket's death at the hands of Henry II's knights. Time seems to take on a new dimension, becoming fluid as Du Boulay slips back and forth between descriptions and anecdotes of ancient Neolithic cultures, the Romans, mediaeval, and later peoples. Importantly, all somehow meld together and are united. At times frustrated, hungry, wet, or suffering back pain, du Boulay's almost two-week journey is a parallel of life, as she feels tempted to give up, or resists the urge to take a taxi or other short cut; she keeps walking. What does du Boulay learn? On reaching her goal, she finds \\"It did not matter that I had no great thoughts. For the moment gratitude was enough\\" (228). Even so, she wonders whether life will \\"ever be quite the same again?\\" (229). I, for one, suspect life will be different.

This journey, taken during a painful period of transition (widowhood) in the author's life, covers physical and spiritual ground one patient step at a time. The author at times seems a latter-day John Bunyan: we learn that there is as much signficiance to the pilgrimage walk as there is to the arrival. Cannot be recommended enough for sincere people of faith, especially those in the English traditions of Catholicism, Anglicanism/Episcopalianism, or Methodism."},{"Title":"The Road to Canterbury: A Modern Pilgrimage","review":"Last week I was talking with a friend who had just returned from journeying Spain's pilgrimage route for St James. I asked her what was most memorable and she said, \\"El Camino, the way itself.\\" Ah yes! Of course! Her remark reminded me of that exact feeling within myself when I did minor pilgrimaging in England and Bavaria. It isn't so much the end that mattered, but the walking and \\"doing of it\\" that mirrored an interior journey. After all, was I not with many people going in the same direction? But most were not thinking of the trip as a journey, much less an interior one. So all of this reminded me of this book, which I unfortunately did not read before my own journey to England, but had since read as a sort of pilgrimage chaser. And it sure brings back to me so many of my own memories that whenever someone talks about pilgrimage, this is one of the books that come to mind. (And as an aside, if you ever do pilgrimage, be sure to select some good books for the way. I am firm believer that all journeys should have some sort of reading.)As to the contents of this particular book, it's a combination of things: insightful spiritual reflections, history of Christian pilgrimage, history of English pilgrimage, commentary and history of English architecture, history of Henry II and his friend St. Thomas Becket, the resulting murder of Thomas after the king mumbled something overheard by his knights, the resulting pilgrimage to honor St Thomas, how to stay strong and not give in to taxis, how to get lost and not get upset, how to find peace in a busy world and how to recognize the mileposts of your own inner journey; and all done with a very easygoing, humble spirit that we could all emulate.Perhaps this review isn't too helpful, but maybe it will remind you to at least take some time every day to make a pilgrimage of the heart, to the virgin point that we all have, reminding us, as Thomas Merton says, that \\"the gate of heaven is everywhere.\\"Other books of interest may include:38.

As cool as it is, they can sometimes run out of fun things to do before they are ready to return indoors. This is where \\"101 Cool Pool Games for Children\\" comes in. You probably remember playing \\"Marco Polo\\" from your own childhood. But do you know \\"Piranha Tag\\" or \\"Snatch the Bait?\\" There is no chance your kids will not have fun and still be safe when you bring this book to the pool along with your snacks and sunscreen.As a certified fitness instructor, the author, Kim Rodomista, looks at pool time as a healthy way to play and get exercise. She has organized the games in ways to show how many players are involved, what props might be necessary, if there is any physical contact involved and what skill level is required. The appropriate icons are listed with each game. The list is also categorized by whether they are imagination, individual, out-of-the-pool, racing, tag or team games. They are even indexed by group size for your convenience. There are games for every size pool and are appropriate for ages four and older.I love the idea of the book and can imagine almost as many uses for it as there are games! What if you are planning a pool birthday party and need some activities to keep everyone happy till the cake arrives, or, if you have signed up to be a camp counselor for the summer, or, you are just tired of diving for toys in the pool? Older children will want to thumb through this to pick their own games.The author has also provided a section with water exercises to keep parents busy once their children are busy with \\"Underwater Rugby.\\" As much as I love lounging in the pool, I can't help but feel slightly decadent. Now I can workout and be redeemed from my laziness, although I'm not sure how funny I'll look doing the \\"Popcorn\\" down the length of the pool and back.As a future teacher, Rodomista caught my attention with the Albert Einstein quote, \\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\\" I find \\"101 Cool Pool Games for Children\\" provides the necessary knowledge to pick appropriate and safe pool games and also perks up my imagination when it has been fried by the sun.

It traces hem's historical roots, details the hundreds of uses of hemp, explains the historical legal underpinnings of hemp's brush in with the law, examines the global hemp industry, and shows hemp in the modern marketplace. In effect, this book provides readers with the most factual, historically comprehensive, and even-handed presentation of this controversial crop to date. To give an understanding of how useful and potentially revolutionary this crop is, allow me to quote one of my favorite parts of the book:\\"So imagine that one day within the next ten years, you wake up in a house whose walls, roof, flooring, insulation, and paint are derived of hemp. You feel great after sleeping on your hemp-stuffed mattress, covered with soft linens spun from hemp fiber. Your feet sink into the hemp carpeting as you get out of bed and open the hemp drapes. It's a beautiful morning.\\"You jump into the shower, where you soap, shampoo, and hair conditioner made from hemp. You step out onto the hemp bath mat, drying yourself with a superabsorbent hemp towel. You clean your ears with H-Tips (better than the old cotton swabs), and apply hemp-oil lotion, moisturizer, and lip balm. You make a mental note to buy some more hemp toilet paper, recalling how it wasn't too long ago that we were still cutting down centuries-old trees just to flush them away.\\"Opening your closet, you dress in hemp jeans, shirt, and jacket; put on hemp socks and shoes; tie the hemp laces; and grab your hemp wallet, which holds checks and currency printed on hemp paper.\\"You're hungry, so you walk into the kitchen with its hemp-based linoleum floor. You make some wheat-and-hemp-flower toast, and pour a glass of fresh, organic hemp milk. After eating, you make a salad with hemp-oil dressing to take to work. Then you wash your dishes, using hemp-oil dish soap and a hemp pot-scrubber, and put the dishes away in a cabinet built of hemp fiberboard. Sitting down on the hemp-framed and upholstered couch, you glance at a newspaper printed with hemp ink on hemp recycled paper, and learn that the hemp industry is now the largest agribusiness and the major job provider in your state. You turn on the stereo, which sits on a hemp fiberboard cabinet, and listen as music vibrates from speakers also made from hemp fiberboard. They contain specialty hemp paper for the speaker cones and are covered with black hempen cloth.\\"Leaving the house for work, you open the door of your car, built of strong, lightweight composites that include hemp. Relaxing into the driver's seat, luxuriously upholstered with hemp textiles, you rest your feet on floor mats that look like rubber but are made from hemp. As you drive to your job at the new hemp-fiber processing facility, you pass farmers harvesting some of the locally grown hemp that is revitalizing your community's rural economy.\\"A beautiful morning indeed, but it would be even more beautiful if you knew how environmentally friendly and healthy your new hempen life actually is. The rubber-like mats in your hemp mobile are all natural and 100 per cent biodegradable; the roots of the hemp plants that line the fields of your county help enrich and solidify much-needed topsoil and therefore increase the yield of other rotational crops. You smile while spreading hempseed hummus on your hemp-wheat toast knowing it is the single most complete source of non-animal protein on the planet - and tastes much better than tofu. The smile increases as you pour hemp oil on your salad, knowing it is high in essential fatty acids that help you think better, boost your immune system, decrease your chances of cancer, and reduce the risk of high blood pressure, platelet coagulation, and hardening of the arteries. Lastly, before heading off to work, you opt for your hemp skateboard instead of the hemp mobile, as it is a brilliant, bright and sunny day.The fact of the matter is, this beautiful morning has no imaginative end. The only thing keeping us from achieving the dawn of a new tomorrow is our monopoly cotton and paper industries, and a government which seems to be supporting those industries by restricting and limiting hemp production permits and also by unleashing the DEA on would-be hemp producers (despite the fact that it has NEVER been illegal to grow hemp in America).

The book is well written and gripping for anyone who liked a book like The Cuckoo's Egg, but yearned for a little more depth to the technology aspect.If hacking is your thing then you will really enjoy this book. If you are a security person and you are interested in learning more about how hackers operate, then you should give this book a good look."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"A great read and well worth the time. This should be a required book for all those who want to be involved in or know more about Information Security as it will definitely get you thinking about how you use your computer when connected to any network.Though the stories are \\"fictional,\\" the tools and techniques are very real. I've personally referred to a couple of the scenarios to get my employer's attention. Thanks to the authors for sharing their \\"work\\" - sorry, I mean, \\"stories.\\""},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"This is an amazing book about hacking. This will open your eyes to the world of hacking in the same way 'Hacking Exposed' did when it first came out. But different than HE, this doesn't jut tell you the how it tells you the why, and accomplishes this through an interesting fictional story. Anyone in the infosec world will recognize the tools and techniques used throughout the book as completely real and accurate. In many cases the authors of the book are the creators of the tools themselves--like the chapter Fyodor wrote which uses Nmap. I enjoy reading security books, but it's become incresingly difficult to find truly unique, original material. This book certainly fits the bill."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"If Hunter Thompson wrote a computer book, this would be it. I didn't think it was possible to work sex, drugs, booze, strip-joints and bank fraud into a book about network exploits. There are multiple plot lines to follow, and some pretty technical hacks, but in the end the book is just a lot of fun. The characters are recognizable if you've ever heard any of the authors speak, and Kevin Mitnick apparently has been \\"freed\\" to work on fictional chaos (just keep him away from the real thing for now). And there is no pseudo-tech junk---the technology is all current and real. Definitely a coast-to-coast airplane read, especially if the beverages are complementary."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I am what is known in this trade as a 'nerd' and as a nerd I can only encourage others to get this book out. If - like me - you're 6ft 8&quot; and so are physically unable to manipulate yourself into a low enough posture so as to watch a 'headrest TV' screen during longhaul flights then you've probably read all the old IT fiction books of any interest. This is the next one for you.The best part about this sequel is how it follows so seemlessly from the first; which was wrapped up so neatly the first time round that it's a marvel of creative writting that it has managed to start off so cleanly. The authors must have planned this story to be a double."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I cannot express in words how refreshing it is to *finally* read the blow by blow details of \\"what if\\" hi tech fiction written by authors who *know* the specifics of the technology that they're describing!

Dan Brown fans take note, if you think Mr Brown's excursions into what he imagines passes for \\"hi tech\\" story lines then you will be sorely disappointed with the STN series simply because you will not understand *any* of the technology. Keep up the good work, Syngress! I look forward to the next book in the STN series."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"'Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent' (STN:HTOAC) is a detailed look at the capabilities a structured threat could apply to the world's vulnerable digital infrastructures. Rather than hire a Beltway Bandit, I recommend those planning the digital defense of this nation read HTOAC. This book is more creative, comprehensive, and plausible than what most 'infowar' think-tanks could produce.HTOAC is second in the STN series, which is developing into an entertaining and effective way to train security professionals. I was a little worried that such a large team of authors would not be able to create a cohesive book. It's easier to assemble the series of vignettes in the original 'Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box' than it is to tie together stories by a dozen authors. While the editing is rough is some places, the storyline explained each individual's part in the caper fairly well. Although the end of the book hints at a certain conclusion, I would have enjoyed a more definitive epilogue, perhaps written from the law enforcement perspective.The strength of HTOAC derives from the expertise of its authors. I've never seen anything in print quite like Joe Grand's chapter on switch hacking. Ryan Russell's description of Knuth's bunker buildout would put the Discovery Channel's 'Monster House' to shame. The attention paid to leveraging unauthorized physical and wireless attacks also seemed very realistic.I have no major concerns with HTOAC, but I don't think it was necessary to print a log of emails exchanged during the book development process. The text held its own at 345 pages, so 50 pages of email add no real value. I also question the need for authors to write 5-star 'reviews' of their own books. Authors write books, and readers write reviews.I look forward to the next book in the STN series. Syngress is doing an excellent job bringing nonstandard security topics to light by tapping niche talents. Everyone will look at their defensive posture differently after reading HTOAC; this is the authors' greatest gift to the security community."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent is a suspense-filled fiction book based on real computer security components. It is an excellent follow-up to the first in the &quot;series&quot;, Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box. Each chapter can be read as its own short story, but they are tied together in ways you wouldn't expect unless you read the whole book. It's a great concept for a book and an excellent way to learn about computer security weaknesses and what could really happen if a group was assembled to own a continent!"},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I'd recommend this book to those who have some knowledge of hacking and now want to get a sense for how hacking is actually done in the real world. Even though the book is a fictional account of the exploits of a criminal hacker mastermind and his often unwitting accomplices, the scenarios involve plausible attacks using real world tools. And even though it is a work of fiction, this book should not be read for the story. Rather, the story is there to illustrate the hacker scene and add spice to the technical content. After reading this book, you will be better able to think like an attacker. You will get a glimpse of hacker culture. And most importantly, you will want to hack stuff.The book excels at showing the thought processes, techniques, and tools used to break into systems. It contains actual logs, command prompts, and code snippets. The authors explain why the tools were used instead of merely how to use them. I myself learned the most from seeing the work flow involved in developing an exploit for closed source programs using debuggers, disassemblers, and packet captures; a process which before now had been a bit of a mystery to me. While the chapters focus on covering topics in breadth instead of in depth, those new to the field should make plenty of fascinating discoveries throughout the book such as tin can antennas, money laundering techniques, and what is supposedly the word for a female hacker.I was most impressed by the presentation of phone phreaking. Joe Grand claimed he was best suited for writing about phone phreaking because \\"it isn't a 'sexy' avenue. And that's where I come in. I'm not very sexy.\\" While I was reading the phone phreaking chapter, I had assumed that whoever had wrote it made phone phreaking so sexy that there was no way the author couldn't be sexy himself. And then I found out at the end that it was written by some random \\"not very sexy\\" guy name Joe. I was devastated. But my shock did not last long as I pursued further information on what I had once thought to be a dull and dying subject.The book was fast paced and easy to understand, reading like the novel that it is. Fyodor and FX's chapters deserve special mention for their wit, while the chapter on ATM hacking mildly annoyed me with it's overenthusiastic style and excess of geeky metaphors. The money laundering chapter was good, but had a few annoying typographical errors including the following unfortunate mistake: $query = \\"select all from users where $user = user and $password = password\\". A good balance was struck between story and technical detail, yet I would have liked more technical details about the ATM hack and especially the money laundering.As for the story, it was good but not great. I really enjoyed the disciplined and straight-down-to-business criminal mastermind, Knuth. His mere appearance in a chapter would deaden the air and fill the room with dread. I eagerly turned the pages, wanting to see how the cryptic clues left in each chapter would come together into Knuth's devious scheme. The problem was, they didn't. Flir and Saul's chapters barely even had anything to do with the grand plot, and the part of Saul's chapter that did concern the plot felt forced. Where there was a connection to the main plot, it was usually intriguing but never fully explained. We didn't even get to see the results of the ATM hack, apart from an ambiguous reference in the closing chapter. But worst of all, was the ending. It was lame and left me feeling cheated.Despite the above problems with the arch plot, the plots of the individual chapters were usually done right. I really enjoyed the network defenders' point of view in the chapters that included them, especially H3X's chapter where they were interleaved with the attacker sections instead of appended at the end. The hacking tales were captivating. The personalities and quirks of the characters were not quite endearing, but close enough. I was disappointed that there was almost no depiction of failure or even hitting a brick wall. Every time an obstacle was encountered, a solution was found almost immediately after. At times I'd even classify these \\"chance\\" events as deus ex machina. Perhaps this luck could instead be attributed to the unnatural skill that the characters possessed. While I get that Flir is supposed to be a kid genius, it just seemed a bit too much. But I suppose when you are pulling off a scheme like Knuth's, you only recruit the best.How to Own a Continent gets 4 stars. If the plot was better, I'd give it a 5."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I first read this book when it came out, but now that I have the paperback edition, I can review it properly. I find this particular book the best of the whole series.I'll just say that, while the writers are outstanding security professionals and some of them fellow researchers, we don't have much of literary skills here, but I'm glad they made the effort and the results are pretty good, but sometimes I felt disoriented as I was reading the book. As I said, it's a fast and entertaining read, with a basic development schema and a lot of focus on the technical side, managing to be interesting and thought-provoking in real-life sccenarios. The only detail I find discouraging is the quality of the screenshots, as their quality is not very detailed.Overall, it's a fun read!

Great read. When I saw there was a follow-up titled Stealing The Network - How to Own a Continent (STC), I had to read it too. Once again, a great read for computer and security people.Much like STN, STC is a series of fictional episodes involving system attacks and exploits. The episodes aren't real, but the techniques and concepts outlined are definitely true to life. The main difference between the two is that STC is a cohesive series of attacks coordinated by a mysterious person in the background who wants to disrupt a continent and make a huge financial score. So while each story in STN was a stand-alone chapter, STC is more like a mystery techno-thriller that is light on plot but heavy on technical detail.In addition to learning about attacks and how they can occur (which you can get in just about any security book), STC once again adds the color of the attacker's personality into the equation... Why they do it, what they stand to gain, and what level of effort they are willing to expend to gain their prize. I feel that most security departments fall flat in this area. They can configure and set up proper security &quot;by the book&quot;, but they are unable to think like a cracker and anticipate the unexpected. That's probably where this book (actually, both books) adds the most value to the collection of security knowledge and wisdom that's available on the technical bookshelves today.If you're looking for a techno-thriller novel that reads like Tom Clancy, this isn't your book. But if you're looking for solid security information told in a colorful and unusual manner that will cause you to question your own security awareness, you found what you're looking for..."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I've read just about every &quot;hacker&quot; and security book worth reading over the past few years, and honestly, most of them really were not worth reading. But, this book is truly unique and is well worth your time to read. The security industry is incredibly complex; technically, socially, and ethically; and this book reflects that. There are many very talented (and WAY TOO MANY not so talented) people on the right, the wrong, and the in between of cyber security. The landscape of the internet changes almost every minute. This book manages to communicate the technical and social intracicies at the same time through a fairly compelling story that also encompasses very challenging, technical information. This really is a must read for anyone involved with the security community."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I have read several books featuring Ryan Russell (Stealing the Network, Hackproofing Your Network, among others), Joe Grand (Stealing the Network, Hardware Hacking), and Russ Rogers (WarDriving: Drive Detect, Defend, Security Assessment: Case Studies for Implementing the NSA IAM) and have never been disappointed. This book was no exception. The story is presented in an easy to read style and the technical details are accurate and well presented.I would recommend this book for anyone responsible for securing their networks, anyone interested in information security or vulnerability exploitation, and anyone who enjoys reading a good story. It's just a fun read."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I read a lot of technical books and also a lot of spy books. This mashed both of my favorite types of books.

I would recommend, and have recommended this book to a lot of people."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"Let me start by saying that, for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The individual chapters were entertaining, educational, and in general very well written. Where my problem with the book lies is in how they tried to string it together as a book. There is a running plot line that involves the main character and the law that basically just falls apart two thirds of the way through the book. Furthermore, how everything was tied up (or, rather, wasn't) in the end was very poorly done IMO. This is really the main reason I subtracted two stars. It's impossible to discuss particulars w/o including spoilers, so I won't, but I honestly felt ripped off after turning the last page. Suffice it to say that the book would have been much better if it had ended 10 pages earlier.That aside, this book is easily as good as \\"Box\\" and is a very worthwhile read -- just don't get involved in the story line, and don't expect any sort of payoff at the end."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"Through a series of fictional system attacks and exploits Stealing the Network: How To Own a Continent provides a basic education in network security. More than just what can happen, it details each attack so you learn the purpose of the attack as well as how it is carried out. Each of the chapters provides the fictional account of an individual who takes on a single network attack. What the reader soon discovers is that it is actually a carefully orchestrated chain of attacks with a larger purpose in mind.One of the things I really liked about the book is that it is not just a dry security book turned into a more interesting novel but it gives the reader a look at the personalities of those who get involved in these things. Each of the attacks involves real tools that can be downloaded or purchased off the Internet as well as real techniques. If you want to know how an attacker thinks and how far they will go to achieve their goals as well as some of the common techniques you can't go wrong with Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"I read the first book in this series, and was both excited/skpetical when I saw their was a sequel coming out. I am often disapointed with sequels to books or movies, because it often seems like the creators rush out something new to try and make some quick $$. This is one of the very rare ocassions where as much as I liked the first, I like the second even better. The authors of this edition have raised the bar by interconnecting a series of short stories into a single, intriguing narrative. What's really impressive is the they accomplish this while still teaching you about network security and vulnerabilities. The details of the hacks while far-fetched in places are technically accurate and incredibly timely. As much as I liked the stories and the hacks, my favorite part of the book is actually an appendix that transcribes a series of e-mail threads amongst the authors as they wrote the book. It's rather intersesting to see the likes of Fyodor, Kevin Mitnick, Tim Mullen, Jay Beale, etc. argue about the plot, joke around, etc. This book presents an intriguing look into the minds and tactics of criminal hackers and info. sec professionals."},{"Title":"Stealing the Network: How to Own a Continent","review":"Well, you can make a novel out of it.Which is precisely what the folks at Syngress Publishing have done. The MO here is to gather a group of experts in the 'hacking' field. Then, have them each write a chapter that focuses in on their sub-area of expertise. Finally tie all the chapters together with an overriding thread, in this case an uber-geek villian looking to make a final score.And it works quite well. If you are going to pull this off, then there is a balance between the techno-speak portions and the traditional elements of a novel (plot, characterization, etc). Granted, given this books target audience, it can pile on plenty of the technology and be just fine. But you can't igonre the story.Most of the contributing authors are able to hold up the 'story' side as well as the 'tech' side. Some do not, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. In particular, one chapter so muddles the character motivations, plot lines, and timeline that the novel is not quite able to recover with a wholy satisfying ending.I never expected Dickens, though. I did hope to broaden my knowledge of hacking - the hows and whys while being entertained. And 'How to own a continent' delivers the goods in a unique and fresh way.

A good plot. Throw in the mob, strippers, assassinations, sex, money laundering, and conspiracy and what do you have? A tawdry, steamy Harold Robbins novel. Throw in computer hackers, war-driving, denial of service attacks, blackmail, social engineering, keystroke loggers, and rooms full of computer geeks? You have possibly the best book written in this post 9/11 world that deals with how teams of individuals, or even individuals who do not know they are working alone, bringing havoc to the financial markets of Africa, stealing millions of dollars in the process. No this is not a Tom Clancy book. His books, while I love them, plod along too much for the target audience of \\"Stealing The Network - How To Own A Continent\\" (FX et al, Syngress Press, 2004, 432 Pages).From the moment I opened the book, I did not want to put it down. Following on the heels of Stealing The Network - How to Own the Box, this book does not waste any time in capturing the readers attention and imagination, showing how vulnerable we all really are in a wired (or even wireless world), and how little we can do about it if network and security administrators do not do their jobs. It shows how things can be prevented or detected if even one bright individual is willing to step up and call attention to problems.I am really afraid to go into too much plot detail because it really would spoil the read, and far be it for me to tell the potential reader that \\"Rosebud is a sled\\". But all you need to know that because Kevin Mitnick was involved in the publication of this book, the scenarios and stories that are laid out and unfold may be more real than you could imagine (or even fear).If you are a \\"geek\\", you will thrill at the depth and breadth of technologies covered in this book. If you are a casual reader, you will love the story presented. You do not have to be a technical person to appreciate the taut story-telling.Who Should Read This Book?Anybody and everybody who has even a passing interest in how technology and social engineering can be used to conspire to bring down a company, a country or even a continent.Word of AdviceNext time you go to the hospital for surgery, call and make sure your blood type is correct (IF you have that luxury).ScorecardDouble Eagle on a LONGGG par 5"},{"Title":"Alone in a Crowd: Women in the Trades Tell Their Stories (Women in the Political Economy)","review":"Jean Schroedel(a courageous trailblazer) takes on a task that is well overdue, even in 1985.Here are 25 self stories of women who wanted a piece of the forbidden pie (a nontraditional job/trade).

Leslie offers sound advice in choosing the healthiest pieces of seafood and avoiding frozen and chemically processed junk. Also included are sensible cooking and preparation techniques, sauces, garnishes, marinades, serving advice, party and grill specialties, etc. Her writing style is pleasant and highly readable and so far, according to my wife, I'm batting 100 on successful dishes.

This book has gotten me to cook and our family to eat more fish happily which is great for our health. I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"Great Fish, Quick: Delicious Dinners from Fillets and Shellfish","review":"At a time of cholesterol-watching, one could not ask for a better fish cookbook. And I say this as someone who never used to choose fish as a first choice. Leslie Revin's recipes are easy to follow -- and the results are fantastic. I hope she will use her talents to publish on other types of foods as well."},{"Title":"Great Fish, Quick: Delicious Dinners from Fillets and Shellfish","review":"My husband and I would eat fish 7 nights a week if we could but we live in the midwest so it's not very cost efficient--we settle on 3-4 nights a week. I have over 20 cookbooks on seafood alone. This book is the BEST book I have found. It not only tells you about the fish (briefly, not too detailed), it gives you other fish options to substitute for each recipe (which is nice if you are limited to what's available at the fish store), breaks the index down by type of fish AND type of sauce and other ingredients so if you feel like something with avocado or black beans or tomatoes you can search the index by ingredient and not have to search the entire book for specific recipes. And, unlike other &quot;quick meal&quot; cookbooks, this one truly is quick. Finally, each recipe frequently calls for one or all of my four favorite ingredients: fresh garlic, fresh flat leaf parsley, extra virgin olive oil or butter and wine."},{"Title":"Great Fish, Quick: Delicious Dinners from Fillets and Shellfish","review":"After having lived on the coast for a year and STILL being afraid of cooking fish and shellfish at home, I checked this book out from the local library and gave it a whirl.

One aspect of Indian society Gandhi criticizes is the relationship between Muslims and Hindus. Gandhi tries to convey the idea that religious identity does not constitute for nationality. He feels that in order to obtain swaraj, India's people must unify themselves as a nation. By disbanding disagreements between the two religions, with acceptance and without imposition, Gandhi implies that what is important- Mother India- can be saved. Both Hindus and Muslims should stop seeking concessions from the British, begin the swadeshi movement (Indian-made goods), and that a universal language (Hindi) would also help the cause. Another factor which will lead to swaraj is passive resistance. (Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement 1931-34). Unlike Nehru, Gandhi opposed modernization/industrialization. These views, as well as views about education and economic reform are also included."},{"Title":"Gandhi: 'Hind Swaraj' and Other Writings","review":"This book is simply awesome. I call this one of the best books I've ever read. It presents Gandhi's views lucidly and you understand the clarity of thought and spirituality of a person who lead India to freedom.To all Indians who are unaware of their own civilization, this book also contains portions where Gandhi gives reasons for why he regards Indian civilization to be the best. (I accept that I'm being chauvinistic).However, this book is not meant for Indians alone, it is for people who wish to be open-minded, who dare to think outside the box, who wish to understand the world, mainly who wish to search for the all-pervading truth.Satyameva Jayathe (Truth always wins)"},{"Title":"Gandhi: 'Hind Swaraj' and Other Writings","review":"This excellent new edition of Hind Swaraj fulfills the needs of all readers, either for private and academic purposes. Extraordinary is especially the introduction which covers all major subjects which should be taken into account for understanding &quot;Hind Swaraj&quot;, e.g. wesetern and eastern influences on Gandhis thoughts, the London &amp; South African years etc. The text itself is issued with a lot of explaining footnotes which also refer on the original (written in Gujarati). It's so far the first edition I know which compares between the english and gujatati text ! The only, minor manko might be the fact that the South African years are treated rather short, but the bibliography and advices for further reading lead the ambitious reader to new sources."},{"Title":"Gandhi: 'Hind Swaraj' and Other Writings","review":"This is an excellent book in which Gandhi presents his critique of Western civilization, his thoughts on passive resistance, his belief that love wins over power and force and his belief that to govern yourself politically requires that you have the discipline to first govern yourself personally.A great addition to the book are the editor's introduction and many footnotes. These help to explain not only Gandhi's argument and key points but also the historical context in which Gandhi wrote."},{"Title":"Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object","review":"A lot of the critique of how anthropologists \\"make their object\\" in the 80s and 90s can be traced back to some of the ideas in this book. It is a profoundly important analysis of how time is manipulated in such a way as to create a boundary between \\"them\\" and \\"us.\\" As the other reviewer says, it is not an easy read, but I don't think you can really know the history of recent anthropological theory without giving this book some of your attention."},{"Title":"Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object","review":"In this book the anthropologist Johannes Fabian, who received his PhD from the University of Chicago, brings a fresh insight to a central topic in anthropology: time. Fabian criticizes structuralism's perspective of time and aims to prove how time is often ignored in ethnography as coevalness is usually denied to the other."},{"Title":"Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes Its Object","review":"The thesis of this book I found quite interesting and accurate: that anthropologists consider their subjects as existing in a different time from themselves, in some mythical past. However, the style of the writing seemed as if it was literally translated from the German. I found it very difficult to understand, opaque, and wondered many times why I was bothering to slog through the thing."},{"Title":"Beyond the Boundaries: Life and Landscape at the Lake Superior Copper Mines, 1840-1875 (Michigan)","review":"Larry Lankton has achieved a great deal in bringing us closer to the early history of Michigan's Copper Country, to help us experience this rugged region in a rugged time as though we had lived there and in those days ourselves. This book, his latest, concerns private life during the first decades of the great Copper Rush on the shores of Lake Superior, which began some five years before the California Gold Rush and which was one of the most productive mining eras in human history (did you realize that?). Like many similar books on old times, Lankton's chapters are topical. Some are more interesting than others, and my favorites are the chapter concerning the early frontiersmen, young and scraggly bucks, who first came to the wilds of the Keweenaw Peninsula; another about labor at the early Copper Mines; and finally the one on crime in the early mining communities out in a region that was once at the edge of civilization. Lankton writes in an easy, congenial manner and bounces from topic to topic within the chapters without any organizational principle other than what he thinks we readers might find interesting about life in the woods and at the copper mines. Though this is not a book to start with when studying the Copper Country and its deep history, it is nonetheless a first-rate addition to the literature of the Keweenaw. (By the way, I live summers in Copper Harbor and my great-grandparents were all Finnish immigrants to the Keweenaw.) Thanks for a job well done, Larry."},{"Title":"Occupational Therapy for Children, 5e (OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR CHILDREN ( CASE-SMITH))","review":"This is a very informative book and I will probably use it as a strong reference in years to come. It is not, however, a very easily read textbook. Some areas are repetative and make for very slow reading. Many times the author backs up her explanations citing studies. This is excellent in a reference book, however, as an introduction to an area of OT, it makes learning the subject matter laborious."},{"Title":"Occupational Therapy for Children, 5e (OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR CHILDREN ( CASE-SMITH))","review":"While I agree with the previous reviewer that the book is slow reading, I have many positive things to say about it as well. The book has a plethora of resources for students and practitioners alike, including readings, websites, etc. to augment eval/tx or to further explore a topic. Also, the fact that it's a brand-new edition means that everything is evidence-based and backed up by the latest research, meaning that what you read is best-practice.

It provided me with more information than I had in my notes from school and I referred to this textbook almost daily.

It is set in the time when 'modern' lifestyle was just taking hold; some Inuit were living in permanent settlements while others were still living exclusively on the land. Houston modestly tells of his efforts to bring Inuit sculpture to southern galleries and sales and to have Inuit 'handicrafts', as refered to at the time, become recognised as one of the world's essential aborigional art forms.The book is full of detailed observations of Inuit society and the tremendous skills these unassuming people possessed that allowed them to thrive in what must be the world's harshest climate. The constant battle with the elements is etched most deeply in Houston's account of the race to get his wife, suffering from acute appendicitis, to the 'outside'where she could have a life-saving operation.I most enjoyed Huston's portraits of the gentle hunters he met, from whom he bought wonderful sculptures, some of which now have prominant position in the world's major galleries and museums.A great book for art lovers, anthropologists and observers of the human race."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Igloo Dweller: The Story of the Man Who Brought Inuit Art to the Outside World","review":"A flattering autobiography by the brilliant artist and entrepreneur Jim Houston.However, many of the stories are &#34;artfully&#34; embroidered for maximum impact.Nelson GraburnNilisi Ainalik Apirqu (Aupaluktaluk)"},{"Title":"The death of Jesus","review":"The Death of Jesus is a great book for those of us who were reared in a blindly religious house and community but always questioned the authenticity of the mythical tales of the New Testament. The book postulates an excellently researched hypothesis that ties into the many of the post-Jesus history that may not be everything we have been taught in Sunday school. For that reading, I suggest Dr. Carmichael's The Birth of Christianity, which demonstrates clearly that the notion of Jesus- the one we still believe today- was peddled around the influential Mediterranean seacoast for years after Jesus' death. Great marketing, but not accurate even to what Yeshua bin-Joseph (Jesus) himself believe. It is possible to see that the beliefs of the good rabbi from Gallilee were exploited, especially after his death, so the reader comes away with a feeling that the entire episode of Jesus' short career reflects very little on what we have been told in Sunday sermons. Get both books! It will open your eyes."},{"Title":"The death of Jesus","review":"This book was originally copyrighted in 1962, then again in 1982 and published in 1995. Judging by the contents, I think it was little changed from the original copyright date. As such, it is a pretty good book for the 1960s, but extremely dated for 1995.Mr. Carmichael is fascinated by all the contradictions in the gospel accounts of Jesus' life and particularly his death. He does a good job of listing these and discussing them, but his perspective is one of constant wonder without any fundamental methodology to analyze the reasons for these discrepancies.Carmichael also falls into the trap of often referring to the gospels as a whole, and moving haphazardly from one gospel account to another. Many authors do this, and they always do so at their peril. The gospels have to be treated independently if they are to make sense at all.Carmicheal also makes many assumptions which he treats as facts, yet there is no universal agreement with his opinions. For example, he claims that the Gospel of Mark was composed in Rome (p. vii), \\"the cross became the symbol of Jewish resistance (p. viii)\\", Jesus comes from a \\"poor family\\" (p. 47), etc. These assumptions may or may not be true, but each is subject to debate, which Carmichael ignores.There's nothing terribly wrong with this book, and it is well written, but there are so many other and better books which deal with this topic (e.g., Haim Cohn's The Trial and Death of Jesus, Crossan's Who Killed Jesus, Spong's Resurrection) that I can't recommend the book."},{"Title":"Ernesto Che Guevara: Mito y Realidad (Spanish Edition)","review":"El escritor presenta un estudio tan extensamente documentado de la vida de Ernesto Guevara, que el lector toma tempranamente conciencia de la profunda investigaci&oacute;n requerida para poder crear una obra tan detallada, minuciosa y completa.Esta obra recorre la vida de Ernesto Guevara desde su nacimiento hasta su muerte, desenmascarando la imagen de un Estalinista con poca simpat&iacute;a para quien cuestionara su l&iacute;nea pol&iacute;tica.

Every chapter eases into Roman history in a way that brings a beginner up to speed and new insights into America itself. Barr includes extensive footnotes and uses direct quotes from the great Roman historians, playwrights and philosophers whenever possible. The transition from Republican rule to the Empire is clearly described- again, in a way that offers insight in to modern America. Through good emperors and bad, remembering senators corrupt and enlightened, a picture of Rome's historical flaw becomes apparant not in the form of government that it possesed at any given point in time, but the values of their culture and how they changed. If you are interested in Roman history, get this book."},{"Title":"Hisako's Mysteries","review":"This is one of a short list of books I remember from my childhood. I was (still am) a voracious reader, but there are only a few books that I would read over and over again, books that followed me into adulthood because I never forgot them.Hisako is a Japanese girl who is being raised by her grandparents. Her parents are the major mystery mentioned in the book's title, and what she learns about them is key to the plot. The truly striking thing about Hisako's childhood is that she is so much like myself, really, and I am of European descent, grew up in the Midwest. It never occurred to me that people were \\"different\\" -- she seemed so real and normal to me, and though small parts of her culture were clearly different, like her grandparents being clearly disgruntled about having to wear their heavy silk formal clothes for a summer wedding (I could never imagine my own grandparents in silk kimonos or places that didn't have air conditioning) I knew and understood Hisako and she never felt foreign to me. Hisako feels about her friends, school, her life like any girl growing up anywhere, even to her being caught between her grandparents' traditional ideals and her desire for that which is modern, progressive, forward-thinking. For instance, the three of them sleep on a futon. Hisako wants a regular (western-style) bed, and it struck me, decades later, when every college student and young person starting out was getting a futon instead of a couch AND bed, I wondered what fictional Hisako would think, this completion of the cycle from old to new back to \\"new\\" old again.People are people. I don't know any girls aged 10-14 who would appreciate Hisako and her life, and I wonder if the book itself reads and feels dated now. However, when we're plagued with reading material directed at that age group like \\"Sweet Valley High\\" (oh, gag) it's nice to remember that not everyone is a boy-obsessed blond cheerleader in a fictional perfect town in California."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I continue to enjoy this delightful series about a set of characters unlike many others.

I guess somewhere along the first three books of this series I understood that there is no need to be frustrated with the very unserious way the author deals with Mma Ramotswe detection work. This is not a book about crime, but about Africa and the ways of its people. It seems Alexander McCall Smith has a very clear agenda which is to hail old Africa and the old Botswana ways, a message he delivers across all books of this series.Another issue that bothers me is the fact that there is no differentiation between the characters way of speech. Mma Ramotswe very unique talk is repeated by all other characters. What I mean is that unless this is some kind of a special African way of speech (which might be the case and I am just too ignorant to know) then all the characters seem to speak in the same way. All talk in the very short sentenced, one thought at a time speech. A good example would be the following: \\" That is very sad\\", said Mma Ramotswe. \\"But the late dog would not have suffered. At least there is that\\". Or Mma Makustsi writing a letter in the same style: \\"This is a very moving essay, which is well typed. You should tell this lady, though, or she might never know. You should ask her to go with you after the class. That is what you should do\\".And yet, after all my criticism is said and done, I do find myself returning to this series and buying the next book in line. There is still a charm to the traditionally built Mma Ramotswe and all her surrounding characters which we grow to be fond of. My favorite is Mma Matuski, but that's my own problem."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"You know how cake icing, whether stuck on the box of a purchased cake or on the rim of your cake holder at home, when you scrape it off with you finger and put it in your mouth, has that shot of sweetness with no body behind it?

I still love them and have ordered more.That said, I must warn readers who are new to this series: this is not a \\"detective\\" series like Conan Doyle or C.S.I or any other modern detective series with evidence and dangerous culprits.No it is an interesting African woman who solves her assignments by listening to her clients with a good grasp of basic psychology and has fascinating ways of solving her puzzles. The puzzles or no more threatening than finding out what a husband is up to or locating a couple of people who someone needs to talk to.This particular novel explores the development of a side business for the agency asst. detective and a quick romance for her. The development of this character started in the previous novel and I expect it will continue. Also included are some small problems with her two adopted children.My only criticism of these novels is that they have long lectures on how people should behavior. There is a lot of comparison of the old Botswana ways of politeness vs modern day behavior. Both Precious - the main character and her assistant spend time reflecting on what people should do vs. what they actually do. It can get a bit tiresome sometimes.Nevertheless, I am enchanted by the descriptions of the land, the views of the cattle (which were a type of currency), and the various tribal stereotypes and the challenges presented.The books are fast reads and fun. I recommend them for a fun and different reading experience."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth in the series of charming cozies set in Botswana, featuring Precious Ramotswe and her ever expanding circle of friends. The stories in this series rarely deal with the usual mystery fare of dead bodies or missing treasures. Mma Ramotswe's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency most often handles errant husbands, petty thefts and other more commonplace events. Aided by her secretary/assistant detective Mma Makutsi have been in business for some time now and have managed to bring many of their cases to satisfactory conclusions. They have even managed to solve some of their financial difficulties by moving their agency into unused space behind Mr J. L. B. Matekoni's Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors' Garage, a move that proved quite beneficial to all concerned. Still all is not well in Mma Ramotswe's world, her already long engagement to Mr J. L. B Matekoni still has no end in sight and the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency is no longer Botswana's only detective agency. Their competitor is a man who boasts of his vast experience with the CID and in New York causing both Precious and Mma Mukutsi to worry about their business' future.The stories in this series are sweet and gentle, fans of more hard boiled mysteries will probably wish to look elsewhere. The emphasis in this series is very much on the 'cozy', the ongoing storylines involving Precious, Mma Makuti and Rra Matekoni rather than the cases the agency handles. The overall story arc is quite pronounced, although a series synopsis is provided at the beginning of each new book fans of this series will want to begin at the beginning and proceed in order through this charming series."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The series (there are 11 so far!)of the \\"No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" is the most entertaining and compassionate literature that I have read in years. . . .disclosure: I am on #8 of the series right now!!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a gem, an absolutely perfect addition to a nearly perfect series.

I purchased the book for my Kindle, then came back to purchase two more in paperback to pass around to my friends. They have also fallen in love with Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, Mr. J.L.B.

Or...as the reader and Mma Ramotswe fear...has the very careful Mma Makutsi been caught in the cluthes of a Bad Man?That's only one of the connundrums in this highly entertaining book, that finds Precious Ramotswe still unmarried, still solving mysteries, and strained to her last nerve by a male detective who is trying to usurp her business.Absolutely a gem from page one to the end. This is simply a series NOT to be missed."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Following on the heels of The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Tears of the Giraffe, and Morality for Beautiful Girls, is this-the fourth entry in Smith's series about Botswanan private detective Precious Ramotswe, her master mechanic fianc&eacute; Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, their assistant Ms. Makutsi, and their two foster children. Devotees of the series will likely deduce from the title that this particular entry will focus on Ms. Makutsi-former star pupil of the Botswana Secretarial College and expert typist. And they will be right, as the title refers to a school established by Ms. Makutsi in order to supplement her income as assistant detective and assistant garage manager.There is only one real mystery in the slight volume, a man who wishes to make restitution for bad behavior of his some twenty years previously. This calls for Precious to track down two people and handle the matter with her usual delicacy. The only other case is a suspected case of infidelity with no mystery to it at all, and once again Precious's greatest difficulty lies in determining exactly what course of action to take in order to effect the best result for all concerned and achieve cosmic justice. Subplots include the ongoing trials of raising the two foster children, and the founding of a rival detective agency. This latter development held great potential for being a long-running obstacle for the Mma. Ramotswe, but is given short shrift and is dealt with all too easily. As in all the books in the series, Smith aims to portray a positive picture of modern Africa, one all too rarely seen in the West. It is both a celebration of the &quot;old ways&quot; of Africa, and a lament for their decline."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I've read all four of the Alexander McCall Smith books centering on Mma Ramotswe and her No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and I plan on reading the fifth, so clearly (to me, anyway) there is something attractive, charming, and addictive about these little literary gems.The gentle wisdom of the main characters, the insights into human nature that are revealed in the succession of episodes, the often lyrical references to life, nature, and culture in Botwana, all of these things render Smith's books fun to read and at times spiritually uplifting. This latest episode, featuring the professional and romantic adventures of Mma Rowatswe's trusted assistant, the typing prodigy Mma Makutsi, is every bit as charming and readable as the first three books in the series, so one cannot say that Smith is losing his touch as he cranks out book after book.There are, however, some troubling aspects to this series that I confess have come to bother me. Example: in his laudable effort to portray life in Botswana in a positive light, Smith's narrative at times takes on a kind of paternalistic tone, the subtext of which seems to be, \\"these people are simple, yes, but they are gentle, good, and in a kind of salt-of-the-earth way, wise.\\" A style that apparently seeks to keep the prose simple and accessible ends up making the characters themselves often appear childlike and one-dimensional, lacking in real human depth. Because of this, I can see how these books have come to be so whole-heartedly embraced by rat-race-weary urban Western professionals daydreaming of a \\"simpler life and a slower pace.\\"This tendency toward flattening out the stresses and complexities of life in rural Botswana would be more forgivable were it not for the fact that this is the nation with the highest rate of HIV infection on the planet. This is a startling, sad, alarming reality that probably will surprise many readers of these books, and yet this overwhelmingly serious problem is mentioned only in passing within Smith's upbeat tales about lady detectives and dedicated auto mechanics. I certainly don't expect the author to dwell in his stories upon this health catastrophe, but his failure even to allude to the problem seems to me an almost calculated part of his overall strategy of presenting a romanticized, sanitized, they're-poor-but-they're-happy image of life in Botswana.People who have read and appreciated all of the novels will surely interject at this point at least one, \\"Yeah, but...\\" Noteworthy among these could be the fact that in a previous book the principal male character, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni (always, cutely, referred to by this full title), is diagnosed with clinical depression. Yes, this is strikingly \\"real to life,\\" certainly, but even here the simplistic, dumbed-down approach to human problems advanced by Smith emerges, as Matekoni's apparently severe depression is completely obliterated almost instantly through a simple presciption for antidepressant drugs. Anyone familiar with the issue of depression knows that overcoming this malady is seldom so simple as is portrayed in Smith's novel. But problems in Smith's Botswana tend generally toward rapid and total resolution, much in the manner of prime time television episodes.Still, I confess that I find these novels to be soothing and easy bedtime reading, and I'm sure I'll end up buying and reading the next one, despite my growing reservations about Smith's overall project."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This was a great episode from the Series by Alexander McCall-Smith! Mma Makutsi needs to earn some extra money to get by, so she opens a typing school for men. She is coming into her own, and becoming a little more independent! The volume still contains the enjoyable eacapades of Mma Precious Ramotswe!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men by Alexander McCall Smith is a delightfully charming book and is just as good as the other books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series.Taking place in Botswana, Precious Ramotswe runs the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency with the help of her assistant, Mma. Makutsi. They now share an office with the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors company, owned by Mma. Ramotswe's finace', Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. The clients of Mma. Ramotswe have the typical problems including cheating spouses and missing persons. Her biggest case in Typing for Men involves her client, Mr. Moletelo. He wronged two individuals twenty years ago and he now wishes to make amends. It is up to Ramotswe to find these two people.The character of Grace Makutsi plays a more central role in Typing for Men. She now works part-time for the detective agency and part-time for the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors company. She is struggling financially and fears that there is not enough business between the two companies to keep her employed. She has the idea to establish a typing school for men. She observed that men who use computers don't know proper keyboarding, but would be reluctant to attend a regular secretarial school. The school also provides a love interest for Makutsi, which gets a bit complicated.For the first time, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency faces some competition when Mr. Buthelezi, a former CID, opens the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency. Mr. Buthelezi purchases advertisements and gives interviews critical of amateur women detectives (a thinly veiled reference to Mma. Ramotswe). But Ramotswe can tell him why women make excellent detectives. \\"The trouble with men, of course, was they went about with their eyes half closed for much of the time. Sometimes Mma. Ramotswe wondered whether men actually wanted to see anything, or whether they decided that they would notice only the things that interested them.\\"Typing for Men is a book that is beautiful in its simplicity--in the scenery of Botswana, in the characters, in the dialog and especially, in the simple lessons and common sense throughout. I heard a rumor that Smith's books are going to be made into a television series. If so, it will be something worth watching."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Another polished gem where the No1 Ladies Detective Agency unknot the thorny problems of life over cups of bush tea. Precious has her sturdy feet firmly on the ground and her very traditional build projects the air of confidence that is so soothing to the callers passing through their door. The interplay between the two women is always a joy and deftly done. Precious is keen to see that her assistant should find true happiness in her life. Much the same as she has, but then she isn't hampered by a difficult complexion and very large glasses. Not to mention a prickly personality, although her assistant is a very good person with a good heart.Meanwhile her assistant often yearns for just a little more glamour and excitement in her life, she knows she is not one of the pretty girls who get easy lives and rich husbands. Not only that, she is always in need of extra money even though her boss pays her as well as she can, so to make up the shortfall she sets up the Kalahari Typing School For Men. Reasoning quite rightly that men don't want to be shamed by having the ladies outshine them. The classes prove a great success and before too long teacher finds she is being wooed by one of her pupils. But sadly he isn't quite what he seems to be. There are others masquerading as something else and they must also be unmasked. But our ladies are up to the tasks, Precious never loses sight of what is important and knows just when to step in and when to hang back.Problems are solved, hearts eased and things are put back to rights without too much harm done. So life trundles on and Precious carries on pottering about in a tiny white van that one day must surely die. Just not yet.Once you get to know these books am sure you will also love to read and re-read them as it is like sharing a cup of tea with a dear friend.

I just laughed and could imagine her walking with her new green shoes that usually tell a lot about their owner! Just those simple remarks that we might neglect sometimes but it is what makes the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency so famous and successful.Mma Makutsi opens her own project which proves to be as successful and she falls in love for the first time! Just charming! Watching her dance and flutter...There is also the new detective agency, but that proved a failure compared to Mma's insight and sincerity. It is a small country where everybody knows everbody... you just need to ask keeping in mind the Botswana morality.Mr. Smith never fails to state his views on humanity, culture and even politics, but you never get bored of those remarks, you expect them as you would know that this is what Mma Ramotswe would say in this and that situation!Still, there is no wedding date!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am admiring the main character, Mms Ramotswe, so much.

And a pretty decent detective story too."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Western writers usually enter Africa by way of a protagonist who belongs to their own culture (missionary, functionary, explorer, soldier, mail-order bride) and is venturing into unknown territory. So it is one of the mysteries --- and miracles --- of recent fiction that a Scotsman named Alexander McCall Smith should have created a character like Precious Ramotswe, the full-bodied, clear-headed, absolutely captivating investigator who inhabits all four of his Botswana novels: THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, and now, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.Mma Ramotswe (in traditional Botswana culture, honorifics are always used; it seems rude not to do so in the review as well) has had a tough life: married to an abusive jazz musician, she loses her baby and then her beloved father. But she finds her vocation: she sets up the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and is soon attracting clients. She also acquires a fianc&eacute;, garage owner Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, two orphans, and a sidekick, Mma Makutsi, who received a grade of 97 percent on her exams at the Botswana Secretarial College. You don't have to be familiar with the first three books to follow the action in KALAHARI --- McCall Smith is careful to supply context for the first-time reader --- but I think it's better to discover them in order. Not only do you gradually develop a sense of Mma Ramotswe and her life on Zebra Drive (yep, that's the name of her street), but you also become deeply fond of Botswana (this is important since, to the average Westerner, Africa is still a \\"dark\\" --- that is, unknown --- continent). These wise, charming books leave you feeling washed clean and peaceful, with an expanded sense of humanity.Although KALAHARI and the other books are technically mysteries, plot is not the main thing here. There are interlocking events --- a man across town opens a new detective agency; Mma Makutsi starts a typing school for men; Mma Ramotswe solves a case or two --- but there is little real tension or suspense. What keeps you reading is the wonderful writing: pure, economical, funny, utterly lacking in condescension. The evocation of Botswana is often lyrical (its quiet roads, its ubiquitous cattle). Sometimes the stories seem fable-like, as if McCall Smith is telling them around a campfire in the deep African night. This impression is reinforced by the repetition of certain phrases. Mma Ramotswe has a \\"tiny white van\\" and is \\"traditionally built.\\" She believes in \\"the old Botswana morality\\" --- a phrase that covers everything from knocking and calling out \\"Ko Ko\\" before you enter someone's house to the deeper sense of courtesy and integrity that is being overwhelmed by modern life.It is one of the many ironies of this wonderful book that Mma Ramotswe and her cohorts, despite their professed yearning for traditional values, are actually the smartest, most progressive people around. Because they are authentic and honest and guided by common sense rather than greed or pride, they make phony modernists like the proprietor of the rival Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency look like idiots (the scene in which Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi pay him a visit is priceless). Indeed, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN, more than the others in the series, is very much occupied with gender; it has a feminist streak a mile wide.Consider the characters McCall Smith gives us: the entrepreneurial Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi; the imposing head of the orphan farm, Mma Potokwani, who wangles free products and services from everyone (\\"It would take a degree of courage that few possessed to turn [her] down\\"); Mma Tsolamosese, whose daughter has died of AIDS and who is caring for her doomed grandchild with dignity and compassion; and Mma Boko, who is head of a local branch of the Botswana Rural Women's Association but refuses to run for office because \\"all [men] do is talk about money and roads and things like that. ... We women have more important things to talk about.\\"With sly humor and wry tolerance, the novel captures that conspiratorial sense among women --- in any culture --- that men are not quite up to their standards (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni being the exception, of course): \\"The trouble with men,\\" muses Mma Ramotswe, \\"was that they went about with their eyes half closed for much of the time. ... That was why women were so good at tasks which required attention to the way people felt. Being a private detective, for example. ...\\" Or Mma Makutsi, commenting on the essays written by her typing-school students: \\"All of life seemed to be laid out before her: mothers, wives, football teams, ambitions at work, cherished motor cars; everything that men liked.\\" And when Mma Ramotswe says her foster son is going through \\"a difficult patch,\\" a friend replies dryly: \\"Boys do go through times like that. It can last for fifty years.\\"McCall Smith, it turns out, was born in what is now Zimbabwe (then called Southern Rhodesia) and taught law at the University of Botswana, but those facts alone hardly explain his astounding ability to enter the soul of a woman as well as the soul of Africa. He, like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, must be one of the exceptions, a good man. He is certainly an imaginative and observant one. Somehow he manages to communicate the specific feel and spirit of Botswana while also creating characters that transcend the barriers of geography, culture, and gender.McCall Smith is writing a fifth Precious Ramotswe book, according to his publisher, and has started a new series featuring another lady detective, Isabel Dalhousie (Scottish father, American mother).

Follow the continuing story of Botswana's first lady detective in the irresistible \\"Kalahari Typing School for Men\\".Readers who haven't yet discovered Mma Ramotswe will enjoy discovering how her quiet humor, understated observations on life, and resolutely intuitive approach to detection promise to put Botswana on the sleuthing map for good.IF there is a downside to this excellent series of enchanting mysteries, it is that it takes several years after a books initial release overseas to appear in US publication. Readers who are hooked on the lovable characters, beautiful setting and imaginative plots will be glad to know that The Full Cupboard of Life (the 5th in the series, is to be published by Polygon UK May 2003). And in a recent interview Alexander McCall Smith forsees even more books in the series! When will Mma Ramotswe and Mr J.L.B. Metekoni tie the knot (is that the correct phrase for getting married in Botswana?). What further adventures and Life's lessons will the group encounter and share with their readers? I for one CAN'T WAIT!!!The Full Cupboard of Life (the 5th in the series, is to be published by Polygon UK May 2003)I thoroughly enjoyed this book for it's unique and likable characters and exotic setting. The uniqueness of the mysteriesreflect a simpler lifestyle than many of us live and especially expect in a \\"mystery\\". TOTAL ENJOYMENT!John Row"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"I must remember, thought Mma. Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life; at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the verandah of my house in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white. Here she was then, Precious Ramotswe, owner of Botswana's only detective agency, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency-an agency which by and large had lived up to its initial promise to provide satisfaction for its clients, although some of them, it must be said, could never be satisfied. And here she was too, somewhere in her late thirties, which as far as she was concerned was the very finest age to be; here she was with the house in Zebra Drive and two orphan children, a boy and a girl, bringing life and chatter into the home. These were blessings with which anybody should be content. With these things in one's life, one might well say that nothing more was needed.\\" (Page 1)So begins Alexander McCall Smith's latest book, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN. He has a wonderful African storytelling voice. Parts of the book are funny, sad, educational, and touching.Mma. Ramotswe deals with real and moral problems. Although the troubles take place in Africa, they are universal and range from searching for people from the past, cheating spouses, looking for love, raising children, trying to improve one's financial status, trying to right a wrong, to dealing with competition, and more.I enjoy the way Mma. Ramotswe solves her clients' problems as well as her own. There are no guns or high-speed chases. There is no fighting, cursing, or the likes. An element of danger and adventure exists in Mma. Ramotswe's work but the detective uses her wits and manners when dealing with others. The plot is always refreshing.I love the way THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN transports me to Mma. Ramotswe's world. I feel like I'm a part of the detective agency. I feel like I'm riding with Mma. Ramotswe in her little white van along the Botswana plains. I feel like I'm sharing a cup of red bush tea with her and Mma. Makutsi. I feel like I've tasted a slice of the cake that Mma. Potokwani always serves Mma. Ramotswe at the orphanage. I feel like I know the kind and gentle Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. I feel like I'm in the same room with his funny mechanic apprentices.Another good read.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe is back in form in the fourth book in the series about the No. 1 Ladies' Detective agency. Her detective agency is on solid footing although she's barely breaking even financially; she's become in institution in the community, her faithful fiance Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is still faithful (are these two ever going to set the date??) and overall, life is good. But there's a small cloud on the horizon; a pushy male detective who claims to be from the Big Apple sets up shop in town, loudly proclaiming that sleuthing is a man's business after all, and threatens to give Mma Ramotswe some serious competition. But Mma. Makutsi, her trusty assistant, saves the day by scavenging some old typewriters and opening an adjunct business in their office, a typing school for men (what's the difference between a clerk and a secretary, except that men are called clerks and women are called secretaries, Mma. Makutsi reasons; after all, they both need to know how to type). And next thing you know, business is booming, and one of Mma. Makutsi's students is making some serious moves on her. Is love in the air? Or is this guy maybe too good to be true? It's up to Mma Ramotswe to find out, when she has time off from her search for two missing persons, and dealing with that pesky competition on the side.Alexander McCall Smith brings Mma Ramotswe back onstage with all her formidable qualities very much in effect; her shrewd mother-wit, her common sense, and her uncanny intuition. Like the first three book, \\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" is an enchanting love poem to the people and the continent that so intrigues and fascinates Smith, and which he makes so fascinating for the rest of us. It's all summed up in his coda on the final page:africaafrica africaafrica africa africaafrica africaafrica"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"As Westerners know, the confrontations between men and women are often acrimonious. Many books, with positions ranging from the militant to the yielding, have been written on the subject. But this small novel, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot;, gently and quietly explores the relationships between men and women, and wisely and quietly illustrates the virtues of respect and patience as people learn to live together.Yes, this is a 'detective' novel, and it's also a folk tale, an allegory, and a spiritual journey for all of the characters--and the reader. The heroine, Precious Ramotswe, returns in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series to confront a number of problems: a client who needs to make amends to important women in his life, an adopted son who is reaching puberty, a fiance who is fragile but growing stronger, an assistant who wants a man and finds one, and competition for her business with an obnoixious male detective.But Precious is a well-rounded lady in her late thirties who possesses wisdom, maturity, and directness and sensibility. In less than 200 pages of this deceptively simple and exquisitely crafted novel, the problems are solved and--yes--the men learn to type.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency Series is a wonderful one. It is set in Botswana, where people mend tea cups rather than throw them away, the simplicity and dignity of the lifestyle is in itself a lesson."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Narrator Lisette Lecat, a native of South Africa, is a polished voice performer doubly blessed by a winning way with accents. She gives vibrant voice to the unconquerable Precious Ramotswe, proprietress of Botswana's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.Possessed with intelligence and human intuition in an abundance that matched her girth Mma Ramotswe has familiarized herself with an instruction manual, &quot;The Principles of Private Detection.&quot; Then, equipped with a &quot;tiny white van,&quot;minimal office equipment, an assistant, Mma Makutsi, and three mugs in which to brew redbush tea she opened for business.She loves Botswana, and feels she knows &quot;how to love the people who live in this place.&quot; It is her duty, she believes. &quot;to help them solve the mysteries in their lives.&quot;Much has happened since Mma Ramotswe first entertained these revelatory thoughts. Her business has flourished to the extent that she has been able to buy a home on Zebra Drive and, on the far side of her thirties, which she considers the &quot;finest age to be&quot; she has become engaged to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the proud and proper owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.Now, with the fourth in Alexander Smith's engaging series, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men,&quot; she has two adopted children in her care, and is confronted by a rival business run by a macho retired policeman who trumpets that only a man can be a proper detective.Mma Makutsi also faces challenges. Her bank balance is anemic, and her life lacks romance. Then, quite suddenly, &quot;a strikingly good idea&quot; occurs to her: she would open a typing school for men. She realizes that men have to type in order to use computers, but did not learn to type correctly because &quot;they are ashamed to say that they cannot type and they do not want to go and have to learn with a class full of girls.&quot;An evening class held in a church hall so that others would think the men were going to a church meeting was the solution. Not only is the school an unqualified success, but there is extra-circular activity when a student becomes enamored with Mma Makutsi. Regrettably, there are complications in this pairing - complications that trouble Mma Ramotswe.Equally distressing is Mma Ramotswe's latest client, Mr. Molefelo. Now, a well-to-do engineer Mr. Molefelo once committed what he considers to be egregious sins. He wants to make amends for past wrongs. Thus, it falls to Mma Ramotswe to find those he has misused.These tasks aren't difficult for Botswana's No. 1 lady detective who, possessed with Solomon-like wisdom, also suggests precisely what Mr. Molefelo might do to achieve proper atonement.Spare and neatly crafted, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School For Men&quot; sparkles with African sunshine and Mma Ramotswe's wit. It is refreshing and irresistible, leaving listeners eager for more.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In the latest book in THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY series, Precious Ramotswe, the first female private detective in Botswana, has issues: (1) a strutting, cocky new detective has opened shop in Gaborone and is threatening her business; (2) one of the children in her care has taken up a bad habit; (3) her secretary/assistant, Mma Makutsi is involved with a suspicious man; (4) Mma Makutsi has opened a sideline business, teaching men to type and (5) a client has given her an urgent, delicate assignment.Like Jan Karon's gentle fiction, I never tire of stories about Precious, her finance, her employee, and their lives in Africa. True, there is no thrilling action (unless you count the miracle in the garage....or the death of a water pump), but there is plenty of heart and some wonderful soul in Alexander McCall Smith's stories about the first female detective in Botswana.Read the books in order. THE NO. 1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENY. TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE. MORALITY LESSONS FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm a neophyte to this series. I guess I walked into the middle of the party, since The Typing School is number 4 of 7, to date. This book was easy reading, comforting, polite, and harking back to another less nasty age of human interaction. No grisly murders or inhuman brutality going on here. Not much crime either. But we have a strong moral compass monitoring the daily melodramas of life in the well-drawn person of Precious Romotswe, and we have an exotic backdrop of Botswana, which is described with precision as a lovely wayside stop in paradise that is slowly caving in to the vagaries of \\"modern\\" behavior (read rudeness).I really liked the Typing School and recommend it as a pleasant resting place between more meaty fare. I also can see how indulging in such bon mots and straightforward writing found here can become habit-forming."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma. Precious Ramotswe muses, \\"I must remember how fortunate I am in this life, at every moment, but especially now, sitting on the veranda of my home in Zebra Drive, and looking up at the high sky of Botswana, so empty that the blue is almost white.\\" Our wise protagonist has much to be thankful for, indeed. Now in her late thirties, (\\"the very finest age to be\\"), Mma Ramotswe is a successful entrepreneur, a top notch detective, the proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, engaged to be married to the wonderful Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, (the best mechanic in Botswana), foster mother of two lively children, homeowner, and a most respected member of the community.Her life is not free of care, however. There are problems with her adopted son, a date has yet to be set for her wedding, and friend and colleague Grace Makutsi is having trouble finding a husband. Savvy assistant detective Makutsi, who has picked-up business acumen from her boss, opens the \\"Kalahari Typing School For Men,\\" with a little help from her friends. This special all male school is necessary, as the guys are ashamed to sit in class with women. When Mma Makutsi is not busy looking for suitors, she is searching for potential students.And across town there is new found competition for the Ladies' Detective Agency - always No. 1 in my book. Until recently, Precious Ramotswe had the only PI office in Gaborone. However, the \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency\\" has just opened its doors and is ready for business. Arrogant, aggressive Cephas Buthelezi, the owner, a retired NYC cop, and a male chauvinist if there ever was one, is a master at fighting dirty. He has reopened the issue about a woman's place in the sleuth business...and is making inroads with the local clientele. He advises potential customers to, \\"Entrust your enquiries to a MAN!\\" Needless to say, the financial problems which have longed plagued Mma Ramotswe, significantly increase with the competition.New cases include, a well-to-do engineer from Lobatse, who hires Mma Ramotswe to assist him in righting the wrongs he committed in the past. And, a potentially philandering husband is investigated with disturbing results.Author Alexander McCall Smith's series is so outstanding because of his phenomenal characters, although the storylines are fascinating, and his elegant but simple writing style makes reading enjoyable. Precious Ramotswe is a jewel - an absolute original. Extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities, she possesses a keen perception of the human character. Along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, Mma Ramotswe inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters.

This series is delightful to read, or to listen to on CD."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Wonderful series for any age. The books don't contain language or sexual material that would make a parent hesitate so even teens might enjoy this series. Gems like a character describing herself as \\"traditionally built\\" when she has several extra pounds she carries around are precious. Also, the two lead characters are written to show how they maintain a relationship through understanding and forgiveness, even with personality flaws. Tolerance is a subtle but constant background to the stories. You begin to relate to and care for the characters because of their imperfections."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love this series. It is a rare thing to find adult literature that is thought provoking, exciting, and clean. I feel like I have actually visited Botswana."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Not much else can be said that hasn't been covered in the reviews. Precious is a wonderful, relaxed, sensible investgator and is surrounded by interesting characters such as assistant Makutsi and fiance' Matekoni. Another interesting book and a proud tour of Botswana. The rival detective agency opening up in town won't stand a chance. Mr.Smith writes an amusing and touching novel about the Africa that he knows so well. Buy it!

It is full of wonderful characters against the sunny background of Botswana. Precious Ramotswe(the No. 1 Ladies' Detective) gives gentle counsel to her friends and presents clever solutions to her clients in often minor, but always intriguing cases. The real treasure of this book, like the others in this series, is the warmth of the main characters as they deal with each other and the world they live in."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Alexander McCall Smith's tales of Botswana bear similarities to those of small-town U.S.A. but with a unique cultural slant. When Precious Ramotswe needs information for one of her detective agency's clients, she just visits a friend for a chat and a cup of tea to get the latest gossip. She is nonplussed by the sudden appearance of a rival detective agency and faces the problem head-on by going to his office to introduce herself. Despite the fact that he's all bluster and no substance, he's a former police officer, and that may be all her neighbors need to believe that he's a more qualified detective. The title refers to a venture that her assistant, Mma Makutsi, initiates as a sideline, so that men can learn what's considered to be a woman's skill in a private setting. There Mma Makutsi finds a potential love interest who, Precious discovers, is not what he seems. I knew that everything would turn out OK in the end, but I still enjoyed reading how Precious manages it, without hurting anyone's feelings."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I loved this book. I actually joined his fan club after reading it. He's a delightful author, and writes about good people.

I just bought my fourth book of his."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I adore these books. Because I love giraffes, a friend gave me Tears of the Giraffe as a gift. Thus I discovered the series, and have read every installment. The pace is so relaxing without dragging that they are perfect beach/mountain/vacation reads, or an afternoon treat on a rainy day. Love the books, Alexander!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This first came to my attention as an audiobook. I was checking out the public library for suitable listening material for my two youngest children, and noticed this intriguing title on the adults' audiobook shelf. Hmmm. What on earth could a book with such a title be about? Well, one way to find out, and fortunately it's free at the library, so I took it home with me.Two chapters later and I was hooked on the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Incidentally, if you have not yet heard the audiobook, I recommend it, too. It's read by Lisette Lecat, a talented South African actress who does all the voices and accents, making you feel as if you were really there. In fact, all the books in this series are available on audiobook read by Miss Lecat.I still recommend \\"The Kalahari Typing School\\" as a first-read when telling people they really HAVE to discover this series. However, I will say that as in several other well-known series, it doesn't much matter where you start, since each book subtly refers back to the previous ones throughout the story. This is especially helpful when encountering the main characters for the first time in each book."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"What I love about these books is the immersion into the Botswana way of life from the Botswana point of view. McCall Smith not only visited Botswana, he lived there for some time, and it shows in every detail. The main character's being a detective lets us pry into the lives of others in her culture. As always, the Kalahari Typing School for men is not \\"about\\" having Mma Ramotswe solve a tricky locked-room mystery. It's much more about the interleaving of Western and African cultures. For example, a detective agency replaces a combination of the village grapevine and village leadership. In this installment and the previous three books, Mma Ramotswe's personal life and those of her friends gets more than equal time with the cases she solves.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is my favorite of the four series by McCall Smith that I have sampled. His gentle tone and leisurely pace fit the setting perfectly. I would recommend a new reader begin with the first book, as there is not a lot of explanation as to who all these characters are and how they got to where they are. Not only that, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency sets the mood for the series perfectly.If you are not a fan of crime stories, don't let that put you off. This is a charming fiction set in another culture with an unforgettable main character."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a book I did not want to see end, and certainly look forward to the next in the series.

A great book, hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read this for a book club selection. Unfortunately probably the best I could say is that it is generally a feel good book, and since we had traveled there, it was remotely interesting because of its placement in Botswana. It is a quick read, but I would not recommend it to most people."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I have to admit that I read only up through page 83, which is a little less than half way.

Etc.I like to read these when I need something light, calming or peaceful, but if you are expecting a gripping mystery or something new in contrast to the other books in the series, don't bother.

The books in this series are an easy read and enjoyable because they discuss a simpler life that still has its ups and downs."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men continues as the fourth installment in the fine series about Botswana's first lady detective, Mma. Precious Ramotswe, which was begun in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and followed by Tears of the Giraffe and Morality for Beautiful Girls. Alexander McCall Smith does a fine job of providing the background from the first three novels in the opening of this one, and the book is almost as stand-alone as The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The Kalahari Typing School for Men continues several themes in the prior books including the superiority of women over men, the importance of being organized and diligent, following your heart and spirit to do the right thing . . . in the right way, and intriguing questions about what is moral behavior in complex situations.The book continues its humorous backdrop as Precious finds herself up against an experienced male competitor who opens the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency. The competitor proves to be very annoying to Precious, and she struggles to maintain her optimism in the face of this new trial.With Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni back working energetically at Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mma. Makutsi finds herself dissatisfied. She's really operating as a secretary to both companies rather than as an assistant detective and acting manager, as she had done before. When a new client shows up and insists on speaking with Precious alone, Mma. Makutsi's unhappiness grows. But she shakes herself off, and finds a new opportunity in establishing The Kalahari Typing School for Men, the most unique educational establishment you will probably ever read about.Precious deals with two client cases . . . neither of which is really a mystery in the normal literary sense. But deciding how to represent her clients' best interests provides weighty challenges of Biblical proportions.I was a little disappointed in the book, though. Unlike the earlier three books, it lacks the powerful presence of wild Africa to add character and spice. Increasingly, I felt like I was reading just another comic novel about a woman who is trying to juggle all of the balls at once without dropping one. While that is certainly entertaining, this book lacked the uniqueness that made the other books such continuing and pleasant surprises.As I finished the book, I thought about the special relationship between novelists and their readers. When a novelist establishes a character and a setting for a series of novels, readers expect that what makes that character and setting precious to them will continue. When a book attempts to go off in a new direction, readers should be glad of the author's willingness to experiment. But I do think that the author should provide a valuable substitute if precious elements are left behind. For example, if this novel had been set in an intriguing new locale because Precious had to move, the pleasure of learning about that locale would have made the book's switch in direction worthwhile.Novelists, keep your implicit promises to your readers!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Another little burst of delightfulness from the world of Precious Ramotswe, her husband to be Mr J. L. B. Maketoni and their assistant Mma Makutsi. Here there are all sorts of new developments. J. L. B. is over his depression of the previous book but problems are arising with the behaviour of Puso, the younger of their adopted children, which is becoming stroppy and difficult. Then there is the nasty development of a rival in the detective business, flashy, male, ex-CID and publicly quite contemptuous of the female competition. J. L. B.'s difficult apprentices remain as oversexed as ever but one of them gets religion. It is he who proposes \\"Learn to Drive with Jesus\\" as a name for the new business venture Mma Makutsi proposes to embark on in a bid to save her floundering finances. In the end however she gives up on the driving school idea and proposes to address the worrying lack of typing skills among her male compatriots. Meanwhile Precious and J. L. B. are getting a bit concerned that their enterprising assistant may be lonely and thinking how good it would be if she could find herself a man...What with all this excitement there isn't much time for being a detective and indeed the whole detective business is somewhat sidelined here. Two cases nonetheless come Precious' way, the most substantial of which is no mystery but simply a commission to track down some people the client wronged many years in the past to whom he now wishes to apologize and make amends. This central story of a middle aged man, Mr Molefelo, and his search for personal redemption, needs a very sure literary touch to keep credible and interesting. But McCall Smith's touch is very sure indeed and it is entirely credible and rather moving. As is the whole of this supremely readable book."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In this book, Smith's 4th and most recent book in the &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series, he tackles again some of his usual topics. He again shows the constant battle between traditional values and modern values and their interaction in Botswana.However, in this book, Smith goes even further than he has before. He engages in conveying the ability of people to self-empower themselves. In this book, Smith illuminates the continual problem of a male dominated society and how this situation affects the women of Botswana. Throughout the book, there are multiple examples of the women of Botswana self-empowering, and feeling the tremendous elation and self-satisfaction that accompanies that accomplishment. Starting particularly with Mma Makutsi, Assistant Detective, who starts a business teaching MEN how to type. And it is an immediate success, as men often feel internal cognitive dissonance that they cannot type for themselves, and have to depend on women to do their typing. The concept of the class itself is self-empowerment for men. And the business itself allows Mma Makutsi to feel self-empowered herself, the proprietor of a successful business.While the books are &quot;plugged&quot; as &quot;mystery/fiction&quot; most readers of the &quot;No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency&quot; series recognize, that the cases, the investigations, are really just a device to advance the plot and to help illustrate the points which mostly deal with ethics, morality and how people treat each other. This is truly what Smith is trying to get across and by using Botswana, a small, proud, independent, Democratic country as a microcosm of the world, he tries to help the reader understand cross cultural issues and basic ethical concepts which are slightly different in each venue, but are nonetheless, universal around the world.Smith gives us yet again, a close look at the internal workings of another society and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions as to how it relates to the world they live in themselves. Truly a wonderful and instructive series, this book deserves the 5 star rating."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoy this series of books - the writing is picturesque. I find myself comfortably transported into a world that I know nothing about. No serious issues in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series - just fun, light reading."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In Precious Ramotswe, the proprietor of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, we find the charmed common sense of Africa. She is fond of manners and good company. When her adopted orphans misbehave, she seeks advice. When a sexist competitor brails her detective agency, she treats competition as an indispensable part of running a successful business. When a remorseful client asks for help, she shows empathy. When a wronged woman demands answers, she displays discretion. She is the center of her small world.The first sentence captures the spirit of the book: \\"I must remember, thought Mma Ramotswe, how fortunate I am in this life\\". Indeed, we are fortunate to read about Precious Ramotswe. Delightful."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"So many series start to wane by the time the 4th installment comes out, but not so with Smith's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books. This installment, The Kalahari Typing School for Men is directly on the level of the previous three books--delightful, peaceful, witty, charming.This installment finds Mma Makutsi feeling down because she is \\"just\\" an assistant manager/detective and she wants more out of her life. She would also like the attention of a good man. Not only that, but the responsibilities of taking care of her family back home and her ailing brother living with her have depleted her savings and are hurting her ability to make ends meet. After much thinking, she decides to open the Kalahari Typing School for Men to make some extra money--there she thinks she finds the love of a man, but what she ends up finding is the love of herself.Mma Romatse must solve a couple of mysteries--another errant husband and a man who did something bad in his youth and wants to make amends. These are so lightly tossed in there that you hardly realize the tough detective work that Precious must do--she's definitely one smart cookie!When I finished, I found myself thinking \\"I want to grow up and be Precious Romatswe\\" but then I realized that 1) I AM grown up already and 2) Precious is really my age. She is such a smart, patient, peaceful, wonderful person who sees the good in people and tries to do her best no matter what. I would love to be like that--to be able to step back from the things swirling around in my life and just breathe and let things work themselves out."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth outing for the wonderful Precious Ramotswe and her no.1 Ladies Detective Agency, along with her supporting assistant detective, Mma Makutsi as well as Mr J B L Matekoni. Mr J B L Matekoni is her fiance and the owner of the Tlekoni Rd Speedy Motors where Precious now has her agency. It is a very good move for now people who need a tune up in their car might also think to get the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency to do a little work for them while they wait for their car, and people who come in to have a matter seen to by the No. 1 Ladies Detective agency might also take advantage of the Tlekoni Rd Speedy Motors to have their motor tuned while they wait. Alexander McCall Smith uses every opportunity to gain maximum gentle humour out of the situation. It is lovely stuff.For afficianados of mysteries these are quite a different experience. It is not so much a whodunnit mystery, but more like how will thing be resolved. It is all very nicely done and there is no disappointment.There is new detective Agency in town, The Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency , Ex-CID, EX-New York, Ex-Cellent. Run by a slippery character, Cephus Buthelezi who it seems impossible to pin down on anything actually real about his life. He is half-Zulu which seems to explain a lot. And he is also extremely arrogant, as an article in the local paper shows. Precious is already worried about the agency, but at least Mma Makutsi is half paid with her work at Speedy Motors as Assistant manager.Mma Makutsi wants more to her life though. She wants to establish her own business, and so she begins the Kalahari School of Typing for Men. This will be run using typewriters which don't always work very well and run in a church building so people will think they are going to church, not simply going to typing lessons, descretion guaranteed.There are two cases for Precious to resolve. A man who wishes to make up for his bad actions in the past, and a woman who wants her errant husband traced. She has used the Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency, but has not been satisfied with the results.Lovely winding together of all the stories which have a satisfying resolution. I have read the first three stories in this series in one big rush. They are gentle, richly humourous and very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"\\"The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" belongs to the category of feel-good, heartwarming, inspirational and life-affirming fiction. Reading it reminds me of books of similar genre such as \\"The Alchemist\\". But what sets it apart from the rest are its simple yet powerful writing, unique suburban setting in Botswana Africa and captivating detective storyline charted forward by Precious Ramotswe. The characterization of Precious Romatswe is so effectively done that the reader genuinely feels for her, thinks like her and connects with her. Plot aside, what I find so refreshing in this book is the nostalgic feel for the old simple way of life in Botswana when foreign influences were kept to a minimal and people upheld morals and traditional values.The novel sends an upliftingly positive message to the readers and incorporates various insights on life, that are universally true and equally relevant, be it in Africa, the West, Japan, China or Southeast Asia. One such insight that remains etched in my mind is, \\"... it is possible to change the world, if one is determined enough, and if one sees with sufficient clarity just what it is that has to be changed\\". In a nutshell, this book successfully integrates humour with solemnness. You will undoubtedly crave for more in this series of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The Detective Agency is in a bind. Income from clients isn't matching costs of operations. Even the merging of facilities by moving the Agency to the site of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and elevating Mma Grace Makutsi to Assistant Manager [along with her already being Assistant Detective] hasn't increased the cash flow. Now, in the midst of business and personal crises, a new detective agency is established in Gaborone. It's run, of course, by [shudder!] a man! And what a man! Cephas Buthelezi is a name commanding respect. Whether this man is an inheritor of Zulu traditional power and deserves deference remains to be seen. Will he corral all of the Ladies' Detective Agency's potential clients?Compounding the business stress are the personal issues. Precious Ramotswe, founder of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, has become a foster parent of two orphans. The girl, confined to a wheelchair, has been subjected to schoolmate taunting. Her brother has developed new and disturbing behaviour, typified by the killing of a hoopoe bird, unheard of in Botswana. Beyond the children's problems is the ongoing, but not fulfilled, engagement of Precious and Mr J.L.B. Matekone. Will they ever wed?More to the point of this tale is Mma Makutsi's spinsterhood. As the highest scoring graduate of her typing school, McCall Smith makes her more intellectual than desirable. Yet these very attributes should make her a prime catch for men following Botswanan tradition. And in Mma Makutsi the author shows how these traditions should be respected. Although her &quot;typing school for men&quot; [using ten used typewriters] is created to help the issue of cash flow, is there a more subliminal motive? As it happens, much of the story pivots on this question.There is, as there must be, a &quot;case&quot; to be solved. As with all McCall Smith's tales of Mma Ramotswe's business, it departs from any typical mystery novel. A hesitant man calls on her services with a special requirement. There was a crime, perhaps two, but it was long ago. The victims may not be alive or perhaps far away. Precious is charged with finding them for a unique resolution to long distant events. As always, she rises to challenge with common sense, a bit of personality manipulation, and effective negotiation. As always, she does it all with tact, forbearance and skill, leaving none hurt or regretful.McCall Smith's narrative skills in weaving events and characters have few peers. Although it's doubtful Precious Ramotswe is a &quot;typical&quot; Botswanan, she's a character worth emulating. The author follows the modern pattern of making men either arrogant or weak, but that, unfortunately, drives sales these days. Perhaps when Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges from his doldrums, McCall Smith will be able to restore some balance. One hopes it doesn't take too many books to achieve that.

Like the rest of the series, this book offers a quiet charm that draws the reader into the lives of a small town in Botswana, Africa. Through the eyes of the heroine, Precious Ramotswe, we feel as though we, too, live in this village. The book as a realistic feel and the characters grow on me with each volume.There's gentle suspense. This detective agency tracks down a lost family, to help a client repay a debt, and a straying husband, who turns out to be uncomfortably close to the agency.Although Precious Ramotswe owns a detective agency,she draws on common sense and her vast network, rather than special skills. Unlike Miss Marple, she doesn't go out of her way to find mysteries, or even label her puzzles as mysteries. She just enjoys life to the fullest.Her fiance,Mr. Maketoni, provides a nice foil, with his motor repair agency, and we now meet two apprentices who have the potential to add additional flavor to the series.Like M. C. Beaton, Smith writes small books that convey a sense of place with economy and skill. However, his characters have a dignity that keeps the book charming rather than humorous. Smith is respectful, while Beaton takes a satiric twist every so often.Stiill, of all mysteries I read, Beaton bears the closest resemblance. Fortunately for fans, both authors are prolific. With any luck, we'll see many more volumes in our lifetime."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Fourth in a series about The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency of Botswana, The Kalahari Typing School for Men by Alexander McCall Smith is an easy read. There is nothing terribly exciting or riveting about this novel, but the simple storyline will make you smile.In The Kalahari Typing School for Men Mma Precious Ramotswe and her assistant Mma Makutsi run a detective agency. Business is slow and a competitor has moved into town so the ladies are forced to develop new ways to earn business and money. Mma Ramotswe investigates a complicated case that requires her to use intuition, tact and foresight. Mma Makutsi creates an entirely new way to make money that will also help elevate her from the ranks of assistant detective and help her lead a more full life.Being perceptive of human behavior, Mma Makutsi sees many men around her falling behind in the business world because of their inability to type. They do not want to take classes and be shown up by women, so they end up falling behind technologically. Being a top graduate of secretarial school, Mma Makutsi decides to open a typing classes geared specifically for men. She is able to make use of her contacts at The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and from her secretarial schooldays and suddenly she is in business and finding renewed purpose in her life.As in many good tales, the storylines of Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi become more and more interwoven as the story progresses. The Kalahari Typing School for Men reads like a children's fable written for adults. At no point will the reader be challenged but reading the novel is a pleasure, as Smith's novel reads with the rhythm of life in Botswana."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth installment in the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series and once again Mr. Smith gives us a dose of African pleasure.Precious Ramotswe finds a cure for her fiance Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni's depression and they are back on track. Her assistant Mma Makutsi starts her own typing class for men and falls in love. We get to know the apprentist mechanics a bit better and meet a few more interesting characters in search of mystery solutions from the detective agency. A few scenes are laugh out loud funny. Another enjoyable and easy read from Alexander McCall Smith.I rated this book one star less than the others in this series because of the fact that I felt portions of this book were repeats of the prior ones. I wish that author's who write a series would just allow the books to stand on their own without feeling the need to explain over and over again who and what the characters are. If a reader picks up the fourth book in a series without reading the first three.....isn't that the readers problem. I would have prefered more character's searching for answers than answers to questions that were already provided."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Even though this book is the fourth in the series about the No. 1 Ladies' Detection Agency, it could easily be picked up and read, not having read the previous three books. The reason is that the author starts the book by giving a good summary, in several pages, of the most important points of the previous books. As good as each book in the series has been, it seems as if every new book is even better!This book imparts the wisdom of experience through the characters. I actually cried with the characters when they cried. This book finds Precious Ramotswe still unmarried, and Mma Makutsi starting a typing school, and with a boyfriend. The cases taken on are as interesting as always, and their resolutions impart wisdom to the reader. This book left me immediately eager to pick up the fifth book in the series."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men\\" is Alexander McCall Smith's fourth novel in the detective series that began with \\"The Ladies' Number 1 Detective Agency.\\" In this new installment, the detective cases are not so much crime stories as social and personal situations for private investigator Precious Ramotswe to resolve with her psychological insight and bold maneuvering.The plot component that gives the novel its name concerns the effort of Mma Makutsi, the Agency's skillful office assistant, to found her own business, with unexpected personal consequences. Another new entrepreneur is not so welcome by the ladies - a flashy and contemptuous outsider who sets up a competing detective agency in Gaborone. In the novel's most serious subplot, an important client hires Mma Ramotswe to help him redress some wrongs in his past. The resolution of that case depends upon Mma Ramotswe's wise sense of justice and compassion.In author Smith's charming series, the environment and culture of Botswana, as embodied in Mma Ramotswe and her friends and associates, is as compelling as the mystery. That is especially true of this volume. I like these books as much for their portrayal of Mma Ramotswe, for their evocation of Botswana and Africa, for their moral authority and psychological delicacy, for their depictions of community (with its strengths and weaknesses), for their generous humanity and genuine convictions, as for their detection. These books have heart. I especially like the narrative voice and prose style, deceptively simple in service of portraying its subjects, and often imbued with poetic lyricism about the landscapes of Africa."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth book of Smiths i have read over a period of a few weeks. I was hooked after the first one. Smith really paints a picture of life in Africa and gives great details about each character. I would love to meet Precious!! Cant wait for the next one in the series. A great short read!!!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe seems almost to step back a bit in this book as her trusty aide-de-camp moves into Botswana's entrepreneurial spotlight. But the stories are engaging as ever and Smith somehow manages to continue steady development of all the characters in this marvelous series. Start here or start with any of the previous books; you will be fascinated and ultimately engrossed by the people and the world the author describes."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Hooked. That's what you are. After reading only a few pages of Alexander McCall Smith's delightful tale you're completely in this author's thrall. Episodes in the life of the incorrigible, unconquerable Precious Ramotswe, proprietress of Botswana's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, are endearing, amusing, and speckled with truths.Possessed with intelligence and human intuition in an abundance that matched her girth Mma Ramotswe (the courteous form of address) has familiarized herself with an instruction manual, &quot;The Principles of Private Detection.&quot; Then, equipped with a &quot;tiny white van,&quot;minimal office equipment, an assistant, Mma Makutsi, and three mugs in which to brew redbush tea she opened for business.She loves Botswana, and feels she knows &quot;how to love the people who live in this place.&quot; It is her duty, she believes. &quot;to help them solve the mysteries in their lives.&quot; (Not the crimes, mind you, but the mysteries).Much has happened since Mma Ramotswe first entertained these revelatory thoughts. Her business has flourished to the extent that she has been able to buy a home on Zebra Drive and, on the far side of her thirties, which she considers the &quot;finest age to be&quot; she has become engaged to Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the proud and proper owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors.Now, with the fourth in Alexander Smith's engaging series, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men,&quot; she has two adopted children in her care, and is confronted by a rival business run by a macho retired policeman who trumpets that only a man can be a proper detective.Mma Makutsi also faces challenges. Her bank balance is anemic, and her life lacks romance. Then, quite suddenly, &quot;a strikingly good idea&quot; occurs to her: she would open a typing school for men. She realizes that men have to type in order to use computers, but did not learn to type correctly because &quot;they are ashamed to say that they cannot type and they do not want to go and have to learn with a class full of girls.&quot;An evening class held in a church hall so that others would think the men were going to a church meeting was the solution. Once the idea was fully formed in her mind Mma Makutsi is so elated that &quot;she began to gyrate round the office in celebratory dance, ululating quietly as she did so, her right hand moving backward and forward before her mouth.&quot;Not only is the school an unqualified success, but there is extra-circular activity when a student becomes enamored with Mma Makutsi. Regrettably, there are complications in this pairing - complications that trouble Mma Ramotswe.Equally distressing is Mma Ramotswe's latest client, Mr. Molefelo. Now, a well-to-do engineer Mr. Molefelo once committed what he considers to be egregious sins. He wants to make amends for past wrongs. Thus, it falls to Mma Ramotswe to find those he has misused.These tasks aren't difficult for Botswana's No. 1 lady detective who, possessed with Solomon-like wisdom, also suggests precisely what Mr. Molefelo might do to achieve proper atonement.Spare and neatly crafted, &quot;The Kalahari Typing School For Men&quot; sparkles with African sunshine and Mma Ramotswe's wit. It is refreshing and irresistible, leaving readers eager for more.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. It is well-written and very wholesome. I have read some of the other books in this series and feel very at home with the characters. I look forward to being with them again in the Full Cupboard of Life."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book is a real change in pace and style for Dr. Smith's series. Unlike the earlier three novels, this one builds more oncharacter development and lessons in real life rather than the challenges in detecting the subtle goings on in Gabrone.As always we have the same characters, Manly Maketoni, 97% Makutsi, Christian Charlie and his brother, as always Precious.The novel has two main plots, one around how Makutsi becomes her own boss and the other around how a person repents for his sins done earlier. The character development as always is excellent but repetitive for the reader of the earlier novels. All though, I was shocked by how Ms. Makutsi responded at the end (no spoliers...).A very quick read for the #1 Ladies loyalists and an interesting eye-opener to a new series to the #1 Ladies neophyte.Fred Gabrone Loving Sanford"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"There is something about these books that really resonates with some readers. After reading the first novel, I did not really jump on the collective Botswana Bandwagon... I thought the books were nice, but found nothing exceptional about them. I am glad that I decided to continue with Book 2 though (that was my favorite so far in the series!) I decided to pick up the other books, starting with book 2, on Audio CD. I am much happier with the Audio CD versions than I was with reading the book. I found that reading the stories was a little tedious for me: The writing is very simplistic, and oftentimes the stories are very predictable. While these do show up in the Audio CD, I do not find myself as distracted by them as I did when I read the first two in the series. The reader, Lisette Lecat is absolutely superb. She is a native South African, and spent a number of years in Botswana. She knows the rhythm patterns and speech patterns of the people, and she distinguishes each character with a certain voice. This skill makes the dialogues much more interesting than reading them on the page, and her general narration really make the stories come alive for me. If it were not for her reading the books, I do not know if I would have stuck with this series.The story of _Kalahari Typing School for Men_ was much like its immediate predecessor, _Morality for Beautiful Girls_. The novel focuses a great amount on the development of some characters, and leaves others &quot;out to dry&quot;, and ultimately strays away from the things that made books 1 and 2 of the series so good: the cases, the interactions, and the values of the Botswana people. That is not to say that this book does not have any detective cases, but I find the novels have shifted from their original focus. However, one thing that I did like about this book is the increased role and development of Mma Makutsi. She is a great characters, and until book 3, Mma Makutsi existed in the shadows. I look forward to seeing her develop more in the next books.I plan to LISTEN to book 5 very soon."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is a solid edition to the collection which means this will be a short review! The only thing I will note about this book is that I felt the ending and the resolution of one of the \\"mysteries\\" was a bit too easy. That being said; the book on a whole is just as enjoyable as the rest of the series. I can't wait to get into the 5th book!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"At this point, entering the fourth book in the series, we are all accustomed to Mma Ramotswe and her alternative brand of mystery. One or two mysteries carry through the book, with a couple more short ones in the midst, balanced with a healthy serving of Mma Ramotswe's wisdom and her reflections on the greatness of Botswana. Always relaxing and mildly suspenseful.This one has a subtle difference: there are no actual mysteries. The agency takes on two cases: one involves tracking down some old acquaintances, and the solution to the other is apparent to the reader within a few lines of the client walking through the door.What does that leave us with? Mma Ramotswe has competition in the form of a rude man who sets up a rival detective agency (Trust your problems to a _man_!, says the ad). The foster children experience growing pains. Mma Makutsi seeks a way to earn some extra cash. Mma Ramotse dispenses wisdom and reflects on Botswana.This is still a very pleasant read, Mma Ramotswe has some good insights to share, and the developments in the characters' personal lives are interesting. If you are lucky enough to have access to the audiobook, Lisette Lecat's narration is excellent and soothing as always. I'm glad I read it, but don't come looking for mystery."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Having found this series a little less than a month ago, I find myself totally hooked on the characters and setting that Mr. McCall Smith describes.

It is wonderful to feel this way again, it doesn't often happen."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The remarkable thing about the 'No.1 Ladies Detective Agency' series is that the incredible standard of the books haven't diminished as the series went on. 'The Kalahari Typing School for Men', the fourth book in the series, is as good as the first in the series, and is one of my personal favourites.In this installment of the goings-on in Mma Ramotswe's life in Botswana, the leading lady sets herself the mission of finding her assistant detective, Mma Makutsi, a husband; the agency gets its first taste of competition in the form of a chauvinistic detective who's worked in America; Mma Makutsi sets up a typing school for men and the agency gets a case involving a man who want closure on his troubled past. As always, this latest novel is a successful blend of the personal lives of the main characters, including the heroine, Mma Makutsi, the two apprentices and Mma Ramotswe's long-time fiance Mr J.L.B Matekoni.As always, McCall Smith includes both the detailed descriptions of the incredibly country that is the stage for the story, and gives us a ticket into Mma Ramotswe's mind. In this book, the trend of the series to slowly expand to show the other characters more continues, with Mma Makutsi getting a chance to shine in the spotlight as she sets up her own business. The younger apprentice meanwhile moves away from his promiscuous lifestyle to a more pious one.But, in spite of a slight and temporary spotlight shift to some of the supporting roles, Mma Ramotswe remains queen bee of her small corner of Botswana. The staple of these books remains: Mma Ramotswe's sense of decency and old-school morals which she refuses to bend, and her philosophical outlooks and opinions on everything ensure that this series just keeps going from strength to strength."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In this fourth sequel of the Ladies Detective Agency, the lovely Mma Romatswe has yet to marry Mr. J.L.B Matekoni, but the plans are still in the works as well as adoption of 2 foster children.There are more problems as well.

The author focused more on the main characters' daily lives and their problems as opposed to actual cases. It's great that the readers get to learn more about the characters but at the same time, it would be better if the author had provided more cases for Mma. Ramotswe and her assistant to solve.

In this story Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni has recovered from his debiltating depression and lends a wonderful richness to the storyline. His character as always is understated and charming and we wonder when the the engaged couple will actually get married. Mma Makutsi figures prominently in the plot and not only does the reader get to know her character more deeply but McCall Smith is able through her musings make several profound comments on the state of women in society today. A new dectective who is both arrogant and inept is introduced and it plays nicely in a humorous way against the womens thoughts about their place in soceity. Mma Ramotswe's primary case involves a successful man who wishes to atone for his past errors and in doing so is able to move on with his life. This is easy enjoyable reading, with beautiful prose and descriptions of life in Botswana and thoughts on life that apply to us all. A pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series and Mma Makutsi comes into her own in this installment. We have learned in previous books that this lady is very smart, very capable, and willing to work hard. While Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni is recovering from depression, Mma Makutsi takes over the running of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Suddenly, the two apprentices shape up big time, and Mma can even fix cars!What a remarkable lady is Mma Makutsi. Remarkable and lonely. Then she meets Mr. Bernard Selelipeng and...but, I'm getting ahead of myself. While Mma Makutsi is busy with two businesses, Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (manager of one, assistant detective with the other) she realizes she needs to open her own business if she truly wants a secure future. She hits upon the idea of a typing school for men. Classes could be held in the evening, which wouldn't interfere with her other two jobs. Mr. Bernard Selelipeng is one of her students, and therein lies that story. Two other men play a prominent role in this book: one who wants to atone for past sins; the other, a pompous windbag who thinks he is a better detective than any woman could possibly be. We also learn more about how the two orphans, Motholeli and Puso, taken in by Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni in Tears of the Giraffe, are adjusting to their new life.My only fear as I read these wonderful books is whether or not I'm reading/pronouncing the proper names of people and places correctly. But then, in our ever-increasing global society, we're all going to have to learn how to properly pronounce one another's names, somehow.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe, founder of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana is faced with several problems in this, the fourth and latest volume of the international best-selling series by Mr. Smith. First of all, Mma. Ramotswe has competition when another detective agency comes into town run by a man who feels women are second rate. His credentials are a bit suspect. I.e.. He claims to have had detective training in some large cities including New York. Second, her assistant, Mma. Makutsi, has started a typing school for men and has met a wonderful man who claims to love her. The question is who is he and is he trustworthy. These problems will all be solved prior to the ending of this delightful little novel.The term \\"cozy\\" was made for this type of book. There is no bloodletting or violence of any kind. It is purely character driven and what charming and polite characters they are! The books are slight enough that we get to know the characters, the problems they must solve, and the resolution before the book ends in a length perfect for one sitting. I fully understand the popularity of these books. They remind the reader of the Golden Age of mystery fiction."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I've read the first 3 books in this series and can't wait for more. I can't remember laughing so often reading through a book. They are delightful, life-affirming...all those corny words. The characters restore your faith in the human race, something I at least need these days living as I do in Jerusalem. These people are the kind of people I hope to be. They just get through life being kind and loving and caring for people less fortunate than themselves. Goes to prove that novels don't have to be able sick twisted people to get an audience."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This series is one the best I've read in years. The characters are compelling and Smith's descriptions of Botswana make it all come alive."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"THE NO.1 LADIES' DETECTIVE AGENCY was such an original and winning debut, that the subsequent novels in the series at best can only live up to it. There is no matching the surprises with which that first book was loaded, especially in terms of its characters, its setting, its wonderful voice and wit, its story structure. The good news is that Alexander McCall Smith does not betray what he has set up and he continues to use it to good effect in the 4th volume, THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN.For the uninitiated, this is a series set in Botswana, Africa, in which the estimable Mma Precious Ramotswe has set up a detective agency. This is not your standard mystery formula. The series relies more on the puzzles of human interactions and weaknesses in a traditional society that is rapidly adapting the first world frame of mind. This time around, Mma Ramotswe tangles with slick competition, while her assistant, the surprising Mma Makutsi, takes a more central role. The various strands of stories come together with Dickensian coincidences, but the author has already snatched your disbelief at the door so you don't care. THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL has its comic moments which are not at odds with its wise reflections. My only criticism of this volume is that the author does not devote the time to exploring his original characters, Mma Ramotswe or her fianc&eacute;, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, that he gives to Mma Makutsi. He has recovered the deeper sense of the country that went missing in MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS, but not to the depth of the first book in the series."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"A cute, sleepy private eye story told form the perspective of Precious Ramotswe, and narrated well by Lisette Lecat. In this episode, we find Precious investigating two cases: that of a philandering husband, and that of an older man who once committed a crime and wishes to make amends.What's good about this series is not the mystery. It's the characters and settings. I really got the flavor that I was in a small town in Botswana, and I enjoyed reading about Precious and her cohorts. If I have any criticism about this novel at all, there was a lack of suspense. The investigation was almost a non-event, and there was a bit too much dwelling in the past for my taste. Part of me wanted to tell the client: GET OVER IT ALREADY. The past is over and done with.Still, a cute story, sure to delight readers who want a slice of African life without too much gritty realism."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love this series and have decided to collect all of them. Some passages seem more like poetry than prose to me. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. I love the way the African culture permeates the story. I really enjoyed some audio books by this author as they were read by an African woman. It was a very pleasant listen -- prompted me to check out other audio books in the series. I love the way the love of country comes thru & the values of Mma Ramotswe are revealed in her speech. I may be a little bit African deep inside. I love the folks in this book."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Smith continues his touching depiction of the lives of his main characters. Of particular note is the significant development of Mma Ramotse's assistant Mma Makutse, full of whimsical and unexpected twists."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"As with all the books in this series, I have fallen in love with the main characters, even the prickly Grace Makutsi. I rooted for her to succeed as the founder of the typing school. I have listened to this book at least twice, find it just as amusing and enjoy the whole story over and over again. Alexander McCall Smith has such a wonderful sense of humor that he imparts to his stories. I consider them priceless."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Reading Alexander McCall Smith's stories of Precious Ramotswe and her associates in detection and in life is like having a visit with old friends: comfortable and reassuring. The graciously gentle and peaceful manner of resolving difficult situations in typical Botswanan style is in direct contrast with the lifestyle of modern America.There is a slow and easy nature to Precious Ramotswe, her fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, and her assistant Mma Makutsi. But that nature does not preclude initiative and innovation. For even up against the competition of a chauvinistic new detective agency, Mma Ramotswe maintains her calm and patient demeanor and continues to serve her clients with discretion and wisdom. For an African woman in her late thirties, she demonstrates inner peace and strength beyond her years. Her ambitious assistant's new business, a typing school for men held after hours, provides a counter plot which enriches the story line. In addition, the interwoven staffing of Matekoni's car repair shop with the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, further links Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi with the young mechanics who work for Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni. This is a true family of characters, including the children of the orphanage on the outskirts of town, from which come Mma Ramotswe's extended family of adopted children.Once again, there is logical conclusion to the predicaments of Precious Ramotswe and her associates. These gentle twists to the unraveling of the unjust bring a smile to the reader and an appreciation for the beloved culture of these Botswanan natives. They honor, revere and love their nation home. And the reader comes to know that reverence in an almost personal way, although vicariously.The love of a natural Africa with a citizenry that prides itself on respect for life, nature and one another, reminds one of the sweeping beauty in the opening shots and lines of the movie, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. Smith obviously has the same love of the Dark Continent and its people as did Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen, whose voice over in the movie says, &quot;I once had a farm in Africa.&quot; The past that Dinesen revered is the present of Precious Ramotswe. Do not miss the opportunity to quiet your soul with a visit to these good people."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I had been meaning to finish this book for a while. It was good. I liked it but didn't love it. This is the fourth in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series. What made the first few so enjoyable (the simplicity of the story/characters/mysteries) suddenly felt dull to me in this installment. So I tossed to book aside with only about 50 pages left to finish, not really caring whether or not Mma Ramotswe got married or whether or not any of the cases got resolved. I did go back to it over the weekend simply because I was in dire need for something to read and couldn't figure out which book I wanted to crack into. In the end: Happy Botswana Ending. Was I expecting anything different? The next one in the series, Full Cupboard of Life, sounds just as exiting as the rest: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni installs a new seatbelt into Mma Ramotswe's van, Mma Makutsi's new house will have running water, everyone drinks a lot of bush tea. Alexander McCall Smith is a wonderful storyteller but his books should be reserved for when you're coming out of a depression and want something simple and happy to read."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"How to express to everyone how happy this series makes me. The characters continue to delight, like visiting a wonderful group of friends that you can't get enough of. It is McCall Smith's valentine to Botswana, and Precious and her crew don't disappoint. For me,the cases almost become secondary to the personal lives that slowly reveal with each subsequent book, which is why I've said nothing about what this case involves. Just know that if you're as big of a fan as I am, you'll certainly want to read this."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This fourth book in the series brings not a heck of a lot of detective work, and none of the astute problem-solving that made book one a literary treasure.The main attractions this time are the opening of a rival detective agency powered by testosterone, the launching of a typing school for men powered by girl power, a long overdue apology powered by guilt, and at long last, a love interest for Mma. Makutsi, powered by hair grease and slime.The author takes us a few levels deeper into the characters this time, and the result is a rich African brew, ideal for slow lazy sipping under a shady tree with a gentle breeze ruffling the pages, and of course a hot cup of bush tea.Not ground breaking or earth shattering, but a very pleasant read anyway.Amanda Richards, November 23, 2004"},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the fourth book in The No. 1 Ladies Detective Novel series, featuring the only private detective in Gabarone, Botswana, a woman named Precious Ramotswe. Mma (Mrs. in the local language, Motswana) Ramotswe is a \\"traditionally-built\\" woman with an extra helping of common sense who decided to be a private detective, and bought a textbook which taught her how. She's now hired a secretary, Mma Makutsi, who's also traditionally-built, and somewhat disappointed that she doesn't get high-paying work because, though she scored a 97% score on the graduation test at the secretarial college, she's not glamorous-looking. Mma Ramotswe is engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, who is a reliable chap if a bit dull.In the first two installments of this series, there were several detective plots in each book. Each of the plots involved someone who had a difficulty and hired Mma Ramotswe to deal with it somehow. In the third book, there was less mystery, and more about the characters and their lives. This fourth book involves more mystery than the third, but there's also a good deal about the characters, as Mma Makutsi decides to teach typing in her spare time (hence the title) and dates one of her students, and Mma Ramotswe has to deal with rebelliousness from her foster children. The mysteries that are in the plot are the usual thing: typical human-interest problems that Mma Ramotswe can deal with by giving some sage advice.This whole series, so far, is wonderful. The books aren't lengthy or over-written, and the characters are refreshingly unsophisticated and sincere. The author has a wonderful ability to convey the citizens of a former British colony in terms of their nature and character. They're simple country people, proud and intelligent, with a simple dignity that's at times faintly ridiculous, and they're unconcerned with other people in other lands of whom they know little. It's a wonderful series, and this book fits right in after the first three."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I was first introduced to Alexander McCall Smith's work when my online book discussion group chose THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY as their monthly selection. From the first paragraph, I was hooked by McCall Smith's deceptively simple story and story telling. Precious Ramotswe is a great character: wise and amusing, the kind of person I would love to know. Reading about her and her friends and loved ones, her village, and her country, has enriched my life. Now I want to visit Botswana because McCall Smith, through Precious's eyes, has made the country come alive for me. I own all the books in this series and hope McCall Smith will continue to write about these rich and wonderful characters. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe was in her late thirties and blessed. She had two orphan children, a wonderful fiance, and a house on Zebra Drive. Mr. Matekoni, the fiance, said that cars speak of people. Mma Ramotswe was concerned that her assistant Mma Makutsi who had run Mr. Matekoni's car repair business when he was ill would not have enough work to keep busy now that Mr. Matekoni was restored to good health. Mma Ramotswe asked her assistant if she would like to have a husband. Mma Ramotswe was an optimist. She did not like to see her assistant go through life thinking she was just a local girl from the bush. After all, she was a crack typist.Mr. Maketoni found that the work of his two apprentices was less greasy than it had been before his illness. Mma Makutsi advised there was another detective agency in town. She learned about the principle of competition at secretarial college. It was located in the original premises of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency. The competition was Ex-CID. Also, New York was mentioned, but Mr. Buthelezi would not say how long he had been in New York. While typing up the bills for the garage Mma Makutsi thought up the idea of a typing school for men and found a source of old typewriters from her secretarial college.Mma Ramotswe was given a case to find people so that an engineer could make amends. She traveled to a government office to find out about a pension for the widow of a prison official. She knew that dull people could not distinguish between meritorious and unmeritorious requests. The motto of the secretarial college is be accurate. The apprentices restored the old typewriters to serviceability. Mma Makutsi received a declaration of love from one of the typing students.The head of the rival detective agency claimed to be the first professional detective. He claimed that the women were just dabbling. I will not disclose the ending to any of the various strands of the plot. These books just keep getting better and better. Bravo Alexander McCall Smith for your wonderful series."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"&quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot; is the fourth novel in Alexander McCall Smith's spectacularly successful series about a lady detective in Botswana. Precious Ramotswe is facing new challenges. A rival detective agency opens up nearby, and Mma. Ramotswe is worried about the competition. The two orphans whom she and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni adopted are having problems. In addition, Mma. Ramotswe is worried about her assistant, Mma. Makutsi, who cannot seem to find a husband.However, Mma. Ramotswe is an optimistic person by nature and she tries to set aside her worries. One way to forget her troubles is to take on new clients. Mma.

He wishes to apologize to them and make amends for his bad behavior.As in his earlier books, Smith's writing is sweet, funny, understated and touching. Mma. Ramotswe again displays her keen insight into human nature and her empathy for those who are in pain. &quot;The Kalahari Typing School for Men&quot; is written simply but it is never simplistic. This novel will delight Alexander McCall Smith's fans, and it will make readers of this series impatient for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency has problems--a new competitor run by a man has opened in town. And with Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni returning from his long bout with depression, there's the problem of how to pay Mma. Makutsi--who has served as assistant detective and also acting manager of Matekoni's garage. Still, although the competitor threatens to steal some of their business, Mma. Ramotswe has some detecting jobs to do--including finding the people a client wronged many years before and whether a husband is cheating on his wife. In the meantime, Mma. Makutsi comes up with a brilliant idea--a typing school for men--men who wouldn't be caught dead in a secretarial college like Mma. Makutsi attended, but who need keyboard skills for their jobs. It's an ideal solution to her money problems and also a convenient way for the single Makutsi to discover a man.Author Alexander McCall Smith loves Africa, its traditional ways of life, and the ways that its people (at least the people of Botswana) treat one another. His No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series, including THE KALAHARI TYPING SCHOOL FOR MEN are practically poetic in their praises of this traditional way of life. Mma. Ramotswe is the protagonist in these stories and the central pillar for tradition. Her detecting and the solutions to her clients problems flow from these African traditions (as interpreted by Smith) and prove heart-warming even in the midst of poverty and the AIDS crisis that has destroyed so much of Africa (AIDS is not mentioned by name in this novel but its impact is clear to see). Whether Smith's view of Africa has anything to do with the real continent is something I won't even attempt to decide, but it is certainly his view and his love for this Africa is obvious and compelling.Smith's beautiful writing makes KALAHARI an enjoyable read that can be savored or swallowed in a gulp. The characters of Mma. Makutsi and Mma. Ramotswe are well drawn and interesting. KALAHARI is anything but a thriller, but it makes a wonderful diversion from the everyday."},{"Title":"The Kalahari Typing School for Men: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in Gaborone, is a much-respected, traditional woman (of \\"traditional size\\") who honors the customs of Botswana and tries to solve problems for her clients the \\"traditional\\" way--through her broad network of friends and family with whom she can sit down, drink bush tea, and \\"talk about very small things,\\" as she searches for clues. She is a warm and happy woman of good sense, and her detective agency is a huge success because of her discretion and care for her clients' feelings.In this novel, full of gentle humor and wisdom, Mma Ramotswe deals with two clients, one of whom committed a minor crime many years ago and for which he now wants to make amends, and one of whom is worried about a philandering husband. Both cases require the utmost in tact and sensitivity. Mma Ramotswe is also concerned with some personal matters. A rival detective agency, run by an aggressive man, opens an office in Gaborone to great fanfare, and he publicly demeans the #1 Ladies Detective Agency in a news feature. Mma Ramotswe's fianc&eacute;, Mr. J. L. B. Matakone still has not set a wedding date, though he clearly loves her, and one of the young orphans she and Mr. J. L. B. Matakone are mentoring, begins to have serious behavior problems. In addition, Mma Makutsi, Mma Ramotswe's assistant, who is barely making ends meet with her current jobs, decides to open a typing school for men after work. Mma Makutsi soon falls in love with one of her students, someone Mma Ramotswe finds inappropriate.Domestic issues and human relationships, rather than exciting plot lines, keep the focus on the characters--beautifully drawn, sometimes flawed, and always forgiven their faults. In a pace as relaxed as life in Botswana, author Alexander McCall Smith recreates the colorful everyday lives of these ordinary people, who treasure friendships, treat each other with respect, and possess inherent good sense. In simple, direct prose filled with homely details, the author celebrates a traditional lifestyle and its values during a time in which change may become inevitable. A warm, relaxing read, filled with the joy of life.

At that time, Koichi Tohei was the Chief Instructor of the Aikikai. Later on because of politics or personal growth, depending on the source, Tohei formed his own organization, and for a while stopped using the term Aikido in favor of the term \\"Ki\\" (same as Chinese \\"Chi\\").Although there are some exercises described, this is more of a philosophical book which delves deeply into the spirit and theory behind the art and practice of Aikido. This is the first developed thesis on Tohei's Ki concepts, which are generally free from the superstitions and magical thinking that permeates some other schools of thought. \\"KI\\" according to Tohei has more to to with the unity of the mind with the body.Later revised editions of this volume were published as \\"Ki in Daily Life\\".

Anyone can benefit from this book."},{"Title":"AIKIDO - In Daily Life","review":"You do not need to havean interest in Akido to benefit from reading what he has to say. Heteaches you how to find inner peace, strength and an outlook on life we all should have.The first half of the book deals with Akido and is quite interesting. The last half, for me, was the best part. It is laid out in short sections and each one will teach you a great deal about yourself and the people around you.When you have finished the book you will be surprised how much better you feel. You will be able to handle stress, and daily life, in ways you thought you could not.If you have been looking for a way to reduce stress in your life and at the same time look at things in a more positive way then this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"AIKIDO - In Daily Life","review":"It has been in my library for a while before I had a second look at it. I had begun and stopped reading the first part years ago, but now I have practiced some Tai Chi Chuan also and this approach starts to make sense to me.

So if your sick of watching videos on YouTube go directly to the source. Not a great read for beginners but for someone who studies the golf swing this is a must have."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"This book is about learning and not teaching. BEFORE the first chapter, one is taught that the hands almost stop at the bottom of the perfect golf swing. It is also explained that many reject this thought \\"out of hand.\\" To learn this you must practice what is then taught in the book. \\"The only way to learn\\", Jorgensen told me. That is \\"why Physics is experimentation\\"; the result being the search for perfection...only a search as golf readers feel perfection is impossible. Trying to practice and then improve this move, much less understanding it ... is the secret.Without these experiments, nothing is achieved anywhere. How many times have you failed to hit a perfect drive. Do you know what the club must do to have that result?The desired intent of this book is to explain using four disciplines the desired result: By word, by drawings, by pictures, by math formulas, they explain the theorems developed by Isaac Newton and others...but his explanations are perhaps better than those of these great men.EVEN YOU will understand ONE of these explanations, BUT only if you use your own hands, your own body, and your own time to experiment exactly as Jorgensen suggests.The same is true of every self help book ever written. Only Frank Bettger guarantees FAILURE from a \\"cover to cover\\" read of his widely sold book: \\"How I raised myself from failure to success in selling\\". This has become the mother of all sales books...because enough readers have experimented with Bettger's concepts. Why, because Bettger gives you the exact words to use, which I have also found to be effective as have the many millions who to this day buy his book too. Bettger and Jorgensen understood fundamentals, such that anyone at any time can always improve. Do you want anything else?One critic of Jorgensen's book stated that he didn't do enough on the short game. Why, I don't know but the Author, Ted, did tell us all why we fail at short shots. It's the knees and the centrifugal force applied to the head and shoulders by the club during the swing. If the knees are bent too much you'll top the ball and hit it thin. With straighter legs you hit it fat. Only those who have experimented with different degrees of flex understand. This flex is changes the force with the speed of the club and the weight of the club's head. Who ever thought the beginning flex of the knees to be that important on chips or pitches. So experiment with the FLEX and you'll win money. BUT DON\\"T EXPECT ANYONE TO BELIEVE YOU AS YOU EXPLAIN HOW TO DO IT...They are YOUR knees. They must do 'em, the 'speriments, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"This book was written before video and computational power was easily available.

The price of two books was $25, but intenational shipping charge was $22 for two packages.If you sent books in a package, I could save my money."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"I actually intended to rate this book a minus 5. What a sloppy work!!!The book was motivated by the author's intention to improve his golf game (imagine how bad he could be to have such strong motivation), although he didn't mention the outcome (sounds like it worked at least on two folks). Why? I can assure you that it doesn't work and he is still searching for the answers, just like all those reviewers and the majority of the readers are.I'm just wondering how much time the author really spent on swinging the club (probably not much) or watching others (maybe some, but whom?) do? If not, how did he come up with the idea of what the golf swing is and even study it? I know, from reading a lot of literatures just like every scientist does. Then a model he believed the closest to the real swing was proposed, so that a lot of equations and computer works can be done to support the ideas (from reading the literatures) he believed, although not all of them were explained, which are either current unknown or more work needs to be done in the future. A typical example of how science is being conducted? Will the resultant information help? God knows! My question is, if the initial ideas (from others) are unquestionable, then why studied them again? What's the hypothesis? I mention these because I am a scientist and know the tricks, too. Scientists are humans just like everybody. Don't believe whatever they say (at least not until they become single-digit handicaps)!The book is merely another version of the existing ideas about golf swing decorated with some terms in physics, mathematical equations and computer generated data, using selected opinions to support selected results and conclusions. Sorry, good try!Golf swing becomes such a difficult stuff simply because nearly all of the concepts we are getting are far from the reality. People who master it can maybe describe it or the feel about it but hardly explain it. \\"Why bother? I can do it well?\\" Others see what's going on here and there but has no idea how they happen? Most of the time, we only see the results but not the causes, and work so hard to make the results happed.Instructions on golf swing have existed ever since the game was invented. If they work (does not have to be all of them), why people still have trouble getting it? Most of the teaching pros should have been out of jobs. But people are still reading the same stories over and over again and keep struggling. The real experts (with some talents) gain their swings, most of the time (or with a bit help from other experts), by trial-and-error and experimenting through various methods and hard practice. Until the real principle being revealed, these are still the best ways to build a golf swing. This is also how I figure out my way, which is totally different from what the \\"mainstream\\" says, to swing the club. Being 5'6\\" and weight 110 lb., I hit my driver consistently dead straight for ~240 yards.Will you buy the book? It's totally up to you!! At least it will make you think harder. I would rather spend my effort on the driving range to experiment it more."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"I enthusiastically recommend this book to golfers with an interest in science/math/engineering, or scientists/mathematicians/engineers with an interest in golf. You should get Search for the Perfect Swing first. But once you have that out of the way, this book is an excellent addition to a golf library.The biggest shortcomings of The Physics of Golf are (1) a lack of quality illustrations/pictures/graphics and (2) a rather terse treatment of the material. I feel that the author probably has enough research to go on for 4-500 pages but called it quits at a much more concise size. I'm all for concise, but not when it leaves me feeling some useful material was left out."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"The book's major contribution is that it distinguishes clearly between style and fundamentals. It focuses the reader's attention on the downswing and demonstrates the simple moves required to ensure club head acceleration through to impact. By showing how these moves differ when the shaft is above and below the horizontal and how certain other moves destroy club head acceleration in these positions the reader will probably for the first time come away with the true fundamental moves in a golf swing. The most insightful book on golf I've ever read. If you can't handle equations read the chapters for the less mathematically gifted - all the gems are still there."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"Only get this book if you love physics and want to analyze in detail mathematical models of golf swings and ball flight. This book is written by a physicist, and it shows. The author does an admirable job of analyzing the golf swing, but spends so much time describing how he built his models that the &quot;so what&quot; gets lost in the details. If you're looking to improve your golf game, other books will get you there with much less pain. For example Dave Pelz is also a physicist, and his book, &quot;Putt Like the Pros&quot; has very readable analyses and offers valuable and practical advice."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"Great book! I have read everything out there and have tried to incorporate the writings of many teachers. Dr. Jorgensen, although a well-regarded physicist, writes like he prefers to be on the golf course.

I enjoyed Dr. Jorgenson's take on the game of golf and some of his personal experiences. He has analysed the various levers and moves and reduced everything to mathematical formulas so that presumably quantities could be inserted in the equations to see what effect differences for weight, speed, force, etc. would have on the outcome. As for the outcome everyone is looking for, he never answers the question that I'm sure everybody has, namely, \\"what do I need to change to get more distance\\"."},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"I am now 65. I received the &quot;Physics of Golf&quot; five years ago. I was so taken aback, I put it down for three years. Then I read it one page at a time, experimented with each paragraph, and have improved steadily ever since. Once, in my coordinated youth, I played to an eight. Then in my middle fifties I could not break one hundred if I counted all my shots and penalties. Golf became expensive...and I didn't even show up at the club...Now after two years with Theodore P Jorgensen my game again is fun. I have shot a 37 for nine holes on a tought golf course from the tiger tees and yesterday parred nine holes in a row.I have met &quot;Doctor J&quot; and if you do, as he suggests, each experiment and try each part of all the things covered, you will find yourself in golf heaven. It's like playing a &quot;Country and Western&quot; song backwayds and getting all you have lost back...but in addition you will understand why you lost it and how you can, now improve even more. As I grew older, the things I knew about golf that just are NOT true ended up distroying my weekends. Now, I play less, score better, (without even warming up), and go home with a positive attitude. That's a good day.The Physics of Golf is one of the best books on sports ever written and Ted Jorgensen is Nebraska's best kept secret. Imagine reading a book on your favorite hobby and improving your skills. If you can read, you, too, will find you can hit the ball as well as Anika and certainly better than Tiger when he doesn't finish first...but you have to buy and read the book stopping to experiement often as you cover each fact. DON'T JUST READ IT. You will almost certainly fail...but you will understand physics and it's disciplines better; thus all won't be lost. This exact science &quot;GOLF&quot; needs such attention.Give this book to the youth of your family, boys and girls alike, and watch them appreciate THE WORLD OF PHYSICS which explains so much about what we see, hear, experience and do. There is no better way to learn golf fundamentals than at the kitchen table...before you practice.All the best to the wonderful customers, employees, and owners of Amazon who made this purchase possible. With the money I'm making on the golf cours I can now afford to support Amazon even even more. Dan Burke who was 18 and is now headed for single digits and is 65 years old going on 66.

On p. 6 is the stroboscopic photo from which all the data are collected. It would be helpful if the light traces were labeled and explained more clearly. There appears to be tape at both the bottom of the handle and the end of the club. This little 12\\" is really critical and deserves better analysis. After all, the handle of the club is your only point of control over the clubhead. Then there are all those extraneous light traces for the elbows and who knows what else. Bottom line, the book is out of date relative to modern video and computer equipment. FYI, many years ago, my grad school mentor, the great University of Houston golf coach and mathematics professor, Dave Williams, published a similar analysis.There are some obvious errors, at least to a kinesiologist. The major part of the analysis concerns the dynamics of the angle formed between the left forearm and the shaft. Figure 2.3, on page 9 and the supporting data tables in the appendix, show an angle that cannot exist in a normal human. The Scaphoid bone in the wrist limits the angle between the club and the forearm to no more than 90 degrees. This analysis if flawed. The reporting of this too large angle is a result of optical delusion existing between a 2D image and a 3D golf swing. This makes you wonder about the affect on the math.The second major problem is the use of a two lever model to describe a two sided human swing motion. While it is true the right side does not act as a large power source (more of a stabilizer), none the less gravity and a small amount of muscle does contribute to he movement of the club. The muscles that add force are not in the arms. They are in the chest. I see not mention of the force coupling between the top hand and the bottom hand. As the end of the handle slows it's forward motion just prior to impact, the bottom hand continues to move forward. While, timing the swing so this \\"whipping\\" action increases clubhead speed, is difficult, it is not impossible. What may be needed is a better teaching model based on something closer to a seven lever model which more accurately describes what the human body is doing to the club.As a compliment to the book, Dr. Jorgensen does correctly describe the kinetic link/summation of segmental velocities which"},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"The Physics of Golf I my mind was a very good book, challenging at times, but still a good book. I learned a lot about golf that I didn't know before hand, like how much aerodynamics plays in the final product of the shot. Like if the number of dimples isn't just right, it could change the shot dramatically. Also, being an amateur golfer myself, I know what Jorgensen is talking about when he makes the reference to the double pendulum, because I have been coached to do that and that one could get more power out of the double pendulum method. The pendulum method is simple as Jorgensen states, that what must come up, must come down on the exact path that the golfer came down on, to, as Jorgensen puts it, more torque out of the swing.One of the biggest flaws I think in this book is that the lack of quality to the illustrations. Most of the illustrations and graphs that the book has doesn't fully explain the detail that the author describes. Another flaw I found within this book was that the author had all this material about the golf swing but he didn't share most of it with his readers. He could have gone about 3-400 pages with all that material but I don't see why he didn't.But with the negativity that goes with this book comes greater parts about the book that make it insightful and intelligent. Instead of the old fashioned way of saying \\"Well, this, this, this, and this is wrong with your swing\\" Jorgensen finds the hidden details written inside of a professionals swing. He tells you what makes a professional swing much greater than your own and what they do that makes them so great. Jorgensen also says in The Physics of Golf that the average tour pro can deliver up to 2 horsepower with just a swing of a club. I now realized this out of the golf course and now shooting much lower that before.So if your looking for an insightful read that is both intelligent and insightful, get this book. I found it a little tough without a back round in physics, but rest assured I found this book very goodChristian"},{"Title":"The Physics of Golf","review":"This book could be at the heart of an episode (maybe a two part) trying to reduce golf down tosimply the physics behind it.

It's a fun little fantasy and a good way to spark the imagination of young animal lovers, boys and girls alike.

The city I have named Sanctum will be a place of absolute isolation for, I fear, many centuries. . .'\\"In the year 2728, what is left of humankind has lived for over 700 years below ground in the city called Sanctum. Buried beneath the Earth's surface in Australia, the underground city was devised to allow at least some to survive as the world collapsed due to overpopulation, food scarcity, pollution and nuclear war. However, the city, which is ruled by the Fulberth, has become a prison instead of a sanctuary. The Fulberth are desperate to remain comfortably in power despite knowing the truth about the surface as well as the fact that after 700 years critical systems are failing in Sanctum.Within the city, one of the ones that most desperately wants to get out is a Mazeplayer by the name of Jarret St. John. He wants more than anything else in life to go to Top World, as it is known to Sanctum's inhabitants. As leader of the best team in Mazeplay, he is somewhat untouchable. But he soon pushes the ruling class once too many times and is marked for death. But, the rulers make a fundamental mistake and St. John and his team elude the trap that has been set for them. Not only do they escape but they discover the existence of humans living safely on the surface.The surface people whose ancestors survived the cataclysms and St. John and his team soon unite to bring humankind back to the surface once and for all. Like many adventure novels of this type, this book relies solely on the action in the work to move the story forward. Character development is very limited with the focus being solely on adventure.

Arguments about the relationship between mentalism and psionics has been raging on the net and in private venues for years now. Essence, being the traditional magical discipline and channeling, the traditional power of clerics and other followers of divine beings, are both firmly entrenched in the minds of players and GMs alike. They are well burned into our imaginations and into our literature, and therefore, easy to grasp, by player and gamemaster alike.My first reaction upon picking up this book was, \\"Wow, how many pages is this thing?\\" The answer, 158 pages, makes this the largest companion yet. Its size is no surprise. Upon leafing through it I began to realize just how ambitious this book really was.It starts with your typical \\"What is Mentalism?\\" section, followed by a treatment of the standard mentalist archetypes. All of this is pretty old hat, though necessary to help unmuddy the mentalism waters. It then launches into a variety of subjects, many of which only loosely connected with mentalism itself.It seems the authors used this book as a vehicle by which to cram in every rule system they could, dealing with the mind or mental subjects. Acceptable? To me it is, though some tastes may differ. A list of the primary subjects is as follows:New professions: Very relevant. Every companion seems to need a new slew of professions, and this one adds (or reintroduces) the Seer, Astrologer, Enchanter and Armsmaster. Of all of these, the Armsmaster is by far my favorite, though the other professions will probably appeal to players with a less chivalrous bent. Regardless of your tastes, these professions fill important niches in the spell casting professions, niches that were previously unfilled.This is followed by training packages, another must for a Rolemaster companion. Of all the work, I found this section the most disappointing (though it reintroduced the houri, an amusing character type). I don't know what I wanted from trainin packages, but this book failed to deliver it. I think it's just that none of the training packages struck my fancy.Next is the treatment of magical ritual, a subject that is beginning to bore me. It's necessary, however, and it was vehicle for the author's attempt to introduce rules for mental combat. A private conversation with one of the authors revealed that, the published rules are scaled down from those the author submitted, and they are skeletal at best.The next section was included to satisfy the Internet community. For years now, debates have raged about the nature of illusion in Rolemaster, and many people aren't satisfied with the official stance. This section therefore treats both sides of the argument, allowing gamemasters to use whichever one appeals to them most. It is good that this treatment was placed into print, and I suppose that this book is as good as any.The next section deals with insanity. Though this might seem out of place at first, mentalist lists are the only real place where insanity is inflicted. This is a necessary addition to Rolemaster. It supports the gritty realism of the game, and I'm glad it was there.This is followed by the section on Languages and Lore. Now, out of all the sections in this book, this has the least to do with mentalism. It's a good subject, though. I've never been satisfied with the way that any game handled languages, not even Rolemaster. This new treatment of languages, though not the most accurate, is a far cry from anything I've seen. The authors strived for a balance between realism and playability, and I think they found a happy medium.Since mentalism deals with divination (at least with the professions in this work), the next three sections are dedicated to divination of various sorts. Therefore the book treats diving the past, present and future, helping the GM deal with difficult subject like astrology and the future. These subjects can be difficult for a GM to handle, and though this doesn't set any rules in stone, it tries to give the GM enough information to make an informed decision.Next, you'll find specific treatments of astrology and tarot. I really felt these sections did nothing to help me with my campaigns, though the information might be a good starting point for creating your own divination systems. It was just too Earth specific to help me much.For you Robert Jordan fans, I'll bet you'll feel a certain kinship with the authors of this book. Before the final section, consisting of spell lists, you'll find a treatment of dreams and dream travel. I liked the ideas here, but I wanted a lot more. It made me wonder whether the space constraints were cracking the whip on the authors during this section. A good broad treatment of the dream world would have been very nice, even one that we throw out to create our own. The single page on dream worlds simply wasn't enough for me.My conclusion? This was a great book. It's become a permanent facet of my campaigns. Out of all the things that Rolemaster has to call its own, mentalism is the one that makes Rolemaster the most unique. It's a good thing for the game that this book was written. It takes that aspect of Rolemaster which is most unique and explains it, expands it and helps us make ours. It patches several holes that were left open in the Rolemaster system and does it with style and quality.If I had to recommend a game, it would always be Rolemaster, and although there have been products in the past that I've felt have fallen short of the quality we've come to expect from ICE, this is not one of them.

At first I really thought it was a cheesy little thing. There are several different lay-outs in this book as well as upright and reversed descriptions for the meanings of the cards. Each card has a different crop circle pattern. The author had a \\"multidimensional encounter\\" in 1988. She was mandated to produce a special healing oracle system. Evidently, the Sirians are behind this. The cards are supposed to \\"quickly access a client's unconscious and higher-Self in order to accelerate Self-awareness, transformation, and healing\\" according to Ms. Quinly. Well, I don't mind telling you, when I read that statement as well as a few of the stated meanings for the cards, I was just rolling my eyes. My friend and I who both read Tarot professionally were just laughing our heads off and mockingly singing the Led Zeppelin tune as we laid out the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" spread that's in the book. But guess what...these cards are astonishing...they TALK! The spreads that we have done using these cards are amazingly insightful and articulate. People grasp the meanings for their lives with clarity and ease. Even though I was prepared to sell these puppies at a rummage sale at first, I now really enjoy and respect this deck. The book's language is so New Agey that it still just makes me laugh but weirdly enough it's right on. I am enchanted by the whole crop circle phenomenon. I think these mysterious and mystical symbols DO speak to our unconscious. These cards take those enigmatic symbols and place them conveniently at our disposal. I recommend this set of cards and book. Keep an open mind and I think you will be pleasantly surprised as I was when you see how well they work."},{"Title":"Crop Circle Cards, The Living Oracle","review":"&quot;I picked up a pack of divination cards called \\"Crop Circle Cards.\\" My inner voice said, \\"Buy them.\\" I did and I studied them.

It also seemed uncanny that whenever I asked a question, the card I drew seemed to be what I needed to read and meditate upon.

The interpretation of the cards is written in the book, but it is altered by whether the card is right side up, upside down or on it's side.

Overall though this book is very useful when in reference to historical and political events."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Disappointing and worrisome. Clearly this author has been writing under the publishing gun. I loved the first two books. (But the second, &quot;Tears of the Giraffe,&quot; had a glaring editorial error involving the caption of a newspaper photograph--at first the text makes it clear that the caption is &quot;illegible,&quot; bug-eaten; so I figured that would provide plot momentum for our erstwhile detective to find out the identities of those in the photo; apparently that potential plotline was dropped in a later manuscript draft, and soon, much to our surprise, the next time the photo appears, the caption is miraculously intact in all its details.)In this 3rd volume in the series, even the casual reader will notice the simplest of editorial errors: For example, in one storyline, lunch is first said to occur at 12, then 1 pm, then 2 pm; breakneck (and tremendously incomplete and unsatisfying) wrap-up of a few -- but not all -- major plotlines; extremely unrealistic introduction of depression theme (person, once ideal, falls victim to deepest depression seemingly within a week or two -- apparently the author was convinced midstream to introduce the topic of clinical depression)... Well, I could go on. I'm sorry to see the evidence of author strain in this initially darling and moving series."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I'm really not sure how I feel about Alexander McCall Smith and Precious Ramotswe. He's really an engaging writer-- there's something very gentle and folksy about his tone. I have the feeling that he writes for the many people. Doesn't talk down. Doesn't mock.But then I get uneasy. Which many people? A Scottish fiction writer is so far removed from the setting of his series. I find myself anxious how this book is experienced in Botswana. A Google search revealed a terrible story how in filming a pilot based on the books, black extras were paid far less than standard by the (white) South African production crew. I read references to accusations of being patronizing, removing dignity from his subjects. I guess I can see that. But then I wonder-- would the same stories written by a black Botswanan carry the same freight. What about if the stories had been transplanted to explore the foibles of a small Scottish town. Would the difference in reception make a difference in how I should look at this? Can you remove a work from the context of the writer?In the end the question becomes relevant because of the lack of African women voices writing about themselves. I'm not sure I find a problem with Smith as such. His books are pure entertainment. Hopeful. And (dare I say it?) well intentioned. The trouble is that for the vast majority of people, this may be the only look they get at Africa, the voice of African women. That lack is what gives Smith more weight than he deserves, either negatively or positively. As one view in a thriving ecosystem of other viewpoints, this uneasiness would cease to be relevant, I think.I realize I haven't said much about what I think about the book. Uneasy about my own enjoyment pretty much covers it.Let the accusations of being too PC commence. :)"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This detective series seems to keep getting better.

Mma Makutsi is the real hero of this volume. When Mr. JLB Matekoni succumbs to serious depression, she takes over management of Speedy Motors in addition to her duties for the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.The orphans are struggling a bit to adjust to their new lives with Mma Ramotswe. Finances are extremely tight, and Mma Makutsi saves the day by taking on a wealthy client who needs assistance investigating the backgrounds of 4 finalists for the Miss Beauty and Integrity pageant (a huge event). Both this case and Mma Ramotswe's investigation of a Botswana family revolve around the theme of \\"the old Botswana morality\\".This book, like others in the series, makes the reader want to hop on a plane to dry, economically challenged Botswana. Love of the land, love of the cattle, and love of family... the life lived by Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, and Mr. JLB Matekoni is a good one.

MFBG is an amazing book in a delightful series. Having read the first three books, I see why the first one burst onto the NY Times bestseller list. They are engrossing and a pleasure to read.The story of Precious Ramotswe is the frame for other stories. Her story and character are charming and reflect everything fundamentally good in human nature. Mma Ramotswe reminds me a bit of Diane Mott Davidson's Goldie in that she is an independent self-employed professional who we meet after one dreadful marriage and who develops a positive, long term relationship in the course of the books. You learn her past, watch her evolving life story, and share in her thoughts.Unlike many mystery books, these are not hard-boiled and classically \\"tough.\\" Each book has several situations the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency solves, consults on, or investigates and advises. Mma Ramatswe's greatest gifts are her ability to listen and her courage to speak up and occasionally bluff in strained circumstances. Her instincts are credible, she's lucky, and so far she hasn't missed a trick.Like a good Western, where a classic human interest story is transported to the setting of the Old West, these stores are touching and timeless. And like a good science fiction story which explores a different reality, these stories transport us to Botswana and paint a vivid picture of a foreign land, its people and culture, displaying humanity identical to our own. These stories could have been set on Antares IV, in Chicago, Laredo, or London. The African setting is intriguing and molds the stories to its hot dry world.My preference is to read a series in the order in which it was written so as to walk with the author as the characters evolve. These are characters I love. Their pride and courtesy are refreshing. The sensory delights of Africa unfold along with genuinely puzzling mysteries. These are beautiful books. Enjoy.

The business has been a qualified success, that is Mma Ramotswe, aided by her secretary/assistant detective Mma Makutsi have brought numerous cases to satisfactory conclusions. In addition on a more personal note Mma Ramotswe has recently accepted the marriage proposal of Mr J. L. B. Matekoni. On those accounts Mma Ramotswe's life is quite good, even including the unexpected arrival of two orphans that her fiance had decided to foster without consulting her first. On other accounts life has presented a few problems, the first being that although the Agency had been quite successful in solving cases it had not been very profitable, leaving Mma Ramotswe wondering how to keep the business open. On a more personal level she was beginning to wonder of her fiance would ever set a date for their wedding.This series of charming, cozy mysteries is set in Botswana and offers the reader a glimpse into life in the exotic locale. The emphasis in this series is very heavy on the 'cozy' and very light on the 'mystery'. Those looking for violence, and numerous dead bodies should look elsewhere. The mysteries here are much more of the domestic variety, a wandering husband, some family conflicts are much more the normal fare here. No matter though what the problems are Mma Ramotswe manages to sort through in her quiet manner to find the best solution.The overall story arc to this series is quite strong so, even though each volume begins with a brief description of the earlier events, for maximum enjoyment begin at the beginning and read the novels in order."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"If you've read the previous books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, then you know what you have coming: Mma Ramotswe, a kindly version of Dr. Phil solving mysteries in Botswana, goes about her business. She helps a government man ascertain whether his brother's wife is trying to poison his brother; her assistant, Mma Kutsi, helps a beauty pageant figure out which candidates would be most worthy representatives of Botswana; Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni battles clinical depression; and so on.This entry in the series is, for the most part, as pleasant as the others, although I found myself growing weary at times. Smith spends a less time on mystery here and more on Mma Ramotswe's personal life. Smith conveys the national pride of Botswana well. At least one of the subplots (that of the beauty pageant) was resolved rather weakly, and another subplot (involving a little boy found out in the wilderness) seemed completely peripheral.Because I've done some work in East Africa (far from Botswana), friends often ask me how accurate Smith's portrayal is. My principal answer is that Africa (with it's many different countries) is very heterogeneous, so I don't know. That piqued my interest, though, as to how the novels have been received in Botswana: after some poking I was only able to find two relevant sources, both positive*: (1) a University of Botswana history professor recommends the novels as a \\"deeply sympathetic (and very funny) view of present-day Botswana\\"; and (2) the head of Botswana's tourism association. So at least you may rest assured that the books aren't seen as a complete misrepresentation.I listened to the unabridged audio recording narrated by Lisette Lecat (published by Recorded Books). As always, Lecat does an excellent job. If you enjoy her narration, I strongly recommend her performance of Alexandra Fuller's excellent memoir of growing up in Zimbabwe, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight (also published by Recorded Books).* I found both of these sources cited in Elfi Bettinger's essay, \\"Riddles in the Sand of the Kalahari,\\" in the book Postcolonial Postmortems (ed.

Ramotswe had been hired to investigate a case of food poisoning and possibly murder for an important government official while Mma. Makutsi undertook her first detective case without Mma. Ramotswe's guidance.In \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls,\\" the author seems to be more focused on the development of his characters as we learned more about Ms. Makutsi as well as Mr. Matekoni. The focus on the secondary characters helps to make this third installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency a much stronger book. In addition, I like that the author came up with very different cases in each of his books which makes the book such a delight to read.

The most pressing is brought to them by a government man who believes his brother is being poisoned. The case requires that Mma Ramotswe absent herself from the agency for a few days so she can infiltrate the family's home and uncover the truth. Thus left without her superior's guidance, Mma Makutsi manages to shine--despite her own rather odd ideas about the principles of deduction. She handles the case referred to in the book's title, interviewing and assessing the moral fiber of a short list of beauty pageant entrants. Meanwhile she is simultaneously acting as the assistant manager of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors while its proprietor, Mma Ramotswe's fiance J.L.B. Maketoni, recovers from depression.A third case is also brought to Mma Ramotswe's attention, but it is left unresolved at the book's end. This seems an odd choice on the author's part, but not necessarily a bad one. Even Mma Ramotswe, for all her acumen, cannot solve all the world's problems.As usual, McCall Smith's novel is a sweet read.

How much can one lady detective handle?Helping save the day is Mma Ramotswe's former personal secretary, now promoted to Assistant Detective, Mma Makutsi. Mma Makutsi, who is 'too dark,' has glasses that are 'too big', and whose hair just is never 'quite right' really comes into her own in this novel - she becomes 'Assistant Manager' of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, whipping it into shape with the force of her personality so that its in a much better condition than even when Mr. JLB Matekoni ran it.She also continues her duties as Assistant Detective, ably proving herself as she handily solves a case of determining which finalist in 'the Beauty and Integrity contest' actually has integrity- and thereby receives big bucks which keep the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency afloat.Like its predecessors, this book is not your typical \\"who dun it\\" detective story. As Mma Ramotswe flatly tells the Government Man, \\"We help people with the problems in their lives. We are not here to solve crimes.\\"Along with helping people with the problems in their lives, Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi continue in this book to have hilarious but often wise insights about gender, beauty, marriage, weight, criminology, treatment of elders and servants, cows, and a number of other topics, all highlighted by the ever-wise old Botswana Morality."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Precious Ramotswe is back in the third installment of this wonderful series about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency near Gaborone, Botswana.

She has promoted her secretary to assistant detective and given her a raise, but there is not enough money coming into the detective agency to keep it in the black.Mr. J.L.B.

He is a Government Man, very rich and very powerful. Convinced that his brother's wife is poisoning him, the Government Man hires Mma Ramotswe to investigate, and she turns up astonishing results. While shis is off on this important case, her assistant detective, who has suddenly found herself as Acting Manager of the garage, too, is required to determine the character of certrain beauty queens, to see if any of them is morally fit to win the pageant and go on to compete for Miss Botswana, and maybe Miss Universe.But most mysterious of all is the small child who smells of lions and is found wild in the bush, unable to communicate with anyone.

While this series is quite delightful, I found this book less entertaining and darker than the first two.The engagement plans of Precious Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni hit a snag when the groom-to-be comes down with a mysterious malady. Mma Ramotswe not only has to run her detective agency, but also must oversee Mr. J.L B. Matekoni's garage, Tlokweng Rd.

A government official suspects his brother is being poisoned by the brother's wife. Mma Ramotswe must infiltrate the household as a guest to investigate the accusations. Mma Makutsi digs into the backgrounds of four young ladies competing for the title of Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana. Neither of these cases is as riveting as in the first two books.

Her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, the heretofore devoted and successful owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and foster father to two Bushman orphans, proves to be suffering from depression and must be subtly tricked into seeking medical help. Meanwhile, her assistant, Mma Makutsi, discovers unsuspected talents when they move the Agency offices to share the garage premises and she finds herself riding herd on Mr. Matekoni's notoriously lazy and inept apprentices. Mystery is provided by the possible ongoing poisoning of the brother of an important Government official, who suspects his sister-in-law, and the discovery in the bush of a naked boy who &quot;smells of lions&quot; (anyone who has read Kipling's Mowgli stories will immediately guess at his past, though nothing canonical is established about it). The title arises from Mma Makutsi's efforts to learn which (if any) of four finalists in the Miss Glamorous Botswana contest are morally suited to the title. Smith, as always, conveys much of the spirit, flavor, and customs of the African nation he knows so well, and leaves us wanting to know how the cases of Mr. Maketoni's depression and the mysterious bush boy will turn out.

What would happen to the reputation of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors?Action is required all round and the ladies of The No.1 Detective Agency don't fail us.This is not the book to read if you like fast-paced thrillers, this is more Miss Marple but instead of Darjeeling she is sipping her cup of red bush tea on the veranda of Zebra Drive thinking about how the daddy, that fine judge of cattle would have solved these manifold problems.I love each and everyone of these books and I commend them to you all for some much needed calm and peace in a bustling world. They are also written in the most beautiful english and are a joy to read."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third in the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, a wonderful group of novels that feature a woman from Botswana, of all places, who's a private detective in the country's capital. In this third installment, she's confronted with several problems, both personal and from her business, and solves them all, as best she can. She has an assistant, and that lady also does her part, solving problems too, sometimes even when they seem to be something she can't do anything about.Smith has a wonderful way with words and phrases, and seems to recreate the country and the prose that the people speak there wonderfully. The several main characters are interesting, and of course it's important to note that these really aren't mysteries, in the sense of Agatha Christie or Raymond Chandler. Instead, they're mainly morality plays, with characters and action that are very tame. So far, there hasn't been a murder in the books, just various suspicious goings-on, and things that need to be found out. Often, the wrong-doer is caught, but judged not worthy of punishment for some reason, and released with the injunction to be more honest or good in the future. It's very strange, to say the least, and considering these books mysteries is more than a bit misleading.I enjoyed all three of the books that I've read, but this one is the weakest of the three. For some reason the pace is slower, and the plots are somewhat less interesting. Or perhaps it's just that I've already read something like this twice, and it's not so fresh the third time. I'm not certain which, but I am not quite as enthusiastic about this book as I am about the other two. However, I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"After the first two outstanding books in this series, to say this third one disappointed me would be an understatement. Most of the aspects that were charming from previous installments are missing or barely present here. For example, Rra. Matekoni is suffering from depression and as a result his participation in the story is minimal, not to mention the ridiculous way in which this situation is handled in the story. The two kids that were staying with Mma. Ramotswe were a central piece of interest for me, and I assume most readers, but in this book they are relegated to a minor spot in the plot. Even with that, the composition the girl shares with her new family is the high point in this book. It is a shame the author did not make better use of this character.Add on top of that a couple of cases with very little appeal, and you end up with a story that dragged along at sloth's speed. Even Mma Ramotswe thought the main case was ridiculous as you can see in the title of this review, and that was only a hint of the things to come. Maybe the only other redeeming quality of this book is that we get to learn a little more about Mma. Makutsi, and she sure is a sharp one, but I did not find this to be enough to make the overall book's quality good.I just hope that this was a stumble in the way and that in the next book we will find the quality of the first two installments. Therefore, I will readThe Kalahari Typing School for Men (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Book 4)in the near future to determine if this is a series worth pursuing farther. Of course, if you have not read other books in the series, my recommendation is not to start here and go back to the first two books, since those are truly worth it."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I love the author's clear and vivid description of the exotic African setting of Gaborone in Botswana. I enjoy reading the brief references to the political leaders and philosophers of the area even though I know nothing about most of them. But mostly, I enjoy the interesting way the author has crafted his sentences and sentiments of his characters; they do not feel anywhere close to Western cultural beliefs and yet seem as though they used to be a long time ago. The daily conventional tasks of living for a very unconventional woman are described beautifully. It reminds me of the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. If Alexander wasn't so obviously a man's name I would have thought the author to be a woman as so much of the pages talk intimately about the differences between the sexes from a woman's point of view. I would very much love to know how to pronounce the abbreviations Mma. and Rra. In my head I read them as M-ma and Ra which I'm certain is totally wrong. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a quirky, well paced novel that leaves you feeling refreshed."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I so enjoyed the HBO series a couple of years ago, but have only begun reading the series recently. This third book has the virtues of one and two: written in simple, effective style; taking an affectionate stance towards its familiar characters; creating an idealistic, almost magical world where thoughtfulness, patience, love and determination reign, malice is treatable, and violence is heard only in muted echos. I can't help picturing the TV actors as the main characters, but I don't mind, because they were played so well, particularly Mma Ramotswe.

I've finished \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" and all the qualities of the previous books are there, especially that which attracts me most: the sensitive, caring, insightful approach to the characters and the social and cultural environment. Better still, it's funny, entertaining, well written, keeping you all the way interested in the cases in which Precious Ramotswe gets involved. Those who appreciate regular, streamline suspense books, on the other hand, may not find in this one what they are looking for. It's everything but common detective novel work. I also recommend the HBO series based on the books.The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (The Complete First Season)"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe, proprietor of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Bostwana, has a great deal to think about. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, Mma Ramotswe's fiance and the owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, has been acting strangely of late. He is unusually listless and he seems uninterested either in his business or in her. What can be wrong with him?Meanwhile, although she gets her fair share of clients, Mma Ramotswe's detective agency is not exactly prospering. Fortunately, Ramotswe's assistant, Mma Makutsi, proves to be an invaluable asset. She not only becomes the acting manager of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, but she even takes on a lucrative case of her own. While Makutsi investigates the moral character of four contestants in the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest, Mma Ramotswe looks into a possible poisoning for an important &quot;Government Man&quot;.Mma Ramotswe's sweet nature, unerring instincts and inherent common sense make her both a wonderful friend and a superb detective. Mma Makutsi comes into her own in this novel, as she shows herself to be both an excellent investigator and a shrewd manager. I recommend &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls&quot; for its gentle charm, its wry humor and its unique and memorable characters."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The books in this wonderful series just keep getting better and better, and this latest, which finds the formidable secretary Mma Makutsi promoted to assistant manager of Mr. J.L.B.

Her fiance, the above-mentioned Mr. Matekoni, is suffering from a mysterious malaise, and has started to neglect his thriving business. Her own detective agency, while still getting customers, is showing no profit and may have to move into different premises. Put that together with the lazy, girl-chasing auto-repair apprentices, the earnest and ambitious Mma Makutsi, and a case for the detective agency that just might save the business, and there are plot twists aplenty.Of course, Mma Ramotswe faces all her problems unscathed, after many cups of bush tea. And of course Mma Makutsi proves herself to be invaluable--as usual.A delightful tale in this utterly delightful series!"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is the third installment in the First Ladies Detective Agency Series starring the estimable Mma Ramotswe, a modern woman of Botswana who has not forgotten the beauty of the vanishing older culture. The first book in the series, THE NO.1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY, was an unexpected Christmas gift of fine writing, a whole new style, a new rhythm to spinning mysteries, infinitely resonate of Africa and humanity. The second book, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE did the first justice, though it was more conventionally linear in its deportment. This third book is in part episodic like the first and partly straightforward like the second, a wiggly balance that is difficult to reconcile.MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS essentially rolls a lot of logs at the feet of our heroine. Her detective agency is leaking rather than garnering profits, despite a busy agenda. Her fianc&eacute;, the dependable Mr. JBL Matekoni, is suddenly not himself and his business is in disarray. A government dignitary wants her to go undercover and prove his sister-in-law is poisoning his brother. An orphanage wants her to look into the mystery of a foundling. Meanwhile, a star rises in Mma Ramotswe's secretary, Mma Makutsi, who rushes in where her boss is not and takes on the titular strand of the story, a job involving a beauty contest. It gives the author an opportunity to tie together the themes inherent in the other story lines.It's the plotting that's off, feels contrived, and there is less of the whole of Botswana and Africa in this volume. But it is a chance to spend more time with charming, original characters in an extraordinary place, so do not pass it over."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Like so many other readers, I really enjoy McCall Smith's stories of Mma Ramotswe, and her Botswana detective service. Mma Ramotswe is a remarkable character, and I love her simple and moral nature. Yet, of the three books I have read in this series, I found _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ to be the weakest story so far.Mma Ramotswe is pulled in many different directions in this book, and only a few of the circumstances really go anywhere. Nearly a whole chapter is devoted to a young boy that is found outside of town, and he is subsequently sent to the &quot;orphan farm&quot;. The matron of the orphan farm, Mma Potakwani, asks Mma Ramotswe to investigate the boy's past, yet that story line fails to go anywhere. Why spend so much time developing a story only to drop it in the end? I was left disappointed, and can only hope that this mystery is revisited in the future.Another large loose end: what happened to Mr. J.L.B Matekoni? In the previous books, he is a main character, however in _Morality for Beautiful Girls_ he is given little face time. The book did not tell us what brought Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's depression, and once again, are the readers going to be told what happened in the future? Like Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the children from the orphan farm, who played such a large role in _Tears of the Giraffe_ are nearly forgotten in this novel. What happened to them?Yet there were parts that I really enjoyed as well... It is exciting to see the development of Mma Makutsi, and her ever-expanding talents and responsibilities. I look forward to reading more about her. I particularly liked her case with the beauty pageant, and her quest to find a girl in Botswana with both beauty and integrity.Despite the obvious holes in this novel, I am still looking forward to reading more about Mma Ramotswe and the other characters in the future."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the third book of the \\"No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" series and some of the novelty is starting to run down. Also comes the realization, that this is more a book about Africa and its people then about solving crimes. The mysteries, so it seems, are just a side issue to the story. This fact was indeed quite clear after the first book and I confess it did not and does not bother me; Africa is an interesting enough subject to hold a story. I also appreciate the choice of lady detective and \\"mystery\\" as a means to unfold the tales of the African people. My criticism however is with the easy way in which the issues and problems (these are not really crimes) are solved. It seems that this gets easier from one book to the next. If solving crimes is the method you choose, then maybe you should try a little harder. It seems a little far-fetched to believe that all servants and maids confide with Mma Ramotswe and her secretary and actually hand them the answers they look for on a silver platter. Also a little disappointing that the issue of the boy with the \\"lion smell\\" presented in such an intriguing way in the beginning of the book is discarded later on with no more then a few sentences (although I did appreciate the clever conversation between Mma Ramotswe and Mma Potokwane).In this book we again follow Mma Ramotswe, our regular heroine and her faithful secretary (now promoted to the position of Assistant Detective and even acting manager of the garage) Mma Makutsi who proves to be a wonder woman. Not only she proves herself to be a great detective but also appears to hold great knowledge of cars and a lot of self-confidence.Another problem is that many of the issues return again and seem to be a little overused. A good example would be mentioning, again, for the 100th time that Mma Ramotswe is a \\"traditionally built\\" woman. OK, we understood that. It seems that the writer wants to make his point again and again.And yet, after I have spilled all my criticism, I must say that the story is a nice and easy read and the current problems of Africa are presented with a love that comes out of every sentence. Mma Ramotswe is no doubt an incredible character and I can only assume that I will also buy the next book of the series, if only to find out how is Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his adopted children."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The ladies of The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Mma Precious Ramotswe and Mma Grace Makutsi, continue to help people solve the problems in their lives. In this installment, Mma Ramotswe finds out what's behind the poisoning of family members of The Government Man who comes to her office convinced his sister-in-law is the culprit. Before the mystery is solved, however, Mma Ramotswe becomes ill herself while visiting the family in question. While Mma Ramotswe is away, Mma Makutsi is hired by the head of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest to see which of the four finalists is deserving of the title. Since both women are perceptive, as well as clever, each uncovers the truth in due time. Meanwhile, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni continues to be vexed by his two apprentices who seem far more interested in sloughing off and going on about girls than they are about fixing cars. He has also begun to exhibit strange behavior. Is he having second thoughts about marrying Mma Ramotswe?The ease with which Alexander McCall Smith tells his stories continues to attract my devoted attention. His descriptions of Mma Precious Ramotswe's Africa and his portrayal of her personality, and that of his other characters, are delightful, often amusing, and full of wise, philosophical musings. One observation made by Mma Ramotswe about a maid in the house of the poisoning goes thus: \\"Here was another with a motive, she reflected, but the thought was absurd. This was an honest woman. Her face was open and she smiled as she spoke. Secrets left shadows on the face, and there were none there.\\" I re-read the words \\"secrets left shadows on the face\\" several times, pondering the depth of wisdom in their simplicity.This is the third in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, and each one is as good as the last. It's also clear that Mr. Smith has a love of Africa (Botswana in particular) that clearly shines through in his descriptions of the land and the customs of its people. I don't want the series to end!Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In the third installment of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, Mma Ramotswe faces new challenges that give this book a slightly different twist. In this story the focus seems to be more on the ever changing quality of Precious Ramotswe's life and the people in it rather than the cases that come into the agency. I missed Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni and his quiet gentleness in this book, as he was indisposed throughout most of the story with a mysterious illness. Mma Makutsi and her new job as the manager of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors and assistant detective figure prominently in the storyline. The reader learns more about her personal life, what drives her and her unique thoughts on the state of society especially the status of women. The mysteries are less obvious and a little less satisfying when resolved. What the reader is given is some beautiful philosophicial prose on the nature of the human condition as Mme Ramtoswe and Mme Matkusi each ponder the intricacies of their cases. I enjoyed this book, although somewhat different. Perhaps, as a reader I must come to expect that each book in the series is unique in its own way. McCall Smith has again created a wonderful story that quietly interweaves the African culture, traditions and communities into a story that touches us no matter where we live."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"In his third book about the &quot;No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; Smith turns to a full blown analysis of Botswana Ethics and Morality. He investigates such concepts as some Botswanians are liars. Most tell the truth about most things, but there are still some things, that Botswanians will not tell about. Some Botswanian women are beautiful and some are not. Some Botswanian women play around, and are promiscuous, others are more chaste. And again, certainly, Smith discusses the concept of Traditional Values in the Modern World and how they mesh, and how they do not mesh.But what the reader notices, is these things that Smith showcases in his book, these values, these ethical standards, and the resulting mix, are not just Botswanian. They are American, Swiss, Russian, Portuguese, Indian, Italian, Australian, in fact, they are the same types of moral and ethical issues that all societies wrestle with all over the world.In this book, Smith deals less with detective stories and much more with ethics and human commonality. He even tackles depression as a very common and treatable human illness. And he comments on beauty contests, both the good and the bad. And even with this change of focus, Smith still keeps us with those same characters, acting the same way, and shows us how they analyze ethics and morality of others in comparison to their own. In addition, just so his characters are not superhuman, he also introduces some character faults within them as well. This introduction of a few negatives, makes his characters much more real as human beings. And after all, it seems, that what Smith's message is here, is that morality and ethics are woven into the fabric of everyday life, just as much as eating and sleeping. No matter where one lives and who one interacts with, the issues of ethics and morality in dealings with others must be considered. And if it be true, that no man is an island; then it also is true, that all men and women, must come to terms with some model of ethics and morality, that they can internally justify.Smith has an uncanny ability to use Botswana as a microcosm of the world. And even more so, a microcosm of the free and democratic countries of the world. For Botswana is a free and democratic country, and they are a very proud people. There are many such countries in the world. And in most things, they can be compared, at least metaphorically to the microcosm of Botswana."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am reading the Number One Ladies Detective series in order, and this is clearly the worst of the three I have read so far. However, that isn't a bad indictment on this charming and easy to read book.In this book, our hero's assistant, who was promoted to Assistant Detective in Tears of the Giraffe, finds herself in an expanded role in the detective business, and in the automotive repair business too. For reasons not entirely explained, Mr J.L.B. Matekoni suffers from depression and takes a theraputic vacation, leaving his business in the hands of his fiancee and her trusted assistant. I was disappointed that we didn't find out more about the cause of the depression, but perhaps that is the cliffhanger to lead the reader to the next book, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.There are two main detective tales in this book, one involving each of our two lady detectives. Each are solved with uncommon common sense from two of the smartest women in Africa."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The third book in the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency series is a little bit of a letdown. Having loved the previous two entries (which one should certainly read before this), I was rather disappointed that there of the five plotlines, only two were actually &quot;cases&quot; and two were left unresolved. Plotline one involves the agency's move to share space with Speedy Motors and Miss Makutsi's new role as Asst. Manager there. Plotline two involves a feral young boy found in the bush, which never really goes anywhere. Plotline three involves the apparent poisoning of the brother of an important &quot;Government Man.&quot;This case is much like those in the two previous books as &quot;traditionally built&quot; Precious Ramotswe must insinuate herself into a country household and unmask the poisoner. As always, she uses her intelligence, keen sense of human nature and a desire to help people to arrive at an outcome that's best for all. Plotline four embroils Miss Makutsi in an investigation of the character of four beauty contest finalists. She proves herself the equal of Mma Ramotswe as a detective, and in that sense, she steals some of the thunder in this book. The final plotline revolves around a mystery held by Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni which is hinted at but never unveiled, presumably leaving it for the next book, which is rather frustrating and annoying.Like the earlier books, this one critiques forces of progress and modernization as well as patriarchalism (although in a lighter way than the other books did), and aims to portray a positive picture of modern Africa, one all too rarely seen in the West. As always, the story is delivered in a delightfully fluid and simple well-paced prose.The series continues with The Kalahari Typing School For Men."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls (2002) is the third volume in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, following Tears of the Giraffe. In the previous volume, Precious Ramotswe has united a woman with her grandson. Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni has acquired two foster children, who now live in the house on Zebra Road; the girl, Motholeli, is very interested in automobiles and engines, so Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni believes that he has finally found someone to whom he can pass on his knowledge and passion for cars. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni also has lost his maid, who was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm.In this novel, Precious Ramotswe plans the merger of the offices and staffs of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and the Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors garage. Mma Makutsi assures her that she can straighten out the garage files. Then Mma Ramotswe discovers that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is suffering from depression and unable to concentrate on any of his work. The two apprentices are mostly goofing off and getting very little work done. Precious offers the position of assistant manager of the garage to Mma Makutsi in addition to her other duties. The new assistant manager soon takes charge, motivating the apprentices and satisfying the customers.Mma Pakotwane asks Precious for some advice concerning a child newly received by the orphanage. The child will not wear clothes and is unable to speak. Moreover, one of the men who found the child in the wild stated that the boy smelled of lions.Mma Ramotswe reluctantly takes on a big case for a very important Government Man, who believes that his brother is being poisoned by the brother's new wife. Mma goes to live with the family for a while and even gets poisoned along with most of the family.While Precious is away, Mma Makutsi takes on a case for Mr. Moemedi Pulani concerning the participants in the Miss Beauty and Integrity contest. Mr. Pulani is well known in Botswana for his beauty pageants and contributions to charity. However, two scandals in recent pageants have persuaded him to consider integrity as well as beauty in the contestants. While he has tried to weed out the immoral girls, he is beginning to think that he has not done that good of a job. He asks Mma Makutsi to investigate the five remaining participants and determine which are moral enough to meet his standards.

At first the phrasing and accents seem strange to the American ear, but after just a few minutes you wish everyone spoke with such caring and respect for others.

I have really gotten attached to this series of books that cherish story telling over action scenes. Smith's work here with his #1 Ladies Detective Agency is not about finding clever ways to solve mysteries. So if you have yet to pick up one of his stories or are wondering why so many people love these books keep that in mind while you read them. Instead of trying to solve the puzzles or sit waiting to be shocked into sitting up biting your nails, watch how Smith pulls together a dozen interesting personal tales and then weaves them together in a magical way. In \`Morality...' Smith manages to slip in a few insights into how one might manage to live a proper and upstanding life. He does so by having his characters think of the old Botswana ways or the Ten Commandments and then wonder at what is wrong with modern Botswana men and women. Then he goes about with stories that link into this theme. All in all this is a very deceivingly complex book. It lulls you with its simple approach and if your not careful you might not notice that Smith might be trying to change you, the reader, with his clever insights.So far I think that because of what I said above, this is Smith's best work of the series. I am in awe of his abilities as an author. This is sort of like reading a simple version of Moby Dick with all of its layers of meaning. Don't pass this series up, though I would suggest you start with the first book.Enjoy"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I can't go on enough about how wonderful this series is.

Once again, the lead character, Precious Ramotswe, and her marvelous assistant, Mma.

Questions such as what is good behavior, what is beauty, and what makes people act the way they do are answered with a clarity and a certainty that ring true. One cannot but like Mmas Ramotswe and Makutsi and enjoy their internal ruminations on these eternal questions. Surrounding them are other well-wrought characters who struggle with life's challenges: Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni with depression, a wild boy found in the bush who now needs to be civilized, a big Government man who comes to the detective agency with a familiy problem that really resides within himself, and on it goes. In the backdrop are the ever-changing cycles of nature as we are enriched with sensual and clear descriptions of the rich countryside that is Botswana.

Mma Ramotswe learns from his apprentices that Mr. Matekoni has lost interest in the garage.Mma Makitsi, the assistant, decides to buy a doughnut to celebrate her new duties and promotion. The house of Mr. Matekoni is unkempt. Mma Ramotswe goes to consult Dr. Moffat. She is advised by him that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni might be depressed. Mma Makutsi is to function as the acting manager of the garage.A detective helps people in need to resolve the unresolved questions in their lives. It is important to remember that every story has two sides. A good mechanic understands cars. The apprentices were a charity of Mr. Matekoni. He thought trained mechanics were needed to replace his generation. Mma Makutsi coordinates the work of the apprentices.Mma Ramotswe believes that the ordinary people of Africa do not have room in their hearts for hatred. Moral codes aree not designed to be selective. Mostly it is about doing the right thing.Mma Ramotswe is distantly related to the woman who runs the orphanage. She goes out to investigate the case of a seemingly feral child. The boy cannot speak and smelled like a lion when picked up by the authorities.Then Mma Ramotswe is called upon to invesigate the motives of the sister-in-law of a government man. In the meantime her assistant is to investigate the background of the contestants in a beauty and integrity event and to help run the garage while Mr. Matekoni recovers from his illness.

The man had on a long robe with an elaborate headdress and tall walking stick. The woman, alien like Diane, was barefooted and dressed colorfully with a scarg around hre head, a bright, eye-pleasing blouse with a long skirt (similar to my dull peacock skirt -- I have a bright one also) and her very presence spoke voodoo. They were not a part of the Fair.Alexander Smith has written fifty books including CHILDREN OF WAX, TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE, and THE SUNDAY PHILOSOPHY CLUB.

I guess I would have to say this is more true for this book than the first one I read. I have to agree with several of the other reviewers that there seemed to be more lose ends (or losely tied ends) that really didn't leave me satisfied.

I will use this seller again."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The first book in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series is a masterpiece, a work of folk tradition, a mystery, a story about the strength of strong-willed women, and a heart-warming tale. As Smith has written more books, they haven't been able to live up to the high bar set by the first. This is more a sleuth story and less of a piece of literature. The mysteries themselves are kind of boring and without the spicy resolutions of the first book. Precious never gets to employ her special brand of folk wisdom to solve a crime.If you are just starting the series, read the books in order, and don't expect everything to live up to the first one."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I imagine these books might turn off a certain kind of reader because of their repeated moral lessons (fat people are okay, don't judge books (or people) by their covers, women aren't appreciated, man are immature etc), but I continue to find them rewarding to read. They are short, they move fairly quickly and nothing particularly horrible ever happens. What draws the reader through is M Ramotswe, the head of the lady detective agency, and her side kick (and now assistant manager) Mma MaKutsi. While Mma Ramotswe is tolerant of other people's weaknesses, she does not let people walk all over her and she always solves the crime in a morally correct way, neatly wrapping up the problems by the end of the novel.In this installment, M and M are moving their detective business from their original place of business to join Ramotswe's fiance in his car repair shop, to save them all money. But, meanwhile, Ramotswe's fiance has fallen victim to a depression and Makutsi has to take over the auto shop while Ramotswe attempts to get her fiance help for his illness and to solve a \\"Government officials\\" fear that his brother is being poisoned by his wife.As usual, Smith examines the issue of beauty and character (Makutsi has to investigate the contestants for a beauty contest), relationships and honesty. There are no surprises in the novel, but there is some humor, great description and fun dialogue."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This third book in the delightful series by Alexander McCall Smith continues the mysterious and personal adventures of MmaRamotswe--intelligent founder of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency. Set in emerging Botswana this book presents the brilliant protagonist still engaged to the kind mechanic, Mr. Maketoni, as she embarks on new professional challenges. Since her modest business faces a deficit cash flow, she enlists the aid of two lackadaisical auto apprentices to move her office to the greasy premises of Speedy Motors. In so doing she promotes her secretary/assistant detective to Acting Manager of the garage. Now Mma Makutsi must combine her sleuthing and typing duties with overseeing the operations of an automotive repair shop.Several mysteries--not all of which are resolved in these pages--crop up to capture the reader's interest: the strange case of a Wild Child who speaks no words and smells of Lion; a Goverment Man who swears that his brother is being poisoned by his wife's greedy family; the judge of a beauty competition who fears for the integrity of his young nation. Lastly the disturbing case of Maketoni's sudden indifference to the fate of his own business; what secret from his past haunts this compassionate man, who a adopted two children from the Orphan Farm on the spur of the moment? What causes this great depression and malaise? If you are not already a fan of this unique detective agency, you soon will be! Consider this book just another in the wonderful, intriguing series which celebrates traditional African values and promotes the role of emancipated Women. You gotta love \`em!"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This book goes to bolster my initial opinion that McCall Smith is a sensational writer to look out for. The book goes to make the series a worthy read. I am particularly drawn to the way the author wrote about the way of life this African country especially its remarkable values. What is more, the characters are real and warm-hearted , and they give the story the humor that is necessary for an interesting life.The usurper and Other stories, The Kalahari Typing School for Men, Disciples of Fortune,turned out to be some of the fun stories I came across. Alexander McCall Smith is a talented writer."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"As the third in the No. 1 Ladies Detective series, &quot;Morality for Beautiful Girls,&quot; continues along the same line as the first two books.Precious Ramotswe finds herself involved in a case for a &quot;government&quot; man and spends most of the book away from those that she adores. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni leaves his repair shop for a stint at the orphange to cure his depression. Mma Ramotswe's assistant is promoted to Asst. Mgr of the repair shop and takes on a case for the detective agency that leads her to discover the truth about beauty. All wrapped up at the end another moral lesson is learned from these wonderful characters.Alexander McCall Smith remains true to his original character concepts and deepens the readers understanding as to what makes them tick. He tells us another fable with a good moral to live by and leads us onto the next in the series. These books are easy, fun reads that blend light mystery with good judgement and relate an excellent lesson. I am looking forward to the next journey of Mma Ramotswe and her gang."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Another good book, not quite as good as some of the others, but still a pleasant read. Precious Ramotswe is busy. She is moving her detetective office into her fiance's business to help cut costs as her detective agency is not doing as well, financially, as she would like. Her fiance is not feeling well and she is trying to help him plus take care of a couple of orphans and solve her cases. Her character is one of warmth, kindness, generosity and strength. One of the things that I like about these books is that I get a glimpse of what life is like in Botswana, Africa."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I think that greatly enhanced my appreciation of the book -- I had read two more in the series (including the first) but liked this the best, perhaps in part because the accents were so well done. The reader really brought the book to life, almost like listening to a play, since so much consists of dialogue or inner thoughts.The books in this series all consist of a series of stories wound together by the lives of the main characters (a female detective, her assistant, her fiance, and her foster children), who live in Botswana. This book revealed the author's continuing interest in ethics. There are a number of story lines going on in the book, but the title comes from an assignment in trying to determine which finalist in a beauty contest is also a highly moral person -- only there are only three days to find the answer. The solution is rather amusing. Other plot lines include a child found in the wilderness -- who is he? and a woman who may be trying to kill her husband -- or so her brother-in-law fears. The two lady detectives have their work cut out for them trying to solve their problems and run the auto repair -- since the manager is suffering from an illness that prevents him from doing this, and it's up to them to keep the feckless apprentices working.I am developing a love for the country through these books and their portrayal of life there with people who are kind and joyful -- who continually find reason to be happy despite their problems."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The last time I saw Mma. Precious Ramotswe, at the conclusion of \\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" the entrepreneurial private eye was happily engaged to Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, they were both making plans for a life together and bonding with their two foster children, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency was firmly established, as was Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, Mr. Matekoni's business, and the horizon was filled with sunshine as far as the eye could see. How drastically things can change in just one book!\\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" finds trouble on both personal and professional fronts. Mr. Matekoni is going through a bout of depression and is temporarily unable to run his business. The detective agency, while enjoying tremendous success with clients and developing a fine reputation, is not making money. The couple decide to merge and reorganize! Mma. Ramotswe closes her detective agency's offices and moves her business, lock, stock and barrel into a small building adjacent to Speedy Motors. Mma Makutsi, who had already been promoted to assistant detective, is now appointed acting manager of the mechanical garage AND she runs the detective business while the owner is in the field detecting. Not surprisingly, the strong woman turns out to be an extremely efficient manager and a clever investigator. Mma. Makutsi is one of my favorite characters and the way she deals with the lazy, girl crazy mechanics is priceless. Meanwhile, Mr. Matekoni, who has been persuaded to see a doctor, is resting and working on getting his health back.An important Government Man enlists Mma. Ramotswe's services when he becomes convinced his younger brother is being poisoned. While she is out in the countryside working the case, the director of the Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana Contest asks Mma. Makutsi to help him with background checks for the contestants. He wants a \\"good girl\\" to win, someone who will not bring shame to the pageant or to Botswana. The problem is that according to the country's norms and moral codes, \\"good girls,\\" don't compete in beauty contests.As always, the mysteries may appear small but they deal with issues important to people's lives, and some of them are extremely thought-provoking and emotional. And for all their apparent simplicity, I find these books highly sophisticated. I really appreciate the way the author handles the topic of depression, and how the need to become informed and get appropriate treatment is emphasized.Mr. Smith also stresses the importance of empathy. When considering a friend who treats her maid badly, Mma Ramotswe thinks that \\"such behavior was no more than ignorance; an inability to understand the hopes and aspirations of others. That understanding . . . was the beginning of all morality. If you knew how a person was feeling, if you could imagine yourself in her position, then surely it would be impossible to inflict further pain. Inflicting pain in such circumstances would be like hurting oneself.\\"As always, Mma. Ramotswes spirit is luminescent. She loves her fellow man, but most of all, and most inspiring, is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\" I am captivated by this series and cannot wait to begin book number four!JANA"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just finished this book-- I really enjoy these characters, especially Mma Makutsi in this one. I so enjoy the stories told through these characters... The bits of tradition told through their politeness or rudeness. This book ended a bit abrubtly for my taste... *I think the idea is that you will run out and buy the next book right away if you are not feeling closure from the previous book. Nice strategy ;-). I'm eager to get to the next one :) side note: I wish I had some \\"Bush Tea\\" to brew up while I read this series. They have tea so often it becomes a very comforting ritual. Off to make a cup now! :D"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Third in the series of the No. 1 Ladies' Detection Agency, a person could pick this up and read it on its own. But I don't recommend it. I feel everyone would enjoy this book FAR more after reading the first two books in the series.As good as the first two books were, each book only seems to get better! I couldn't put the book down, and read the whole thing in one day. Unlike some U.S. reviewers, I did not find this book to be weak. I found the fact that some cases/plots resolve more satisfactorily than others to be a mirror of REALITY. (I am an American living overseas, and have often heard British/Australians/New Zealanders criticise American movies/books for having endings that are \\"too pat,\\" with too many ends tied up TOO well! Perhaps those who criticise this book about the the opposite are more used to American authors. I think part of what they are feeling is that this is a British author.)As all books do in series, different books focus more on certain characters, to the exclusion of others. Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is somewhat on the sidelines in this book, but he does come back into prominence in the successive books (and in fact, book five seems to be primarily about him).The title of this book comes from a particularly interesting case Mma Makutsi investigates while Precious Ramotswe is away investigating another particulary interesting case. The best thing about the book is the way these two cases resolve! I feel this writer has had a lot of life experience, and ends up imparting this wisdom about life through his characters adventures and investigations. Furthermore, living in Africa these past 12 years, I absolutely love the African settings and how the African people of Botswana are portrayed."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This is the 3rd McCall Smith book I have read. In this book the author expands our understanding of the support characters - the finance, the asst. and more informaton on Precious and the country of Botswana. This novel includes a little more political history (with some prejudice for the country) than the first two. However, unlike the other two novels, this one contains fewer detective stories.If this is the first McCall Smith story you are thinking about, I recommend that you read the first two, especially \\"The No. 1 Ladiess' Detective Agency\\" first. Also if you are looking for a complex, \\"Sherlock\\" type story or a murder mystery with danger on every page or even a CSI type novel, - these novels are not it.McCall Smith's strength is his short, down to earth tales of Africa with a no nonsense lady who capitalizes on her common sense and understanding of her people to solve the mysteries.Also this book is a little heavier on moral commentary - how people should act and how the young people are not acting that way. It got a little too much for me, because the theme was repeated in various ways.That being said, I still liked the book for a fast and humorous read and have already ordered two of the next books. My reasons are noted above and because I studied sociology in college - therefore I love stories that delve into family or social dynamics. These stories do that with good psychology and decent (though overdone) philosophy thrown in."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls by Alexander McCall Smith In this sweet installment of the always-pleasing No 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, Mma Ramotswe has quite a bit on her plate --- even for a traditionally-built woman.Her fianc&eacute;, the excellent Mr.J.L.B. Matekoni is suffering from the signs of depression, a Government Official believes that his sister-in-law is trying to poison his brother and bills are piling up at the agency--with few too cases to counter them. Not to mention, J.L.B. Matekoni is unavailable to work in his condition and while he hides out at the orphan farm to recuperate and take some medication, Mma Makutse ( her prickly, be-spectacled and utterly delightful secretary) finds herself the manager of Twolkeng Speedy Motors. It is a sumptuous book. Mma Ramotswe is so jolly and delightful she's Prozac! You just feel giddy reading about her and how innately good she is.This particular installment delves into the backstory of her adopted orphans, Puso and Motholeli and gave a bleak glimpse into the hardships African children undergo upon the death of parents. McCall Smith speaks very starkly about J.L.B's depression and we, as well as Mma Ramotswe, not only sympathize but no what is at stake for someone so well respected to be under the cloud of such a condition. Mma Ramotswe goes undercover to a farm near her home village of Mochudi and we see, for the first time, how the legacy of her father has rippled through the local community.I really enjoyed this book and its subtle wisdom. What a great tonic these stories are! While Mma Ramotswe is out of Gabarone, Mma Makutsi is approached by Two Shots Poulani: one of Botswana's lead Beauty Contest orchestrators ( according to McCall Smith, beauty pageants are quite popular in Bostwana and they always jump at a chance to crown a pretty girl). Sponsors are concerned that the women parading in the pageants do not have the moral integrity needed to provide a good example to spectators. Thus, Mma Makutsi ( who, face it!, has always found women in short skirts and heels problematic due to her own dwindling self worth) has no trouble writing off girls who aren't nearly worthy enough of the title of Miss Beauty and Integrity. When she finds a beautiful, rural girl who not only embodies the humble spirit needed of a girl of integrity but wants to attend the Botswana Secretarial College, Mma Makutsi finds herself rooting for a beauty contest contestant. All in all a charmingly wonderful story."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Don't know what to do on the weekend?

Good reading and thought provoking moral characteristics. Looking forward to the remaining books in the series."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I enjoyed this 3rd book in the series very much, and life goes on with more interesting adventures.As you know in the last book, Mma Ramotswe was engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. In this book, they still plan to marry of course, but Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is experiencing a depressed mood unlike himself, and is not in the mood to run his garage. So he just took off and left the work up to his apprentices who only goof off and work hardly at all. That is, until the detective agancy experiences financial setbacks, and Mma Romatske has her secretary/assistant detective, take over at the garage as well. That way they can save money, and help Mr. J.L.B Matekoni as well to save the garage while absent. When Mma Makutsi takes over there, she puts her foot down, and makes these gentleman work harder than they ever have. And, shortly after a new case comes in.The new case is the Government man who believes that his autistic brother is being poisined by his wife who only married him for the family money anyway. It is reluctantly that Mma Ramotske takes the case, and stays at the family farm for a 'respite' for a week so she can see what really goes on. What she finds out there is quite surprising.Then there is another case taken by Mma Makutsi. There is a beauty competition run by a wealthy gentleman each year. Trouble is, he isn't sure which girl is deserving of the award as many of them are quite untrustworthy. So he wants Mma Makutsi to interview the candidates for this year's pageant, and figure out which girl has morality, and is worthy of the winner's place.There is also a strange boy in the story this time as well. Mma Potokwane, the manager of the orphan farm, doesn't know what to make of him. He seems unable to speak, and won't wear any clothing. He is a wild boy, and attacks anyone who comes near him. So Mma Potokwane wants Mma Ramotske to figure out where this boy might have come from, and who he belonged to before. But it may not be easy when the boy won't even talk. Anyway she owes Mma Potokwane a return favor for helping Mr. J.L.B Matekoni snap out of his depression and seeing that he takes his pills properly.The book was just full of events like this and it always makes it so interesting. It is hard to put down."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am slightly concerned ... this has been to date such a charming series right up there with such classics as Wind in the Willows.But alas as series continue, especially ones so well received as the life and times of Precious Ramotswe, the author seems to come to believe it is his story. In this particular case we find Precious discussing such unrelated things as the relevance of existentialism, the theories of David Leaky, women's rights, yada yada yada.Mr. Smith, if you out there more focus on Ramotswe and the trials and travails of the the Dective Agency and Speedy Motors and less as a vehicle for better world understanding. sigh :("},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I am a huge fan of Alexander McCall Smith and I find the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series overall to be extremely heartfelt and compelling. The characters are so unique and each chapter seems to bring a smile to my face. No sex. No violence. No profanity. Yet I find myself wanting more. How amazing.Yet Morality for Beautiful Girls is a noticeably weaker effort than the first two. The title is bland and hard to remember. You get well past page 100 before the beauty contest contestants are even introduced and there is only one chapter involving the poisoning case early on. So there isn't much detecting going on. Honestly, there isn't much of anything going on and the reader almost becomes as depressed as a certain major character, waiting for something, anything to happen.To me, Smith stumbles this out. Not in a major way, but after the joy of the first two Precious tales, this time around things seem a bit too dark in Botswana and some of the joy seems to be missing."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"These Ladies Detective Agency novels are entertaining but there are much better books out there.

'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I read the first volume of the \\"No 1 Ladies Detective Agency\\" and now volume 3. By comparison, vol 3 dwells too much on the personal lives of Mma Ramotswe and her husband to be. These parts of the book are uninteresting and did not engage me much. On the other hand, very little detecting is done in this book. The main character really handles only one case, and while in the first volume this was where her earthy wisdom shone through, here her advice is not as convincing, as if she has her mind on other things.On the other hand, the minor characters in this book are delightful. It was good to see the assistent come into her own, and the mechanic apprentices insert a much needed comic note into the story.In all, this book feels like the author is treading water, not sure where to take his characters. He is shifting from the series-of-vignettes to a more long form novel, but the result is not convincing. Yet."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I still find this series refreshing for its unusual setting, positive portrayal of Africa, and careful treatment of the relationships between the characters. But in this installment, plot (always a secondary consideration) takes a seat in the way-back of the tiny white van.The various plots involve a few detective cases, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's deep depression, the two orphans living at Mma Ramotswe's house, and money troubles at both the garage and the agency. You would think that with all this going on, there would be plenty of material to fill up a short book without the characters (and the author) also indulging in extended mental rambles. Much of the book struck me as weak philosophical musings in the guise of character development."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first two volumes in The Ladies No.1 Detective Agency series; however, this entry was a huge disappointment.

However later on in the book the Government Man's mother is claiming the youngest son as her own and no further mention is ever made of the 'other mother'. Further there are plot stubs that go nowhere as far as I can tell -- the Lion Boy, Ms. Makutsi's brother and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni's illness.

Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful appreciation of language, idiosycracies of character and a sympathetic eye for nuance of language and manners which make this book (and this series) one of the best reads I have had. A series which I will continue to read over and overIn this, the third book of the series of Precious Rambotswe and the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, she is given some problems which only she can solve. Her fiance Mr J B L Matekoni has lost interest in his business, the Tlekwoni Rd Speedy Motors, and the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency is not doing as well as it might, putting the assistant detective, Mma Makutsi's latest promotion in danger. Mma Makutsi scored 97% in the final exam at the Botswana Secretarial college but does not wish to return to being simply a secretary. There are not enough secretarial jobs around especially for a secretary who is not pretty.Precious is asked by a Government man to investigate his sister in law who he believes is poisoning his brother. She must also investigate the strange case of the boy who may think he is a lion and is now residing at the Orphan Farm. So Precious sets off for the Government mans farm to investigate (under cover) leaving the No. Ladies detective agency and the Tlekowni Rd Speedy Motors in the capable management of Mma Matuksi. Righly so for after she leaves Mma Matuksi receives a visit from the manager of the the Beauty and Integrity pageant. He wants to make sure the winner of this years contest is worthwhile, and not a bad woman like last years one who was arrested for prostitution and brought the Beauty and Integrity paegeant into disrepect - especially with the sponsors.Alexander McCall Smith writes of his characters with real affection. Everything is worked out and it is all very small stuff - just as you would expect a detection agency would in a small town. The characters are steeped with the morals and manner (and language) of their place in society - that is of a traditional Botswanan society fighting the onslsught of modern manners.There are genuinely hilarious moments, but mostly it is the gentle and sweet.

Ramotswe, owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana, Africa! I love this strong African woman who is proud of who and what she is and where she is from and I'm highly entertained by the clients and other characters that she comes across.\\"We help people with the problems in their lives. We are not here to solve crimes,\\" Mma. Ramotswe tells one client. Not your average detective, she and her staff of one (Mma. Makutsi, her secretary turned-assistant detective) help people from different backgrounds with varied problems. Mma. Ramotswe even has a personal problem to resolve when her fianc&eacute;e (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors) starts acting in a strange manner without warning or reasoning.I like the way the author brings out the close relationship between Mma. Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni. The couple chooses to address each other formally but it is done in the context of respect, affection and love. The mannerisms and dialog between the other characters show the reader some of the cultural nuances in that part of the world.The issue of morality -- how people treat each other, forgiveness, helping others -- comes up as the detectives work. On a job assignment, Mma. Makutsi goes in search of a beautiful girl with morals for a beauty pageant(hence the title). Mma. Ramotswe wrestles with the idea of whether some of her methods of detective work are moral.Set to a vivid background of the dry but beautiful land of Botswana with its great Braham bulls and colorful people, Alexander McCall Smith describes scenes that remind me of the picturesque movies like OUT OF AFRICA and I DREAMED OF AFRICA.MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is another fun book to read.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Makutsi rises to her own in this volume of &quot;The No. 1 Ladies' Detective&quot; series books. As Mma Ramtoswe feels the pinch economically and emotionally, what with moneys tight in the agency and the illness of her fiance, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni,she comes to rely on the unexpected talents and strength of her secretary. Mma Makutsi, with her too dark complexion and too big glasses, a less than &quot;beautiful&quot; specimen, shows true beauty in her no nonsense approach to taking on the business managerial load of Tolkweng Road Speedy Motors and its &quot;lazy, girl crazy apprentices&quot;, as well as landing a big paying client for the detective agency. Mma Ramotswe doesn't exactly take the back seat, but as she wrestles with the case of depression of her normally steady and reliable Motekoni, she is able to see her secretary's best qualities. In fact, I found the very modern issue of medical depression quite fascinating, along with Mma Ramotswe's recognition of the need to read about it, and get help from the other strong woman in the series, Mma Potokwane, the director of the children's orphanage who relies on Rra Matekoni for help.This volume of the series was very touching to me, as Precious Ramotswe takes on the case of an obnoxious Governmental Official who wants his own family investigated. Her wisdom in using the cultural courtesies of Botswana to interview the would be &quot;culprits&quot; and find a solution are just good sense. Her strength of character reinforces the issue of morality in the story.Most amusing of all is the big money customer that Mma Makutsi obtains who requires a quick investigation into the character of four Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana candidates, a rush job with an unusual need and surprising resolution.Best of all, Mma Makutsi shines in her managerial skills with the mechanics and customers of Speedy Motors, more than succeeding in bringing things in line for the ill owner and his intended bride. Her personal joy in receiving the opportunity to succeed in the business world makes her unusal character round out into a fully amusing and &quot;beautiful&quot; woman.Mr. J. L. B.'s recuperative visit to the orphanage and connection with a wild child there further enrich his gentleman's character.This is a reassuringly enjoyable read. A comfort and joy for the fans of Alexander McCall Smith's series."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls is third in a series about Precious Ramotswe, a lady detective in Botswana, Africa. For this Midwestern reader the landscape, weather, and daily life in Botswana were fascinating and clearly depicted.This is not your typical mystery--there is no murder to be solved. Ramotswe and her assistant detective cleverly handle a couple of cases for clients, but her personal life is just as interesting: moving the office, caring for two foster children, and handling the auto repair shop belonging to her fiance who has suddenly begun acting strangely. Ramotswe deals with both the problems of her clients and her personal life in a thorough and straight-forward manner.I had to buy the first two books in the series (The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency, and Tears of the Giraffe) from Amazon.UK, so I was very happy to find this third book on Amazon.com.For something just a little different--highly recommended."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Mma Ramotswe and her assistant, Mma Makutsi have a problem--or rather a series of problems. Thanks to her impending marriage to Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, Mma Ramotswe has a chance to move the office of the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, saving money. But even so, the agency is losing too much--and Makutsi would hate to have to let her assistant go. When Mr. J.L.B. Makekoni loses interest in his auto repair shop, Ramotswe sets up Mma Makutsi as assistant manager--but that doesn't deal with the issue of why Makekoni has lost interest in his shop (problem one). Then there's the government man who's convinced that his sister-in-law is trying to poison his brother (problem two). Next, there's a child found with the scent of lion on him, speaking no known language (problem three). Finally, a beauty contest manager comes to the agency with the problem of deciding which of his contestants is least likely to be connected with vice, theft, or other sponsor-offending defects (problem four). Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi definitely have their hands full.Author Alexander McCall Smith uses an almost fairy-tale touch to tell his story of families, culture clash, and ordinary people in Botswana, Africa. Smith emerges the reader in African urban culture immediately, letting the western reader come across differences and similarities to their own background in a natural and convincing way. His light touch (I especially liked Mma Ramotswe's description of herself as having a 'traditional' figure) adds frequent smiles to the journey.MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is not a complex mystery. In particular, I would have liked to see a better integration of the lion-child into the story. It is, however, a charming story of Africa, women trying to make their way in a culture that is quickly changing yet that maintains many of the values of the past, and of simply getting along with one another as they gain deeper insights into people. MORALITY is a quick read--but if you're like me, you'll find yourself thinking about it again and again once you're done."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls, the third book of the series, just continues to please.

She looks at life in a balanced and faithful way, and she lives a good life, expecting others not always to do the same. In this book we see her give her secretary more responsibility and authority and it does nothing but good. I love the way Alexander McCall Smith describes Africa, and I feel like I am there.

What's not mentioned in the blurb is that Mma Ramotswe has far too much on her plate, and is forced to share the spotlight with the efficient and intelligent Mma Makutsi, now promoted to Assistant Detective of the agency, with the added responsibility of managing Mr. Matekoni's auto repair business.While her boss is out of town sorting out the worries of a rich Government man whose concern for his younger brother and inheritance has poisoned his mind, Mma Makutsi takes over the story completely, devising methods to select a deserving and scandal-free beauty queen, while at the same time anchoring two businesses, and trying to keep them both afloat.This is really the story of the quiet and homely secretary who matured into a feisty, albeit plain swan.Amanda Richards November 14, 2004"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe has more than her clients' problems to solve in the third book of this series. Her detective agency is not doing well financially, and her fiance, Mr. Matekoni, has two lazy apprentices who are not helping him much with his car repair business. Added to this, Mr. Matekoni himself is behaving in a very strange manner. Rather than fire her secretary, Precious instead promotes her and puts her in charge of running both the car repair business and the detective agency. For some reason, which is not well explained in the book, Mma Makutsi is wildly successful in running the businesses and motivating the apprentices. Mr. Matekoni is shuffled off to the local orphanage (which makes no sense) to try to recover from his problem. His absence is keenly felt in the book and part of the interest is lost because he and Precious have very little interaction in this installment. Also there are some subplots which are weak or which go nowhere (such as Mma Makutsi's ill brother and the strange boy who is found in the wilderness.) The book is at its best when Mma Ramotswe is trying to solve the mystery of a Government Man's relative who is being poisoned, and Mma Makutsi investigates the moral character of four beauty pageant contestants.

In this third edition of her &quot;investigation of confidential matters and inquiries&quot; Mma Makutsi, her assistant and graduate of the Botswana Secretarial College with 97% in the final examination, exhibits her take-charge attitude. Mma Makutsi assumes the title of Assistant Manger of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the repair shop of Mma Ramotske's fiance who is suffering from depression and ignoring his once well-run garage. Then, too, Mma Makutsi uses her initiative to solve a lucrative case to determine the moral character of the four finalists of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest.And Mma Ramotswe's firm handling of an arrogant &quot;Government Man&quot; could be a textbook lesson in the the fine art of assertive behavior that results in Satisfaction for all Parties.I discovered that one of my favorite tea makers sells African Red Bush tea--now my preferred drink while reading about The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The beauty of this series is its simplicity and non-formulaic pacing and style. With few words, with a seemingly simplistic point of view, complicated matters that go beyond the borders of Botswana are broken down into small parcels. The facts have life are not often so basically described.One of the main aspects of the novel that I really love is the unpredictable pacing of the novel. Halfway through the story, a new and very important story line surfaces and without a lot of Hollywood-style drama, the story continues unfolding calmly, without exploding cars; wild, passionate scenes; predictable melodrama. Unlike most stories today, the plot doesn't build up to a dramatic plateau three quarters of the way through the story; rather it unfolds like rolling hills.The plot is almost inconsequential compared to the telling of the story; it's the telling of the story and the point of views that make these books so captivating. This series successfully transports you to a new world and way of looking at life, something that can't be said for most fiction that I have read.Between this book and Matt Lauer's report on Botswana, I am now looking forward to visiting this country someday."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third novel in the series about Precious Ramotswe and her detective agency in Botswana, and covers the period of one month after the events in Tears of the Giraffe. Be sure to read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe before this book, or you will probably think this story is a three star effort. Many reviews describe these books as mysteries . . . but they are really novels about a woman who sometimes solves problems for people. Since the first book, the &quot;mysteries&quot; have not been very mysterious, and the appeal of the books lies far apart from the mysteries.In Morality for Beautiful Girls, Alexander McCall Smith takes a thorough look at the pros and cons of the old communal values found in Botswana's villages compared to the new morality of the urbanizing young in that country. In the process, Mr. Smith makes a powerful case for grafting onto the old values an appreciation for ingenuity, education, effort, organization and courage while dismissing most of the new morality as misinformed at best, and harmful at worst. In so doing, he eloquently describes the potential benefits of a matriarchic society led by determined, talented women who break down traditional boundaries that limit both men and women.As the story opens, Precious realizes that her concept of helping all those who need her help, regardless of ability to pay, is going to leave the detective agency in perpetual financial trouble. Having agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, who runs a prosperous car repair business, Precious looks at ways to reduce her costs by sharing their resources. Her conclusion: She should move the detective agency to the garage, share Mma Makutsi's time and salary with the garage, and rent out the building she has been using for the agency. All seems to be off to a good start when Mr Matekoni begins acting strangely. With her burgeoning responsibilities and plans, Precious has just too much to do. So she delegates as many items on her &quot;to do&quot; list as possible to others, and gets going on what only she can do. It's like reading a lesson in time management.During the course of the story, you will meet another unusual youngster who ends up at the orphanage. Precious is caught up in a case of potential poisoning at the behest of a powerful government official who is also a wealthy and well-connected tribal member. Although Precious doesn't want to take on the case, the official and Mma Makutsi bully her into it. While she's away on the case, Mma Makutsi proves to have even more talents than anyone could have expected from either her degree or her experience. In the process, she brings in a major case which she solves on her own involving four potential beauty contest winners.In the first half of the book, the distress that Precious and Mr J.L.B. Matekoni are experiencing is so palpable that I found myself feeling more and more upset as I read the story. Seldom does &quot;light&quot; fiction affect me that way. I can only ascribe the intensity of my reactions to the quality of the writing and the exceptional care with which the characters have been developed into people for whom anyone would feel great sympathy and empathy. The book ends up leaving some mysteries unsolved, and I found myself wishing that I had a copy of the next book with me so that I could read what happened right away.As I finished the story, I found myself wondering more about Botswana and why people love it there so much. I recently began working with a businessman in Botswana, and he has promised to help me understand more about that intriguing country. I look forward to being his student in this, as I have enjoyed being a reader of these fine novels."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Precious Ramotswe turned a legacy from cattle-breeding into a novel enterprise. She runs the only Ladies-run detective agency in Botswana. The business, however, struggles for survival as she's more helpful than profit-minded. Her secretary, Mma Makutsi, proves unexpectedly astute in helping to solve the crisis. She receives a promotion. In fact, she garners two promotions as Mma Ramotswe's fiance, Mr. J.L.B. Matekone, develops mental problems.Mma Makutsi achieves a greater level of exposure in this third volume of McCall Smith's series. The attention seems well deserved. She branches out in unexpected ways and proves both caring and efficient. These aren't traits common in management - at least in this reviewer's experience. But Botswana is a different place, as Mma Ramotswe continually reminds us. Even &quot;knocking&quot; on the door of the house you're visiting is different from what we're used to. Tradition is strong in Botswana, but the modern, Western world makes intrusions. McCall Smith, through Mma Ramostswe and others, notes these clashes with style and wit. His discussion of studies of the &quot;criminal type&quot; raises an old spectre - but is it a grim one?Men in general come in for a thorough drubbing in this volume. The young men are indolent and unreliable, spending too much thought on young women. Older men are arrogant and unreliable, spending to much time taking up with young women. Even Mr J.L.B. Matekone emerges with an unresolved shadow in his past. A grudging respect is granted to, of all people, a man running beauty contests. Women bear the burdens of responsibility and labour with little recognition of their worth. It all reads a bit like Gloria Steinem in her more turbulent days. One can only hope that this series will redress some of this condemnation in a later volume.[stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I think I've enjoyed this the best of the first three No. 1 LDA books. It's the continuing developments of the characters from the earlier books, Precious Ramotswe, Mr J. L. B. Maketoni and the secretary Mma Makutsi. In this book we hear rather less from J. L. B. and so does everyone as he comes down with severe depression and suddenly needs a great deal more looking after than Precious can easily deliver. But while he recedes somewhat into the background, Mma Makutsi is more prominent. Having already been promoted in \\"Tears of the Giraffe\\" to Assistant Detective she now also becomes Assistant Manager of J. L. B.'s car mechanic's company. And when he is removed from the scene by illness there is really no \\"assistant\\" about it. She is, it turns out, rather good at it, better really than she is at being a detective where her enthusiastic belief in phrenology gives her no advantages. With the only other strong and admirable major character being Mma Potokwani of the orphan farm, this gives the story a somewhat feminist feel, conveying as it does a world of powerful women and rather ineffectual men: the damaged J. L. B. Maketoni, the foolish and arrogant Government Man who brings Precious the case that provides the centre of the story, and J. L. B.'s idle and feckless apprentices who grow somewhat less idle and feckless under the iron rule of Mma Makutsi who they both fear and flirt with. The brilliantly conceived character of Precious continues to be the splendid centrepoint.The central mystery is rather more interesting than in \\"Giraffe\\": a domestic drama that Precious clears up by exerting an uncommon measure of common sense in a way that reminded me a bit of some of the Father Brown stories. A second detective storyline, about the potential beauty queens whose morals Mma Makutsi is invited to look into in Precious' absence, is the main source of the novel's finely judged humour.Morality is the persistent theme of the book and there are passages where it is subtly apparent that it is the work of a medical law professor who has to read a lot of fat moral philosophy books for his day job. Sometimes the effect is a trifle gauche. The short conversation on moral weakness, knowing what is right to do but not doing it, between Precious and Mr Pilai on p. 119, is perhaps a faintly clumsy intrusion from Moral Philosophy 100. But the single paragraph on pp. 76-77 that delivers Precious' simple but devastating critique of existentialism makes the book worth reading by itself: \\"You did not need to go to France to meet existentialists, she reflected; there were many existentialists right here in Botswana... She had been married to an existentialist herself, without even knowing it... It was very existentialist, perhaps, to go out to bars every night while your pregnant wife stayed at home, and even more existentialist to go off with girls - young existentialist girls - you met in bars...\\" Brilliant stuff."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"While still a sweet diversion, this book did not quite have the charm of the first two books in this series"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Oh, dear! I'm nearing the end of the series!!! Mr. McCall, please write another one quick! Mma Romatswe has become a friend I don't want to lose! This is the best series since Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys! Fit for all ages of readers 14-100! Oh, if we were all like Mma ... what a wonderful world it would be!"},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"Is there anyone who does not find the character of Precious Ramotswe charming? This traditionally built (fat) African lady detective takes a back seat to her homely assistant detective, Mme. Makutsi, in this installment of the series. Nevertheless, we are favored with the wise one liners of these patient busybodies. Mme Makutsi with her oversized glasses and her too dark skin shines. The detective agency is charged with the task of finding a young woman whose integrity matches her beauty among contestants in a beauty pagent. To the reviewer who wrote that too many story lines are left dangling, I recommend reading the next installment. I have not read these in the proper order, but I loved them all. If you can read these in the proper order, I recommend it. I can't wait for the next one as this completes my read of all the outstanding installments."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"I just love the series of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency. What has always impressed me about these books is how no person is simply a one-dimensional character. Maids, cooks, Important Government Men, fiancees, children and garage apprentices all have complex motives and emotions. How human."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"This series of books has been a favorite of mine since they were first published, long may they continue.In this the third in the series of books about the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency we are drawn into several little mysteries, some more serious than others, like the important man who thinks his brother's wife is poisoning his family, the man who wants to make sure that all the girls in a beauty pageant he is holding have good morals and are not \\"bad girls\\".Also there is the worrying mystery about Mr Matekoni's strange illness, is he sickening for something or does he have a strange illness called depression and if he does have depression, how can it be treated? And who is the strange little boy in the Orphan camp who can't speak, only growls and why do people think there are lions about when lions are only found in the Kalahari?Add to this a smart secretary from the Botswana Secretarial school with a passion for shoes who got 97% in her exams, along with a plethora of delightful and understated characters, including the enigmatic and shrewd Mma Precious Ramotswe who knows what makes the human mind tick, and you have yet another wonderful book from the Master author Alexander McCall Smith."},{"Title":"Morality For Beautiful Girls: More from the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency","review":"The British Edition of the third book in the Precious Ramotswe No 1 Ladies Detective seriesI absolutely adore this series and I have no idea why I didn't discover them earlier. Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful appreciation of language, idiosycracies of character and a sympathetic eye for nuance of language and manners which make this book (and this series) one of the best reads I have had. A series which I will continue to read over and overIn this, the third book of the series of Precious Rambotswe and the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, she is given some problems which only she can solve. Her fiance Mr J B L Matekoni has lost interest in his business, the Tlekwoni Rd Speedy Motors, and the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency is not doing as well as it might, putting the assistant detective, Mma Makutsi's latest promotion in danger. Mma Makutsi scored 97% in the final exam at the Botswana Secretarial college but does not wish to return to being simply a secretary. There are not enough secretarial jobs around especially for a secretary who is not pretty.Precious is asked by a Government man to investigate his sister in law who he believes is poisoning his brother. She must also investigate the strange case of the boy who may think he is a lion and is now residing at the Orphan Farm. So Precious sets off for the Government mans farm to investigate (under cover) leaving the No. Ladies detective agency and the Tlekowni Rd Speedy Motors in the capable management of Mma Matuksi. Righly so for after she leaves Mma Matuksi receives a visit from the manager of the the Beauty and Integrity pageant. He wants to make sure the winner of this years contest is worthwhile, and not a bad woman like last years one who was arrested for prostitution and brought the Beauty and Integrity paegeant into disrepect - especially with the sponsors.Alexander McCall Smith writes of his characters with real affection. Everything is worked out and it is all very small stuff - just as you would expect a detection agency would in a small town. The characters are steeped with the morals and manner (and language) of their place in society - that is of a traditional Botswanan society fighting the onslsught of modern manners.There are genuinely hilarious moments, but mostly it is the gentle and sweet. I adore these, there are no car chases, or dramatic finales, they are simple tales, told with simple affection."},{"Title":"Music of the Spheres: The Material Universe from Atom to Quasar, Simply Explained","review":"Unequalled for friendliness of tone and accessibility, a personable survey of the microscopic and macroscopic phenomena of the universe. Some of the science is slightly out of date (it was written in 1967) but if you want a thought-provoking introduction to the current views of the physical universe, this is it. I read my copy over and over, and it always gives me new insights in the way Murchie combines ideas that have not been combined before. With excellent illustrations by the author, and the author's own index, which is a deep work of art in itself."},{"Title":"The Illusions of Postmodernism","review":"With his elaborate language T E is amazingly shallow, when it comes to critizing postmodernist thought. When postmodernists say that humans cannot and will never understand a system from within that system itself E replies that &quot;a certain capcity for critical self-reflection belongs to the way the human animal belongs to its world&quot;. Shamelessly E makes a law of what he has to prove! Rationalism, universalism (which E stands for) are bankrupt. Relativism and postmodernism are also bankrupt, but E doesn't understand how (that one mirrors the other). And he doesn't realize that there is a third alternative: there is a truth but no interpreters. This third alternative merges authority with non-authority and deletes both rationalism and relativism.Gunnar OdhnerSwedish author and philosopher"}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},L={key:1};function D(s,o,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",S,[(e(!0),t(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",L,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const N=d(C,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-e11823f9"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/6.md","filePath":"people/6.md"}'),j={name:"people/6.md"},q=Object.assign(j,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(N)]))}});export{E as __pageData,q as default};
