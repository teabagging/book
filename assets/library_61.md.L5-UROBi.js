A lovely, light read, TRAVELING BUG will definitely feed the need of romance and tropical heat.Jeff Banning left his father's computer business two years ago to become a tour guide. While he had loved programming, he resented his father's remarriage to a much younger woman so quickly after his mother's death from cancer. But when owner Vince Banning becomes certain that someone is stealing software through the company web site, only Jeff is in the position to stop the crime before the company is driven out of business.Jeff uses his position of tour guide and family influence to land a transfer to Minneapolis where can accompany Banning employees on their upcoming cruise. What he didn't know was that he stole Diane Foreman's chance at promotion and fulfillment of her dreams.Diane has long dreamed of accompanying the tours she schedules. Certain she has at last earned her promotion, she was deeply resentful to learn that some rich playboy had landed her much coveted position. Worse, when Jeff shows up at the office, she finds herself making foolish mistakes because he makes concentration so difficult. But, when Jeff invites her to help as tour guide for the Banning Corporation, she quickly agrees.The resulting sultry nights in Mexico certainly build a beautiful backdrop for romance. But what's a girl to think when one moment the man is kissing her, and the next working intensely with another woman; one who's obviously sexy, available, and interested. As the tropical nights heat up, Diane finds herself succumbing to the tropical heat. Yet for every moment of pleasure, there seems to be another of mystery, as she can't quite unravel the connections that Jeff holds to his father, the sexy secretary, and the secrets he's obviously keeping.A light hearted tropical romp in the sun, TRAVELING BUG definitely warms the imagination with its tropical delights. Lovers of light romance will find this traveling adventure quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Traveling Bug","review":"I found this book to be much longer than necessary, extremely boring and amateurish. The author did nothing to develop the characters and portrayed them as shallow, petty, stupid, jealous people who were, for the most part, unlikeable.The story line was imbued with inaccuracies where both computer technology and the travel industry were concerned, and these inaccuracies highlight the authors obvious lack of research. I almost begged for Diane and Jeff to simply \\"get on with it\\" as the supposed romantic portion of this lame storyline dragged on and on. If the overuse of adverbs is your thing, then this book is definitely for you, but in reality I was almost driven crazy by them. I gave this one a single star simply because you can't give a no star rating. Don't waste your time on it."},{"Title":"Traveling Bug","review":"There are probably many subjects that the author of this book knows and understands, but the worlds of computers and tourism seem far outside her areas of expertise. The computer plot barely shows up every now and then, and there is no comprehension of what a tour operator does or how they do it.Our heroine works for a travel agency/tour operator (I've owned and operated both) and when she finally achieves her goal of being a tour escort, she asks what she has to do! I guess she didn't learn much on the job, but that's understandable, since nobody seems to know what they are doing, or how it should be done. I suppose those who have no knowledge of the travel business might not be bothered by this, but when I read a book, I expect the author to have a minimum understanding of the industry that is central to the book. It's called research.And the romance ..... I actually laughed out loud at one of the descriptions of love-making.I gave this two stars because it is readable, but I would not recommend it, nor would I read any other books by this author."},{"Title":"Traveling Bug","review":"I don't undertand the poor reviews; guess they want perfection! I really liked this one. Being from Minnesota was icing on the cake. The author is a Minnesotan and writes about Minnesota locations. My advice to all the nay-sayers: LIGHTEN UP!!"},{"Title":"Traveling Bug","review":"Like the previous reviewers stated, the author clearly has little, or no, knowledge of technology or the travel industry. But, perhaps some readers can ignore that, or have little knowledge themselves. Then that might not bother you.However, the characters are awful. Perhaps it is the shallow way the author wrote them (there's no depth to these people, you never really get to know them, or care about what happens to them.) but Diane and Jeff are completely obnoxious characters. She is happily single, and BAM! Hot guy and she wants to get married and have kids. But she's fighting it! Or...he's ignoring her. Or flirting with another woman. Or frolicking in a pool in Mexico with a half-naked ex-coworker, then making out with Diane? Yeah...what the heck is going on there? And then at the end after they have this amazing make-out session (not amazingly written, but supposedly the characters got hot), the next day Jeff is telling Diane that she has a heart surrounded by ice, and that she needs to thaw out. Um...what?It almost seemed like the author forgot who her characters were. As a matter of fact, if I'm not mistaken, the author changed a character's name midway through the book. Boss Alice became Boss Anne. (I was never sure who Anne was, but they seem to be the same character, if I'm wrong, I'll definitely take this section out.)I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't recommend anyone read it. Perhaps a lot of editing and fact checking and research could make this better, but as is--it's one to skip."},{"Title":"Traveling Bug","review":"This story had possibilities, but when you see the glaring errors regarding computers, software, online bulletin boards and viruses - it completely destroys any credibility in the tale. And as mentioned by another reviewer, the tech part of the story seemed to be just stuck in there and went nowhere. I am not familiar with the travel industry, but even I could tell that the characters were not true to life regarding what would be expected of an actual tour agent; from the little I have seen of that job, there is no way that a person doing that job would have all the free time the author wrote into the story.It was bad enough that I removed it from my Kindle, and I won't be reading any more of this author's work."},{"Title":"The Greater Key of Solomon: Including a Clear and Precise Exposition of King Solomon's Secret Procedure, Its Mysteries and Magic Rites, Original Plates, Seals, Charms and Talismans","review":"I have the old version of the book, 1900, I'm quite sure I will love the more modern version as I am a history buff."},{"Title":"The Time of Music: New Meanings, New Temporalities, New Listening Strategies","review":"In my experience, music theory texts are sometimes interesting, usually boring, sometimes admirable, rarely exciting, and never inspiring. Maybe I haven't read enough theory texts. But this one is scholarship bordering on art. It expands your mind, asks you to think differently, maybe even to use a part of your brain you have never thought would apply to Western Classical music. And it's very well written, without gumming your eyes up with a lot of unnecessary theoretical jargon.This is one of the few theory books that I can say was a pleasure to read, in fact it was a treasure to unearth it and think about it and then attempt to apply it to works that I am familiar with. It definitely changed the way that I perceive music."},{"Title":"The Time of Music: New Meanings, New Temporalities, New Listening Strategies","review":"...in 1988 for a book like Jonathan D. Kramer's \\"The Time of Music\\" to appear because it was with this comprehensive piece of work that music started to cease being considered, in an almost exhaustive manner, \\"the art of sounds\\", as musicians themselves were indirectly encouraged to realise that time and not sound is the only ontological dimension of music. Kramer has a peculiar gift of revealing the \\"beyonds\\" of musical time perception and in so doing he actually teaches the reader how to look after the relevant aspects of music listening: Beethoven, Sc&ouml;nberg and Stravinski (to whom the author dedicates three separate \\"analytic interludes\\") thus become \\"new\\" composers to whoever reads Kramer's writings. In so doing, he is not only commenting on the temporal aspects of a few compositions, as J. D. Kramer, while depicting temporality, by no means foregoes pitch. In his analysis, sound is always a bearer of temporal significance. It illuminates the qualities of musical time and offers consistency to the Kramerian \\"jargon\\" which includes terms such as \\"linearity\\" and \\"nonlinearity\\", \\"vertical\\", \\"moment\\" or \\"multidirectional\\" time etc. Perhaps the best thing about this book is the way Kramer avoids proposing a \\"musical language\\". What he actually does is to create a general, yet solid theoretic and aesthetic framework into which musicians are supposed to fell free to explore the qualities of musical time both in listening, instrumental performance and musical composition. I have come across \\"The Time of Music\\" in 1995, a year after I had published a book of my own dedicated to music temporal phenomena. I was thus amazed to see that there was no apparent clash between my discoveries and Kramer's theoretic work: he only gave me a larger perspective and a better motivation to continue the search for meaning in this elusive dimension that we call (musical) time."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Orange County","review":"The first Robert Stone books I purchased were hiking guides to Yellowstone National Park and the Beartooth Mountains. Both were nice introductions to an area I had spent relatively little time in as an adult. But like many fans of Montana's Big Sky country, Stone eventually discovered the bitter truth, namely that it is cold as heck during the winter there. He now spends winters in California and subsidizes his stay by writing hiking guides to the West Coast. Not a bad lifestyle.That said, I hesitated to buy this book since Jerry Schad has done such a wonderful job covering this region that I was afraid I would not find much new material. I could not have been more wrong. This book offers detailed descriptions and trail maps of 108 hikes in and around Orange County, including many along the coast. Palos Verdes, Crystal Cove, and Chino Hills State Park receive much of the coverage of course, but readers will also find routes in out of the way places like little Oak Canyon and the El Dorado Nature Center in Long Beach. Readers will also find many hikes within the boundaries of the Cleveland National Forest.Most of the hikes in this book are between 1-3 miles in length. A few exceed 7 miles and a couple have options that would give hikers a 10 mile trek. For the most part however, all the hikes in this guide are accessable to most reasonably fit walkers. I've enjoyed all 30 of the hikes I've done in this guide and look forward to doing several more when I get a spring break in April. This book is a winner for all Southern California Walkers."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Orange County","review":"I prefer 101 Hikes in Southern California Gary Schad to this one. Origanally I had gotten this one because while I had hiking books about Southern California, I had only a few that were about the local area of Orange County. Honestly, I was very excited to see new places to hike around here, but I was quite disappointed. There are many hikes here in OC that are left out, and only limited references to the many hikes in our various local regional parks. There are no pitures, which I was a little bummed about. It helps for picturing where you are going, and the maps are not defining enough for the pages they take up.While the book does cover a few interesting places, it covers no more than most other books about hiking in the area that cover all of Southern California."},{"Title":"Day Hikes Around Orange County","review":"1 to 10 mi. hikes, easily accessable to all.

Other than that, it's not much. Very brief hiking directions, not much info about what you're seeing, dry writing. No photos and that's a loss. I get excited about hikes by seeing what they look like. A number of hikes that are more neighborhood walks than a hike. The author might have been better off choosing fewer hikes but making them good ones, and using the extra space for photos and better descriptions."},{"Title":"The Shy Stegosaurus","review":"I read this as a child and have the fondest memories of escaping into the wonderful world of Cricket Creek. Many books have come and gone in my collection since then, but this one will always remain. Lampman's characters guided me through fanciful adventures with a dinosaur friend that too many other books cast in the role of the villian.

Oftentimes his book is the best reference to questions which on the surface seem impossible to answer (supposed mysteries with which we must use faith).

I found it to be very comprehensive, addressing all but the most esoteric and sensationalist anti-Mormon questions. It's certainly appropriate for the sincere investigator.

After thousands of hours of study I find that I much prefer deciding for myself where my heart lies, and it is works such as this book that bring new insight, thinking, contemplation and eventual knowledge into my own understanding as to what I feel the scriptures really mean to me. This book will give new insights into interpretations of scriptures from whatever background you come from. By knowing what the critics are saying and their common attacks and also becoming more knowlegeable with traditional Christian thinking, a follower of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints will gain knowledge of their fellow brethren that will possibly help them come closer in communication and understanding. Through reading this book traditional Christians may begin to see why the many tactics used toward their fellow Latter-Day Saint brethren don't really have much impact in conversion but will always really be directed toward their own congregations trying to get them not to look or think for themselves, and that by gaining a knowledge of why the effect is nill may bring knew insight into developing relationships with their fellow brethren that are meaningful and very productive. Either way, both sides have knowledge to gain by understanding the truth about the issues.

Since extensive time and gospel libraries are not available to many members and missionaries, it is my hope that I can pull together answers to many questions in one resource aid... It is hoped that this book will answer many of the common difficult questions about the restored gospel.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"Truth cannot be self-contradictory, so any group of churches which disagrees on points of doctrine cannot logically claim to have unflawed doctrine. Pure truth can only be found in Christ's church...\\" (Pg. 19)\\"Indeed, Jesus prophesied correctly, for the gates of hell did not prevail against those built upon Christ and his revelation to the prophets. Rather, the church fell into general apostasy when members began to rely on the philosophies of men, setting aside prophecy and Christ himself. The many firm believers in Christ, those who were 'called out,' died firm and untainted by the apostasy.\\" (Pg. 28-29)\\"Were Abraham, Jacob, Moses, Nathan, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jonah, and Jesus false prophets? If we use Deuteronomy 18:20-22 as an absolute rule and believe the Bible to be inerrant, we might be led to this conclusion.\\" (Pg. 42)\\"The assumption (of anti-Mormons) is that because God is an unchanging being, his requirements and commandments never change. Yet, many examples of change may be found throughout the Bible and especially the New Testament.\\" (Pg. 66)\\"Yet (evangelicals) sometimes attempt to play word games, asserting that Latter-day Saints are 'polytheistic' in their worship of these same three beings. It is hypocritical to call Protestants monothesists, and Latter-day Saints, Polytheists since we worship the 'Godhead' in the same manner they worship the trinity.\\" (Pg. 81)\\"None of the above sources state that God 'had sexual relations with Mary' as some critics contend, seeking to extract 'shock value' from their statements... While we do believe that Christ is the 'only begotten Son' of God in the flesh... the author is unaware of any speculation by LDS leaders as to how this was accomplished. In this day of test-tube babies and artificial insemination, various possibilities as to how the virgin Mary conceived can be considered.\\" (Pg. 97-98)\\"It is important to note that the word 'grace,' according to all four gospel writers, was never used by Jesus Christ. One would think that if grace alone were sufficient to salvation and exaltation, Christ would have taught this important truth himself.\\" (Pg. 137)\\"Salvation is not received solely as a result of a confession of faith, but follows a life of faith accompanied by works.\\" (Pg. 145)\\"To the above list we can add missing prophecies which include: Matthew's reference to a prophecy that Christ would be a Nazarene (Matt 2:23...), a prophecy that Elias 'shall first come, and restore all things' (Matt 17:10-13), and a prophecy by Jeremiah concerning the 30 pieces of silver (Matt 27:9).

First, its attempt to answer questions asked by Christians of the LDS religion are often simplistic and inaccurate. The author does a good job dancing around the major issues and majoring on the minors. Having studied the LDS religion from an evangelical Christian perspective, I was impressed by very few of his attempted answers.I'm sure the Latter-day Saint who is looking for faith-promoting material will appreciate this work, yet I found little information that would get me to cease asking the very questions he poses because he really didn't answer them. I must say one positive thing, however. The author does understand many of the concerns the Christian apologist has about his religion, and we are certainly free to disagree with one another. But his insistence that Mormonism is synonymous with Christianity is definitely flawed. Perhaps both sides ought to be considered.

Snapping it out of its box, I set to work for the next two hours to uncover its mysteries and delights. This is indeed a fresh look at the Italian dessert to those of us used to restaurant standard and same ol' same ol' at home. Highly developed around the various fruits of the region, these recipes are fresh, unhackneyed looks at what can be done with dessert from an Italian point of view. Ranging from Apple and Calvados Sorbet to Whole Wheat Plum Tart, the reader is quickly transported to that most magical of all cooking worlds, the dessert. The recipes are workable, not hard, but sometimes a little searching is necessary for some of the ingredients especially if you live outside a major city in the United States. But for the most part the book works with food materials that are readily available here. We all need to be challenged out of our cooking ruts and this book does that. I especially enjoyed the Muscovite Gelato. Mine didn't quite look as beautful as the picture in the book but close enough. If you are feeling the need for a little freshness in your menu, and what with the fruit crops arriving now, plunge into something different. What can it hurt? Try it you'll like it as someone wise once said.

The title in this case was chosen partly because _Three Witnesses_ isn't a novel, but a short story collection, so that _Royal Flush_ does indeed consist of 5 individual stories. (There isn't any other obvious connection with cards or other royalty in the stories herein, however.)As with most Wolfe omnibuses (omnibi?) to date, the titles selected for _Royal Flush_ are an odd assortment, without being connected by theme or even consecutive publication order, and the omnibus provides no added value that individual copies of the books wouldn't supply. For more detailed discussion of the individual works making up _Royal Flush_, see their separate reviews._Fer de Lance_ (1934) was the first Wolfe story. For those unfamiliar with it who may be hoping to see Wolfe's first meeting with Archie or one of the other recurring players, I'm sorry to disappoint you: the characters have some rough edges, but nothing marks this book as the beginning of an era. (Inspector Cramer changed over time, of course; he was initially fairly cordial, even as late as the opening of _The Rubber Band_, but after some of Wolfe's more embarrassing charades, their relationship went downhill at an alarming rate.) As with the other very early Wolfe books, _Fer de Lance_ inflicts more drama on the denizens of the brownstone than some later works; the title is drawn from an incident involving a snake of that species planted in Wolfe's desk. :)_Murder by the Book_ (1951), the 19th Wolfe book, is unusual in that Inspector Cramer, of all people, opens the story by calling on Wolfe to ask for help. (Archie makes appropriate noises, of course.) Leonard Dykes, a law clerk with no life, was fished out of the river on New Year's Day, and the only anomaly that *might* provide a lead on his murder is a list of names found in his apartment - names of men who don't appear to exist. Wolfe has no suggestion to offer, and that would have been the end of it, except that a client seeking to catch the hit-and-run driver who killed his only daughter - in the Bronx rather than Cramer's Manhattan precinct - provides a letter containing one of those names a few weeks later. This story is unusually strong on character development for Stout, particularly concerning the families of the victims._Three Witnesses_, the 26th Wolfe book, collects 3 short stories that previously appeared in magazines.\\"The Next Witness\\" (1954), a.k.a. \\"The Last Witness\\" subjects Wolfe to one of the perils of his profession - not to life and limb, but to a subpoena. He usually tries to arrange matters so that Archie, not he, testifies in court, but this defendant never even achieved clienthood, so Wolfe had no control over the case. But after hearing testimony in the trial of Leonard Ashe for the murder of his wife, Wolfe becomes convinced of his innocence, and rather than awaiting his turn as the next witness, Wolfe leaves court to concoct an alternative to helping convict an innocent man. Very enjoyable, not least because Archie more than half suspects that the *real* issue was the heavily perfumed woman sitting next to Wolfe in the crowded courtroom.)\\"When a Man Murders...\\" (1954) The title parodies the rhyme, \\"When a man marries, his trouble begins.\\" This case is a rare exception (in fact, the *only* one I can recall) in which Wolfe completely breaks the rule about refusing divorce cases. After Sydney Karnow was reported missing-believed-killed in Korea 3 years ago, his wife Caroline inherited half his estate, his sponging relatives the other half. Caroline remarried a year after his \\"death\\" - and *now* Sydney has come back alive. But for how long?\\"Die Like a Dog\\" (1955), a.k.a. \\"Body in the Hall\\", \\"A Dog in the Daytime\\" begins with a black Labrador following Archie home. Archie, finding that the dog's collar is engraved with a kennel-club name including \\"Nero\\", can't resist the temptation to yank Wolfe's chain a little. But his joke backfires in a completely unexpected manner - not only with the genius' - and Fritz' - reaction to a dog, but with the news that the four-legged Nero may be a witness in a murder investigation."},{"Title":"Understanding Boat Design","review":"This book certainly must be part of any boat design collection. Brewer covers all aspects of deisgn from hull to deck to power to storage space. It serves as a complete introductory resource covering the important aspects of each topic without burdenning the reader with details that the designers and builders must understand.However, as an introductory book, it is missing some friendliness for the beginner. Brewer could improve on the technical definitions early in the book; in particular the description of prismatic coefficient left me seaching the web for a clearer definition. Brewer uses plan drawings to introduce hull shapes, but not teach the novice how to read such a drawing. Finally, some of Brewer's own designs are displayed; however, they lack detailed drawings and their minimal descriptions do not explain to the reader why the design was chosen or what tradeoffs were made, which would be particularly educational. Instead it just appears as a catalog of some plans Brewer hopes a reader might purchase.All in all, I highly recommend this book, but hope the the next addition improves on this already valuable text."},{"Title":"Understanding Boat Design","review":"I've have studied a fair number of books about design. This was the first I read and it's a good thing because it's not too hard to follow but it is definitely informative. It helps to understand design terminology and how a boat will perform based on its characteristics. I think I would have been frustrated had I begun somewhere else (such as Chapelle).The focus is fairly broad. The designs are those most often seen on the water during the last 50 years (no brigatines, viking ships, or submarines). They are both power and sail, and both displacement and planing hulls. The size mostly seems to be boats of the \\"yacht\\" size (20 to 100 feet). Topics covered include styles of hull shape, line drawings, keels and rudders, layout, safety, construction materials.This book will help you understand WHAT characteristics of a boat affect performance (and I don't just mean speed, because there is much more to it) and HOW they affect performance.After reading and understanding this book, you will be able to better determine what to expect from a boat by just standing next to it and sizing it up. You will also figure out a few of the goofy things production companies do these days because they are focused on making boats that will be easy to sell, and not focused enough on making a boat that sails well. Make sense? Many modern designs have goofy characteristics that make a boat look good on paper and in an advertisement, but detract from performance, seaworthiness, reliability, and practicality when out on the water.Bottom line: This book includes what I believe it should based on the title and the fact that it is ~150 pages long. It is very useful to someone want to own a boat, or get into boat design."},{"Title":"Understanding Boat Design","review":"This a great book if you are just starting to ponder the mysteries of boat design and its modern, which makes it better for beginners than Chapelle's books. IF, however, you are looking for more scientific/engineering sort of information, then you will be disappointed. Bottom line- it provides a wide survery of yacht designs, but does not delve into specifics enough for those of use who already know the basics. I would recommend it to anyone starting out in the field, but it is less technical than, say, Skene's Elements of Yacht Design."},{"Title":"Understanding Boat Design","review":"Understanding Boat Design supplies basic introduction to yacht design.

I expected a well thought out, easy to understand description. The author starts out defining some terms, but omits others, and then describes things using undefined terms. By his initial definitions, one thinks &quot;Good, this author doesn't assume I understand all the terms he will be using.&quot; Yet in the rest of the text he clearly considers that the reader knows a fair amount about boats and the terms used to describe them. Some drawings are missing important labels, and some explainations referring to drawings are missing important details, with a result that one is sometimes left perplexed. The book struck me as a quick gloss over of boat design with too much detail for someone in need of the grand overview. I don't think it had detail for someone actually interested in learning more about boat design. Someone interested in the quick basics would do better with other general sailing texts where simple principles of boat design are covered. Not sure what a better, more detailed text would be."},{"Title":"Understanding Boat Design","review":"This book is fantastic for the curious.

It is a book not just for fathers. It would be a mistake to give it to a father and say,&quot;Here, this is what you must do.&quot; It is a book to be read and experienced together by parents willing to create a partnership in raising their children. The book covers concerns from before the baby's birth through young adulthood. It offers a wealth of anecdotes and practical suggestions to help parents nurture and guide their children while maintaining a balanced parenting relationship. I wish I had this book before my first child was born, but, it is not simply another &quot;newborn parent&quot; offering. If I had received this book at any stage of my children's development, I would have found it insightful and helpful. I plan to send it to son, daughters, nieces, and nephews.

However, there is somewhat more of a smug/judgmental tone to this one, a tone I'm not entirely sure I feel comfortable with.Part of Amy Dacyzyn's charm is that she laughs at herself throughout her books. The authors here don't do that, which is unfortunate. They also seem much more interested in comparing the &quot;American&quot; lifestyle with the way people live in other countries. While this is a valid point, it has the potential to alienate readers who are newer to the voluntary simplicity concept.They also do not seem to feel that smaller efforts towards lifestyle change are as worthwhile, which upsets me. Those who are just beginning to look at the way they live are not likely to be comfortable with a book that says, in effect, &quot;In order to survive the future, we should all become vegans and leave our thermostats at 55 degrees all winter.&quot;On the positive side, there are several useful tips and a nice collection of recipes that see frequent use in my own kitchen."},{"Title":"Living Lean Off the Fat of the Land","review":"Most of the tings in the book were good but its hard life to following most of the ideas I did follow them but i didn't like it but if you do follow it you'll have an interesting lifestyle indeed"},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"I started using this book with my daughter when she was ten months old.

This book is an overview (pretty straightforward and intuitive) of various theories of child learning, stuff like \\"it's never too early to learn\\" or \\"learning must be fun\\" (I am quoting these from memory since I immediately returned the book unread). If you are searching beyond the obvious, you will most likely be left pretty dissatisfied. What's more, despite being presented as a serious pseudo-scientific manual the book presents absolutely no data whatsoever to back up assertions like \\"it's never too early to learn\\".I am going to copy-paste this review to this other title, \\"Native Reading: How To Teach Your Child To Read, Easily And Naturally, Before The Age Of Three\\" by Timothy D.

If you are into it, read Encyclopedic knowledge.I also recommend you to take the author's courses, in Philadelphia, but they are a couple of thousand dollars or more. Do it all before your baby is born.I read this book 10 years before my wife got pregnant and it changed my life... and my daughter's (I hope). It changed how I saw child's development. Now she is 3.But don't get too carried away. Believe me, some parents do get carried away. The ones in Philadelphia seem to belong to a sect. Just enjoy your children and add this program to the fun.Although I spend a large amount of money with the course, I really don't do much of the program. Still, I raise my daughter differently from what I would otherwise have done without having read this book. You will not be the same person after you read it.

It is about teaching your baby about life.You will have more respect for your child and will not let your baby grow \\"by accident.\\" Instead, you will be able to actively participate in the learning process and challenge your child to fulfill his or her intellectual potential.

Their method suits for a baby from zero moths old, i.e. from birth. The are three lessons per day, each lesson last fifteen seconds and give such a joy to the baby that she woke me up in the mornings asking me to teach her to read. When she hears my steps when I return from my job, she runs to me to teach her to read. The babies CAN and WANT to learn!The babies are eager to learn, they want desperately to learn everything they can, as quickly as possible, but the adults are often fail to provide for the babies the adequate opportunity of learning.Glenn Doman and Janet Doman offer funny and inexpensive way of teaching the baby to read, math, and encyclopedic knowledge by means of special inventory. For reading, it is cards with big red printed words.A few words from my own experience on producing the inventory: don't even imagine of cutting the cards and printing the words by yourself. Just give a list of words to a nearby company, which prints business cards.I also recommend \\"How to Teach Your Baby to Be Physically Superb\\" by Glenn Doman in addition to this book."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"My mother purchased a copy of this book in 1965 when I was an infant.

It is still amazing, still revolutionary. The concepts,although still debated by many, are among the most unique and original child instructional methods ever devised. It really is possible to teach a baby to read! I have taught children in preschools and kindergarten, using a variety of methods, but I keep coming back to this book. I have also read How to Teach Your Baby Math, How to Teach Your Baby Encyclopedic Knowledge, and How to Teach Your Baby to be Physically Superb. I have also read the profiles of the many children who graduated from the author's school( The Institutes). The part in this book, that grabbed my attention, was when Dr. Doman stated that \\"you can teach a child anything if you present it in an honest, factual way\\". I knew that children were capable of amazing things, but the results I achieved, and the parents talked about in this book, are nothing short of astounding!My favorite thing to teach, though, is encyclopedic knowledge. It is so much fun to hear a child call out 2-3 hundred breeds of dog, or species of bird by sight, and beg you to teach more. The most incredible thing that happened to me was when I was showing paintings of the greats,Leonardo, Picasso,etc., and after a few months, I brought out some new paintings by these artists, that the kids hadn't seen. Without giving any hints or supplying any info. about the paintings, I asked them who they thought painted the unknown masterpieces. They correctly called each artist by his painting! They had developed a sense of each artists' style. The ages of the children ranged from three to four years old. I highly recommend this life-changing book.

I have seen excellent results from parents applying the suggestions in this book to a 3, 4, and 5 year old and look forward to observing a parent use the suggestions with a newborn during the next four months.I am developing a course titled \\"Creating Intelligence\\" and I plan to use some of the information in this book in the course.From page 1 to 102 a definitive analysis shows why babies want to, should, and can learn to read and the problems children face if they can not read well when they get to school.The key information on how to teach your baby is presented, step by step, from pages 102 to 157. The next chapter, pages 158 to 196 is divided into sections outlining specifically how to implement the program for different aged \\"babies\\". Thus it is fairly easy to implement the program regardless of the age of your \\"baby\\"(birth to six).The approach in this book simply works, and works well. The company offers word cards and \\"bits of intelligence\\" cards, both worth the price. Babies and adults learn a lot from the \\"intelligence\\" cards. The \\"intelligence\\" cards are expensive, full color, and simply fantastic - but not required!From the book, and from my own experience, it is clear that anyone not offering their \\"baby\\" the opportunity to read using this system (it is easier on the child than other programs) is certainly depriving the child, themselves and grandparents of a joyous experience.A word of warning. The book suggests you use empty 6\\" high cards to put words on. However, if you have purchased any word cards from the company you will find they use 4\\" cards. The 4\\" cards are a lot easier to use than the 6\\" empty cards they sell. Buy your own 4\\" card stock cards, so they will fit with the 4\\" cards you purchased from the company. If you do not buy any cards from the company use 4\\" cards anyhow, they are easier to work with than 6\\" cards.The company sells a video to go with the book. It is a good video that will help the reader understand the teaching concepts in the book.

I started with 25 words and add 5 new words every day, 1 second per word, 3 times a day. To my surprise, my son absorbed every thing so quickly and after 3 weeks, he started pointing to the right objects so often when I showed him the word!I attended Dr. Doman's \\"How to multiply your baby's intelligence\\" baby brain development course in his \\"The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential\\" in Philadelphia in order to meet those experts and little geniuses in person. The Institute is for both well babies and brain injured babies, which was founded by Doman 50 years ago. It is a non-profit organization. (www.iahp.org)We saw all those 4-6 year-old kids and other 8-12 year-olds in their Institutes could read more than 3 languages, read many big thick books, do Math, science and encyclopedia, gymnastics, swim, play violin in almost professional high level!!! They were taught by their parents who most of them did not have any foreign languages and musical background and etc. Everybody in the class was astonished, thrilled and speechless; many were cried in the very formal graduation ceremony.I started teaching my son reading when he was 9 months old. And the result was amazing. Three weeks later he could point to his name word when I say his name; and point to my bellybutton when I showed him the big word card: bellybutton. However, he lost interest of reading completely in 2 months when he can walk around. I had to stop my teaching for a while and search for methods that can intrigue his interest.When he turned 18 months old, he can accurately name and read every part of the world map puzzle, he can read all other body and organ parts words and flower/tree parts words and other 1,000 words cards. When he is 21 months old, he can read dozens of children books. Now my son is 25 months old, I am starting teaching him the elementary curriculum for 10 to 20 minutes every day.My son is just an ordinary child, if you think he is a GENIUS, then every baby is a GENIUS including your baby, as stated in Doman's theory, because every baby is able to read and do math if you prepare such an environment and opportunity for him to learn. And babies love to learn, it is fun and it is their surviving skill...You do not need a college degree to be able to send your child to college or even Harvard, the love with all your heart to your child makes the real difference when you decide not taking the chance of winning a baby Einstein lottery that might be related to your family Genius Gene. Every hard effort you put to your baby, God knows, and your child knows.Do not waste your baby's precious first 6 genius years!

She learns to read and write English using the Phonics system about 7 yrs old. As we're in Hong kong, we switched her to a local Chinese special school for disabled kids last September so she will learn some Chinese and independent living. The problem is while she can speak and understand Chinese, she can only read a few Chinese words (we thought Chinese was more difficult to learn, so we decided to let her learn English first). The Chinese curriculum was so difficult for her and the words were so difficult because others have spend 9 years learning Chinese.We learned about the Glenn Doman's method by Christmas. I started out slowly 5 words using the 5x8 cards with 3 inch Chinese words on them. It worked. She could read the words before dictation came. She only had to learn towrite them instead of learning reading and writing at the same time. She was so fascinated to read the menu, signs and children's books or newspaper. The words started to talk to her as said in the book. Using the each flash card for about 15 times(as said in the book), she could recognize the word quite well. Sure, needs to do revision. She loves the food category the best. She is so much more confident at school. At the mean time, I read \\"What to do with your brain injured child\\" and \\"How to teach you baby to read\\" ordered from Amazon. The book's theory explained to me how it works.

I poured over this book, and was absolutely astonished to find NO MENTION of reading out loud to your baby as a method for teaching them to love books, and thus desire to learn to read. In fact, the books that the baby learns to 'read' (purchased from Doman, of course) are poor quality, uninteresting and lame!Instead of reading this book, buy something by Troxel about \\"Great Books to Read Aloud\\" and go from there. We dropped this entire method by the time my daughter was a year old, and she learned to read on her own at age 3.5, now at age 7.5 she read the new Harry Potter book in under a week, spells at high school level and is always begging me to go to the library.Shut off the TV, choose some excellent books (Blueberries for Sal, The Maggie B come to mind) and read with enthusiasm to your little one.

He went on to teach himself to write in cursive when he was 3. He learned completely on his own without a suggestion that he try it. My son was and is ADD so his attention span was short. Any child who doesn't learn to read when he or she is 2-3 years old has selfish parents.

You are left to your own devices or they point you towards their catalogue or website for further information (read: buy stuff from us).At this point in time I can not tell you whether or not the methods described in the book work or not but I can tell you if you want to know what the method is, how it came to be and how you can proceed to apply it then yes this book is 100% what is claims to be.It tell you exactly where to begin, what you need, how to set it up and so on and so on.I was very sceptical of this book after reading some of the reviews but now i can not wait to try it.

If you have more than one child or you not a stay at home parent then this is very difficult to do. I lasted about 3 weeks. I did see results, my 3 year old was able to recognize a few words by then, which was motivating to continue. But then the next baby came along and it was very hard to keep it up. I even tried decreasing the number of times per day I did it from 5 to 3, just to keep doing it, but it just faded as the weeks went on."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"As a teacher, this is not teaching but regurgitating .

My major complaint is that the first 6 chapters are dedicated to convincing you that you Can teach your Baby to read. I would not have brought the book if I did not think it was possible, and I certainly do not think that it warrants 6 chapters to tell me that, especially since I already bought the book.

At 8 months she shocked us at a pet store by pointing to the words on the wall that said \\"dogs, cats, birds\\" - she clearly knew what they meant. By 15 months we had a box of words on cards (including big ones like \\"refrigerator\\" and \\"calculator\\")and she would pick out whatever word we asked of her. When she began to speak we showed her the word cards she had learned and she read the words aloud for the first time.She read sentences by the age of 1 and books by the age of 2. By the age of 5 she'd read over 100 books. When we put her in private school they tested her spelling at ever-increasing difficulty to find her grade level. She made no errors.Today she has a 3.78 GPA from UCLA and has been accepted to a top law school.

She would ask (beg) for \\"one more word\\" and loved the games we played as she read her \\"signs\\" as we called them. I cut poster board strips and used a red permanent marker to make them. I then bought begining readers and taught all the words first and then handed her a book she had never seen before that she could read all by herself! By the time she was 3 she was reading any begining book (and the Reader's Digest we kept on the back of the toliet!) She went to school when she was 4 and learned to read upside-down so she could sit in the teacher's big rocking chair and read to the kids while they looked at the pictures right-side-up. I didn't start the other 2 children as early, just because I was a busy mom, but they all read before they went to school and saw the phonics way of learning to read as \\"spelling\\".

The other, 36 years old, majored in English, became a VP of a major company as a securities anlyst and loves reading. Be patient when you start. It took several weeks for them to respond to the first word and several more to differentiate between one word and another - in other words to respond to the word not a card with letters. But then they were off and running. 10 words the first week, 100 the first month. When we moved from 4 X 6 index cards to 3 X 5 index cards, we had to start all over.

However, I quickly got over the excitement when I realized exactly how much work it would entail for me as a parent. The philosophy is sound, I just don't have time to cut up all that poster board and create flashcards nightly. In my parental laziness, I hunted around online and found there are a few programs that offer Doman-Inspired teaching but with none of the bother in making homemade materials. My favorite is the Little Reader software that flashes words Doman-style but also includes pictures, audio, and video. If you like Doman, you'll find this is a much more do-able, modern adaptation.

I just finished this book. All I can say is that I wish I had purchased this book three children ago. I used other methods to teach my older children to read. I got progressively better as a teacher with each child. If only I had this book sooner I would have had a more concise and specific method of teaching that would have been more fun and organic versus the structured and academic way I taught my older children to read. This book has also taught me to have much higher expectations for babies and toddlers. As a seasoned parent I've taught 3 children to read. This is by far the best method that I've seen when it comes to teaching infants, babies and toddlers. I would advise teaching 5 year olds and older phonetically. Sight words work for babies not for Kindergarteners and 1st graders. With this program a baby can be reading by 18-36 months depending on when they start them. A 36 month old reader is a two year literate veteran before entering kindergarten. Teaching a baby phonetically is confusing for a baby. They learn to speak organically and naturally they can learn to read the same way. By the time children enter kindergarten brain receptors that would have made learning to read easy have grown dormant. By age 5 or 6 It is necessary to teach children the sounds that letters make so that they can decode words and read them. The process is completely different for babies. Best of Love to you."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"I used this method to teach both my girls--had them on a 3rd grade+ level when they started to kindergarten.

The girls are lifelong readers! (They are both grown, now--so we're working on teaching the grandkids!)"},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"This book has very good information on infants and children, particulary on development. It comes from a very positive perspective of children, and encourages parental/child bonding through quality time spent together. You will certainly find some useful information that can help a parent, especially a new parent, shape how they ultimately wish to teach their child. Whether or not you decide to use the method in this book, or how closely you wish to adhere to the methods in this book, depends on your personal philosophy about how children learn and how much time and money you wish to spend. This method seems to be very time consuming, mostly in the preparation of the reading cards. Realistically, I won't be following this method. But it has made me more aware of pointing out words and things to my child often and regularly, daily, and I don't feel silly doing so even though he is only 4 months. After all, the whole premise of this method is that if you repeat words to a child often enough, he'll come to know it. Don't most of us parents already know this? So, the theory behind the method is simple. Putting the specific actions of the method is not practical, but doable. The book is informative. I don't regret the purchase of this book, but could have done without it."},{"Title":"How To Teach Your Baby To Read (The Gentle Revolution)","review":"If you love this book (like I did) you will soon discover that it's hard to find more reading books for your little one that use Doman's concepts.

She shares transpersonal aspects of healing that take TT beyond the mechanistic bioenergy model of simply assessing bioenergy fields that reflect physical and psychological problems, and adjusting bioenergy states through healer intent. Yet Krieger firmly grounds the transpersonal in theory and experiential explorations, with a strong focus on teaching in a responsible way.Krieger presents lists of descriptors for various aspects of the TT experience that are helpful in dissecting and analyzing TT, but most of all - in appreciating its multi-faceted, multi-layered potentials for bringing the TT therapist (Krieger uses this term instead of healer) through bioenergy interactions into ever greater awarenesses of the transpersonal dimensions of healing.Discussions of the chakras (major bioenergy centers along the midline of the body) emphasize their transpersonal resonations with the cosmos, in addition to their regulation of localized body functions. Krieger strongly advises that a person should be helped to regulate her own chakras and that these centers should not be treated by the TT therapist. (In this, she differs substantively from practices common to many other healing approaches.)Krieger has several earlier books on TT. This one takes the reader more deeply into the need to focus on the personal and spiritual development of the healer.The reviewer found this book more focused on transpersonal issues than Krieger's earlier ones and warmly recommends it to anyone wanting to learn about Therapeutic Touch."},{"Title":"Therapeutic Touch As Transpersonal Healing","review":"Therapeutic Touch As Transpersonal Healing by Dolores Krieger (who developed Therapeutic Touch in collaboration with Dora Kunz) is a an explanatory presentation of the practice of &quot;Therapeutic Touch&quot;, including its origins, its applications to promote healing, and much, much more.

The better the research design, the less the effect, if any.Krieger's claim that anyone can sense the \\"human energy field,\\" aka chakras, was demonstrated to be groundless by a 9yo school girl who tested TT practitioners to see if they could sense her hand when not looking. This well-designed experiment was published in JAMA. No one, including Krieger, has stepped forward to replicate it.Krieger has made a laughing stock of the nursing profession with her attempts to make nurses the equivalent of faith healers."},{"Title":"Prayer: Manifest a State of Grace","review":"This tape was just what i needed to help me recover from bitter experiences with religion.

Elizabeth, who is the victim in this story which takes place during the 1950's in a place called \\"Rehoboth Road\\", in Georgia;is a very strong-willed, determined individual who has great courage through out a situation that was thrust upon her.Considering the era this book was written you have some very,strong female characters,Elizabeth's mother (Loretta) and Mrs.Collins, who took Elizabeth in after her father, Reverend Turner kicks her out for shaming the family; because after all he is a Minister and he has an image to up hold, even though it is surrounded in his being a coward.A few questions for the book club members were- why did it take 36 years for the Reverend to finally believe his daughter and for the family to finally confront the rapist, Reverend Oliver? And why didn't Reverend Oliver take his family and leave, after he committed this horrendous crime?Considering the era that this book was written, the actions of the community makes sense, but the concept of \\"it takes a village to raise a family\\" did not seem to prevail here, except for Ma Dear (Mrs. Collins) who took Elizabeth and her baby in and cared for them until she died.This is a very well written story, with characters who will make you want to actually shake some sense into them or beat the living day lights out of them for being so hurtful!This story will also leave the reader with a lot of \\"what ifs\\" to keep them turning the pages to the end.We are anxiously awaiting the sequel, to see how the next era, which spans into the 60's will turn out."},{"Title":"Rehoboth Road","review":"This book was amazing!

Imagine how you'd feel if you failed to protect your gift from heaven. In REHOBOTH ROAD, we meet the Turners, the Olivers and MaDear. These unforgettable characters tell a story of lost innocence, familial love, Christianity and that old time caring of a community. This story begins in the 1950's on Rehoboth Road in a rural community just outside Macon, Georgia. And for the next thirty-six years or so, we follow the growth of two families as they deal individually with a secret that works like a cancer as it touches each one of them.Anita Ballard-Jones uses her excellent storytelling abilities to capture the disposition of the African American culture in rural communities during the 50's and 60's. She told a very inspirational and heartrending story. I could not put this one down, as I soaked up the essence of the characters and lived through the pain inflicted because of one man's sin. There were times I cried because of that pain and other times I rejoiced because of the healing that occurred. REHOBOTH ROAD is a stimulating read and I highly recommend it.Reviewed by Brenda M.

From the very beginning, you get to know the characters and whether you want to, or not, it won't take long before you choose sides After the most brutal of attacks an innocent fifteen year old proves to have greater strength and faith , than those the communities around Rohobath Road hold in reverence. I must have though of a hundred Bible quotes and sayings. As you sow, so shall you reap probably is the most fitting. People make choices, in this world, and it often seems that those who do the worst of deeds go unpunished. You will not be able to put the book down until it comes to its explosive conclusion and I strongly recommend Rehobath Road to anyone who likes powerful stories, especially if you feel that life has not been fair to you. I look forward to reading any future books written by Anita Ballard - Jones. ."},{"Title":"Rehoboth Road","review":"Reading this book gave me a colorful view of life and the social norms in the 1950s (and beyond). As one used to reading contemporary romance novels, this book was an excellent diversion.Ballard-Jones has done a wonderful job of encapsulating the chain of events on Rehoboth Road over a period of years. While it was easy reading, it had a powerful and poignant message.I whole-heartedly encourage all readers, regardless of your preferred genre, to read this thought-provoking book and experience it. The vivid portrayal of what fear, denial and lies can do to you, will definitely bring you to your knees!Buy the Book!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Rehoboth Road","review":"Elizabeth Turner, daughter of a prominent Georgia minister wants to win her father's affections and respect again. However, he will not forgive her for the shame she put on the family when she had a child out of wedlock. But it wasn't her fault. Someone very close to him raped her and more importantly, caused her to lose her faith in God.Macon minister, Reverend John Turner refuses to forgive his daughter for shaming the family. To him, she's dead. But when the truth finally comes to light will Elizabeth and his grandson forgive him. Will Elizabeth return to God?Jones should be credited for taking on such an epic and long story. However, it was too long and the ending not fully defined to make this story come full circle. The southern dialogue was short of being offensive, especially for readers who live in Georgia. When she replaced \\"I\\" with \\"ah\\" in every piece of dialogue it slowed down the story's pace. Faith elements spoken in dialogue were too clich&eacute; throughout the novel. Furthermore, Jones told too much of the story instead of allowing her readers to witness the events as they unfold.The novel chronicles the lives of the people living on Rehoboth Road. It is reminiscent to traditional southern literature. Jones writes beautiful scenery, tragic and very flawed characters, but unfortunately, misses the mark. Norma Jarrett's Sweet Magnolia(June 2006) is a better choice for readers who love this literature style."},{"Title":"Rehoboth Road","review":"The Regal Sisterhood Book Club chose \\"Rehoboth Road\\" by Anita Ballard-Jones for our March 2007 club read. Wow what a story! This storyline, spanning over 36 years beginning in 1950, provided hours of discussion material and sparked a few debates. Elizabeth Turner endured the shame and pain of the unimaginable and lived to tell the story of how God can truly work it all out in your favor. Each character of the book showed us how one man's evil act and another man's cowardly act, can shape the lives of those around them, in both good and bad ways. This book holds the old saying true, \\"what Satan means for bad, God will turn around and make it all good\\". The worse thing to happen in Elizabeth's life, proved to give her the best thing she could have ever hoped for. While the story line was wonderful, the ending was absolutely awful! We can't believe the author just left the story \\"hanging\\" the way she did. We were all looking for some type of continuation somewhere in the book. Ms. Jones must have the sequel immediately around the corner! We need to know what happened to Rev. Oliver and Johnny. This book was a page turner and everyone agreed that they could not put it down. You felt as though the characters were a part of your family and you could not put the book down. We felt compelled to \\"read\\" them out of their situations.

I loved each and every character (even the bad guys). The story was well put together and held my attention from start to finish. Each character is very believable and realistic. The story flows nicely, makes a lot of sense, and does not have one boring moment. I was intrigued during the entire length of the book, and put it down only when I was just too tired to read. The story was so fascinating that I truly hated to see it end and I now eagerly await for more from this exciting new author. If you just want a story with a nice flow, interesting plot, and believable as well as likable characters - Rehoboth Road is what I highly recommmend. It is not rocket science or anything complicated - it is just a darn good book.

A. Hodge lays out in wonderful and understandable form a systematic thinking toward God. Each chapter broke down into understandable and easy to comprehend form. From chapter 1 \\"Christian theology; its several branches; and their relation to other departments of human knowledge.\\" To chapter 43 \\"the Lord's supper\\" Mr. Hodge brings theology to life. A must in my opinion for any pastor, teacher or individual who wants to further their knowledge of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. The explanation of Angels and the rise and fall of Satan are well explained."},{"Title":"Outlines of theology","review":"This is THE definitive book on Reformed Presbyterian theology. Hodge is strong not only in what he explains, but also how he explains it. Each section is divided into questions, as if someone was interviewing Hodge. He then answers each question in a very logical, ordered manner, giving the reader a very clear perception of each particular concept. Hodge leaves nothing uncovered, but rather touches on a very wide spectrum of Reformed theology, and every time his argument is succinct and backed with scripture.

I have read several good books that deal either exclusively with OLAP or exclusively with data warehousing. This book touches on all aspects.And FINALLY, some examples and explanations on how to use the advanced aspects of DTS. I have been unable to find this anywhere else.I also liked the fact, that although more detail was neeeded in some areas, it managed to touch on a large amount of all the aspects involved with OLAP and SQL.While at times, it was a little too technical for me, and other times a little too general, this is by far the best book on SQL and OLAP I have come across yet.I highly recommend this book for those who need a fairly complete reference to SQL/OLAP."},{"Title":"Microsoft OLAP Unleashed with CDROM","review":"I have several books on data warehousing and OLAP, most of which I find to be too theoretical and lacking the basic recipes and plans for developing OLAP cubes.

I recommend the purchase of this book to all of my clients since I have read it. If you want to hand just one book to any computer professional who does not know OLAP, this has got to be it. Advanced Analysis Server knowledge will come from time and experience, but all of the fundamentals (DTS, Data Warehousing, Schema Types and implementation, performance issues, .mdx language basics, DSO basics and the use of .mdx in Excel) are all there, easily understandable and will provide a foundation for future growth.

They assume that everybody wants to be an American, and tend to ignore other cultures. OK, part of that is the media, which leaves out a lot. This is not useful. Humility is useful. This book is a fairly nice coverage of an alien culture with very interesting characteristics. It covers Balinese dance, drama, music, and puppetry, and the shadow puppets of this area are very interesting. A performance can last all night, and use more than 15 languages, from Java's history. The puppetmasters memorize all this stuff. I think even a teenager could enjoy this, well a teenager who wasn't into video games, and other such addictions. This one even covers history, how the art forms embody Balinese values, and specific genres, from Gamelan Gong Kibyar, to Wayang shadow puppetry. There is even a listing of useful CDs and books. Nice stuff. The authors clearly love their subject, and it shows.

It is absolutely amazing to find out what people have already gone through to bring a business international.Does your CEO have the audacity to believe that he will not make the same mistakes that others made? Is your marketing team prepared for each and every market? This book teaches you to carefully prepare for each and every market and not take ANYTHING for granted. Do your research, or you will be the punchline of an joke or two at some International Marketing conferences somewhere in the future.Dave Ricks lays out everyone else's blunders in such a way that you wonder if they could have really happened. Although it is sad that these mistakes happened, the message is that without preparation people make big mistakes in international business. These major business mistakes could happen to anybody (who does not know to avoid them.)If you are looking for anectdotes for a business class or international business curriculum, you can save yourself the trouble of research and find out what Mr. Ricks has painstakingly already researched.Although there is no way to find out what to avoid in every market... today's business students should buy this book and read it often so they can recognize when they need help avoiding the pitfals in today's increasingly global business world.As a biingual international manager of an import/export firm I see many of these blunders cropping up everyday. Some companies are better prepared to handle them before they become broadcast over teh whole world. Many Mexican companies I have seen do not know their translation takes on a funny twist in English. But if I told them would they believe me?... I hope reading this book will make me realize I need help myself sometimes too.Dave Ricks is a respected faculty member at Thunderbird, one of the world's most innovative International Business Master's Programs."},{"Title":"Blunders in International Business (Blackwell Business)","review":"In just the first half of the book, I found 5 urban legends being presented as fact (e.g., that ancient thing about \\"bite the wax tadpole\\", the one about Africans thinking that baby pictures on baby food meant the food was made of babies).Granted, the latest update was in 1999, but the facts should have been verifiable and verified even then.Take the anecdotes with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Blunders in International Business (Blackwell Business)","review":"\\"Once upon a time there was a company which....\\" and \\"it once offered a product which's name sounded badly in another language\\".

This book in most part is the clinical account of Rajan's memory ability and processes. Also included in this book are other control subjects GN, DA, DW, MD, TH. In about a 3-yr. period of time Charles P. Thompson, Thaddeus M. Cowan, Jerome Frieman conducted a battery of tests and worked closely with Rajan. Rajan has proven himself worthy to be in the line with other great memorists.Contents:Preface1 Rajan The Person2 Memory Span and Memory Load Tasks3 Non-Numeric Performance4 Number Matrices5 Memory Search6 Priming Digit Strings8 Comparison With Other Memorists9 Overview And Interpretation Of Rajan's PerformanceReferencesAuthor IndexSubject IndexThis is a list of Chapters, there is much more information in the sub-chapters.

Numerous memory tests ranging from memory span, mean memory Span, mean Recall, mean organization measures, mean study time and recall, mean time per matrix, median search times, theoretical median encoding/production time, and more. There are numerous charts and graphs comparing Rajan with the test subjects, also contained are tests on Rajan himself. As you can tell, there is a lot one can learn from this book.The beginning of this book is an introduction to Rajan. Rajan himself writes the autobiography in the beginning of the book. Also learned from the autobiography is Rajan's middle name \\"Srinivasan\\". \\"He is named after a distant cousin who perhaps was India's most famous mathematician, Srivinvasa Ramanujan\\". Following the autobiography are only brief accounts of interviews NBC, radio, 60 minuites, etc. Also most memorable is the sub-chapter entitled \\"The \\"Larry King Show\\", a very amusing story. Then some information about Rajan the person and his schooling. The meat of the book is the memory experiments.Also contained in chapter 8 of this book is a brief comparison of Rajan to other well-known memoirists, Inaudi, Diamandi, Arnould, Ruckle, Bergh, Finkelstein, Isihara, professor Aitken, Shereshevskii, VP, SF and DD, TE, and last Bubbles P.There is information regarding Ericsson's Theory of Skilled Memory and how it pertains to Rajan. The reference section also gives valuable information. I found some valuable books and papers catalogued here.I did not want to involve myself in the work of detailing information that is contained in this book because of its length and scope. Because of the previous reviews, and I wanted other memory enthusiasts to have a handle on what to expect from this book. This book is more of a clinical account of Rajan's ability and not the most pleasant of reading material. However, there is a terrific amount of experiments and information in this book. I learned how to conduct different memory experiments, understand memory function, also learned about the uses of \\"rote\\" memory. I urge anyone interested in memory read this book."},{"Title":"Mayhem in B Flat","review":"I think humorous mysteries are wonderful, and know of none better than this. Set in Paris between the wars (what Paul calls Paris's best American period) the Homer Evans mysteries have broad humor and a distinctive wit. Add an inspired selection of funny names, a varied and eccentric cast of characters, word-play of a highly entertaining order (as when one Lvov Kvek is described as &quot;a former colonel in the recent army of the late Czar&quot;), and &quot;Mayhem in B-Flat&quot; is well outfitted for humor. Even the chapter headings are funny.As for the mystery involved, there's hardly anything comparable for bizarre complications and circumstances outside Alice Tilton's (i.e., Phoebe Atwood Taylor's) Leonidas Witherall mysteries and one of her Asey Mayo mysteries, &quot;Spring Harrowing&quot;.Even if possible, a plot summary is inadvisable, as aeshtetic merit and mental health might equally suffer. However, a list of the some of the elements of this tale may give an idea of its dizzying effect: the theft of an extremely valuable violin called &quot;The Sinner Without Malice&quot;; corpses that hardly seem to have noticed their own passing; a significant error in a game of checkers; forged fingerprints; a lady baritone; tarantula fights; barratry; thugs known as Dental Jake and Godo the Whack; a fiendishly dangerous new poison; a greasy thumbprint dating back to around the time of the Norman Conquest; a permeable wall; a revolutionary glue; and Hyacinthe Toudoux, medical examiner for the Prefect of Police.Only three of Elliot Paul's Homer Evans mystery titles seem to have been in print in the last thirty-five years or so. That is unfortunate, for Evans and his friends inhabit a distinctive, strange, and funny world. To get there go past &quot;It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; and Dortmunder country, then hang a right as you pass &quot;Charade&quot;, aiming toward &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot;. Halfway to &quot;The Thin Man&quot; wave at Tish, enter Paris, and fall down laughing."},{"Title":"Mayhem in B Flat","review":"A 1940 contemporary review described Mayhem in B-Flat as \\"a sizzling concoction of murder, merriment and madness\\". A zany cast of characters collide in a far-fetched plot that unfolds in the decadent and scandalous background of Paris in the late 1930s. This is pure fiction; there is no hint of the worsening international situation in Europe. Surprisingly, Elliot Paul, the author, does not allow the humorous situations that continually arise to undermine the mystery itself. Mayhem in B-Flat is a detection novel that challenges the reader.The investigation of the theft of a rare Guarnerius violin during a public concert is unexpectedly complicated by multiple murders, gang warfare, mysterious poisons, and a possible escape from Devil's Island. The plot is unpredictable. The eccentric, improbable characters are immensely entertaining. I will leave the details unspecified. The reader derives much enjoyment from the unexpected events and unanticipated coincidences that characterize the plot.Mayhem in B-Flat is the third story involving Homer Evans, an independently wealthy, well-educated, suave American with a penchant for solving complex mysteries. I have not read the two earlier stories - The Mysterious Mickey Finn and Hugger-Mugger in the Louvre - but their titles suggest a similar humorous vein.Dover Publications specializes in publishing works no longer in print. I particularly enjoy the Dover mystery and detective fiction series. Many selections are recognized classics by authors like Wilkie Collins, G. K. Chesterton, and J. Sheridan LeFanu. Others, like Mayhem in B-Flat (1940), are rarely encountered today. These inexpensive reprints are not only enjoyable reading, but they also provide an intriguing look at contemporary life and attitudes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."},{"Title":"Going to War in World War I (Armies of the Past)","review":"This is an excellent introductory book. It consists of twelve double-page sections, which are - The road to war; Off to the front; The Western Front; Trench warfare; The experience of war; Behind the lines; The widening war; Conflict in the east; The war at sea; New methods of warfare; Battle in the skies; The last year of the war; with a Glossary and Index. Each section is well-illustrated, with excellent artwork, very good maps and some relevant photographs. This is as good as the companion volumes -Going to War in World War Two (Armies of the Past),Going to War in Victorian Times (Armies of the Past),Going to War in the 18th Century (Armies of the Past). This really is an excellent introduction to the subject for younger readers, and can be read by grown-ups as well, as I can attest."},{"Title":"Most Revealing Book of the Bible: Making Sense Out of Revelation","review":"Dr. Eller has a very readable writing style. Like some of his other efforts it reminds you of a fascinating detective novel. In this case, you are searching for a powerful understanding of very difficult biblical material. Dr. Eller makes it feel easy. Eller explains some of the ways the stranger (he calls them calandarizing) interpretations got started and explains how they prevent Revelation from being a powerful spiritual resource in our lives. Here is an example of Dr. Eller's powerful, personal style of writing: 'However, what John intends, I now am convinced, is nothing other than to tell his churches: &quot;Look, my friends, whether you recognize it or not, your history is part of the great and universal mission being directed from God's throne. What you do and what happens to you is an integral and meaningful part of the wonderful thing God is doing with the cosmos, through Christ, to Evil, for mankind. My story starts with you and ends with all things being made new--but it is one story! Until you can understand what it is you're part of, you're bound to see yourself and your efforts as lowly; your're defeated before you even get into the game. But look at it once with me from the true perspective of God's throne, and you'll see that because of Jesus there's no way we can lose--no way!&quot; (page 71) Eller makes us understand that not only are John's first century brothers and sister's part of something big, but we 21st Century readers as well. Dr. Eller's background is from the Church of the Brethren which is a descendant of German Pietists and Anabaptist traditions. It may be nice for readers to get away from the excessive liberalism of mainline commentaries or the &quot;we know all the answers&quot; commentaries of evangelical writings. You get the best of both worlds. A nice feature of the book is that the passages commented on are there so the readers don't have to flip back and forth between a Bible and the commentary. The bad news is the translation used in Today's English version (TEV or Good News Bible) which is one of the weaker translations. Other concerns for some might be Dr. Eller's side mission of trying to make a compelling case for a modified Universalism throughout the book. Dr. Eller feels that all ultimately have the chance to be saved, though he does hold that some (especially Satan's close allies) will probably not accept the opportunity. Since it was writen in the 70's there is limited use of inclusive language which may bother some contemporary readers. Dr. Eller's powerful interpretation of Revelation holds up well after almost three decades. For lay people and pastors this is a great addition to their libary."},{"Title":"Most Revealing Book of the Bible: Making Sense Out of Revelation","review":"Another great book by Eller - it brings a sensible interpretation to the Book of Revelation"},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I'm not much of a reader, but when I read this book I fell in love with it.

Likeable characters and a sweet story line make it a quick and pleasurable read."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"The story of a young Methodist girl whose mother dies en-route to the west, and her father abandons her at a girls catholic school in the town of Santa Fe NM. The story is centered on a local 'myth' that the spiral staircase in their church was a miracle, that St.Joesph appeared in the guise of peasant carpenter and built it with wood he conjured.From a historical standpoint the book is a bit light, but it might be good supplementary reading for the settling of the southwest."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"The staircase was an excellent book. I was reading this for a children's literature class and I am glad I picked this book. I love the character of Lizzy. She goes through so much in this book and you can't help but be on her side when Elinora tries to get her in trouble. Lizzy does not care how others thing of her she just wants to get out of the all girls' school. This is an excellent book for children to read. The plot was very interesting and exciting. The characters are likeable and true to life, Rinaldi's writing is very descriptive. This story is about friendship, families, and lessons of life. This book would be an excellent read aloud. It introduces friendships and how to learn to be on your own."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"An engrossing literary gem.....a rare and valuable find in children's literature."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I am actually going to give this book to my granddaughter. I did read it and it is very touching to go into the life of a young lady that is on her own."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I have been reading books by Ann Rinaldi for a long time. I give her my credit for liking historical fiction so much. I keep reading because I can never put her books down. The staircase was no exception I couldn't help but to keep reading it. Lizzy Enders is going to Colorado with her mom and dad. They are on the way to Colorado, when the most unthinkable thing happens Lizzy's mom becomes ill and dies. Then she is left to take care of her dad including Elinora who her father is getting paid to bring to the Sisters of Loretto in Santa Fe Mexico. Then her dad leaves her and she's surrounded by Catholics but she's Methodist. She is hated by everyone there. Then she becomes friends with a carpenter who only has three tools. Who builds a great spiral staircase in a matter of weeks. Then he is gone. What happen to him? Who was he? These questions and more are running through everyone's mind. Ann Rinaldi did a really good job on this book. She did a good job of telling about the staircase myth at the girls' school in Santa Fe Mexico."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"One privilege I had going into this book was being familier with Santa Fe. In fact this book actually made me want to visit the \\"staircase\\" the story is about. As an avivid reader of historical fiction, this book was right up my ally.Ann Rinaldi displays a skill in bringing to life another time. Her characters all speak for themselves and at times that even makes the harder to understand...they know themselves so well...but the reader must get to know them.At times the crisp beautiful writing had me backing up to reread, but that was a fault of my own. I didn't absolutely adore this book, at times I felt like I had to think too hard to understand the different viewpoints and the sometimes very eccentric characters (which is something I believe is reflected from the real Santa Fe). It is a story about learning to love by learning to forgive. The central character has to deal wth a girl who is annoying and hateful, a father her leaves her at a girl's church bording school, and an elderly women who seems crazy after the death of her son...but proves to be a great friend. On top of all that she has to learn how to live with herself.I am not sure if the way Catholic beliefs are portrayed is offensive,keep in mind the main character doesn't know a thing about the Catholic faith and is in a whole new world. Also she is dealing with the death of her mother and a feeling she likes to call \\"hatred\\" but is it?Overall this was a well written piece that has made me eager to read more of Rinaldi's books. I don't feel like the story was great enough to reccomend, but I do reccomend the author."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"The Staircase was a great book. Elizabeth (Lizzy) Enders and her family were on their way to California. They were heading there to see if they could find some gold from the mines for some money. On the way Lizzy's mom died of the putrid fever. Bishop Lamy was paying the family to bring back his niece, Elinora, to The Sisiters of Loretta. It was in Santa Fe. Lizzy thought she was very annoying. Since Lizzy's mom died her dad knew he would have to get himself established first, which would have been really hard to do with Lizzy there. When they arrived at the church Mr. Enders left her there, without any goodbyes. It just so happens that she is forced to stay in the same room with the annoying Elinora. Lizzy was very sart mouthed, so she was breaking rules left and right. She was forced to have many chores. For one, she had to escort a woman called Mrs. Lacy to the cemetery everyday. Lizzy was happy because she got to leave the convent for a few hours. While she did these chores she made many adult friends. She made friends with all the nuns and came to learn her way around Santa Fe when she walked with Mrs. Lacy. There was one huge problem. The Bishop just had a choir loft built, but the carpenter took his money without making a staircase. The girls at the school prayed everyday to a novena to Saint Joseph expecting a miracle to come. Of course Lizzy didn't believe a miracle was going to come, so read The Staircase and see what she decides to do. Will she be able to go back home? Will she get a carpenter to finish the job without the girls being mad because their miracle didn't come true?"},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is definitely for teenagers (especially the romantic type). An assumption that it was the same as the William Peterson film, The Staircase, was incorrect. The only similarity was the staircase being built by a \\"mysterious stranger\\". Oh, well, as an adult, perhaps I should be a bit more careful in book choice and look inside before purchase."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I love this book because it was about her family and a girl name Lizzy. Lizzy got so sad because her mother died on the way to Georgia. Her mother died of a fever, but Lizzy always know that she was there for her and for her family. Lizzy missed her so much, but she always held her tears in for her bothers. Also I loved how Lizzy would always help her family, but she would help her dad more because he hurt his arm in the war and he olny had one hand. I also love this book because she meet a lot of people at her school that her dad left her. In some parts of the book I hated because her father left her and her bothers at a school to learn new stuff. Lizzy was really mad at her father for leaving her, but she got over it and wrote her father a letter. I love is book so much beacause every time that Lizzy saw someone she would always help them out. This one time there was a lady who was lost in the woods and Lizzy heared her scream and Lizzy went to try to find the scream. Lizzy helped this poor old lady and her name was Mrs. Lacey. She told Lizzy that she was trying to find her sons grave to leave a lantern so that he knows that she was also there for him and that there is light everywhere. Mrs. Lacey loved her son so much. Also Lizzy loved her mother also. I love this book because I learned that you need to repect your family because they won't always be there for you. You need to respect everyone in your life. That is why I love this book so much."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"The year is 1878. Thirteen-year-old Lizzy Enders is torn by grief. After her mother's death on the long journey westward from Missouri, her father has abandoned her at a convent school in Sante Fe, New Mexico. He is determined to prospect for gold in Colorado and regain the family wealth lost in the final days of the Civil War, just before Lizzy's birth. As the only non-Catholic girl at the school, she finds herself an unwelcome outcast, teased and tormented by the other students, especially snooty Elinora, who pretends that she wants to be a nun to avoid suspicion while sneaking out at night to see a boy. Lizzy's only friends are a slightly crazy old woman who lost both her husband and only son to the Civil War, and a travelling carpenter hired to build a staircase at the scool. But even with these two friends, Lizzy still longs for the day her father will return for her, and she wonders if that day will ever come. I highly reccomend this novel to fans of Ann Rinaldi's books. It's another excellant book by her, and she's one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I read this book to my daughters because it is based on the fascinating, true story of a staircase that was built mysteriously and miraculously in the Loretto Chapel of Santa Fe. According to history, the nuns were praying for a staircase to be built to the upper level, and a mysterious stranger came, built it, and left quietly without payment. The staircase can still be seen and it is a wonder in design.The book adds the girl Lizzie to the story, a Methodist thrust into a Catholic school. When the other girls cause a stink about the mysterious carpenter, and plot to get rid of him, Lizzie defends him and thereby becomes the outsider in the group. The way she is treated is quite unfair, but she tries to react without resorting to the same spiteful tactics of the other girls. I enjoyed reading aloud with the nasty intonation of Lizzie's rival, but my daughters thought for their ages, the girls behaved quite immaturely. I agree with one of the young reviewers that stabbing the kitten in the eye was unpleasant to read, but otherwise, I enjoyed this story very much as Lizzie's conflicts were resolved in the midst of the mysterious carpenter's visit."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I read my first Ann Rinaldi book when I was 12 years old. I give her credit for my love of history. I continue to read her books, because I know I will get a good story and &quot;Staircase&quot; is no exception. Lizzy Enders is on her way West with her family and their charge, Elinora. When Lizzy's mother dies, life, as she has known it, is over. Elinora is to be taken to a Catholic convent school where her uncle is Bishop. Lizzy expects to leave with her father, but is left behind. There, she learns some hard lessons in life and how to take the good with the bad, with a little help from friends.Rinaldi, in her classic style has taken an event in history and built a wonderful, captivating story around it. No matter how old I get, as long as she keeps writing, I will be reading. I highly suggest you do the same. If you are have never read her books before, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"Lizzy Enders feels abandoned in Santa Fe when her father and the remainder of their wagon train to Colorado leave in the middle of the night. Though not exactly alone in the convent school, Lizzy is certainly an outsider, the only Methodist and labeled as a heretic by Mother Magdalene. Add to that the fact that her own mother has just died on the Trail and left without a proper burial. Consider also the fact that she is outcast by the other girls in the convent, including her nemesis, Elinora who has traveled the Trail with her from Independence. The Staircase is more than a story about one girl's acceptance and perseverance in a life that is less than charmed, though. It is a story of hoping for miracles, but more importantly of realizing miracles, even when they do not come in the packaging one expected to find them. Heart-warming and based on the story of the Chapel of Loretto's fabled staircase from the late 1870's, another exceptional offering by Rinaldi."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst. Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"Very pleased with the book I enjoy reading the author. Will be reading somemore of her writings."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"Lizzy Enders is ripped to pieces with grief after losing her very sick mother on the Santa Fe trail. But she is even sicker when her father abandons her along the way- at a Catholic boarding school run entirely by nuns. She is a Methodist, and the other girls look down upon her. She is also stuck sharing a room with her horrible cousin, who can only think about herself. While trying to understand the ways of the strict Catholic church, Lizzy is asked to accompany a strange lady who lives at the convent up to her son's grave each day. She learns more from this lady than she could immagine. But when she and her cousin, Eleanorea, end jup in the town on an escapade in the middle of the night, Lizzy meets a carpenter, desperately in need of a job. Lizzy gets a strange feeling about the man. She knows the church needs a staircase up to the choir loft built, so invites him to come talk to the nuns. She forms a tight bond with the man, who preforms one of the most famous miracles in history before he vanishes. Lizzy is wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement around every corner.A very good book. It was a little descriminative against Catholics in my opinion, but that takes little away from the book itself. An all-around great story."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"I liked this book. It was pretty good with all the important things. One thing bad about it though, is that it stayed on the same &quot;level&quot;. I don't really think there was a &quot;climax&quot;. But I did like the story.I'd say that the best part of the book is when the bishops arrives. His so nice, and he knows what Elinora is really like, because she fool alot of people. The worst part, well its not really the book, but more what happens in the story. I hate it when Elinora stabs Cleo the kitten in the eyes with a needle then throws her out the window. She doesn't need to hurt Cleo to show Lizzy how much she hates her.The author did a really good job on characters, I really felt I knew them all like I had really known them for years. The other thing is the conflict, she had like five conflicts going on at the same time. So those were all pretty good."},{"Title":"The Staircase","review":"Ages 12 and older will find The Staircase refreshingly different: it tells of Lizzy, whose father has left her at a girls' school run by nuns on his way to new exploration in the West.

I thought it was wonderful how the staricase was a way to test the users faith in the end, with no railings on either side and built of strong and sturfy mysterious wood and wooden pegs instead of nails. The fact that the actual staricase has withstood all these years is amazing as well.

As a moral guideline, natural law has a very long and honorable tradition, especially in Christian faith. This book confuses the issue. Even though Rev.

Of the many books that have come out in the past 15 or so years on so-called \\"spiritual warfare\\" very few have contained seminal ideas like so many Christian books. There needs to be a general wake up call to the entire Christian writing community to either stop writing warmed over obvious insights or just stop writing altogether until there is something worthwhile to say... but please stop just continuing to crank out book after book after book with mere pablum.Dr. Lisa's book is anything but the above! This is hot bread. She has taken the time to think things through, pray things through, observe things... to gain new insights, to be observant of completely new concepts. She strikes me as someone who as a bit of a modern day John the Baptist with her observant eye (perhaps a godly Dennis Miller...?! - that's a compliment!) I typically am not attracted to books like this, but I am glad I picked this one up. If you are in for being challenged, called to action, called to make a difference... called to danger - the danger of losing your life in he call of Christ - hey, we all say that's what we are praying for - then this this book is for you.

It is nothing like the many books with nude photography that show glamour models insinuating that they are available for sex.I found these images to be very personal intimate portraits of real people that nevertheless are very athletic and erotic.The feel of the book is a classic calm mood. Very warm real and respectful. The prints show most of these real Black men in front of dark backdrops in the studio. The light and the print quality is mostly soft and warm. The way the sepia tone is used here really compliments the dark skin tones of the men depicted.It was a pleasure for me to come across a book that is not polished to go after the obvious mass market appeal. The real and warm humane mood of these images where more satisfying than anything I had come across for a long time."},{"Title":"Kalle Pieper: Sango (God in the African Pantheon) (German and English Edition)","review":"There are only 2 reviews for this book at the moment (as I begin writing this). One rates it 5 stars, the other only 1 star. I was wondering how anyone could give this great little book only a single star--and I think I've figured it out.The 1-star review is by a woman who further reveals her preferences in her review of another black male book, by John Healy. That more artsy book had her \\"salivating,\\" over men she found to be \\"handsome,\\" \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"fine-looking specimens.\\" Indeed John Healy's book is about as artistic as one could possibly get in photography. It's a totally different style and presentation from this Kalle Pieper book. I have them both, I love them both. And I can understand why a woman who likes neatness and handsome and gorgeous might be turned off by \\"specimens\\" less handsome, more macho, more every-day, regular underwear that may be a little ragged instead of Calvin Klein, and a cheek shot. To each her own.Of course others will prefer the opposite--models that exude sheer black male machismo in every fiber. That's what you get in Kalle Pieper's work. And although these models may be Americans, the entire flavor of the book is that of African countries where Mr. Pieper has spent a great deal of time. If you like an ethnic feel, you'll like this. If you like no pretension, no pretty for pretty's sake, studio yet without studio polish--just the ruggedness of sheer maleness in black--then you'll love this book.I think Ms. S.I.M. misrepresents the 5-star review in saying she disagreed because the pictures didn't look \\"natural\\" at all. That reviewer didn't say the models looked \\"natural.\\" And what seems totally baffling to me is that Healy's book (which she prefers, and which I too love), is the very epitome of polished studio posing, replete with numerous unusual props! Pieper's work would be more like Candid Camera by comparison.I have observed that some people are embarrassed when black people are photographed in less than spectacular settings. Books on tribal Africa, for example, will always be angrily denigrated by some who seem to be embarrassed by the huts or the nudity or the decorative body paint. I don't know whether Ms. S.I.M. is embarrassed by the more pedestrian portrayal of black men in Pieper's work--I don't even know if she's African-American herself (she does say of Healy's work: \\"I must say you know how to portray 'our' gorgeous Black men\\"). In any case, there does seem to be something she finds annoying about Pieper that she can't put her finger on--which I say because of her contradictory remarks in the two reviews.Bottom line is, people's tastes differ. And that's okay. She prefers \\"salivating\\" over Healy's \\"gorgeous, handsome, fine-looking specimens,\\" while others will prefer the more rugged, gritty, ethnic machismo of Pieper's work. Personally, I have a broad range of appreciation and give both books a strong 5-star rating.This book is now priced so low it's like stealing to buy it! What an amazing value!."},{"Title":"Kalle Pieper: Sango (God in the African Pantheon) (German and English Edition)","review":"I totally disagree with the above fore-mentioned review! The pictures did not look \\"natural\\" at all. Yesss, they looked posed, and dressed up for exactly that fact: posing for pictures in a studio. They have the repetitive same theme ie... atleast 1 or 2 military clad guys, someone sittin' in a chair, someone on a table. It looked like scenes were thrown together without much thought at all. The underwear w/ holes in them; made me think of uncleanliness, also the same \\"spreading the cheeks\\" pose...sigh...come on! I do agree; however, with the sepia tones...nice indeed. The pictures didn't even fill up a whole page. You could of saved $$$ condensing it into a smaller book. Small pictures do not give the effect of life-like. You wanna feel entrapped or look at every detail in a photograph. I'd have to say the best picture to me is of the uncircumsized falace.

He begins by discussing two states - two different ends of the spectrum between Total Order and Total Chaos. Somewhere between those two states is a zone of complexity, where nature teeters on the brink between order and chaos. To use a metaphor, this is like the moment of transition when slush could melt or freeze, or when water might turn to vapour. In this zone very interesting things happen - both in the natural world (at an atomic or larger physical level) in the social world (when social networks form) and in the biological world which is where Gribbin ultimately takes us - showing us how complexity operates in food chains, but also in terms of DNA and evolution.The book is captivating and my only regret is that I didn't write down a few notes along the way so I can dig back and think about how some of the universal laws might explain why (in my line of work) some new products do - or don't succeed. On the cusp of chaos, anything might happen.I'm actually going to read Deep Simplicity Again because it is both so informative and so enjoyable. A good book to read in tandem with this one is Duncan Watt's excellent Six Degrees which focuses on network theory."},{"Title":"Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life (Penguin Press Science)","review":"I appreciate greatly the author's aim, sharing his sense of wonder with his readers. Gribbin gives a wide perspective about chaos and complexity with facts from the history of science.Simple laws, non-linearity, sensitivity to initial conditions and feedback give rise to chaos and complexity.

It changed the way I view complex systems."},{"Title":"Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life (Penguin Press Science)","review":"I have just finished reading Deep Simplicity and felt the urge to tell anyone who would listen how I felt about the book. Read the other reviewers to find out what the book is about.There have been very few occasions and very few books that moved me in the way that Deep Simplicity did, for it is a work of art and without doubt a genuinely beautiful piece of literature. What's more, I feel that the beauty inherent in the book is self-similar on many scales, from the lucidly illustrative metaphors, to paragraphs that grab you as they weave delicately expounded threads together, to the overall structure and flow of the book itself. I felt privileged to have read the book.After I finished I was left with a tremendous sense of appreciation for and recognition with our planet, its biosphere, life, and the Universe at large; even for my fellow man - although our depredations are made strikingly apparent. My final and lasting feeling is one of profound enlightenment; something felt when previously reading Gribbin, but not to this extent.Thank You John Gribbin, for writing this book; $24.95 in one currency, priceless in another."},{"Title":"Deep Simplicity: Chaos, Complexity and the Emergence of Life (Penguin Press Science)","review":"I'm no scientist. Nor an academic.And it's been about twenty years since any formal full-time education.I found this book after rifling through ten or so boxes of assorted second-hand books up for grabs in a community centre on the Isles of Scilly.Something about the cover appealed to me. Maybe because I'm an artist/creative. Perhaps because I recognised the Hokusai reference and liked the clarity of the art-work. Certainly I'd read and loved James Gleick's classic book on chaos in the Nineties. And the words 'deep simplicity' resonated in my bones. Especially to a man forever in search of simpler ways of existing, to a man drawn instinctively to Zen. Whatever my reasons for picking up this book, I came to love it.I read a fair amount. Every book has its pace, some quicker, some slower, some turgid, some dense, some with big spaces between paragraphs, and some with type so small it leaves your eyeballs raw. I had a very slow entry into this book, one of those 'I've read this page twenty times and it's still not quite getting in there' scenarios. One of those occasions where you wake yourself up with a 'huh?' as your head nods to the side, you try re-reading the same sentence to once again find yourself five minutes later staring blankly at a book with a crick in your neck and a numb buttock.That may have had to do with my inability to focus my mind on the job in hand at the time, or perhaps that I was sizing it up as to whether to bother reading it at all. Was it just too geeky? I hadn't paid for it, so didn't feel that there was any reason to suck my money's worth of juice from it. Perhaps I was just plain tired and needed sleep more than information at that moment in my life.But I persevered.Initially I felt back in a classroom. Out of my depth. Wrestling with concepts, that although expressed with a beautiful clarity, wallowed in the murky depths just out of reach of my present level of understanding. Like a deep sea diver I only saw glimpses of those things that my sphere of illumination touched. And they were strange.Although also familiar: 'strangely familiar'.I needed time to absorb the paragraphs, to 'update my operating system'. Just a few pages and I'd have to stop, put the book down, digest for a few hours/days, allow my brain to chew over the content. But not for too long. If I did, the thread would go cold and I'd have forgotten what went on before.And so started a dance between myself and this book.It grew on me. Fast. And illuminated so many diverse corners of existence that I was left reeling with the implications. Giddy. It's a must read. An enormous read. Should be compulsory reading for every human. The highest wisdom that we now know, the cutting edge of contemporary science/physics/thought written in simple terms for a lay person like me to understand. With stacks of fascinating references to contemporary life and culture, examples being illustrated with traffic jams, telephone noise interference, spots on leopards, estuaries, earthquakes, boiling water, the shape of ferns, to make difficult concepts very accessible and relevant to the world in which we live.It was a pleasure to go on this journey. To rediscover the joys of learning from one with a much clearer world-view than my own. Made me feel like I'd been living in Plato's Cave! My diver's sphere of illumination is now so much bigger. Perhaps, dare I say it, I've even been allowed a glimpse of the bigger picture. Of the essence of the nature of creation. And no, it isn't a guy on a cloud with a long flowing beard! It has deep simplicity at its heart.I only wish John Gribbin had been my science teacher at school. He's given me a passion for the subject, a relevance that the dry, dusty delivery of my teachers of yore never managed to kindle. Perhaps I'd have made different decisions along the way, and my current life of yoga, paint-brushes and guitars might instead be replaced with lectures and seminars and bright brains chewing over the big questions of existence? Perhaps this doorway is still open.Whatever, I only hope that you too can experience the joys of this book. Maybe my very own copy will find its way to you one day. I passed it on to someone I thought would be interested, as I do with most of my books. I'd like to think it'll keep doing the rounds until there's more Sellotape than pages holding it together!Namaste."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"This book is a compilation of 12 speeches delivered, for the most part, during the past several years. Collectively, they clearly and succinctly in effect compare and contrast the fruits of the materialistic worldview with that of the biblical worldview. Having recently rediscovered Christianity in part through previous writings of Chuck Colson (e.g. Born Again, Life Sentence, Kingdoms in Conflict, Loving God, and The Body, all of which are excellent), I found this book to be a wonderful read. What a difference it would make in our world if our leaders, educators, and students thoughtfully read this material and took its teachings to heart! To appreciate the impact of even one transformed life, all you need do is consider the example of its author."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"I found this little book to be a summary of Colson's philosophy as expressed through twelve messages. The effect that this had on me is phenomenal; he made me rethink my future plans and basically, caused a mid-college crisis.The main ideas in this book will be repeated several times because he gives them in the form of speeches, not as a long, narrative discourse. Several (of the many!) themes are: freedom is found in a moral law p.20; a way of doing apologetics by porving that only the Christian way makes sense (p. 55); knowable, scholarly truth and it is the highest goal one can pursue (p.75). His plea for presuppositional apologetics (even if you are not a presuppostionalist, I think you would understand his point, p.114); the Christian duty seek the glory of God in one's vocation (p.138); despair is sin because it denies the sovereignty of God (repeated over and over but articulated on p. 165); a rational approach to ethics is pointless if it lacks a will to do what is right (p.194).Final Analysis:By now I hope you have an understanding of what Colson is trying to convey. This is a brief summary of what is found in *How Now Shall We Live* and *Being the Body* (But please read both of those as well). It is curious to see what the West would be like if Christian's took up Colson's challenge."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"When it comes to being salt and light in a post- Christian society , no one's opinion is more highly regarded among evangelicals than Chuck Colson's. In this collection of his speeches, Colson clearly deals with subjects such as religious liberty, duty, Christian worldview, and conscience. The book also contains a speech by Colson on C. S. Lewis, and Colson's annual Easter sermon. This book would be great to give to a non-Christian in order to let them read about how a Christian worldview is fleshed out. As with all Colson books, this one contains a wealth of illustrative stories and materials that could enhance Sunday School lessons or sermons."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"12 of Mr. Colson's most important and influential speeches are assembled in this book. A wide range of contemporary issues are covered such as morality, ethics, leadership, personal holiness, public service, and social justice. Sometimes stories are repeated in the speeches, but a thought-provoking and life-changing challenge is always presented. Colson's message is a message of Truth that cuts through the confusion and double standards of our world today. God has given Chuck Colson an absolutely amazing testimony. He served four years in the Nixon administration before serving seven months in Alabama's Maxwell Prison. Before entering prison for obstruction of justice, Mr. Colson came to understand the Way, the Truth, and Life. I highly recommend spending some time reading more about Mr. Colson's Prison Fellowship at his Breakpoint site."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"For fans of Chuck Colson, this book is essential reading. Unlike some of Colson's longer works, this is a short compilation of speeches he has given over the years. While each speech is only 15-20 pages long, the essence of Colson's worldview is clearly evident. If you are going to only read one of Chuck Colson's books, make sure it is this one."},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"An excellent read! Colson once again addresses several relevant issues facing our culture today.The book is a compilation of addresses by Colson at various meetings (college commencements, Bible conferences, etc.) and covers a wide range of topics: conscience, personal integrity, the choice between right and wrong, leadership (this address alone is a gem and my personal favorite!), and other subjects.Consistent with his other books, Colson challenges the reader to know what you believe and why you believe, especially from a Christian worldview. Colson encourages us to think through our beliefs and not just live on emotion alone.Buy the book and be challenged and inspired by one of the great Christian apologists of today!"},{"Title":"Chuck Colson Speaks: Twelve Key Speeches by America's Foremost Christian Thinker","review":"Since probably all of Chuck Colson's books, along with \\"Loving God,\\" are ghost written, this book, which purports to be transcripts of speeches, must have been lifted from the teleprompter. If Obama is the \\"scripted President\\" Colson is the \\"scripted Evangelist.\\" I mean, some of his books are outright worthless. If you want great theological treatises, read the church fathers such as ST. John Chrysostom or St. Athanasius. Or read the great treatises such as Olaf Moe, Ned Stonehouse, Richard Longenecker. If you want good apologetics, read Richard Whatley, William Paley, John Henry Newman, Edward John Carnell, Walter Martin or John Warwick Montgomery, or, better yet, Jean Guitton. For great Christian literature, read Dante, Cowper, Bunyan or C.S. Lewis.Don't read Colson. He won't tell you about the juwes or masons and their offspring, the cults and the new world order. Instead, you will find his imprimatur on such ridiculous titles as \\"the God of Stones and Spiders.\\" Note I said \\"imprimatur\\" which in Latin means \\"Let it be printed.\\" For, Colson is an industry, not just a person. He doesn't even know about books being producted and ghostwritten in his name. He just collects the money. On several occasions, he was caught in the embarrassing situation of not knowing a certain book was written with his name on it when asked about it from a person in the audience at the particluar venue he was at at the time.Imagine that, \\"the God of Stones and Spiders.\\" What a stupid title. Has Colson invented, through his ghostwriters, a new genre? Namely, whacky titles? Allen Ginsburg would be jealous. How about, \\"the God of Rutabaga and Peanut Shells?\\" Because it doesn't make much of a difference it shows how preposterous the former title is.I hope the Christian church recovers from all of the Chuck Colsons, Pat Robertsons, Billy Grahams, Robert Schullers, Pope John Pauls, Pope Ratzingers etc. The devastation these men have had on orthodoxy, either through public compromise of the Apostles Creed, the depleting of the Christian Church (Roman Catholic, Prostestant and Orthodox) of its economic resources and channeling those resources into their own greedy hands, or the blinding of the Christian public by their collective refusal to name our enemies thus rendering the Church impotent, is a tragedy that will take years to undo."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"I was going through my shelf the other day and came across a 1969 edition and recalled a conversation I had with the folks at Wipf and Stock a few years ago about reprinting it and lo, there it was on amazon.com! Very cool guys. Why I haven't reviewed this book earlier surprises me, since it was seminal in modifying my views on the atonement from an American Lutheran to a more Eastern Orthodox position.So why does this book matter? Aul&eacute;n challenges the status quo answer to the question: Why did Jesus have to die and what effect does the resurrection have? Raised Lutheran (Missouri Synod), I was taught a very Anselmian version of God's rationale for the events of our salvation which the author of this book takes to task (or at least demonstrates to be a modern development). We sinned in Adam, are guilty for his sin, and the offense to God's justice demands His wrath be taken out against us. Jesus takes the wrath of God upon himself, so when the Father sees me He really sees Jesus and doesn't take His anger out on me. Of course there is a biblical basis to some of this, but not to the exclusive extent that this theory holds over most of Protestant theology (although, as the author points out, Luther himself had a more nuanced version in his theology with the \\"blessed exchange\\" of the natures in Christ and, by that virtue, our own in Christ). Such a model focuses heavily upon the death of Christ, and personally I can remark that often the incarnation and resurrection were taught as an afterthought.Aul&eacute;n begins his work by stating the problem of the atonement and its possible answers, tracing the history and role that the Anselmian, Latin version has played, commonly known as the substitutionary theory: Jesus takes my place under the wrath of God. Then Irenaeus is used as the example of the earlier and more universal theory of the early church and New Testament: Christ tramples down sin, death and the power of the devil by his incarnation, death and resurrection. This is the classic model of recapitulation in Christ.Then the Middle Ages are examined with the roles of Tertullian, Cyprian, Gregory the Big One and Anslem, among other notables. Here the classic idea is beginning to wane and almost disappear under the weight of the Latin model. Although Luther moves markedly to the classical model, he still employs terms and sometimes the meaning of the Latin model, which has further solidified it in his tradition. He concludes with some analysis of post-Luther developments and posits that a return to the original model is a needed corrective. A very comprehensive and packed slim volume indeed!Other books of interest may includeHow Are We Saved?: The Understanding of Salvation in the Orthodox Traditionby Kallistos Ware,Common Ground: An Introduction to Eastern Christianity for the American Christianby Jordan Bajis, and for a Lutheran reappropriation of the classical idea,Union With Christ: The New Finnish Interpretation of Lutheredited by Braaten and Jenson. Lastly, perhaps the best book on the topic, although dated to 1927, is Grensted'sA Short History Of The Doctrine Of The Atonement (1920). In fact, I would probably buy Grensted's work before Christus Victor for a more complex adn in-depth study. They compliment one another perfectly.I would find it most interesting to look at this whole question through liturgical theology, since how we understand the sacrifice of Christ, along with his taking on and renewing our nature, is intimately bound (think of the Mass as Sacrifice, Recapitulation, partakers of divinity etc); For Christianity is primarily a doxological religion. This would refocus our attention upon the necessity, nature and role of the sacraments/mysteries. PhD/ThD thesis anyone?"},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"This book provides an historically-faithful alternative to the substitutionary and exemplary models of the atonement. Its strength lies in its presentation of a vivid and robust picture of the work of Christ. Its (the book, not the model) weakness is its simplistic reductions of other theologians' thoughts.Overview:The Christus Victor model presents the work of Christ as a triumph over the devil, powers (demons), bondage of sin, and the \\"law.\\" Accordingly, given its Eastern overtones, the atonement and the Incarnation are inseperable. Christ united humanity to his nature to redeem it. He redeemed it (still united to his nature) on the cross.This is to be contrasted with the Latin views of the atonement, which are narrowly penal. The Latin views incorporate merit and penance in the atonment model. For Aulen, this move removes the work of God from the work of Christ in redemption.Criticisms of the work:This is why I give it 4 stars. I do not think he dealt as fairly with St Anselm as he could have. David Bentley Hart (*Beauty of the Infinite*) has shown how St Anselm and St Athanasius do not fundamentally disagree. Another problem I had is that biblical students need to see that the Bible incorporates all 3 models of the atonement (Mark 10 = substitutionary; Colossians 2:15 = Christus Victor; Peter 2:21 = exemplary). Aulen also used language that begged the question in favor of his position.Aside from the above criticisms, this is a paradigm-shifting book."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"Aulen's aim in this work is to explain the doctrine of the atonement as it was held for the first 1000 years of Christianity, and to explain how and why the church has deviated from it.I am a lay theologian and I have read a lot of theological works, but this book stands out from the rest. I now feel that I didn't properly understand Christianity prior to reading this work.Aulen doesn't interact much with scripture, and confines himself to a historical account of what various people in the church believed at different times. However his fundamental thesis is clear: that the Bible and the early church have a view of Christ's work that is majorly different to what is commonly received today in the Western Church.Though Aulen was a Western theologian, Eastern Orthodox believers will also benefit from Aulen's clear and insightful exploration of the doctrine of the Greek Fathers. Aulen's account of the atonement is Orthodox, and far clearer than what I have seen expressed elsewhere in Orthodox writings."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"The author draws a sharp contrast between the atonement theology of the apostles, the early church fathers, and the Lutheran catechisms on one hand, and the atonement theology of Anselm, medieval Roman Catholicism, and later Protestant orthodoxy on the other hand. He demonstrated that the fathers did not hold to \\"the ransom theory\\" at the exclusion of the objective reconciliation of God by his own victory in Christ over the curse.As a Missouri Synod Lutheran, I found more interesting than convincing the argument that the observed divergence between Luther and sixteenth-century Lutheranism goes beyond differences in emphasis. For example, the author did not appear to sufficiently appreciate the relevance of Lutheranism's teaching, in opposition to Calvinism, the communication of attributes between the divine and human natures of Christ.The biggest contribution of the book may be the case that Luther's joyous proclamation of Christ's victory over sin, death, Satan, the law, and God's wrath represented a Pauline development of the atonement theology of the fathers."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"Gustaf Aulen very simply traces the history of the three main ideas of the atonement. One, the \\"Classic View.\\" It is the more mythic view, the invasion of God to earth to rescue man, reconciling himself to himself. The Latin View, more commonly known as the Satisfaction theory of the atonement and then the more humanistic \\"subjective\\" view.It is a very simple historical outline with weighty consequences. The way which in which we view the atonement shapes our image and idea of God and why he did/does what He does. Did God come to save me out of love or was it more rooted in retribution and punishment? Aulen systematically reveals the holes in the ever popular ideas of \\"Satisfaction,\\" punishment and penitence found in the Latin idea of the Atonement and how Christ offering himself as a Man to God is erroneous and a breach in the Divine rescue. And I realized while reading, \\"if God demands a satisfaction of his justice, then how is it truly love and forgiveness?\\" I can't sum up everything Aulen says clearly in this place, but he addresses all these questions. He shows how the Atonement is the work of God from beginning to end and that the MOTIVE of God is the Divine Love working outside of and thwarting the Divine Justice. He shows that the Divine Love is bigger and works outside of the box of the Divine Justice or rather, man's need to rationalize and logically figure out how God's justice was satisfied through the Atonement; it wasn't. Rather, God performs the spontaneous act of love for his children and rescues them from the power of sin, death and law. He shows how the Law is just as much an enemy as sin is rather then something to be satisfied or lived out or held to in some moralistic fashion.An amazing book that is refreshing and shows that God acts out of love rather than the logic, rationalism and all the other damaging theories we have about him. God saves man because he loves him, and if he decides that he loves us more than he wants to condemn us, then who are we to insist that his justice is robbed from him or not? If a father decides to rescue and forgive his child because he loves his child, why would we try to rationally figure that out? And isn't it truly justice and evidence that we are created in the image of God when we would do the same for our children and imagine God as doing it for us? God changes his mind, and he is not any less God because he does that. He changed his mind because of Moses and we see something of his heart for his people in Hosea 11 where he cries out that he cannot turn his back on them. Hence, the struggle of God and we see the dichotomy between the Divine Love and Divine Wrath. The former overcame the latter. Beautiful. I could go on, but reading the book would be far better."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"How come every time I turn around I hear that Augustine came up with something that was later turned into Reformation Theology in contradiction to everything the church believed before Augustine? Can it be that the pre-Augustine church was so screwed up that they got almost nothing right? I'm OK with some improvement of theological thought given the discovery of texts they might not have had, etc. But, on major topics like salvation security, eschatology (as it relates to preterism), pacifism, and church/state integration, do you really think they'd be completely wrong within a decade of the death of the last Apostle?In this book, the author traces the evolution of atonement over the course of church history. He does a pretty good job of explaining the difference in the mechanics between the original system (\\"Classical Atonement\\" or \\"Christus Victor\\") which the western church followed for about 1000 years (and The Church of the East still does) and the system that was invented after 1000 AD by the Roman Catholic Church and then adopted by Reformed Theology (\\"Substitutionary Atonement\\").I would like to see some skilled writer update the author's work to make it a bit more readable. However, if you put the effort in, he makes a clear argument which seems to me to be hard to refute."},{"Title":"Christus Victor: an historical study of the three main types of the idea of atonement /","review":"No Christian committed to the teaching of Scripture would deny that the doctrine of the atonement is the heart of the Christian gospel. The Scripture clearly teaches that Christ's death as an atonement for sin will result in the salvation of the world. But the dominant view of how the Church has understood how this works has changed dramatically over the last thousand years. Most modern Christians (not including those in the Orthodox Church) have a system of how and why this exchange took place which was not articulated until Anselm in the Scholastic period. This system in all it's most important intricacies is held by most as not only essential orthodox dogma but as the center of the Christian faith.This book brings the view of this system (and the view that later opposed it) under the microscope as no other work has done before. Aulen analyzes these views in light of the dominant teaching of the Church for the first millenium of Church history (known as the &quot;Classic/Patristic/Greek&quot; view). He also has some interesting insight into the strength of Martin Luther's atonement theology.My personal qualms with this work are that1. he lays out the Patristic view as the teaching of the Bible but is not very convincing2. Luther's views on Law and Wrath do not line up with Biblical teaching and are certainly not the pinical of Christian teaching on the atonement3. he does not understand the history of the doctrine of the Reformed Church and therefore lumps it all together. BTW this is a problem with a lot of modern critics of teaching on the atonement (&amp; justification) in the Western Church, including my favorite N.T. Wright.Though I have quarrels with some of Aulen's views, this book brings a most important issue into focus and does a great job of starting a conversation between differing wings of the Christian Church.

This unique collection of the four plays he wrote between 1879 and 1884 provides teachers of drama/literature with an opportunity to look at a major writer trying to develop his craft. Ibsen is concerned with social criticism and each of these plays reflects his change in perspective as he tries to write a drama that will be both socially relevant and commercially successful. You have to remember the time and place that considered it shocking for Nora to leave her husband or for Mrs. Alving to consider euthenasia for her son. By turning to &quot;comedy&quot; (of a sort) in &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; Ibsen found a way of making his point in a manner more acceptable to his audiences. By looking at not only the plays but how each was received by the public, teachers/students can better appreciate what Ibsen was trying to do with each successive play.For all four of these plays the notion of responsibility is primary. In &quot;A Doll's House&quot; Nora Helmer decides to leave her husband because he is unworthy of her love. In &quot;Ghosts,&quot; Mrs. Alving has to decide whether she should give her diseased son poison as a mercy killing. In &quot;An Enemy of the People,&quot; Dr. Stockmann decides to stay and fight to have the infected baths repaired even after the town ostracizes him. Finally, in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot; the idealist Gregers Werle comes home and destroys a family by insisting the truth be told. A classroom set of this particular volume is relatively inexpensive and provides an excellent case study of the growth of a major writer. Students do not often get the opportunity to read several works by the same writer. Shakespeare is the exception to this rule, but usually students are exposed to different types of plays (comedy, tragedy, history) rather than to a series of consecutively written plays."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen (A Bantam Classic # HC177)","review":"henrik ibsen has perfected the realist movement in theatre. he has accomplished what so few have: to maintain the realistic effect, without succumbing to the tediousness of every day life. his plays ring true for the common man, yet not in a pedestrian manner that becomes boring. in my opinion, he far surpasses any other playwright in the realist movement, including chekhov."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen (A Bantam Classic # HC177)","review":"So much in reading Ibsen depends upon the translation of these great works. These four plays of Ibsen's so-called &quot;realistic period&quot; revolve around social issues of his day which plague us 100 years later. Do we ever learn from such literary wake-up calls? Although the dramatic tensions here, which could have easily have been 20th Century tensions, rumble through these plays, the translations here are wordy and dated, thus making the plays sound overly melodramatic and at times downright silly. Still, everyone should read -- and discuss -- Ibsen's plays for their uneasy questions regarding universal social problems: money, privacy, freedom to act, government corruption, unchecked journalism, and the moral and physical diseases which only seem to wear a new face each year."},{"Title":"Four Great Plays By Ibsen (A Bantam Classic # HC177)","review":"This book is great!

For some reason, I took it out anyway and read it. The first few pages seemed to confirm my theory, but I read on.And changed my mind. Getting the Girl is not the shallow sex story I assumed. It is a moving account of a boy and his life, his relationships--with \\"the girl\\", but more importantly, with his family and with himself--and his longing for \\"okayness.\\" Cameron is a believable character that you will grow to support, ache for, and feel attached to. The supporting characters have depth and truth, the plot is interesting, the setting is not stated but you get a feel for the where and the when.Cameron grows as a person before your eyes as the author shaves off layer after layer to reveal him on the inside."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Markus Zusak's GETTING THE GIRL, the sequel to FIGHTING RUBEN WOLFE, is a five star effort of YA fiction. The story centers on the life of Cameron Wolfe and his hunger, his desire to get a girl, \\"the\\" girl, the one who lives in the house up in Glebe he waits outside of. This coming of age story feels so fresh that I swear my eyes started sweating.Like so many younger brothers, Cameron is trying to grow in the shadow of his brothers, and it's not working for him. Rubes gets all the girls, accomplishes all the heroics, and stands on his own in the world. Cameron can only \\"want\\" that. It takes Octavia, not the girl he thought he was waiting for, but the real thing, to enter his life by surprise and plant the seed of strength in Cameron that he didn't know he had soil for.At first, Cameron's secret journal writings feel too advanced for the kid we meet, but he grows into them, or they grow into him. Either way, they work well to add a deeper level to this already emotionally complex novel. They reveal a maturity in Cameron that feels right when the end of the story comes around.If our lives truly are made up of moments, as Cameron says they are, that those moments are the pieces of us, then this story is a piece worth carrying with you, one you'll want to applaud with your noble clapping hands. When the last raindrop has fallen, the question it's asking us might be -- \\"What moments make up that life of yours?\\"Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Cameron Wolfe is crushing hard. Her name is Octavia and, in his mind, she is just about perfect. She's beautiful and caring, and can make a harmonica &quot;howl.&quot; Octavia doesn't mind having Cameron around, unlike most of the girls Cameron's brother Ruben brings home. That's the trouble: Ruben brought her home first and, unlike most of the other girls who have come and gone, Octavia is the one who dumps Ruben. Ruben acts as if it's no big deal but, in truth, Octavia is the source of Cameron and Ruben's first real conflict, in which Cameron bears the brunt of Ruben's anger. It is Cameron's sister, Sarah, who helps Cameron see that he can be more than just Ruben's shadow --- he is his own person, smart and sensitive with his own unique vision of the world.Lyrical and evocative, GETTING THE GIRL is not so much about Cameron's crushes as it is about family, self-discovery through writing, and the reality of teen love. Cameron's voice is graceful with a perfect blend of wisdom and naivete, of learning the differences between lusting from afar and real-life dating. Readers will identify with him at the same time they want to strangle him for being so pigheaded, doing things like sitting outside the house of a girl who hates him. The change in Cameron and Ruben's relationship is satisfying and realistic. Those who are looking for a thoughtful yet strong male character will find a perfect match in this elegant sequel to FIGHTING RUBEN WOLFE.--- Reviewed by Carlie Kraft"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Friday, I read \\"Fighting Reuben Wolf\\"...couldn't put it down. Saturday, I read \\"Getting\\"...do I need to say more? All I can say, in all truthfulness is: \\"Write more, Markus and write fast!\\""},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Marcus Zusak creates another hit for teen readers here. I purchased this for my classroom shelf in eighth grade, and in spite of (or because of?) the \\"mature readers\\" tag I had to place on it, the boys have been wild for it. Cameron has the kind of weirdly stable home life lots of our real students live. He doesn't enjoy being in his brother's shadow any more than any other teen would. But Cameron doesn't leave his home, become shockingly muscular, or achieve any other traditional solution to this problem. He makes a new path, and that is a great message for most kids who understand that those other resolutions are seldon viable in the real world. Don't worry about neglecting the girls. I've had several show interest because the main character and his brother are exactly the sort of boyfriends they crave getting to rescue. The language is vividly authentic, and an advisory of some sort is probably in order if you plan to shelve this for students."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Zusak's final book about the Wolfe family, focuses on the youngest, most shy member of the pack- sweet Cameron.Cam is used to living in the shadow of his brothers, worrying about his sister's future, & generally trying to stay out the way of his parents & really, all he wants (like any teenage boy) is a girlfriend. Oh, if he weren't such a hopeless case- or at least, that's what he's convinced himself.It's a joy, in this third book to watch as Cameron figures out who he wants to be & perhaps, who he is. If you've read the first two Wolfe books, you know what you're in for with this family & this book doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"He is a very good writer. He has a moral sense of the world. His characters are very human, though he does add some fantastic situations that make it mysterious."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"What makes up an individual into the person one hopes to be? What components to a person's life are most crucial to this formation of self? To which extent is an understanding or reconciliation of these personal elements required for one to achieve a satiated level of \\"okayness\\"?These are the questions that auspiciously consume the pages of Markus Zusak's sweet and endearing novella. In my own chronology of Mr. Zusak's erudite adventures, following I Am The Messenger and The Book Thief, the third book in my path, Getting The Girl feels decidedly more deliberate and minimalist. With the protagonist, Cameron Wolfe, ever searching for a hunger and desire within, readers my find themselves, along with Cam, searching for what it is they also are hungry for. In a completely charming approach, Getting The Girl offers fun and amusing perspectives on the intimate value of words, stories and a sense of feeling. Most predominantly, Mr. Zusak frames a portrait of personal familial relationships and how the person that one perceives in themselves informs the perception others have in them; and vise-versa."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"3 Weeks ago I read The book Thief, loved it so much i ordered fighting ruben and getting the girl. Mr. Zusak is an amazing down to earth writer that I seem to keep craving more of. I'll be moving on to the messenger and waiting anxiously for whatever else he writes. Thanks for adding substance to my world."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Getting the girl is my first book by Markus Zusak. Though I've heard so many great things about \\"The Book Thief,\\" I haven't read it yet (but I'm planning to do so pretty soon). Also I'm aware many people like Zusak's writing style and storytelling talent. Because of all those reasons, I was tempted to try Zusak's work.So ... Cameron is a hopeless romantic. Considerate and smart. Reading this book from Cameron's perspective makes this book a lot interesting (since most of YA authors write from the female perspective), and it's kind of an eye opener to see there are boys like Cameron--who are thoughtful, sweet, romantic, and full of potential. Unlike his brother, who plays around, Cameron is not only feeling-driven, he craves the real thing: Love.Cameron's relation with his family (especially with his brothers--more specifically Ruben) is sweet, though things aren't always that great. When his womanizing brother brought a girl (Octavia Ash) home, Cameron is attracted. Cameron has never been with a girl before, but now, he likes this girl and wants to get close to her. All in all, this book illustrate Cameron's struggle to become a better person and get what we wants even though his brothers think less of him.Getting the Girl was not that great for me. I thought the setting makes it hard to make prediction, and that can be a good or bad thing--depends on how you see it. The story wasn't tedious, but it was dry, dull. There was no life to it... nothing grasped me to carry on. It was more of a settle, unpredictable read.Zusak's writing makes imagination easy, and I look forward to read The Book Thief."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I read this after reading The Book Thief, and even though the author's writing style annoyed me at first, there's is something organic about it. Honest. This book reminded me of my family, my brothers, and sibling rivalry."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Many of you have probably heard of Markus Zusak, and if you haven't you should have. His most famous books I Am the Messanger and The Book Thief have won countless awards including being named a Printz honor book and Publishers Weekly best book of the year. But of course this review isn't about either one of those books (which are both sensational books as well), this review is about another remarkable book that is quite a bit less known, Getting the Girl.Getting the Girl is the sequel to Fighting Ruben Wolff, but it can easily be read as a stand alone. It begins with the protagonist Cameron feeling like he wants more out of life than being the underdog and second string, but not really knowing how to achieve it. He's in love with a girl who hates his guts, and he doesn't really connect with anyone outside his family. All in all he's not doing so well.But then he starts to write and with the help of his sister and his brother's ex-girlfriend Cameron starts to turn things around for himself, and discover there's a lot more to Cameron Wolff than meets the eye.Getting the Girl is a sensational coming of age story. It takes the lovable yet quiet brother and shows what's really going on in his head. Teenage readers will truly connect with Cameron's writing, and while some of it may seem unbelievable at parts, the love and attachment the reader will feel to the characters and the level of writing Zusak exhibits in this book make it a must read to any fan of young adult literature.[..]"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Please don't ever judge this book by its cover. Based on the title and image, I was expecting a shallow hormone-fest for teen boys, but it's a beautifully written story of an artist discovering his craft and finding his sense of worth because of it. I freaking love this book. Zusak balances humor and poetry like nothing I've ever seen. It's awesome, but completely unpretentious. He also handles sibling relationships in a touching and realistic way.I read this book like once a month. It's that good."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I discovered Zusak with \\"Book Thief.\\" I then read \\"I Am Messenger\\" and finally got my hands on this book in the library. Initially when I started reading it, I thought this was going to be too simple of a story for me to enjoy. Wow, was I wrong!! Cameron Wolf really grew on me, as well as his relationships with everyone else, especially Ruben. I can see Zusak laying a common foundation in this book (as well as \\"I Am Messenger\\") to culminate in the telling of \\"Book Thief.\\" Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Not Zusak's best work but still a great read for teens. The main character Cameron is a gentleman and half, not to mention somewhat of a hopeless romantic, a rare find in a teenage boy. You get a good glance into Cameron's mind through the journals he keeps along with his narrative in the story. I didn't LOVE this story but as I read I felt a certain kinship with Cameron as I understand about unrequited love and finding something good only to lose it. I wasn't too keen on Octavia mind you, but she did serve well as the one to give Cameron a much needed boost of confidence. Again, not the best from Zusak but still a superb read."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Summary: Getting the Girl centers around the life of Cameron Wolfe and his desire to get a girl. Not just any girl, but \\"the\\" girl.Review: Reading that summary, it might seem like this novel is just a shallow story about a boy wanting a girl, for his sake. But that's not at all what this book is. It is about getting the girl, but not at all in any malicious way. Narrated by Cameron Wolfe himself, he talks about his coming of age story, when he doesn't only grow up to be the person he wants to be, but to be someone he never knew he could be.I have to note that because Marcus Zusak is the author, it is somehow already expected that it will have good writing. And it does, the same way his other book, The Book Thief, has. This also has the same poetic style, with just the perfect balance of everything. At times it was funny and heartbreaking. But in the end, though unclear or ambiguous, was truly inspiring.I recommend this, mostly to young adults. But really, anyone who appreciates a good, simple story with great writing should pick this one up and try it out."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"This is a good book but should probably categorized as poetry. I really enjoyed it but Zusak's book The Messenger is a much better book. Also, make sure to get The Book Thief. I would buy anything he writes. He is very talented."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Markus Zusak has such a gift with words. This is a simple story about a young man learning who he is and where he stands. But with Markus Zusaks gift for writing it is a simple story turned into an amazing story. I really enjoyed reading this book as I have all his others. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice book to read and enjoy. :)"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"It was refreshing to, once again, read a great book with a male protagonist who writes, and not only that, writes really really well. As in, with the exact style that I would love someday to write in, flowy but not overly descriptive, just about the world and life and how everything fits together. You go into the book a little confused by/about all the characters, and come out wishing you knew them all, especially protagonist Cameron. I thought it would just be a typical \\"guy\\" book, expecting, you know, murder, car chases, whatever. Who knew you could write a YA romance with a side of bromance, feauturing a main male character? (Well, other than John Green). Cam is the guy every girl wishes she had, I just don't think he knows it! Quiet, sensitive, writer with the sweetest and deepest thoughts, sounds perfect to me! I thought the entire story was well-paced (not to mention, well-spaced, thank you, double spacing authors, we love you!). The ending was a little all over the place, and I wish there was more resolution with Octavia, but it was very sweet, tying up both the brotherly stories and the romantic ones. Amazing read.Rating: 4.5/5"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I am not surprised that thus far, this book has only received 5 star reviews. I read all kinds of genres of books and this is one of my favorite books of any genre, definitely of the YA genre.Before I review it, I want to say this is my first Markus Zusak book and I did not realize that this book follows another: Fighting Ruben Wolfe. Unfortunately, that book appears to be out-of-print here in the U.S. and is for sale Used at like $30 a pop. Understandably, people don't want to get rid of Zusak's book, because I'm sure they want to reread them! My point is that if you can't get the first book, or you do not want to pay that much $, I felt like Getting the Girl can be read without needing to read the first. I did not feel like I was missing backstory, though I would like to go back and read the first.Now, as for my review, I won't recap the plot, because I hate recapping the plots when I write reviews, but also because this book is more about a character's journey to find self-worth than about any specific events. That isn't to say that there weren't some suspenseful moments where I couldn't tear my eyes from the page. Especially towards the end of the book, I was covering the words with my hand so my eyes wouldn't jump ahead.This story really snuck up on me. In the first half of the book, I was pulled through my the author's amazing writing, which is both poetic yet straight to-the-point. Not overwritten at all. At first, I was reading it in like 30-40 page increments at a time. I found myself rereading sentences and letting them settle in my mind. At some point in the middle, the story turned a corner where I could not put it down and stayed up late to finish it. In no way is this book sappy or melodramatic - it involves guys fist-fighting, playing sports, going after girls, etc. but it is very raw and real and it reached in and grabbed my emotions by the throat and didn't let go. I cried at least half a dozen times in the second half of this book.I just hope this review did this book justice. It was that good. This may be classified as Young Adult, but I think this is a great book for not only adolescent and teen boys & girls, but also for adult men and woman. So I guess I pretty much think everyone would love this book."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"In Getting the Girl, Markus Zusak takes us into the world of Cameron Wolfe, a high school boy living in the shadow of his older siblings: Steve who's smart and driven and successful at everything he does, Sarah who works hard, and Ruben, a fighter who earns the respect of all the guys in the neighborhood and who easily gets any woman he wants.But Cameron is a loner, with no friends outside his family, no girls to go out with, and nothing to do at night but wander the streets around his home. Things start to change for Cam when Octavia comes into his life. Octavia is the latest in a long line of girls dumped by Ruben. Cam sees her as different from the rest, and when she makes it known she's interested in him, Cam doesn't hesitate. But how does he open up to someone when he's so used to being alone? And how does he tell Ruben that's he's dating one of his ex-girlfriends?Cameron is an unlikely hero. Quiet and unassuming, he's caught between wanting to find someone who appreciates him for what he is and wanting to be more than what he lets others see of him. Getting the Girl delves into complex issues of family and the roles played by different members, and finding a way to be true to yourself while not being overshadowed by more forceful personalities.Markus Zusak has a way of writing that makes you forget you're reading about a fictional character and instead think you could run into Cam Wolfe on the street one day. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I loved this book. It was a quick, easy read. A lovely story about a teenage boy becoming a man,discovering love and finding a comfortable place within his family and the world around him. I have enjoyed all Zusak's books and I am amazed that someone so young can write with such feeling and understanding."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Well, I'll be honest. The only reason I read this book was because I had been blown away by the authors \\"The Book Thief\\". This one, on the other hand, simply needed to be blown away!I realise that perhaps I am being unfair, as this book was after all, geared to teenagers. Nevertheless, had expected to see the genius the author displayed in the other book.Would like to have read something else totally."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I bought this book for my teenage son because it was the sequel to Fighting Ruben Wolfe, which he had enjoyed very much. My son read both of these books as his monthly book report books for school. He enjoyed this book - Getting the Girl - as well, but not quite as much as he enjoyed Fighting Ruben Wolfe. He really likes the writing style of this author (Zusak), which apparently is very personal in nature, and pulls the reader into the character's mind-set. The book also arrived on time, which was great - my son was able to begin reading it fairly early in the month (though he still saved more than half of it for the last few days of the month, of course!). All in all, I give this book a very good rating."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"His first being Fighting Reuben Wolfe. Both are tight, crisp and strong. Both should be on your bookself if you love great, engaging stories with characters who jump off the page and plots that grip your heart, make you smile and leave you satisfied when you turn the last page."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"Cameron Wolfe is the youngest sibling in his family, and yet he feels that he is the least important one in the family. He feels that nobody really cares about, just as long as he does his chores, and does everything he is asked. He has two older brothers, and an older sister. He doesn't really talk to his sister, she keeps mostly to herself. His closet to age brother, Ruben talks to him a lot, and they get along great, until one of Rube's girlfriends come over, and he slowly falls into love with her. His oldest brother Steve, plays soccer, and is very well known for it. Everyone wants him on his team, and Cameron wants to be just like him. When Ruben brings home his \\"new\\" girlfriend, Octavia, Cameron falls deeply in love with her. She's not like the other girlfriends Ruben brings home. She actually cares for him, and acts like he is a human being. After awhile he starts writing on small pieces of paper what he feels. They become the major part of the book. He writes as though he is distant from himself. When Ruben breaks up with Octavia, Cameron takes advantage of it, and throws himself at Octavia, who gives in and they start hanging out. Ruben finds out and throws a couple punches at Ruben, and then Octavia's and Ruben's relationship is over. From then on they fight to keep each other close. There became many fights to show each brother that they are still brothers for life. In the end, Cameron saves Ruben's life, and never really gets the girl back. In the last piece of writing he writes. He writes about how its not about getting the girl, its about how the girl gets you."},{"Title":"Getting The Girl","review":"I really love Markus Zusak. I think he is an incredible writer, but he does not hold back with profanity or thoughts about sex - nothing graphic, but several references. The characters are so well drawn that it's as if I know them. They are genuine people living genuine lives. I really appreciate that the author can infuse so much emotion into a male primary character. Love it, but maybe just adults should read it!"},{"Title":"ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATION - BIOLOGY","review":"I have receieved a 5 on the May, 1999 AP Biology Exam, and one of my aids was this book, which I found to be completely worthless. The book lacks much information with only about the first 75 pages of large print text actually being dedicated to teaching you a whole year's worth of AP Biology! The rest of the book is just sample tests which look unprofessionally made and some questions are ambiguous. I was so frustrated with this book because the many misprints that it contained, I seriously do not recommend anyone who is taking the AP Biology exam to buy this book, instead, buy the Cliff's Notes for AP Biology, that is the best book ever for the exam, after reading that, I completely understood every aspect of Biology."},{"Title":"ADVANCED PLACEMENT EXAMINATION - BIOLOGY","review":"I bought this book by winter and read it on the plane in winter break.

Also discussed is the conception and creation of the show, which was originally a mere half-hour segment, rather than the full 60 minutes seen today. An interesting part of AMW's genesis was the search for a suitable host. One of the candidates was a certain New York prosecutor named Rudolph Giuliani. The Fox folks decided not to go with him, though, because they felt the future New York mayor's political ambitions would cause him to use the show merely as a stepping-stone to get into political office. It was a decision which, in hindsight (at least according to most New Yorkers) eventually turned out to be the right call.Then there's the most important part of putting an AMW segment together: selecting and producing the various criminal profiles that are submitted, as well as the process of casting for the re-enactments. Then there's the scouting of locations to shoot the scenes, as well as the host spots whenever Walsh goes on location. The book also goes into detail about some of their most notable captures in the series' first two seasons, including David James Roberts, the first capture the show was credited with, and John Emil List, who was caught almost 20 years after slaying his family. Although described in much more detail in \`Tears of Rage', there's also a section that describes John Walsh's tragedy that led him to crusade for children's &amp; victim's rights, and eventually end up as host of the show. Other bits include an appendix featuring the first 80-some-odd captures credited to AMW, and a brief interview with Walsh and the aforementioned Roberts.Although I found it to be a pretty easy read, this book's almost 400-page length took a while to get through. And even though it's dated by over a decade, it does give the reader a good idea of the genesis and history of AMW.\`Late"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I am appalled that any book on pregnancy would tout the &quot;convenience&quot; of having your labor induced.

(it may be easist for the doctor.) both of these are known to be false. in fact, it has been pointed out that the lithotomy position is the single most dysfunctional position for delivery. it actually makes the pelvis more narrow and increases the likelihood of tears. also, it has been the least common position adopted by birthing women throughout history and the world except in cultures that have embraced a medical approach to birth (and then, it was the doctors' idea). i think this is very irresponsible of the authors and the publisher should have balanced their perspective with that of natural-birth practitioners so that women could hear more than one viewpoint.there is some helpful information in this book. also, on a personal level, this was the book that prompted me to call my midwife because of the early contractions i was experiencing. some other books seemed to imply that the contractions could be normal. in other words, i think this book is most useful for the medically urgent issues that may come up during pregnancy but NOT for a normal, healthy pregnancy that is moving along smoothly."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"After the ton of pregnancy books I read while pregnant with my daughter, this was the only one to mention pregnancy-induced carpal tunnel.

Instead of taking on a \\"DON'T STAND IN FRONT OF THE MICROWAVE OR YOU'LL COOK YOUR KID\\" attitude it takes a very gentle, no-worries approach.Others have said this is for the woman who will be delivering in a hospital rather than giving birth at home. An element of this is true, but it's still a nice reference to have around when you have questions about what your body's doing.

I was so disappointed by this book.The Complete Idiot's Guide...breaks down your pregnancy not only by trimester, but also by week, which I found very helpful in my previous pregnancies. PREGNANCY FOR DUMMIES does not do that; it simply breaks down your pregnancy by trimester. Personally, I like the little weekly milestones, and I didn't have that with PFD.Overall, it is an informative book. There is great information to be found, however, it's not as detailed as I'd hoped. I also miscarried my pregnancy, so if I should ever become pg again this isn't a book that I'll use for reference. I'll either get my usual Complete Idiot's Guide or look for something else. But since I was looking to change things up a bit, I was not happy with the selection of this book and won't use it again. I wouldn't put it on my top five, either, if someone asked me for a book recommendation...But that's just my opinion ;)"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"There was nothing about midwifes, home births, doing it green, advice on how to give birth naturally. It is a very ordinary pregnancy guide, nothing special. A big disappointment as I love the dummies series. On top of that I didn't like the way it was organized. I would have preferred it to list the pregnancy symptoms/development month by month."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I realize that Dummies books are supposed to be fun, but this one can be just plain silly at times. At one point, the authors suggest that when a woman is in transition, her husband should &quot;promise her some expensive jewelry...promise to do all the cooking and cleaning for the next year...do whatever she says, even if she tells you to shut up&quot; and so on. I found this a little condescending and silly, as did my husband.I don't think the problem is with the authors, however. I think that pregnancy simply isn't a topic that lends itself well to a Dummies book. I had similar misgivings about the Idiot's Guide to Bringing Up Baby, too. I think some subjects are best handled in a format other than Dummies and Idiot's Guides. Now if someone would just write the Smart Yet Neurotic Woman's Guide to Pregnancy, that would be the book for me!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I purchased this book and What to Expect When You're Expecting at the same time. I read both and found this book to be far superior. What to Expect was full of opinion and condescension. Pregnancy for Dummies was written by actual physicians and presented information in a straight forward way that made me feel the book was a tool and not trying to guilt me into making certain choices. It also did an admirable job of providing information in a way that did not terrify me. I was on bed rest due to complications which were covered in the book. It was perfect for those, \\"Should I call my doctor?\\" moments. I was able to use the information in the book to find out if what I was experiencing was normal, was something I should bring up with my doc at the next visit, or was something that necessitated immediate attention. I would recommend this book for anyone having a baby."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Having just read back to back Pregnancy for Dummies and Idiots Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth. I thought I'd share some thoughts on one vs. the other, seeing as they are so similar.Dummies good: Chronology of pregnancy process week by week. I am referencing this now as my friends are going through their pregnancies to get an idea of what they are going through at whatever week they are at. Goes over common pregnancy myths.Dummies bad: \\"Daddy Alerts\\" totally belittling of men. No discussion of mother/parents relationship stability or network. No mention of home pregnancy tests.Idiots good: More information in more detail. Just simply covers more ground. Also has week by week chronology section, it's just not wholly structured that way as Dummies is.Idiots bad: Same absence of relationship/network or over the counter tests.Hope this helps someone along in comparing the two. If someones attention span is shorter go for Dummies. If you want a little more detail, Idiots is better. The Mayo Clinic guide seems to be the most highly praised overall pregnancy book out there, and I'll get one for reference, but as a cover to cover book, I wasn't that brave. Both of these are decent for what they are, intros for the clueless."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I bought this book because of the title and absolutely loved it. I recently went to the doctor and she was impressed at how much knowledge I had about pregnancy considering I have never been pregnant. The book is easy to understand and very informative.

My husband and I read it together and he enjoyed the &quot;For Dads&quot; parts."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because of the title, but it turned out to be the best pregnancy book I found.

It's organized extremely well, and covers many of the subjects and areas one would expect... and then some. I highly recommend it. I also highly recommend the video version of this book which I luckily had a chance to see a promotional copy of. Almost 4 hours in length, most of the same material is covered in a way that is far less difficult to absorb. It's well worth viewing. That said, the best approach is getting both. While the video presents the info wonderfully, the book is a fantastic research tool thoughout the course of a pregnancy. Together, they add up to more than their parts individually. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I'm lucky enough to have Dr. Stone assist me with my twin pregnancy, the book is great for those who can't actually see her.

I was given this book along with &quot;What to Expect When You're Expecting.&quot; It was by far much better than &quot;What to Expect...&quot; &quot;What to Expect...&quot; was too serious and made me feel guilty everytime things didn't go exactly as written."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"This is by far the best pregnancy book on the market.

Sinai to take us through this period in our lives."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I love this series of books - but didn't love this one. Some really important issues - like dealing with illness while pregnant - were dealt with in a very superficial way. I am pregnant for the first time, and I have a ton of really specific questions. This book does not go very far in answering those questions. For a first-time mom, I would suggest &quot;What to Expect When You Are Expecting,&quot; instead. This book simply does not provide enough detailed information to be truly helpful. It is more like an outline of everything you need to know; but you still end up seeking out other books to get more info, so save yourself the money and skip this one."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I bought this book not realizing that it was the UK edition. So the book spends a bit of time going over UK health care, welfare and medical benefits of UK citizens. Since I am American none of this pertained to me. Also some of the vernacular is different, understandable but different (mum = mom, labor = Labour). Some words were confusing if you didn't spend a minute to look them up such as Paracetamol (thats actually tylenol). Also things such as the food guide pyramid are different because each country has its own pyramid. If you are not from the UK, keep looking until you find the US version. THe technical baby stuff is the same, but much of the other stuff is much different. You will be much happier if you get the US version. If you are from the UK - You will love it"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I'm a great fan of Dummies books--but not this one.There are too many holes in the book: the authors only give superficial treatment to such important issues as preconception health, work-related issues (e.g. how to tell your boss you're pregnant), the implications of taking various types of drugs during pregnancy, and the role that doulas and midwives can play in prenatal care and labor support. Worst of all, the chapter on pregnancy loss failed to address the important physical and psychological issues involved: how to cope with your grief, the physical aftermath of pregnancy loss, when it's safe to start trying to conceive again, and how to cope with the stress of a subsequent pregnancy.The tone was also pretty heavy--even a little dry--as compared to your average Dummies book. I was hoping for a book with a bit more personality.If you're looking for a comprehensive pregnancy book that's strong on content, pick up The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby by John Sussman and Ann Douglas. If you're looking for a book with lots of style, pick up The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy. Unfortunately, this book doesn't have much to offer in terms of content or style."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Since I am a nurse and doula amongst other titles, I figured I would see what this book is all about and I must say that I was very disappointed in it, including the tv program that was based on this book. This book reminded me of going to a hospital-based childbirth education class, where it only gives you one side of birth- the medicalinized way or no way at all, with intervention after intervention. It did not describe at all any of the pain management techniques other than medications, nor did it describe or mention homebirth or birth center options, or even doula support. If you want to know all the current info out there, this book is definately not the one to get."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Honestly, this book is written for a third grader. One of the first things it talks about is how pregnancy is broken up into \\"trimesters\\" REALLY?wow. If you know NOTHING about birth/pregnancy then maybe you would benefit from this book. However I found it really unhelpful and I quit reading after a few chapters...."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"A truly \\"dumb\\" book - there are several other pregnancy guides that are much more useful (and still easy to navigate)."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Yup--it sure is for dummies. You would have to be as dumb as the day is long NOT to know the information in this book already. If you figured out how to get pregnant in the first place, you are smart enough to read something else. For example, there is a whole section devoted to myths about pregnancy, one of which tells readers that putting silverware under couch pillows will NOT help determine the sex of the baby. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"This book is pretty intresting it gives you information on what you have some questions about pregnancy, and symptoms too."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Pregnancy for Dummies is an excellent resource for the journey of pregnancy. It is extremely well organized, including a chapter on things to think about and prepare for before you get pregnant as well as a chapter on what to do with the baby once he/she is here! It is also very well written... with humor and anecdotes. I believe it is written by two OB/GYNs - a man and a woman who has had children of her own. Like the others below, I too found it superior to \\"What to Expect\\" which was pretty dry, and in a Q&A format that might not appeal to everyone. I'm not sure why the reader below freaked out about scheduled inducing, but you have to remember the book is written by doctors... inducing is convenient for them as well as perhaps the parents! Anyway, you won't go wrong with this book."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"This book was recommended to me by my OB/GYN, and I found it to be very helpful when I would freak out in the middle of the night... I particularly appreciated the fact that all the scary-but-rare stuff was put in one chapter at the end, so you could look it up if you needed to, but you didn't have to encounter it when you were looking for more routine information. Too many other pregnancy books have the scary-but-rare information throughout, so you spend time worrying needlessly."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I'm 36, overweight, hypertensive, and having my first baby. I wish Pregnancy for Dummies had been the first pregnancy book I had purchased. I purchased three others before I finally got this - in my third trimester - after I rented the DVDs. This book is very straightforward and has sense of humor. I took a childbirth class chock full of info on natural childbirth, breathing, relaxing, etc. This book was a great companion to the class - a basic primer. If you need additional information, go ahead and buy a couple more books (25 is probably overkill, though. It's a baby, not a thesis).Two of the books I purchased prior -- What to Expect When You're Expecting and the Mother of All Pregnancy Books were loaded with every horrible thing that can happen at every stage of pregnancy. Loads more information on genetic problems than you need in a normal pregnancy. Heaven forbid if you eat a Twinkie at 22 weeks!! I thought they were both alarmist. My AFP test said I had a higher chance for Down's Syndrome. I went to my amniocentesis test convinced that even if the baby tested fine that the amnio itself would cause me to miscarry. Long story short - the baby is fine and the amnio wasn't a big deal (just don't look at the needle!).I think today that most women understand they need to stop drinking and smoking, take prenatal vitamins, eat some vegetables, and see an OB. If they don't know already, then I can't imagine they'd be buying any pregnancy books anyway."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"This is my first time being pregnant and i didn't want to be overloaded with useless information.This book is to the point and easy to understand.My husband is also reading it and he enjoys the info he is getting out of it.Good work!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Overall this is a decent book. I like its no-nonsense approach to what changes a woman's body goes through during pregnancy, what things to look out for physically, and what types of things are checked by the doctor at typical office visits.However, based on the title, I expected it to be more comprehensive than it was. This book was almost exclusively medical information and I wanted to know other things like, when does one normally start taking birthing classes, when should one start buying things for the baby, choosing a hospital, and other basic topics.I understand if that wasn't the scope of this book, but, based on the description, it should have been."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"I purchased or was given three pregnancy books and this was by far the best. The others were written by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (my husband is an OB/GYN) and What to Expect . . . I did not like the organization or content of What to Expect . . . and the ACOG book was a little skimpy on the practical questions I had. Pregnancy for Dummies was funny and answered all my questions with medically appropriate advice, according to my husband whose medical opinion I highly respect. It is light-hearted at times, which I liked a lot, but still provided serious and complete advice - not for those without a sense of humor though! All in all, a very good choice, especially for first time mothers."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"Really smart, thorough, and intelligently-organized.

These authors aren't afraid to have a little fun along the way. You won't want this to be your only pregnancy book, since it tends to gloss over a lot of important issues, but it makes a good read for expectant parents who aren't too proud to admit that they don't have a clue about what pregnancy is all about. If you buy the Dummies guide to this, that, and the next thing, you'll want to add this book to your collection, too.My only criticism is that the book isn't likely to score too many points with Dads. They're given their own five page chapter that tends to spoonfeed and condescend to them (&quot;Remember that after you arrive on the labor floor, all attention is focused on Mom, not you.&quot;), but other than that they're pretty much ignored."},{"Title":"Pregnancy for Dummies","review":"This book is extremly well written. I am in a child devolopment class and my teacher uses the movie &quot;Pregnancy for Dummies&quot; to explain important conecepts. The book makes all the medical terminology simple to understand.

Definitely not a book you need to read more than once (because of course you will also be experiencing it in real life) so if you are having one child I suggest borrowing from a friend or looking into a library?

I can't praise this book highly enough - this is the first time I've reacted strongly enough to a book to volunteer a reader review. During the last 9 months expecting my first baby, there was never once this book couldn't answer my questions or doubts, big or small. It is easy to read in digestible chunks as you progress, but also more importantly easy to use as a reference source for those quick questions e.g. hearburn (nformal), tingly fingers (can happen, normal), PUPPS rash (can happen, normal), night sweats (can happen, normal), when bleeding is to worry or not, etc. Very reassuring and informative. Although I was only fucussed on the progressing pregnancy and later the delivery/birth, surprisingly I still found myself regularly scouring this book's pages post-delivery e.g. breastfeeding, baby healthcare, immunisations, etc. A wealth of tips and resources. As well as presenting just 'medical' or 'physiological' accounts, the book also presents *practical* info, e.g. what to expect at the hospital, what to pack/bring, baby items to have ready at home, the first days after delivery (normal or caesarean), first days at home, etc. It's like having a combination of your own private midwife, and Mum, on call 24/7.

I've been thinking about them recently (I read a BUNCH of them in past years) and decided to try to find a source. Every one of the Shell Scott books I've read over the years was truly enjoyable, light, fast, humorous, &amp; hard hitting. Recommended."},{"Title":"Shellshock","review":"My father always enjoyed reading the novels in this detective series which were very popular in the 1950s and 1960s. So, I decided to read some as well. But, they seem to be hard to come across. I believe that this novel was the last that the author wrote. All of the books in this series are centered about a private detective named Shell Scott, an ex-marine with a bleached-blond crewcut. The first book in the series (there were more than forty) was published in 1950: &quot;The Case of the Vanishing Beauty&quot;. &quot;Shellshock&quot; begins when Scott is asked by a friend of his, an attorney in Arizona, to take on an unusual assignment. The attorney's client has to find a daughter that he had abandoned years earlier. And Scott has to do it without knowing the daughter's full name, without using the client's name, and do it discretely in only a few days. In addition, because of the client's former criminal past and current associates, there are men attempting to stop Scott from completeing his task. Interestingly, it is mentioned in the novel that Scott is thirty years old in this novel. That would mean that, when Scott had his first published case in 1950, he hadn't even been born yet! Of course, we readers probably shouldn't read that much into these serials. The Shell Scott stories are probably required reading for serious students of the sub-genre of hard-boiled, private eye novels."},{"Title":"Shellshock","review":"This was the first book I read by Richard Prather,I was instantly hooked. I now own 15 of his books, most of which I had to buy used. I strongly recommend this book for anyone with a passing interest in detective fiction. Since Shell Scott and I have the same taste in women, I find the books so easy to read I just can't put them down until I'm done. If you haven't read anything by Richard Prather, This would be a great first book to read, as it is very well written."},{"Title":"Zaha Hadid - Space for Art: Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati - Lois & Richard Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art","review":"Fantastically unique and genuinely honest inside through the design concepts and completion of the Museum.

As images they can be seductive, but it must be admitted that they have nothing to do with architecture. Hadid's buildings prove the point that her work is not really about architecture or space much as she professes otherwise. Remove her computer graphic program and the you get the crude interpretaion of ideas not fully worked out, passing themselves off as a building. The CAC was designed on screen without any reference to site or context, and it shows. There is no attempt to adress scale (human or urban), and the massing is loud and arrogant. (&quot;Look at Me&quot; - it screams.) Sadly for Cincinatti, they are stuck with this amatuerish and crude building. As for the book, it is predicatable in its praise and cliched in its language. The photos are irritating insofar as they make difficult views more unreadable than they need be. I can't help wondering if this is just a trick that weas deployed because there are no satisfying compositional views within this building that could be taken.

Still drawn by his instincts, Terrel is on the Skua, a ship heading for the ice covered island of Myvatan, where he believes resides another Elemental. And when he recognizes a vision from his dreams, the rock carved in the shape of a large whale described in the Tindaya Code, he has to convince the captain of the ship to let him disembark.Emerging from Savik's Whale's blowhole, Terrel soon finds himself caught up in a war that's been going on for centuries between the Black, Red, White and Gold quarters. Taken to Saudark by the Black who suspect he's a spy, Terrel later discovers a society where water is the vector of magic. Indeed, whereas men fight with swords and spears, the Magians, all women, use the potency of water to create powerful weapons in the form of weather spells. It won't be long until Jax, taking over Terrel's body one day, impresses Tofana with his weathermage skills. The chief Wizard will then devise Fire Starters, a weapon capable of destroying their enemies utterly in the blink of an eye. If Terrel doesn't do anything about it, it will be an appalling massacre, and a threat for the whole world of Nydus.The book goes on to describe the terrible war of magic in which Terrel reluctantly takes part, trying to make his way to the Elemental at the same time, and making new, invaluable friends on the road. Among them are Tegan and Yarek, two young people who, like him, are eager to bring peace back on Myvatan.Whereas our hero's overall goal is still the same, this volume is a tad different from the previous ones in the sense that Terrel's search for the Elemental takes a slightly less ponderous place in the story, leaving space for a little more action. The new characters introduced here are again very likable and their society quite interesting. However, not much is said about the further deciphering of the Tindaya Code and the solving of the Dark Moon and Sleepers' mysteries, as Alyssa and the ghosts intervene less often. And I have to admit I kind of missed them, and had the felling that the pace had somehow decelerated. Let's hope this is only the quiet before the storm, as I'm looking forward to reading how things resolve in the climatic conclusion I'm expecting in Alyssa's Ring, the last volume."},{"Title":"The Red Glacier (Guardian Cycle) (Bk. 4)","review":"Ive never read a book like this befor. Ok...so what if I don't read alot of fantasy novels? This book is amazing. If you enjoyed the Lord of The Rings and/or THe Silmarillion (by J.R.R) this book is for you. It took me less then 4 days to complete it. I just couldn't put it down. I found myself at 3am in the morning reading this thing. Thats how good it was. There was great combinations of romance, action, suspense that really got my emotions going. The twists and turns take you on a great fantasy ride. I did not read the books prior to this one though which I regret. If you have yet to read &quot;The Dark Moon&quot;, &quot;The Jasper Forest&quot;, and &quot;The Crystal Dessert&quot;, I suggest that you read those first as I was slightly confused in the begining. I can't wait to read ALyssa's Ring. It must be amazing too. Bravo to 'Julia Gray'."},{"Title":"Love and Other Stories","review":"Checkhov is skilled at the minute description.

This book makes a wonderful corrective to the memoirs of Singapore's leader, Harry Lee Kuan Yew, and a great companion to Christopher Lingle's Singapore's Authoritarin Capitalism, Ian Buruma's essay, \\"The Nanny State of Asia\\" (in his book, The Missionary and the Libertine) and Francis Seow's A Prisoner in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore (...).The other essays include a distressing one on the destruction of the rainforests of Borneo by Malaysian government officials in Sarawk - local officials use their five year appointments to loot the place, the fear of poverty in them overriding any environmental concerns, which (sadly, sadly) seemed a very western - ie, foreign - concern after reading this.The Burma chapter is perhaps the most sobering of all - here the whole sad history of Burma's ruthless, inept, corrupt post-independence rule is laid out for the reader; Burma was ironically far more prosperous under British rule, when it known as \\"the rice bowl of Asia\\" (ie, it exported rice to the region) than under so-called independance. How very sad. Sesser's book is very informative and will be of great interest to anyone planning to vist/live in the region, or simply visit from the armchair."},{"Title":"The Lands of Charm and Cruelty: Travels in Southeast Asia","review":"This is a fascinating book covering lands and peoples that get little notice in the West. Stan Sesser does not give us a touristy travelogue, but heavy-duty investigative reporting into the darker sides of these little known countries of Southeast Asia. His five long essays in this book cover Singapore, a bizarre construct of communist capitalism; Laos, a country that remains friendly and resilient even after a few centuries of being used violently as a pawn by larger empires; Cambodia, a land of strange politics where the genocidal Khmer Rouge have been welcomed as possible saviors into the modern regime; Burma, a potentially prosperous nation managed with horrific incompetence by paranoid and xenophobic hardliners; and finally Borneo (specifically the portion of that island controlled by Malaysia), which offers a chilling lesson in environmental devastation. It would have been nice to see similar coverage of Vietnam and Thailand, but there are only so many places Sesser can cover so strongly in one book. Sesser's main theme in his coverage is indeed charm vs. cruelty, as in these nations he has encountered some of the friendliest peoples and cultures in the world, which are being oppressed by the world's harshest regimes. While there have been many political developments since this book was written, especially in Cambodia, Sesser still offers many valuable lessons in the histories and social dynamics of these nations. Instead of a happy tourist diary of scenery and monuments, we get both the light and the dark of Southeast Asia in the most informative and enlightening ways."},{"Title":"The Lands of Charm and Cruelty: Travels in Southeast Asia","review":"Stan Sesser adds a great deal to the dialogue on S.E.

It's been a little while since my last great true-crime find. This book is meaty and well-researched. It's got extensive quotes in the sisters' native French, with English translations (most of the time.) This is *not* a light or a quick read, which is why it's been living on my coffee table so I can go back to it in little sessions. I read far more fiction that non-fiction, and even for non-fiction this one's a bit dense! It's the only book on this subject that I could find online, and worth reading.

But here one can at least say what one likes or dislikes.I like this book of poems. In &quot;Shepherdess with an Automatic&quot; one finds short poems, usually no more than a page in length, that flash in your mind as if in recollection and that build upon each other to create a presence that suggests your past is much more than a burden to overcome--it is your inescapable undersong.One finishing stanza that I think marvelous, from &quot;Nocturne&quot;, &quot;The trick is to remain unenticed by another:/not impressed, but not beyond impression,/adrift and at home in recognizable streets&quot; is perhaps what seems most central to these poems and this poet.In &quot;Small Life&quot; (I'd love to reproduce it, as it is my favorite and my wish for you to know it if you do not buy this book) the poet reflects upon a photograph by Henri Cartier-Bresson, Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, depicting a man, no more than a shadow of a man really, frozen in mid-air, about to step into the middle of a large puddle of water. &quot;Is this//what it means to be immortal...&quot;? &quot;--See how the shadow below/stays close, attuned/like a soul or most perfect mimic.&quot; (A shadow, a soul, a mimic is &quot;at home and adrift in recognizable streets.&quot;) After reading this several times I had to find a copy of the photograph (I've pasted it into my book!).Satterfield's poems seem to hover just outside of experience, or rather, outside the reflection upon experience--apparitions returned to make sense of the past.&quot;I like to feel water slip/off the skin,/the lightness after/what cannot be lifted/is lifted.&quot;&quot;What is the body?//A barrier to the crossing.&quot;&quot;How I'd like to believe in hope,/but the past, it seems, is like gravity,/the force that keeps us in place.&quot;At home and adrift but always in the same (recognizable) place."},{"Title":"The Children of the Poor","review":"This book contains numerous typographical errors that make it difficult to read.

I was very unhappy with false advertising."},{"Title":"Meet Kirsten: An American Girl (Book 1)","review":"ISBN 0590437879 - As a newly converted fan of the American Girls books, Meet Kirsten was a pleasant read for me. I do have some problems with it, but I'll save those for last.Kirsten and her family arrive in America from Sweden in 1854. On the ship, she's made a great friend in fellow traveler Marta, but they are separated in New York when Kirsten's family goes on a day before Marta's. New York is loud, dirty and crowded with people who speak languages Kirsten doesn't recognize - a problem when she becomes separated from her father. Traveling by train, steamboat and even on foot, the family faces challenges all the way to Minnesota, where they join Uncle Olav and his family.***SPOILER ALERT*** I was very curious about how realistic the story could be without a death aboard the crowded ship. When the family disembarked and everyone was still alive, I was disappointed (for the lack of reality) and relieved (because it is a childrens' book). Reality returned with a death (I won't say who) along the way across the country and I was rather surprised that they handled it well. If your child is apt to be upset by the death of a character that they identify with, please read the book before handing it over. The illustrations are average and rather bland, with one exception being the burial.

In the book, the love that Kirsten feels for her family and friends seems to inspire her to cope with her new life in America. The day to day struggles she faced in the new frontier brings adventure and danger once she leaves Sweden.Mrs. Shaw makes it easier for the reader to imagine what is happening in the story. The scenes in the story have lots of details. The author has given the characters individual voices that express their emotions very well. For example, Kirsten was sad when she said \\"Mormor (grandmother) said, \`When you're lonely, look at the sun. Remember that we all see the same sun.'\\" As I read this I felt that Kirsten was actually sad, but she was trying to cheer up her friend, Marta.This is an interesting book to read because I think that learning about the past helps us understand the present. This is knowledge that we can all benefit from.The author, Janet Shaw loved to read so much that she fell asleep reading a book once. She loved reading and writing so much that she became a writer.Meet Kristin should be read by all girls and boys who like American history and surprising stories. So head to the library, book store, or the American Girl store to get this amazing book now."},{"Title":"Meet Kirsten: An American Girl (Book 1)","review":"My preschooler is ready for chapter books, but most chapter books are either meant for beginning readers, with a controlled vocabulary, or are meant for older kids, with content that isn't appropriate for a four-year-old. The Kirsten books are both appropriate read-aloud material for preschoolers on up, with good stories, clear plot lines, simple yet not controlled vocabulary. Using the story of a little girl to teach historical fiction leads to discussions about different time periods, often leading us to do further research about modes of transportation, geography, farm life, immigration, etc.My daughter really enjoys these books, and so do I. If her dad reads a chapter, I find myself going back and reading it so I know what I missed! A previous reviewer was upset by the use of Swedish words. The only Swedish words in the first book were \\"Tak\\" which means \\"thank you\\" and was clearly understood using context clues, and her names for her grandparents, which my daughter found no more confusing than her friends' names for their grandparents: Nanny and Pappy, Granny and Pop Pop, Grammie and Grampie, etc.Yes, Marta dies. Yes, Kirsten gets lost in the city. Yes, the family faces hardships. What family doesn't? But the message is that the Larson family sticks together, works hard to overcome their difficulties and make a better life for themselves. The parents clearly love the children, the children love and respect the parents, and they all understand the importance of working together for the good of the entire family. Along with the Little House on the Prairie books, this series is wholesome and educational while being fun and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Meet Kirsten: An American Girl (Book 1)","review":"Kirsten Larson is my favorite out of the American Girls collection.

In the story she finds a friend a friend that was to on the ship with her. What a great time for Kirsten. She also has to travel in America to get to her aunt, uncle and two cousins.My favorite character is Kirsten. She is my favorite because kind and nice.

I was very pleased"},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Paul Tillich's romp through the church is done so through the eye of Existentialism, a philosophical way of thinking that took root in the mid-twentieth century. One of the most surprising ironies of Existential thinkers is the retrogressive application of this way of philosophizing projected on every philosopher, theologian, or Jewish prophet who caught their attention, all the while disavowing the label themselves. This book could have been more appropriately titled \\"A Existential Interpretation of the History of Christian Thought\\" since Tillich cannot spare us his own commentary through page after page of theological thought and development.Like any good liberal theologian, Tillich is sympathetic towards those historically labeled as heretics or whose thought life was controversial. His section on Schleiermacher can only be described as a short historical treatment mixed with his own rambling apologetic against the neo-orthodox thinkers who attempted to marginalize the thinker's importance.Tillich spares no expense to show that the original thinking of the church was a mix of allegory, metaphor, and existential thinking that was repressed by what he calls \\"the simple ones,\\" those who clinged to literal renderings of scripture. The real fight for Tillich though is not doctrinal, but philosophical.If by now you're wondering what any of this has to do with a fair and equitable treatment of an historical summary of theological reflection, you are right in asking this question. While the New Yorker calls this an \\"excellent guide for the non-specialists,\\" it's likely a student new to theological study will come away with strong opinions superintended through the lens of 20th century existentialism.Some specific examples will help to drive this point home. In Origen, he sees the \\"greatest theologian\\" of the church, and one who systematically denied the reality of hell. The \\"simple ones\\" (primarily the magistrates of orthodoxy), out of sheer malice and a hatred of their enemies, repressed his work as a means to inflict mental torment and anguish while pronouncing eternal damnation on those who in life they could not bring under their authority. Tillich has no problem summoning motive and establishing psychological profiles where there is none specifically to be derived.He reinterprets the doctrine of creation ex nihilio as a metaphor for expressing a reality about God's all-encompassing being. For Tillich, there is nothing in the cosmos that resisted his creating, which he contrasts to Greek thinking in which matter was eternal and existed alongside the eternal gods.Neo-Platonism is also introduced as a precursor to existential thinking. For example, evil is not a force of spiritual opposition to the good. But it is \\"participation in non-being.\\" By non-being, Tillich asserts anything that is not self-generating or self-sustaining so as to have a reality in itself, namely material reality.At times Tillich is so utterly wrong that it bears pointing out a few examples: In recalling the life of Apollinarius of Laodicia he seems to group him with the doctrine notable in Eutychus and fails to mention his most famous formula, namely that the mind of God replaced in the person of Jesus his human mind.When it comes to Theodore of Mopsuestia, there are more than a few attempts to turn him into an orthodox thinker. For example, Tillich mentions that in his theology, God the Son suffered and the human nature must be adorned. In the same paragraph, Tillich says God both suffered and did not suffer a few lines down. Confusing? But he says nothing about his heresy as he has brought up in other thinkers. This detail is conspicuous, although it should be mentioned that Mopsuestia like Nestorius after him, believed the union was one of ethical union.Meanwhile, he represents the Western thinkers as adopting a notion of the gloried Christ as one that returns to oneness with God, saying that the human nature was \\"swallowed up\\" in the heavenly one\\" after his ascension into Heaven. Here, Tillich seems to make the Western churches followers of Marcellus. I'm aware of no authorized view in the West, be it in Roman Catholic or Protestant circles where the churches believe that the Incarnation is an impermanent event. Plus, this implicitly denies the pre-existent oneness of the Trinity, a concept too Tillich repristinates in a form of modal monarchianism as he explains it in a later chapter.By the time he gets to Aquinas, he informs his readers that his \\"five proofs\\" is a valid analysis so long as it remains an analysis and not an argument. Remembering that Tillich finds an existential parallel in everyone he likes, as far as analyses go, Aquinas' five proofs, we are told, are by and large \\"existential.\\" He even calls Jesus and Socrates existentialists because they moved people.This goes on and on, from personal asides such as he wishes the theological climate in Germany worked with the same agape love present in American theology, or his own affinity for Kierkegaard as he studied under Martin K&auml;hler. There is simply too much Tillich. Tillich, however, is known for this kind of bait and switch tactic. His monumental work Courage to Be, had nothing to do with \\"courage\\" in the traditional sense, but was really a reinterpretation of \\"faith.\\" So to read this book as a history, would be first to know how Tillich operates.My recommendation is that this book be read by individuals interested in Tillich's theology not as a book impartial to a history of Christian thought. There are much better books out there, for example Thomas Oden's Classic Christianity, which simply presents the historical thought or doctrine and provides chapter and verse support from the ancient authors, allowing you to judge for yourself."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"These lectures clearly reveal Paul Tillich as one of the greatest, most brilliant, theologians of the 20th century. The book summarizes and critiques the entire history of Christian thought (with special emphasis on German theologians). Tillich's appraisals of others are completely fair. His own insights that he shares along the way are those of a devout and brilliant liberal Christian. He summarizes his approach as follows: &quot;Theology must see both sides, man's essential nature, wonderfully and symbolically expressed in the paradise story, and man's existential condition, under sin, guilt, and death.&quot;I have only one reservation. This may well be Tillich's most accessible work, as one reviewer states. But that speaks more to the difficulty of Tillich's other works than to the ease of working through this treatise. It is brilliant, it is beautiful, but it is tough going. I had to reread many passages two or three times to understand them (and a few I simply had to give up on). The book is absolutely worth the effort, but for anyone looking for a somewhat simpler (but excellent) introduction to Christian thought, I would recommend Alister McCrath's &quot;Christian Theology, an Introduction.&quot;"},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Paul Tillich was perhaps the most important and influential 20th Century theologian writing in English. His books, however, are tough slogging--especially for those who haven't read all the many continental philosophers and theologians with whom Tillich was arguing. This book, which consists of transcriptions of lectures Tillich gave on the history of Christian thought, is, besides being a wonderful introduction to the subject matter, the best possible introduction to Tillich's own thinking. Wonderfully accessible, engaging and lively, this book is thoroughly readable.

With precision and clarity he connects various movements and strains of thought which one might otherwise consider unrelated, or, more importantly, unimportant to oneself. Ultimately, the book (consistent with Tillich's existentialist leanings) attempts to point to theology's inherent purpose--personal application. He does so in this book with impeccable scholarly and intellectual skill."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"This is an extraordinary set of lectures by the great theologian and cultural analyst. While hewing to the main intention of presenting a history of Christian thought, the lectures necessarily encompass a history of Western thought in general from Greco-Roman times to the present, given that specifically church-sponsored Christian thought developed and must necessarily develop in close, thoughtful, and fervent dialogue with significant trends of thought, feeling, imagination, and morality in the larger cultural environment. Each section of this book is stimulating and rich in insight. Your future reading (or past reading, for that matter) on any topic he covers in these lectures will surely profit from attending to what he writes. Tillich has a knack for getting simply to the root of any matter.One important implication of the lectures given by Tillich on ancient and medieval Christian thought and policy is this: though they may differ as to what they draw from that tradition, that tradition belongs to all Christians."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Paul Tillich - one of the greats in Theology - systematic, thorough, enlightening.

This book (subtitled \\"From Its Judaic and Hellenistic origins to Existentialism\\") was published in 1967. The Preface indicates, \\"A History of Christian Thought originated as lectures delivered by Tillich at Union Theological Seminary in New York ... the second part of this volume contains tape-recorded lectures which Paul Tillich delivered at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago during the spring quarter of the 1962-63 school year.\\" Tillich himself states in the Introduction, \\"Actually, nobody would dare to present a complete history of what every theologian in the Christian Church has thought. That would be an ocean of contradictory ideas. The purpose of this course is quite different, namely, to show those thoughts which have become accepted expressions of the life of the church.\\" (Pg. xxxviii)Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"The idea of transcendence, that there is something that surpasses empirical reality, was prepared for Christian theology in the Platonic tradition.\\" (Pg. 6)\\"Celsus' deepest criticism of Christianity was neither scientific with respect to history nor philosphical with respect to the idea of incarnation; instead, it was one which arose out of a basically religious feeling. He said that the demonic powers which, according to Paul, had been conquered by Christ are actually ruling the world.\\" (Pg. 25-26)\\"The church had become a state church. This was the price which had to be paid for unity. The emperor did not command the content of the dogma, but he exercised pressure.\\" (Pg. 72)\\"What Tertullian actually said was: 'The son of God died: it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd'... It must not be taken as a literal expression, but by means of a paradox a pointing to the incredible reality of the appearance of Christ.\\" (Pg. 98)\\"Pelagius ... does not see that Christianity also stresses the tragic universality of sin ... Pelagius had a point, but he did not see the profundity of the Christian description of the human situation.\\" (Pg. 124)\\"The church of this period lived in constant anxiety about the presence of the demonic within itself and in others. This is the background to the trials of witches ... It is the basis for the demonic persecution of the demonic.\\" (Pg. 148-149)\\"I could say that where God is not the prius of everything, he can never be reached. If one does not start with him, one cannot reach him. This is what Anselm himself felt when he realized the incompleteness of the cosmological argument.\\" (Pg. 165)\\"One is baptized for life; this had the practical consequence in the Middle Ages that all the baptized fell under the law of heresy.

I find in this text a very good presentation of the early church. Ths issues with all it's complications and consequences are presented in a clear and concise manner which I do not find in much other texts. Tillich's presentation of the church fathers gave my much new insight.But then for some strange reason I seem to be missing the same clarity in other parts of the text. For example, in presenting Augustine and Calvin on the matter of predestination -- for me a very disturbing and unconvincing theory -- he describes this concept sympathetically it seems, but for me he leaves open too many obvious questions, in stark contrast to the very good presentation of the church fathers very most aspects and objections seem treated. If predestination, why should anyone being \\"bad\\" attempt change if it's predestined? What about this very cruel image if a God who seems merciless and without concern about innocent new-born but unbaptized children being \\"lost\\"? And the marks of being elected by good through good morals and good economy -- what about the obvious consequence that poor people are looked down upon rather than being helped since they then obviously according to this view are not in good standing with God? Which is in stark contrast to Jesus caring for the poor and unsuccessful people?While Tillich's great description of the early church gave me new insight and clarity, the unanswered questions of these other aspects left me quite disturbed after reading the text. What does Tillich think about it? -- not clear to meStill, in many ways a good book to read. Like any book to be balanced by reading others as well."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"Understanding where Christianity comes from sets the stage to question modern Christianity. A Pastor once told me to forget all the modern Christian books and concentrate on what the early Church Fathers said, what the great theologians contributed to what we understand today. A History of Christian Thought begins that process. Understanding what Christianity originally meant is to understand the what Christianity has forgotten. This book has a lot to teach regarding Christianity."},{"Title":"A history of Christian thought","review":"From beginning to end, this book is a masterpiece of Christian intellectual history.

The depth of his insight and the breadth of his knowledge are stunning. There is a hardly a page in this book from which I did not learn something that will stick with me for the rest of my life.My only complaints are hardly complaints at all. The first is that Tillich, being a Protestant, has a decidedly Protestant outlook on the history of Christianity. This is, of course, something I knew going into it and so, again, is not something that I can complain about but only warn potential future readers of. The other is that I do wish that the lectures of Fr. George Florovsky which represent a lacuna in the chronology of this book had been included. But, again, this is hardly something I can complain about, given that this is Tillich's book and not Florovsky's.I recommend this book for anyone interested in the history of Christianity, in the intellectual history of the West, and in the thoughts of the greatest minds the world has yet produced as examined by one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Garden in Autumn","review":"I had checked out this book several years ago at the library and enjoyed it throughly.

I don't mean that in the positive sense, but in the publishing sense. Much has been published on the holocaust, Nazi occupation and the party Hitler hosted. History demands that people write it and people demand to hear \\"the truth\\" about the past. \\"Born Jewish\\" offers something different, something that isn't necessarily in demand, but is neccessary for the canon of work on the war and aftermath of the holocaust.Marcel Liebman, for anyone unfamiliar with his other work, is a reknowned Marxist/Leninist/Soviet Union historian and historical analysist. This is clearly, his most personal work, but he does not leave his politics or his academic work at the door. \\"Born Jewish\\", as he says, \\"questions history\\", not in the sense of the accuracy of the event(Liebman writes how dismayed he is that the world did not fully accept Hannah Arendt's accounts of Jewish collaboration with the Nazi's as having actually happened.) but in the sense of the accuracy of historical accounts of it.The new perspective Liebman adds is one often obscured by accounts of Nazi occupation and anti-semitism: that class conflict did not dissolve the day the swastika was raised over Europe's cities. In fact, the Nazi's capitalized on the class difference amongst Jewish populations. For Liebman, the horror of his brother's execution at Auschwitz is intimantly connected with the horrors of exploitation and collaboration within the Jewish community.Liebman composes his memories carefully and beautifully, resisting sacrilization of experiences he realizes must answer to history as much as to his own heart, and criticizing the radical Zionism that he was to see flourish during his lifetime.The incredible forward by Jacqueline Rose is a great appetite whetter for the book. She sums up the book far better than I ever could: \\"Amongst other things, this memoir stands as an extraordinary rejoinder to those who insist that Israel is the only and definitive answer to the genocide of the Jews...It is one of the strenghts of [the memoir] that Liebman can be so unerring in this analysis while at the same time acknowledging the point where understanding trails off into uncomprehending terror, where the most painful part of mourning trumps all rational thought.\\"I highly reccommend this book for anyone who was interested in the slough of memoirs on the subject. It should be read alongside Judith Butler's new book on mourning, violence, 9/11, anti-semitism and the Israel-Palestinian conflict, \\"Precarious Life\\"."},{"Title":"Born Jewish: A Childhood in Occupied Europe","review":"This is a spellbinding account of a Jewish teenager in Belgium, during the war. The second of four boys in a loving Jewish family in Brussels, Liebman gives density and texture to the anxieties, terrors, and perils of life under the Nazis. Always on the run, sometimes together, sometimes apart, Liebman is a superb observer of the venalities and kindnesses that accompany him through these tragic days. It is also a compelling coming of age story. All except the last chapter, which takes advantage of his survivor's status to mount a soap box against racism, with a special target being Zionism (hence Jacqueline Rose's breathless intro). Even aside from its polemics, the chapter feels like it is tacked on to what is otherwise a superb addition to Holocaust memoirs."},{"Title":"Born Jewish: A Childhood in Occupied Europe","review":"Born Jewish: A Childhood In Occupied Europe by graphically authored by Marcel Liebman and deftly translated by Liz Heron is a vivid memoir of one man's childhood tale of Nazi control, familial struggle, and the betrayal he faced from more powerful Jews in times already hard. As a revealing and historically important biographical account of international history during the second world war, Born Jewish is an invaluable documentation which is very highly recommended for historians and laymen alike, as each and all may take some interest and understanding in this book. Born Jewish is a compelling and valued addition to the growing library of Holocaust literature so fundamentally necessary if the world is never again to experience genocide on such a massive and methodical scale."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"Did your copy have 187 pages? If it had more, I would very much like to know how your version finishes. I, and others have commented on how Ms. Fitzgerald leaves a certain ambiguity at the end of some of her works. She invites her readers to finish the story based on what she has shared, or the reader has understood. This time around, I first felt I was reading a work like Dickens' unfinished, \\"The Mystery Of Edwin Drood\\". However this time it was a bit abrupt, a door opens, the reader pops their head in, and, she decapitates the reader with efficiency that Dr. Guillotine would have admired.This is the fifth of her nine novels I have read, and it will be difficult to top this work. Everything I have read has been excellent, so the pleasure of reading her work is just a matter of degree. The complaint as stated at the beginning is more frustration than anything else. So much appears to be shared with the reader, that ultimately deception is far to mild a word, and then when you think the puzzle is complete; she adds another thousand potential pieces by bringing the story to an abrupt halt.But the story really is quite complete. After you read what she has written a logical explanation follows. She sets the process in motion, steps back, and knows the reader will continue to follow her lead. She pulls the strings of a reader like twine on a top. Once pulled she can step back, the top continues to spin. She is as manipulative as any writer I have had the pleasure to read, she also respects her readers with the presumption they will read what she gives them, and though left wanting more, will be able to put their own finish to what she has written.I cannot use any names, as it would ruin the piece. She produces one character that is such a brilliant fraud, that when his actions come to be known, his victims are left with mouths agape when they should be throttling him. As she has done in other works, she has children that are well beyond precocious, and other players that the reader is routinely lead to underrate.Ms. Penelope Fitzgerald was a great discovery for me, as I knew nothing of her or her work. She started writing late in life, and sadly died earlier this year. The collective work she has left behind, is as good a written legacy any writer could have left, for all who love to read."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"This is the most likable of the four PF novels I've read (I admire all of them). Her ability to create characters with extreme economy is breath-taking. Even more than in _Blue Flower_, she illuminates a milieu distant and time and space, the Moscow of a British businessman in Moscow ca. 1913 (i.e., on the verge of the First World War, the Bolshevik revolution further off). I don't really know that there were households or businesses like those she brings to life. If the concrete details are imagined rather than researched, her accomplishment is even greater, but it is also considerable if she has &quot;merely&quot; brought back to life vanished Russian and expatrate English ways of being.One of Fitzgerald's many gifts is creating prematurely wise prepubescent female characters (as in _The Bookshop_ and _Offshore_) who view the fumblings of adults with clear-eyed but mostly gracious bemusement and fitfully attempt to keep the adults from totally mucking up. Dolly takes that role here. The omniscient narrator has her own compassionate bemusement at the frailities of adults who want to be loved and try to be useful to others. Frank and Selwyn are prime examples from this book. As far as I can tell, the only thing Ms. Fitzgerald can't do is create rounded prepubescent male characters (Ben here)."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"Many writers tend to get stuck on one theme and write the same story over and over. Not Penelope Fitzgerald! I've enjoyed THE BOOK SHOP, OFFSHORE, and THE BLUE FLOWER, each so different that I'm amazed the same author penned them.THE BEGINNING OF SPRING is my most recent Fitzgerald reading, and it may be my favorite so far. Frank Reid, the main character, runs a printing company in Moscow, a business he inherited from his father. Frank was born and brought up in Moscow although he is still considered a foreigner because his parents were English. Frank was sent back to England to polish his education and while there he married Nellie, a woman who felt constrained by the narrowness of her English hometown. She was ready to leave that town, but she wasn't prepared for Moscow and could never quite adjust. One day, she gathers up their three children and leaves on the train to return to England. Not being able to cope with the children, she sends them back to Frank before she continues onto England. Frank is mystified by his wife's actions and doesn't know if he will be able to cope with the children either.This is the story of a domestic crisis, but the backdrop of unrest brewing in Russia clearly presages the Revolution. The year is 1913. Frank doesn't know how much longer he can maintain his business, and he's not sure where his sympathies lie.Ms. Fitzgerald does have one trick: she seems to lead the reader one direction, and then bam! you find that's not where she was headed afterall. I thought THE BEGINNING OF SPRING was quietly wonderful, but when it concluded I found that it just seemed quiet and the resolution was resounding."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"This is an evocative book, I was transported back in time to pre-communist Russia; her descriptions pull you into the story and hold you. I purposely read only two chapters at a time because I didn't want to leave that place and those characters.

After all, Penelope Fitzgerald is one of the finest writers we have today. She writes precisely and succintly which is difficult considering the complexities of her characters and topics. However, what I find lacking in &quot;The Beginning of Spring&quot; is an interesting story line. When Ms. Fitzgerald tells the story of Frank Reid and his wife Nellie who suddenly leaves one day without returning she presents us with an interesting premise. How Frank copes with this loss and measures he must undertake to raise his children is well accompolished by Ms. Fitzgerald. It is amazing to me the clarity that Ms. Fitzgerald has in the human condition and the psychological process we go through to cope. However, the other major story line about Frank's business and the political upheavel of Russia seems laborious. I lost interest in her discussions about Russia's communism and the effects it has on Frank's business - too much time appeared to be spent detailing the Russian society. Perhpas it is just me, but unlike &quot;The Blue Flower,&quot; a magnificent piece of literature which focused more directly on the characters, &quot;The Beginning of Spring&quot; is more of a statement about Russia and the times which left me unsatisfied. I have to give this novel a good rating, however, as Ms. Fitzgerald's writing is nothing short of perfection. I will continue to read her works."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"A truly beautiful and moving book permeated with humor, insight and compassion. It describes an English family living amidst the overwhelming chaos of life in Moscow in the early nineteenth century. Penelope Fitzgerald reminds one of Jane Austen with her soft, ironic touches and delicately-drawn characters."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"Fitzgerald, in this book as with another I've read, shows herself to be a precise and evocative miniaturist. The sweep of the events surrounding the main character, the English gentleman Frank, is brought into his small world, one of limited perceptions and a desperate need for equilibrium. A great deal of the novel is happening out of the range of Frank, and just as much is unperceived or misperceived by Frank. So that the ending is a series of shocks, some of which are not quite comprehensible.Frank sees it all in domestic terms: his wife has left him, and left him with the chidlren; he is advised by his friend, the seemingly muddle-headed idealist Selwyn; visited by his brother-in-law, also seeming to be muddle-headed, Charlie. But the Russian Revolution is swirling around him, and encroaches upon that world, re-defining this crisis in Frank's small life.Fitzgerald at once brings a wry humor to the novel, but it has an Austen edge to it, and is in an environment that adds a shadow of pervading seriousness. At the same time, we see more than Frank but less than many others, caught between the English humor and the socio-political storm.It is a subtle and provocative book. And short."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"Imagine Moscow in 1913: The Russian society is in transition; traditional political structures are being challenged by popular movements; industrial technological advances are leading to workers' unrests; an atmosphere of foreboding is palpable in every strata of society including among the English expatriates in Moscow. Frank Reid, an English business man, born and raised in Moscow, is highly conscious of the changing political landscape. After years of training in Western Europe he has returned to Moscow with his young family to take over his father's large printing press operations. Following an apparently harmonious and organized period during which the family had settled, Frank's wife Nellie suddenly departs without warning, leaving Frank to balance challenges at work with new responsibilities at home with his three children.Penelope Fitzgerald's novel weaves a delicate and gracefully imagined portrayal of the man at the centre, his attempts at normalcy despite inner doubts and conflicts. In fact, all her characters are exquisitely drawn and remain memorable beyond the reading of the novel. Selwyn Crane, the poetry-writing accountant who is also a follower of the Tolstoyan movement, is one such character, who is endearing despite his rather bumbling personality. Amongst other, possibly questionable, advice he recommends to Frank to hire the young Russian peasant girl, Lisa Ivanovna, as a governess for the children. She remains a mysterious, yet attractive, character and may not be as innocent and placid as she appears.Frank's consistent efforts to stay out of the political turmoil of the moment, by refusing to use his presses for political pamphlets and other such material, are in some way mirrored by the author's concentration on the private lives of her protagonists. However, the complex realities of the day are always present, bubbling under the surface, subtly evoked and touched on by Fitzgerald, almost as an aside, through brief vignettes of specific incidents or, and especially, as part of the different lively conversations. Reading the exchanges between Frank and his various very engaged counterparts - whether other expatriates or Russian business partners - is a constant enjoyment.While the novel is not really plot driven at all, it is full of off-beat scenarios that underscore Fitzgerald's much appreciated sense of humour and irony. Finally, Moscow in March cannot be imagined realistically without the weather. Fitzgerald succeeds superbly as she weaves her suggestive descriptions of the unpleasantness of the wet, grey, icy, foggy atmosphere of late winter into the story and the moods of the character. One scene stands for many: Frank takes a different, rather unpleasant route home through slush and ice along the river to escape an encounter with an older English woman who the minister's wife may want to suggest as a governess for Frank's children. And, of course, every winter ends with the beginning of spring...Fitzgerald's writing is a delight for her lively depicted characters, her often understated yet affecting portrayal of social conditions and human relationships, set in a specific period of time. Having previously readThe Blue Flowerwith great interest and enjoyment, I was highly motivated to read this novel. Her novel adds a lovely intricate portrait of a group of Muscovites that included English expatriates to the rich Russian literature dealing with that period in time.Finally, I have to admit to a personal bias as regards the theme and time characterized in this novel. Having inherited a distant family connection with Moscow, I have visited Moscow several time and studied Russian language and culture. Despite the time lag to 1913, some aspects of Fitzgerald's novel still ring very authentic to me. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"My immediate assessment is that THE BEGINNING OF SPRING is not a \\"great\\" novel in the sense of one freighted with meaning and significance, though it has a certain elusive, chimerical quality and I might be missing something. It is, however, highly literate and thoroughly entertaining, even captivating. It is the fourth or fifth of Penelope Fitzgerald's novels that I have read (including her Booker Prize-winning \\"Offshore\\"), and it is the one I most enjoyed reading.The setting is Moscow in March 1913, as the ice melts and spring unfolds once again. Revolutionary fervor and social unrest also are blossoming. The protagonist is Frank Reid, an Englishman who has spent most of his 40 years in Russia. At the beginning of the novel, his English wife Nellie suddenly leaves him and their three young children, apparently to return to England, though this is uncertain. A short while later, a young Russian woman from a peasant background, Lisa Ivanovna, enters the Reid household to look after Frank's children and what often blooms in spring blooms in Frank.All of the characters are characters, and there is something slightly amiss or askew with each of them. Despite the surface matter-of-fact frankness of the characters, things often are not what they seem. The story is told swiftly, deftly, with wry and sometimes barbed humor. The narrative is generously dosed with historical details that make it a masterpiece of time and place. For me, there was only one false step, a scene near the end touched with the supernatural or with symbolism. Otherwise, THE BEGINNING OF SPRING is an extremely well-crafted novel.P.S.: The title of this review is the motto of one of the characters, and it is aptly exemplified with the last twist of the novel, which occurs in its last sentence."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"This book was really good. It showed Russia's personality beautifully. Although it was an intriguing story, it lacked a lot of action. If you're looking for a book with a somewhat non-existent plot, then this would be great for you. Just when you expect the story to get more interesting, it ends. There isn't much of a conclusion so the story doesn't really wrap itself up. I found it somewhat frustrating, how it just ended in a sentence. It is a very well written novel. It wasn't very long, which was nice. Fitzgerald does an excellent job describing Russia and the characters' feelings. Although it can be boring and dry at times, the reader truly becomes thrown into the lifestyle of a very interesting Russian family."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, when looking for a light-weight book to bring with me on vacation. I'd not heard of the author before, but was intrigued by the description.I love the prose - it's clean and the descriptions are both spare and evocative at the same time. Each character has depth - even though the descriptions are often spare and even though they may only be present for a few paragraphs. I'm reflecting on the book a couple of weeks after reading it, and I already want to re-read it for the writing, if nothing else.I love that the story is set within a domestic context, but reflects the larger political and social changes underfoot in Moscow and Russia (a bit like a Tolstoy novel, no? Though the plot here is far smaller in scope and the writing is more incisive.) The children are especially engaging and the way the father interacts with them is tender and feels very, very real. The twists and turns of the plot could have taken the book on tangents that would have derailed the plot - but instead they are dealt with in a matter-of-fact way. I don't know much about Russian history of that time, but I suspect it was the way that anyone in Moscow (particularly an expat) had to deal with life during that time in order to remain sane, given the many uncertainties that were a part of daily life. I was trying to put my finger on who the father reminds me of, and I think he has a bit of Atticus Finch in him - very practical, very moral, very concerned about his family and very matter-of-fact.Finally, I really loved the ending - without giving anything away, the novel ends with strings untied and more questions unanswered than answered, but I still felt satisfied. I'll definitely be reading everything I can get my hands on by this author and will be recommending this book to others."},{"Title":"The Beginning of Spring","review":"This is the third novel I've read of this writerand what strikes me is the compelling sense ofplace and time even though I have never beenthere.A parallel would be if you were at a play andthe moment the lights came up and the actorsbegan speaking you were somewhere else in yourmind's eye.What Penelope Fitzgerald does not give us, Ithink, is a plot that has any definitive resolution.

Into the mix came the exhaustic study by Schweitzer of the Quest for Jesus. So it is not surprising that a half dozen books promptly appeared which sought to explain Jesus' personality using these newly invented ideas. The 3 most famous books came from Germany (George de Loosten), France (Charles Binet Sangle), and the US (William Hirsch), and they concluded that Jesus was mentally unstable, specifically, paranoid. Interestingly enough they relied on Schweitzer's 1901 book to make their claims, so the mortified humanitarian produced this brief book to counter their claims (and deal with his guilt).The Psychiatric Study of Jesus is not so much a study of anything, as it is a refutation of the theories of the aforementioned authors. Schweitzer does a good job of summarizing their arguments and then systematically refuting each. The impact of Schweitzer's book is clear from the fact that in the next 100 years there were as many books written on this subject as in the first 10 years of the 20th Century - in other words, after Schweitzer's book appeared almost no one else took up the subject.The book is well written (it is Schweitzer, after all), but modern scholars will find the documentation sorely lacking and the interpretations are fairly naive. Moreover, Schweitzer offers us very little of his opinions about Jesus's mental status, apart from the arguments against his psychopathology. But these shortcomings pale in comparison with the historic value of the book.In brief, this book can be enjoyed by almost anyone with an interest in Jesus."},{"Title":"The psychiatric study of Jesus, exposition and criticism (Beacon paperback)","review":"You probably already know that Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965) was a famous theologian, philosopher, and organist before he decided to become a medical missionary to Lambar&eacute;n&eacute; in west central Africa. This brief book was actually his doctoral thesis upon completing his medical training. (The translator notes that \\"On several occasions he was on the point of choosing an easier subject for his thesis.\\") It was first published in book form in 1913.Psychotherapy was a \\"new\\" subject then, and several persons took it upon themselves to attempt a \\"medical diagnosis\\" of Jesus of Nazareth, and actually concluded that Jesus was mentally deranged/diseased. One of their key arguments was that Jesus believed that the world was going to end within his lifetime (a viewpoint which, ironically, Schweitzer helped foster). Schweitzer wrote his thesis to refute several such writers.In his Foreward, Dr. Winfred Overholser (then President of the American Psychiatric Association) cautions, \\"Two general comments may be made on psychiatric diagnosis. First, one must have a good case history. In the case of Jesus, we have virtually none.... Furthermore, we know nothing except by tradition of any but the last year or so (at the most) of Jesus' life, and in all accounts there is a gap of at least 18 years. We know little of his relationship with his mother and siblings and, while we know something of the multifarious social, religious and economic influences of the time, we know very little of the manner in which they played upon him and moulded his feelings and reactions. The perils of diagnosis 'a distance' are great!\\"Among Schweitzer's conclusions are these:\\"(A) number of acts and utterances of Jesus impress the (critical) authors as pathological because the latter are too little acquainted with the contemporary thought of the time to be able to do justice to it.\\"\\"From these false preceptions and with the help of entirely hypothetical symptoms, they construct pictures of sickness which are themselves artifacts and which, moreover, cannot be made to conform exactly with the clinical forms of sickness diagnosed by the authors.\\"\\"The only symptoms to be accepted as historical and possibly to be discussed from the psychiatric point of view--the high estimate which Jesus has of himself and perhaps also the hallucination at the baptism--fall far short of proving the existence of mental illness.\\"I would highly recommend this book to anyone intersted in Jesus, as well as his \\"psychology.\\" (It's also revealing in terms of Schweitzer's own ideas, as well.)"},{"Title":"Jews in Poland: A Documentary History","review":"Iwo Pogonowski's book is a veritable mine of information about Polish-Jewish relations since the Middle Ages. This subject has been badly distorted in the English-language publications, mostly for reasons that have nothing to do either with history or honesty. &quot;Jews in Poland&quot; needs to be read slowly, in small doses, with frequent returns because sometimes a very important fact is hidden in a footnote or some such obscure place. This volume looks and reads like a scrapbook, and the impression is reinforced by its graphic aspect.&quot;Jews in Poland&quot; is full of very instructional maps and diagrams, it also carries a good selection of illustrations (although their quality is rather so-so). All in all, a book that stands head and shoulders over any other treatment of Jewish-Polish history in the English language."},{"Title":"Jews in Poland: A Documentary History","review":"In recent years, there has been a great deal of emphasis on Polish anti-Semitism. This is despite the fact that anti-Semitism existed virtually everywhere, and in Poland never approached the level which Jews encounted in many other European nations. Moreover, the positive aspects of Polish-Jewish relationships have been virtually ignored. Pogonowski's excellent book does much to show, in fact, how Jewish communities flourished in Poland."},{"Title":"Jews in Poland: A Documentary History","review":"This review expands an earlier one, and refers to the 1998 paperback edition. This latter edition contains several articles not found in the original hardback edition. The authors trace many mischaracterizations of Polish-Jewish history in the American press. The informed reader can appreciate how little has changed since then. For example, the recent publications of NEIGHBORS and FEAR by Jan T. Gross have resurrected many old Polonophobic canards that should have been, if nowhere else, laid to rest by this 1998 edition.Pogonowski shows, in detail (pp. 296-297) how the pro-German Zionists formed the Zionist Association in Germany in 1897, and how they opposed the resurrection of the Polish state. Instead, Max Bodenheimer, its president, proposed the creation of a German Protectorate out of the western parts of formerly Russian-ruled Poland. (The German-ruled and Austrian-ruled parts of Poland would remain the same). The new German protectorate would be German-Jewish ruled; the latter facilitated by the Germanophillic orientation of many Jews living on Polish soil, the abundance of Jews in influential positions, the affinities of Yiddish to the German language, etc. For a time, famous Jewish existentialist philosopher Martin Buber supported this plan. The reader can clearly see that the concept of Judeopolonia (Judeo-Polonia) was not simply an anti-Semitic fantasy: It had some basis in fact.This work contains an extensive expose of the so-called Kielce Pogrom--A Soviet-staged event (pp. 403-422). The Soviets wanted to discredit a free Poland in the eyes of the west, and to terrorize the remaining Jews into fleeing to Palestine. Other anti-Jewish actions in Hungary and Czechoslovakia got little press in the west, probably because anti-Communism had been relatively weak in those countries.In Kielce, the tale of the blood libel had been spread by agent provocateurs (p. 414). The Jews were shot by Communist police, and club-wielding fake \\"steel workers\\" also took their toll. Other Communist police involved in the so-called pogrom had been dressed as goons or priests. There is the fantastic myth of the 15,000 to 75,000 cheering Polish onlookers (p. 406), a myth recently repeated by Gross in his FEAR. The actual number of Polish onlookers, most of whom were probably motivated by curiosity, didn't ever exceed several hundred at its peak. After the \\"pogrom\\", inconvenient eyewitnesses met their deaths. The Kielce files themselves were burned in November 1989, shortly before the Communists left power.Pogonowski makes clear that the Communist anti-Jewish policies of 1968 were not Polish. They were plainly Soviet-dictated (pp. 30-31).The atlas itself is chock-full of useful information. The reader soon learns that, despite the frictions and mutual prejudices which sometimes developed between Poles and Jews, Poland was historically one of the most tolerant nations in the world for Jews. If the fact that 80% of the world's Jews, at one time, made their home in Poland does not prove this fact, then what does? This book makes it clear that Poland had been centuries ahead of others in terms of human rights and religious tolerance."},{"Title":"Jews in Poland: A Documentary History","review":"Despite the frictions and mutual prejudices which sometimes developed between Poles and Jews, the fact remains that Poland was historically one of the most tolerant nations in the world for Jews.

This book was good, quick to read but not terribly in depth. This author did not do the research that was done by author Bella Stumbo in the book Until the Twelfth of Never: The Deadly Divorce of Dan & Betty Broderick. While my sympathy is first with the Broderick's two young sons and their daughter Lee, I truly felt sorry for Betty. The Broderick's older daughter Kim I have mixed feelings for after reading Stumbo's book.In some ways she seemed eager to hang her mother all the while getting everything she needed or wanted from her. In some area's you can see they she takes after her dad and not in a good way.As I said this is an afternoon read, for the true story read Bella Stumbo's book."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story","review":"I had never heard of Betty Broderick until I picked up this book (I understand there are two other books on the subject which have better reviews). This is Betty's story from Betty's point of view (the author based the book on prison interviews with her and tries hard to make the case that Betty was a hapless victim) and yet, to me, she still comes across as unsympathetic.This does not mean I have any sympathy for her husband, Dan, or his mistress, Linda, both of whom acted abominably towards Betty, but she could have handled the situation very differently, in a way which would have left her with her children, a fair financial settlement, her dignity and her freedom.Betty, however, was definitely her own worst enemy. Sure Dan fought her in court - and she consistently played into his hands. When you're fighting to regain custody of your children and you want to show what a stable, responsible parent you are, you don't leave obscene messages on your ex's answering machine, you don't vandalize his property, you don't drive your car through his door (!), you don't flout restraining orders...especially when your ex is trying to show the court that you're unbalanced.She claims that she couldn't hire a lawyer because she couldn't come up with a retainer. She comes from a well-to-do family - she couldn't persuade her parents or siblings to lend her the money?She claims that Dan was terribly abusive to her throughout their marriage, starting with their honeymoon (and yet she told Oprah that their marriage was 'perfect'). Why did she stay? Well, partly it's because she had no identity other than being a wife and mother - and partly because she loved the lifestyle of being married to a rich man (the designer clothes, the luxury vacations, etc).Still, the story is a fascinating one."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story","review":"True crime cases hold a grim fascination for many, and the Broderick case rarely fails to disappoint. After reading books on the subject authored by Bella Stumbo and Bryna Taubman, I made an attempt to familiarize myself with as many aspects of the case as possible, reading archived newspaper accounts, court transcripts, viewing TV clips, etc. The one indisputable fact about Betty Broderick is that she suffers from selective memory, chronically lying and twisting facts, events and dates when it best suits her. Even sympathetic writers and interviewers freely acknowledge this. To base a book solely on her 'story' is to present a warped one sided tale that begs to be held beneath a microscope. The author of this work should be thankful that the book sank without a trace and that no one seriously challenged her tale, for a mountain of legal documentation exists that could easily refute much that is presented here. The fault lies with the author however and not with Betty Broderick, for anyone spending 15 minutes with the subject is aware that her story is so tinged with anger and a lack of complete responsibility that it must be considered just that, a story.The most inflammatory statements in the book are Betty Broderick's repeated assertions that Dan 'stole her kids and wouldn't give them back' when court records show that Betty forcefully and willingly dumped all 4 children on his doorstep and refused repeated pleas from her attorneys to take them back unless they 'were returned with the financial settlement she wanted.' Additionally, veiled references to physical abuse between Dan and Linda, Dan's 'alcoholism,' his physical abuse of the children, and frequent attacks on the character of Dan and Linda only highlight Betty Broderick's disturbed and narcissistic character and should not have been included without back-up from solid and indisputable sources.The only purpose this book serves is to ensure Betty Broderick serves her full prison term with no hope of parole; there is just too much factual information in the records to disavow this book, and anyone familiar with the case will realize that Betty remains what she has always been- a \\"pro\\" at shifting details and facts to suit herself and still refusing to acknowledge her responsibility in destroying the lives of her children and those around her."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story","review":"If you ever wondered how a writer can crank out a book moments after the fact, then read this book.Fact Checking should be mandatory or at least a consideration."},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story","review":"first everbody keep saying that betty work a lot of jobs to put him thur school but did u no she was a nurse that she quit so that why she work alot a jobs she went from makeing good money to mim wage that why SHE work alot of if she would stay a nurse she would of not had to work three jobs so stop makeing dan look so bad yes its hard when someone dose leave you for another worman but who kills for we all deal with the hurt after u heal from the hurt then u move on and hopeley u can become friends thanks judy ps to dan and betty kids u are doing a great job in life keep up the good works and may hurts go away allways forgive"},{"Title":"Forsaking All Others: The Real Betty Broderick Story","review":"This woman works her butt off to put this ingrate through, first, med school and then law school.She suffers countless miscarriages because HE doesn't believe in birth control.And then he throws her over for a bimbo in his office who wasn't half the woman Betty was and wages an emotional and psychological war on his abandoned wife.I agree with the one juror: \\"What took her so long?\\"As for the female prosecutor, she's nothing more than a \\"pilot fish for the patriarchy.\\""},{"Title":"Jamaica Plain, MA","review":"When I wrote this book on Jamaica Plain, MAI was amazed at the rich history of this neighborhood of Boston that was once a part of Roxbury and originally known as the Jamaica End of town.

The end sentence on the back of the book \\"...becoming a mother is an expression of creativity, not its silencing\\" really got me to buy this. Some stories are very good and touching, but others just weren't interesting and were poorly written. The editing is also poor, as there are mistakes in many of the stories. The vast majority of the stories were written by women attempting to balance a writing career with motherhood. I really questioned the judgment of a few of these women, since I don't think it's appropriate to feed your kids junk food all day and have frozen waffles for dinner so that you can have time to be 'creative.' Some stories read to me as if these mothers were more concerned with their own achievement than with raising their children, and that the goal of the day was usually to get away from the kids and find time to work. However, most of the mothers did mention that their children were incredible boosts to their creativity, and some were very insightful.

Obviously a lot of work for something that you may only intend as the holder for a &quot;real&quot; present, but that is the point. These lavish, artistically crafted containers ARE worthy gifts in themselves, and showpieces of your skills from more than one area of crafting.The author starts with lists of basic necessities for cardboard box crafting, detailing types of cardboard needed for various parts of boxes and glues, tools, etc. Next, there is a Techniques section, with step-by-step illustrations of the various steps in boxmaking, such as batting, wrapping, assembling, and lining strips. A similar section on ribbon embroidery techniques and other embellishments follows. These instructions are basic enough to serve as valuable references, and someone who has never attempted ribbon embroidery before can conceivably do a decent job if he/she pays careful attention.The &quot;real&quot; fun comes in the largest section, the projects lavishly photographed and laid out in two-page spreads. These boxes are arranged from beginners skill level at the beginning, to the advanced crafter level at the end. Each project uses new box building skills that build upon the skills practiced in the last project.I know this all sounds extremely complicated and exhausting; but I have found it to be worth it due to the fabulous results. There are scalloped, diamond shaped, and heart-shaped boxes of various sizes at the introductory level alone. If you decided to stop there, you would already have some beautiful victorian-inspired treasures that are totally unique from any prefabricated craft store box, many with hinged and fitted lids, lined in velvet or silky materials and padded sumptuously for a feminine feel -- and you would not have to spend more than an hour or so of total work. But mere boxes are just a starting point. Further along are a pincusion shelf with two drawers, a teapot, a crescent moon, a 12 inch doll's travel wardrobe case, and more.If I had to nitpick some cons I could mention that it was a little inconvenient to have to spend time at the copiers enlarging the box patterns. The only other drawback is the time you will spend shopping for just the right fabrics and notions to decorate your finished products -- which, after all, is one of those drawbacks that plagues many other crafts as well, including quilting and making clothes. So, if you are already involved in some other area of crafting, you may have some of what you need already lying about.Because of the involved and time consuming nature of this discipline, I have sadly had time to devote to learning only a few of the beginner's boxes and one more advanced project, a romantic keepsakes box with a drawstring pouch for a top instead of a lid. This particular box has been variously enlarged and reduced to fit the size of intended birthday, shower and Christmas gifts, changing color schemes and notions to reflect the occasion. It has become a favorite of mine and the recipients often treasure these containers long after they have eaten the chocolates or dried fruit that was inside. So I believe that if you only find one favorite as I have, it will become like a special signature gift that you will learn to make quickly as you practice it.In a nutshell, this is a great book for those who wish to put time and care into something original and beautiful that will be used as gifts and keepsakes."},{"Title":"Making Decorative Fabric-Covered Boxes","review":"I give the book a wow!!! great box making book.

This is due to his unusual talent in explaining the abstract ideas contained in Hassidic thought. In this book, besides dealing with the basic concept of the Jewish redemtion with great profundity, the author (not withstanding his controversial status among hassidic Jews) is the first to have written Rabbi Kahns teachings in English. An additional comendable factor is the authors way of lightening up the intence, deep matters at hand.

The authors (all of whom are highly trained in their respective fields) have opened up to their readers a beautiful and yet painful world which those of us who live in freedom and prosperity probably never knew existed before.The writing is clear and precise and the reader is offered many direct quotes as well as regional aphorisms and Yiddish terms used by the Eastern European Jews to describe their friends, family and surroundings. At times I was filled with laughter, other times brought to tears by the words of those who lived in the shtetleh of Poland and Russia.The Jews of Eastern Europe were a simple people of faith---in their God, in their little run-down communities, in their family and friends---but they also lived in a world which evoked a constant sense of fear knowing that anytime day or night they were subject to the violent whims of their Gentile neighbors. During the worst pogroms, Jews were attacked and sometimes murdered in front of family members and friends. And yet, because of the social conditions in Eastern Europe, those who witnessed the horrors of a pogrom might actually come face to face the very next day with those same Gentile attackers in the marketplace, and they were expected to act as if nothing at all had happened. We of democratic laws and justice would not fair so well in such a society; they had no such choice, for to complain was to risk one's life and bring down further destruction on their shtetl.With few exceptions, the Jews of Eastern Europe lived and died with dignity and courage despite the sometimes horrible conditions under which they were forced to live, and this book describes this world more simply and clearly than any other I've read. For them, life truly was &quot;With People&quot;, and it opened up my eyes to the incredible value of my own family and friends and the freedoms so richly enjoyed in this, the nation of my birth. I was deeply moved by this book and would recommend it to anyone, regardless of their national origin or religious faith. John Edward Flynt"},{"Title":"Life Is With People: The Culture of the Shtetl","review":"This book was recommended to me as something every Jewish person from Eastern Europe who is at all interested about their past should read. Since I fit the description, I decided to give it a try. It was not disappointing. This book is written as a work of anthropology, where the authors make an attempt to describe the worldview of the shtetl as fully as possible, and to describe what it was like to live in the shtetl. Some parts of the book read like a primer on Judaism, which is necessary to understand the context behind the shtetl life. But, it is by no means a primer on Judaism. It is a description of the main aspects of shtetl life, such as religious celebrations, marriage, education, men's and women's roles, etc. The book is written in a lively voice that shows the enthusiasm and interest of the authors. The best part of reading this book for me was recognizing the \\"voices\\" of my grandparents in quotes from interviews with former shtetl residents, which were a main source for this book. Apparently, classic gems such as \\"Woe is me, you're out without a hat again! You'll put me into an early grave!\\" and \\"No evil eye!\\" have a long shtetl pedigree. I also think that it let me better understand certain parts of the American Jewish culture, particularly Jewish political preferences and attitudes towards charity and education. One thing that I think the authors could've done better is to differentiate between uniquely Jewish aspects of the culture and the non-Jewish culture of Eastern Europe.

It does not name names and focus on individuals. But rather gives a generalized picture of areas of life , of attitudes and perceptions. The central idea is that the Jews of the Shtetl lived in intimate connection with each other, and shared a system of values and a way of life which had despite the background in poverty a special sanctity and beauty. The authors claim that the people of the Shtetl had a shared ethos and were at home living traditional Jewish lives.This masterwork describes Jewish communal life in the small villages of 'The Pale of Settlement' those areas in which Jews were confined to live in in Tsarist Russia. It presents an idealized portrait of a society in which there was a special closeness and intimacy between people, and too a special sanctity. It depicts a traditional Jewish world in which values were shared. There is an innocence about such a world and a special beauty. The authors do not focus on individual cases but draw their portrait as a generalized picture of the ideas, attitudes, customs , patterns of behavior of this society.They too make it clear that this is the world destroyed by the Shoah, the Holocaust. It is a world for which many Jews might still be nostalgic about.As a young man this book had a great positive influence on me. It was the basis of a Ph.D. thesis in which I tried to understand just how 'Jewish' the emerging American- Jewish Literature of the fifties truly was. Measured against the standard of 'Life is with People' Bellow , Malamud and Philip Roth did not seem tremendously Jewish.Only one writer in America seemed to me to be truly understanding of the kind of Shtetl world presented in this book i.e. Isaac Singer himself.In any case this is a most highly recommended look at the world 'of our mothers and our fathers' and is certainly worth knowing about it."},{"Title":"Life Is With People: The Culture of the Shtetl","review":"Works such as this - and the manufactured images of Roman Vishniac - has been behind so much of American Jewish identity and Jewish communal policy; to have read this book (along with Howe's equally 'expurgative'\\"World of Our Fathers\\" - which had little to say of the religious life of American immigrant Jewry), is to have been \\"informed\\" about \\"our\\" past. They've also fed into the ascension of fundamentalist elements of Orthodox Judaism in fertilizing minds for planting false notions of noble and glorious sufferings of generations past, of unified communities, centuries of uninterrupted authenticity and observance.

It seems that everything that Marlborough did is described as prescient and extraordinary. John Tincey, who wrote earlier Osprey volumes on 16-17th Century English military history, provides a compact and well-written narrative of the Blenheim campaign, but it is imbued with the usual chauvinistic myopia and reluctance to examine inconvenient details that makes it difficult for modern readers to evaluate what really happened in southern Bavaria on 12 August 1704.Tincey begins with an overly succinct introduction and campaign chronology, but makes up for it in good sections in opposing plans and opposing armies. It is clear that the French were over-extended in 1704, as Tincey notes that they were trying to conduct nine different campaigns simultaneously (although the main effort, more or less, was in Bavaria). Marlborough's main goal, in moving his army from its secure base in Holland to link up with his Austrian allies in Bavaria, was to prevent the isolated Austrians from being knocked out of the war. However, Tincey's description of this as a \\"strategic maneuver\\" is inaccurate - it was an operational maneuver; if Marlborough's army had been transported to attack the French in Canada, that would have been a strategic maneuver. As far as the audacity part, there is a \\"hyping\\" here of a not-very extraordinary administrative march - Marlborough's march was through mostly friendly country and was unmolested by the enemy - that ignores truly audacious maneuvers such as Hannibal's march across the Alps, Sherman's march to the sea and Napoleon's Ulm maneuver. In the section on armies, Tincey describes how the Anglo-Dutch adoption of \\"platoon firing\\" gave Marlborough's army a big tactical advantage over the French, who still fired by successive lines. On the other hand, Tincey's British chauvinism is evident in the slight mention accorded to the role of other coalition members in the campaign, such as the Danes, Prussians, Hessians and Imperials. Did they use platoon firing, too? A close examination of the order of battle reveals that only about 17% of the Allied troops at Blenheim were British and that the largest contingent was Dutch. However, like Waterloo historiography, British historians minimize the contributions of their erstwhile allies and promote the idea that it was the genius of their commander and the bravery of their handful of troops that carried the day.Blenheim 1704 has five 2-D maps (French campaigns of 1704; Marlborough's March to the Danube; the capture of the Schellenberg; Tallard's march to Blenheim; Marlborough's approach march), three 3-D Bird's Eye View maps (the battle opens; Marlborough's attack; the Franco-Bavarian attack) and three color battle scenes (Marlborough's meeting with Prince Eugene; the Foot Guards cross the Nebel Stream; French infantry in Blenheim surrender).Tincey's tactical description of the battle is coherent, but lacks analysis. He suggests that Marlborough's style was to employ a combination of deceptive fixing attacks to spread the enemy out, then to aggressively mass his forces to achieve a Blitzkrieg-style schwerpunkt at a chosen point. This looks accurate because this is what transpired in the battle, but it is debatable if this was the result of planning, luck or just dumb enemy mistakes. The Battle of Blenheim was essentially a 1-1 odds fight with the French on the defensive behind some \\"slow-go\\" terrain; the Allies had an edge in cavalry and the French had an edge in artillery (Tincey makes no effort to discuss why the French artillery didn't turn the battle in their favor). The French made three critical mistakes that cost them the battle: (1) they failed to provide an effective covering force between them and the enemy, (2) they failed to cover \\"dead space\\" in front of their positions and (3) they committed their reserve at the wrong place and time. To be sure, Marlborough exploited every one of his enemy's mistakes and this is to his credit, but it is not clear that he had a plan for dealing with an enemy who didn't make so many mistakes. If the French had not made any one of those mistakes, Blenheim would have been an entirely different battle - probably a sanguinary battle like Malplaquet in 1709. Marlborough gambled that his enemy would make mistakes and his audacity - in that sense - paid off, but it is important to remember that anything less than a complete victory would have meant failure of the campaign's objectives.As for the scale of the disaster, Tincey's suggestions that the armies of Louis XIV were smashed at Blenheim ignores several inconvenient facts: (1) at least one-third of the enemy losses were Bavarians, not French, (2) most of the thousands of French prisoners taken would be paroled within a short period of time, Tincey admits that the best regiments were captured virtually intact in Blenheim and (3) the actual permanent French losses - perhaps 10,000 dead - represented only about 2-3% of total French military manpower available. Granted, the loss of Bavaria as an ally and the defeat of French forces east of the Rhine were serious setbacks, but they were hardly irreparable to the French cause, as Tincey suggests. Indeed, the French were able to recover the initiative in the Low Countries after Marlborough left in 1711 and end the war in a decent negotiating position. Indeed, the fact that Louis' armies could sustain more heavy defeats at Ramillies, Oudenarde, Malplaquet and Turin and still end the war holding many of their gains indicates that there was a great deal of strength left in the Sun King's empire."},{"Title":"Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's masterpiece (Campaign)","review":"It is hardly surprising that in 2004 Osprey should seek to capitalise on the 300th anniversary of the Battle of Blenheim. This title, number 141 in the \`Campaigns' series is written by John Tincey with colour illustration by Graham Turner.The books in the \`Campaigns' series are apparently written to a strictly enforced format. In addition to the text the author has to provide all illustrations apart from some large format colour illustrations and maps. Whilst a set format may provide an appropriate template around which an author can work one has question whether a \`one size fits all' format is appropriate to the diverse campaigns that are encompassed within the series.In accordance with the Osprey house style the author has provided introductory chapters on background to the campaign, opposing commanders, armies, plans and orders of battle. These are basic and provide the same sort of information available in the works of the late David Chandler or Sir Winston Churchill's biography of the Duke of Marlborough. Consequently there is little that is new within this work. The discussions in these chapters also tend to be centred on the British (more strictly English) and French armies and commanders. There is little discussion of the composite nature of the allied army and nor indeed the Bavarian part of the Franco-Bavarian forces. One surprise, however, is the inclusion Louis XIV in the section on the opposing commanders! The Sun King attended many a siege as a spectator but was assiduous in avoiding the dangers of the battlefield.The orders of battle presented are far from perfect. That for the Franco-Bavarian Army is apparently based on two secondary articles and merely represents a listing to brigade level for the foot with statement of the numbers of cavalry squadrons and battalions. The slightly more satisfactory one for Marlborough's command is apparently based on a single near contemporary plan but provides only a listing of brigades/battalions/squadrons in terms of a unit's presence in either first or second line. No attempt has been made to divide either the Allied or Confederate orders of battle into tactical commands. The Franco-Bavarian and Allies' campaign plans are briefly outlined before a concise narrative of the circumstances leading up to the battle.The ensuing account of the battle follows a traditional, predominantly anglocentric narrative. For example considerable detail is expended on the defeat of 8 squadrons of the Gendarmerie de France by 5 squadrons of English horse (3 pages plus one of plans) in the vicinity of Blenheim. There are, however, barely three pages of text inclusive of black and white illustrations devoted to the events on the right wing where Prince Eugene experienced stiff and determined resistance. The greater part of the description of the battle, such as it is, is given over to the events surrounding Lord Cutts' assaults on Blenheim and the Duke of Marlborough's advance over the Nebel stream. The account of the battle is interspersed throughout with quotes from three \`contemporary' sources; Captain Robert Parker and Dr Hare, the Duke of Marlborough's chaplain, for the Allies/Confederates and the Count of Merode-Westerloo from the Franco-Bavarian side. It is may be significant that the memoirs of both Parker and Merode-Westreloo were edited in a single volume by the late David Chandler in the 1970s. The text is rounded off with a brief analysis of the consequences of the battle with a guide to the battlefield today including information on the Schellenberg, Blenheim Palace and Marlborough House.It must be admitted that \`Blenheim 1704' does have some attractive artwork. The most immediately obvious are three two-page colour illustrations by Graham Turner and a number of excellent colour maps. The latter include three panoramic \`3D' views of the battlefield which are entirely wasted as the book is \`perfect bound' and all detail in the centre of the plan is lost in the binding. This is a pity but it is a perennial fault of all Osprey Campaign volumes. The text is liberally illustrated with near contemporary black and white images. These are interesting notwithstanding the odd one from the 1690s, which appears to have been slipped in.All in all this is not a bad book but neither is it a very good one and represents something of a lost opportunity. The overall impression is of something pushed out to in time for the 300th anniversary rather than a work that originates from a long interest or passion in the subject. This is a pity as the author has published some fine work on various aspects of late C16th and C17th military history. If you can pick up a cheap/half price copy then it may be worth the money for some of the illustrations but otherwise I feel that it is not really worthy of the full price."},{"Title":"Blenheim 1704: The Duke of Marlborough's masterpiece (Campaign)","review":"Books like this one are the reason why I owe ALL the Osprey Campaign titles. \\"Blenheim 1704\\" has a great deal of strong points, but one is the most crucial - the description of events is very clear. The reasons of the crushing defeat of the French are clearly and comprehensively explained. The way the story is told makes it a really interesting read - I hardly noticed time passing when I was reading and turning the last page I was surprised that I got through it so fast. And I wanted more - so I really hope that the author is cooking right now \\"Ramillies 1706\\".The maps are great - very clear, with all necessary detail, but avoiding the overdose of details. Illustrations are (almost) always good in Osprey titles and here they are above the average level of these series. Colour plates are delicious and there is three of them. The only thing a little bit odd is that no actual fighting is described in the colour plates, but this is really a very minor bad point in a overwise really great title. I think also that the author was slightly unfair to the French in his description of the motives behind the beginning of the war as well as about the appreciation of the final result of the whole War of Spanish Succession - I personally tend to consider that Louis XIV ultimately ended ahead of the game... But that is of course the question of the point of view.All in all, good job Osprey and good luck John Tincey for more books on Marlborough battles."},{"Title":"Trip to Ireland: Quilts Combining Two Old Favorites","review":"This book is extremely helpful.

To me the writing is a bit dry and doesn't make the material real, doesn't really relate the knowledge to working with actual bodies. Too much unconnected fact and speculation, not enough energetic personality. I was also irritated that the discussion of the more ethereal, ancient concepts such as the bandhas are presented in the same breath as the medical information, and aren't explained in any depth.

I could not have understood much of the language in Scientific Keys without this book. because the language is simple it can really help improve your verbal cueing skills during class, if you like to be specific. also explained are circulation of blood and lymph, tendons, ligaments, joint and bone types. when explaining the type of movement the book uses one asana as an example, but the principle can be applied to any asana using the same movement. i received this book for free at a training course and have it in my regular stack of review books, along with the Scientific Keys."},{"Title":"Anatomy and Asana: Preventing Yoga Injuries","review":"Product arrived in good condition as described.

The style is clumsy though the author strives to impress with an aristocratic pompousness so typical of social climbers of her day. The characters are cold, their development dull and boring and Austen's every attempt to portray the most basic of human relationships falls well short, getting completely tangled in ridiculously elite language that was in its day and remains still completely outdated. Commoners did not speak like that then, nor do they now. I would rather endure a daily root canal than read this book again. It was almost as inspirational as witnessing a mountain top removal to mine coal.

That's the main point of all the character's in Pride &amp; Prejudice. Pride &amp; Prejudice is about the Bennet's 5 daughters who need to be married off. Unfortunately all of the Bennet women are poor judges of how to act towards men and how the men feel about them. (Both cause many problems in the book.) One person understands, Mr.Bennet, but he seems to kind of humor them and leaves the job of matchmaking to his wife to deal with that. Mr. Bennet did seem to pass on some of his knowledge to the so-called heroine of the book, Elizabeth, a character who seems to be the light at the end of the tunnel for Mr. Bennet. Sadly, at times her wisdom fades and she shows her true colors as a Bennet woman. The main reason that all of the girls (with the exception of Elizabeth) are so silly (as it was put in the book is mostly due to they're mother, Mrs.Bennet. I assure you that Mrs.Bennet will irritate you. Even though she always tries to do the right motherly things or what she things is best for her daugters she causes many problems you may not realize until you finish the book. You can see her ingorance in her first statements which she bases on the fact,&quot;That a single man in possien of good fortune must be in need of a wife.&quot; All in all, I really find the book and the statement above shallow. All though I understand that British society at that time diplayed courting as the top of the list for females, but this book makes women appear as empty-headed, man-hungry, child-like people that bow down to man's and society's every wish. I have found that a lot of British and other classics diplay courting as a high priority, but in other books, like The Inheritance and Little Women there was more on thier mind than finding a husband. I also find this book unrealistic for many reasons, mostly because the complete personality of the charcters change in the blink of an eye. I really feel that this book is not pleasurable to read, though it may benefit you to read it so that you can learn to find the good and bad pionts of a book and compare it to other literature like it or during that time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Everybody talks about the book. No one talks about the reading of this book by the reader, Irene Sutcliffe. I have not listened to the CD, but before I buy this CD, I want to see some review of the vocal delivery. Is her reading enticing, annoying, off-putting, etc?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't believe this is considered a classic, and still so beloved by readers today. It's so incredibly boring and stupid!!! It was without a doubt one of the most torturous reading experiences for me. Now, I can appreciate great pieces of classic literature (e.g. Moby Dick, Red Badge of Courage, Gullivers Travels), but this assuredly does not merit to fall within that catagory. It is friviolous and devoid of any real substance. No plot whatsoever. Essentially, it concerns a bunch of smart-aleck, stuck-up self-righteous phonies who try to outdo each other with their sarcastic and smart-aleck remarks. Give me a break, all of you who supposedly like this dull, monotonous, shallow book!! It is utterly beyond my comprehension how in the world this garbage is considered one of the great books of world literature. It is simply a 19th century British version of the Jerry Springer show."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book is for three kinds of people:1. people who think what so-called \\"classics\\" are all good. Of course, why would such book be called a classic if it isn't good?2. People who are really really old and are adapted to the cultural and period ideas3. people who like fairy-tale-like romantic storiesThat being said, I'm fair to not give this book a one-star. You can bang on the \\"unhelpful\\" button if you like, but I'm only telling the obvious truth.The story is basically about a mother trying to marry her five daughters off to wealthy men, so that she may \\"rest assured\\" on profits. Sounds selfish huh? Well.All the daughters are quite empty-headed and foolish except Elizabeth Bennet, who actually has clever \\"ideas\\" and is quick-witted with her tongue.They flirt around, using clever, humorous, or not-so-clever speeches that establishes each personality of the characters. Kind of like one of those old-fashioned playsI can just imagine Austen while she is writing, it goes something like this: \\"oh those pitful arrogant wealthy people, how I loath them! But it would be very nice to marry to one.\\" The truth is, she wanted to be a feminist, thus the Elizabeth character, but ended up a conservative anyways- women are better off marrying rich guy; rich guys are not only noble as birth, but noble in soul as well; high class people are in general, better than low class people. etc.So how did it end? well, I'm sure you can figure it out. All the girls married to rich-guys, or rich-guy-to-bes, with her main character married to the richest of all- and surprise! The best guy of all. And they all live quite happy.Some people said that they are enchanted by the \\"clever things\\" Elizabeth says. Yeah, they are pretty clever, but honestly, it's pretty much only because of the period difference. I think some pop TV shows' characters' speeches are pretty clever too with their usage of pop culture, I bet Austen can't think of those. WHY? BECAUSE SHE LIVES IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME!!! So why would people hold Elizabeth's speeches higher? Well, you figure it out.Sound like a dumb silly-old love story? well, you got that quite right. This is pretty much what I tell most people who are biased over \\"classics\\": classics may have that time-less fancy feeling with their wording, but story-wise, they are pretty silly and outdated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"How a spinster who was living in relative isolation in the English countryside during the earliest years of the 19th century was able to write the ultimate romance novel is a question that nobody now alive can answer.Yet in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, this is exactly what author Jane Austen has accomplished.Written at a moment in time when it clearly was too early to have been inspired by the writings of other authors, P-and-P has every component that the greatest love stories require. The lovers meet, there is tension, there is conflict, there is separation and, finally, with the reader's pulse quickened, there is the acknowledgment of their feelings for one another.Lizzie Bennett and her hero, the conveniently rich Fitzwilliam Darcy, are two of the most significant lovers to be found in literature. And, in creating them, Jane Austen laid the groundwork for the elements that would need to be present in the modern romance novel.All of Miss Austen's books are worth reading, but PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is unique among them in being great."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy's marriage proposal.

Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife\\" which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth's romance with Darcy intriguing.

It's very detailed and it's a very easy to comprehend and read. When you read this book you will have a better vision of the women in the 19th century had to live. It also talked about entailment, which means that after the father dies , the next male heir takes over the property and females are not able to inherit.The novel is not your usual love story because in the beginning of this story the two characters who treat each other as if they were the devil end up falling for each other; although, in the beginning of the story you get a sense of who the characters are going to end up with, except one or two couples. My favorite chapter in this novel is the first chapter because it deals with pride and prejudice, exactly the title of the novel. In the first chapter you see that Darcy has a lot of pride and Elizabeth's prejudice towards Darcy.I like Jane Austen's use of dramatic irony because we as the readers know what's going to happen before the characters, like as the story goes on we know that Darcy will ended up with Elizabeth by the way they treat each other. I would recommend people of 16 and up to read this book because this novel does not make you want to go to sleep. It makes you want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was such a delight to read. Anybody who enjoys reading will love the book. Its tales of love and money will grab and hold your attention. The author's use of conflict between her characters is marvelously done. Conflict was a literary device I appreciated from the book. It brings interest, excitement and wonder to the story.A favorite chapter of mine would have to be chapter nineteen. Austen's portrait of Mr. Collin is solidified in this chapter. The manner in which he proposed to Elizabeth was a prime example of his pompous nature.Pride and Prejudice is a light-hearted and romantic book. I would recommend the book to any teenager or adult. Its topics are very relatable to both age groups."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is chapter thirty four because this chapter presented the plot's climax. The author has carefully built the plot so that Darcy's proposal comes at the height of Elizabeth's anger toward him. This chapter presents a new obstacle in the plot, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth, who promptly turns him down. If Darcy had worded his proposal in a romantic way, Elizabeth would have reacted differently, but Darcy's pride makes him act in a superior way. When he proposes, he indicates that he makes the offer in spite of her minor social position and her ignorant family. Elizabeth's previously established prejudice against Darcy is intensified and she does not even consider marrying such an arrogant man. Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being too proud, while Elizabeth accuses him of being prejudiced, but the truth is that both characters are guilty of pride and prejudice.The ages for which this book would be appropriate are ages thirteen and up because it gives a good lesson on what life was like in the early nineteenth century. For example, women can't inherit their own estate; only men can.One literary device that I appreciate is Satire. The author satirizes the manners of all classes, exposing people who have excessive pride as rude and often foolish, regardless of wealth.I like this book because in many ways it is a very accurate portrayal of what a woman's life was like in the early nineteenth century. Its message is that love is more important than financial gain."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a one-of-a-kind book. When your start to read this intriguing book, you will see its magnificent plot. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family. The family worried because their estate is entailed and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet only have daughters. When an estate is entailed, only a male can inherit the estate. Mrs. Bennet wants to help her daughter find a wealthy husband so she could be financially well off, but that wasn't her only reason. She also wanted to see her daughters get married and become mothers. That's where the entire novel becomes interesting.Well I don't really have a favorite chapter because it had many chapters that caught my attention and made me see things in another way. But if I would have to choose a chapter I would choose chapter one because that's where you see what the novel will be about. This novel would be perfect for teenagers and up to read.One literary device that I appreciated from the novel was imagery because I could picture big events in the novel in my head. For example, one big event that I could picture in my head was when Charles Bingley, a wealthy man, rented the manor known as Netherfield Park and that causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn. What specifically creates an image for me is that Jane Austen is very descriptive in her writing and she has a way of showing things to the readers. To be descriptive in her writing she uses powerful words to set the mood for what's taking place. For example, in chapter 22 and 23, news arrives that Mr. Collins has proposed marriage to Charlotte Lucas and she has accepted. Elizabeth is shocked but Mrs. Bennet, of course, is furious with her daughter Elizabeth for allowing a husband to escape her. Before that had happened, Mr. Collins had proposed marriage to Elizabeth, but she had refused. The mood went from pleasant to drastic in such a short moment. I really like this awesome novel because it opened up a new world for me; it showed me that in the old days things were different from what they are now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an illustrious and fascinating book to read because of its twisted plot that attracts readers. What really made me crave the book was the love-hate relationship Elizabeth and Darcy maintained. My favorite chapter of the book was chapter two in volume III where Austen gives an optimistic overview on Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship as well as Jane and Bingley. She expresses Elizabeth's strong feelings towards Darcy and foreshadows a second proposal.I enjoyed reading the book because of the setting and the era in which it was written. It's quite interesting to read their proper English and try to understand their rare humor. I believe that the right type of age group would be senior students, around the age of seventeen to eighteen and above because of the mature language the author uses. I strongly recommend this book especially to women who like &quot;fairy tale&quot; type of endings in a novel.The literary device that I appreciated was dramatic irony because I found it appealing to see how Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship was going to end up. It was exhilarating to see that Darcy was going to propose to Elizabeth for the second time and she not know about it while she was thinking she had lost him forever. That to me was good enough to want to read the book all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel written in the 19th century about the hardships of love, pride, and prejudices.My favorite chapter in Pride and Prejudice is Chapter 8, Volume 1. In this chapter, Elizabeth goes to visit her sick sister, Jane, at the Bingley's estate and during her stay at Netherfield, Caroline continues to insult her. ELizabeth, being the head-strong, outspoken person she is, became fed up with Caroline's constant insultsand began to reciprocate in the same manner and made Caroline feel foolish.Pride and PRejudice is a great, romantic classic that most people would enjoy. In my opinion, this particular novel is directed towards a more mature audience. Because of the sophisticated language and the constant event change, I also think that this novel should be read at a high school level or higher, depending on the person's own reading level and his/her understanding of the use of language in the 19th century.One literary device that I appreciate is the external conflict between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. At first Elizabeth &quot;could hardly stand to be in the same room as him,&quot; but as the plot progresses, she and Mr. Darcy become infatuated with each other and will not speak of their hidden feelings.I enjoyed this novel because it challenged my mind. It made me wonder what role women play in today's society: it has indeed changed dramatically, but the process has been slow. The novel forced me to think about my past predilections and the disorder they caused in my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"O.K.

I would also call Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen quite possibly the most well-written book in the past 300 years.As soon as you pick up this book, your mind is forming hypothoses about the rest of the book. The weird thing is that ABSOLUTLY NONE of them happen. Yet, at the end, you are not only as happy with the conclusion as you would have been with your own ideas, but happier. That kind of literary psycological euphoria cannot be and has not been acheived by any other author that I have ever read.This book leaves you with a feeling of absolute feclicity. I cried with joy the first time I read it, and had to reread the ending twice. In other words, it has a very happy ending! That has certainly been attempted by every tale from Cinderella to the Harry Potter books, yet Austen's ending is unique as her ending is perfectly real. It not only seems realistic, but, in hindsight, any other resolution to her book seems ludicrous.Her characters are vivid. They are complex yet you see them as if they could be you own mother, sister, father, brother, friend, foe, or aquaintance. You not only warm to her heroes and heroines, but Austen leads you to feel a fiery hatred of her vilains and vilainesses.Her writing is intricate. You are left feeling not only perfectly satisfied with this book, but want more. She is not only an excalent writer but a perfect one. Thius book is her masterpiece. It has comedy, tradjedy, richness, irony, love, and loss. It many complex facets gleam like diamonds. I am in awe of this book.

Three years later, I tried it again... and I kicked myself for not having tried it sooner.I think my vision of reading Jane Austen always has me curled up in a chair while it's snowing outside, but in truth, the real memory of reading this book was sitting in the waiting room of a car mechanic while my car was being worked on. That day stands out because as usual, the mechanics only had the usual things to read: &quot;Guns and Ammo&quot; and &quot;Field and Stream&quot;. Add the requisite gumball machine in the corner with stale gumballs and you have the idea. I brought the book with me to read, but didn't really think I would get all that much reading of it done. True, I was reading it for fun, but it was Jane Austen after all, and I wasn't sure if I could really concentrate on her. Well, 200 pages later, bringing that novel with me was the best decision I ever made. 4 years later, I still rememebr how into this book I got. (I even had to take a walk around the block before I read the last chapter just to prolong finishing the story.) Once the story did end, I felt like I was saying goodbye to my friends.This book is riveting, it's fun, it's hysterical (wait for the rewarding confrontation between Lady Catherine deBourgh and Elizabeth...it's not only a battle of tongues, but a great clash of the &quot;refined&quot; yet uneducated upper classes, and the middle classes of Regentry England.

So, this winter, wait for a snowy day (heck, choose any day, you can't have a bad Austen day) and get ready to be taken away.

Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and prejudice is a beautifully written love story, full of humor and life-like imagery. The characters Elizabeth and Mr Darcy are both carved out nicely, with Austen's acute sense about how both men and women think and perceive beauty, love, society. The novel is a compelling read, and for diehard romantics like me, it is irresistable to the end. While Sense and Sensibility moves more slowly, and likewise also dwells on stories of two sisters, there the love stories are presented with maze of other matter. Here the hero must overcome his pride, the heroine must fight a battle with her prejudices, and both then discover not only love in each other but their real selves. Additional stories and people appear perfectly developed in their own roles of lovers, parents, friends, envious relations, grumpy grandmothers, lively teenagers, etc. The drama of a great movie or a soap opera is all here, with Austen's simple and elegant story telling.Many sequences and sentences are purely delightful or extermely hilarious, making the novel one of those reads where you are caught laughing aloud or smiling with twinkle your eyes alone, as you are relishing the new turn of events. While the story is set in Victorian era, the characters, emotions and humor is timeless. The novel is an easy read, fit for travel reading as well as for fun, and trust me, the romantic in you will be raving about it for a long time! In fact, two movies compelled me to reread the novel recently: Gurinder Chadda's Bride and Prejudice that reinvents the classic in a Bollywood flavor and Tom Hanks- Meg Ryan Starrer You've got mail. In You've Got Mail there are repeated references to the novel, and to the extent the opposites attract, and essential elements of novel are concerned, the movie is like a reincarnated version of the novel.Citation from You've Got MailConfession: I have read Pride and Prejudice about 200 times.

This novel takes place in 19th century England and revolves around the slow development of love found between two characters. The first of these characters is Elizabeth Bennet, a clever, beautiful, and spirited young woman. Pride and Prejudice begins, when Mrs. Bennet asks Mr. Bennet to call on their new neighbor, Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley has an income of 5 thousand pounds a year and is not married, so Mrs. Bennet hopes to marry one of her 5 daughters to him. Jane, the eldest daughter, and Mr. Bingley begin to like each other during a ball. Elizabeth, the second oldest, meets Mr. Darcy at the same ball. Darcy initially does not care for Elizabeth, and refuses to even dance with her.However, as Elizabeth grows to dislike Darcy, Darcy starts to become very fond of her. She and Darcy meet again when she stays with Mr. Bingley, because her sister, Jane, has taken ill at their house. Ms. Bingley, the sister of Mr. Bingley, herself hopes to wed Darcy, and seeks to make Elizabeth less appealing to Darcy. After Jane's recovery she and Elizabeth return home. There they welcomed to their home by their cousin Mr. Collins, who, because of the inheritance customs of the times (the Bennet girls had no brothers), was the heir to the Bennet family home. Together, Elizabeth and her family travel to town, where they met Mr. Wickham. Mr. Wickham notices Elizabeth, who he found charming, and describes to her a terrible deed he alleges Darcy had committed against him. Wickham claimed that Darcy owed him money and had denied him of a promised avocation. This new information causes Elizabeth to despise Darcy even more.Soon Mr. Collins, the rather odd clergyman, proposes to Elizabeth. To her mother's dismay, she refuses him. Instead, her friend Charlotte Lucas marries Mr. Collins, and Elizabeth goes to visit them and their neighbor the great Lady Catherine De Bourgh. During her stay Elizabeth sees Darcy again, and he proposes. Elizabeth refuses, reciting all the terrible things he had done, including the mistreatment of Wickham. In response, Darcy writes Elizabeth explaining how Wickham had tried to elope with his sister because of her money. Elizabeth is forced to rethink, her opinions relating to Darcy and Wickham.That summer Elizabeth traveled to Pemberly on holiday with her aunt and uncle, and while there her aunt and uncle wanted to see the beautiful Darcy estate. While visiting, Darcy showed up. Darcy and his sister heartily welcomed Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle, and invited them to dinner. Elizabeth began to grow fonder of Darcy. Dreadful news arrived during Elizabeth's stay at Pemberly. Her frivolous younger sister Lydia had run off with Wickham. Upon learning of the circumstances, Darcy sought out and found Wickham and Lydia, forcing them to marry. Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle returned to the Bennet home.Bingley and Darcy together visited the Bennet household to call upon Jane and Elizbeth. Jane became engaged to Bingley, and when Darcy proposed to Elizabeth, her heart had changed, so she said yes. Elizabeth had fallen in love Darcy. They had both seen past their pride and past the prejudices that they had learned from society. Elizabeth and Darcy were happy in marriage, and remained forever grateful to Elisabeth's aunt and uncle for uniting them.I would recommend the book Pride and Prejudice. It forces each of us to think about our roles in life. The novel also makes us think about our own pride and our own prejudices against others, and the need for us to learn more about people before we judge them. This book is also one of the greatest Romances of all time, bringing to life the love that a man and a woman held for each other from another era. It provides meaningful messages that all of us should learn. The characters are also interesting. This book is good for people who understand the use of language in the 19th century. Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that I love, and believe everyone would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is viewed as one of the finest novels ever written, and rightfully so. Despite being only 22 years old when the original manuscript was finished, Austen displays an astonishing mastery of the English language that has rarely been equalled. The prose is so expertly constructed that the book maintains a brisk pace throughout and never becomes dull. Being so heavily dialogue-based, it's critical that the conversations in this book keep the reader interested. Fortunately, the snappy dialogue is what makes this book really shine. The characterization is nothing short of brilliant, from the silly Mrs. Bennett to the intolerable Mr. Collins. Despite the fact that nothing truly exciting ever happens, you'll find yourself desperate to turn the next page. I could not possibly recommend this book more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic Jane Austen novel is one of my all-time favorites and I loved the novel on my Kindle as well.

I recommend this to anyone who hasn't read it before and has a Kindle too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a big fan on Jane Austen, so when this book was put out I had to get it. The book its self is written just like the classic; however, it has humorous and interesting side notes through out the book. I find the side notes very fun and interesting to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the classic version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I use an audio copy of P&P when teaching it in class - we read through important passages together without the loss of my voice. I previously owned a tape version - horrible because you had to FF to whatever parts you wanted. In fact my player ended up eating 2 of the tapes. This CD version is much better and I would highly recommend it, except... Normal audio CDs have tracks that correspond with the chapters. Not this one. The tracks were in random places (in the middle of a paragraph, even in the middle of sentences!) so trying to find the right chapter to start on required some detective work. If you're just planning to listen from start to finish, however, this is an excellent version- the reader is splendid."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was very fun to read! The dialect was puzzling in places, but it was so different from some of the twentieth-century authors who write with slang and no culture at all. Jane Austen created a tale that is very sweet, very smart, and very imaginative. I love the characters Elizabeth and Jane Bennet with their witcisms and mistakes and exclamaitions. I would recommend this book to anyone, even my sister who doesn't read books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is no wonder why this was the story You've Got Mail was based on!

I must confess that Emma bored me, and although I liked Sense and Sensability, it is nothing in comparison to Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen does a wonderful job of developing her characters.

Elizabeth find one person in particular that she will never court, Fitzwilliam Darcy, or will his charming ways find their way into her heart.This book is suppose to be humorous. I did not find anything funny or remotely interesting, well until Darcy came along. In all truthness I can not see how this book has gotten so many other books based on the characters of Darcy and Elizabeth. I don't get it. I wish I did. I wanted to like this so much more than I did. All I could see the book is about is dancing and gossip. It reminds me of a older version of Seinfeld because it was about nothing. I did not give diddly squat about anybody in this book. Yes it is written pretty and well done but I had no connection to the people.You are probably wondering why I would give any stars if I dislike it so much but the truth is certain moments caught my attention and as I said it is written pretty.

Everyone in the novel wants to find love, and marry someone. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her five daughters to find husbands and she makes it \\"The business of her life\\" (Austen, pg 5) to get her daughters married. Throughout the novel the characters must cope with the issues of pride and wealth in their community and in turn deal with the pressures of marrying into a good family.Mr. Bingley, who is a wealthy man, is very attracted to Jane, the eldest daughter. They dance at the ball and she believes that he is the right man for her. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's friend, does not want to dance with Elizabeth, Jane's sister, because she isn't part of the same social class as Mr. Darcy. This makes him seem very arrogant. However, as the novel progresses Mr. Darcy sets aside his prejudice, and actually starts to fall for Elizabeth. Elizabeth starts to realize that she actually has feelings for Mr. Darcy. She understands that she isn't as rich as Mr. Darcy, and that she does not come from the same world as him. Elizabeth looks past the arrogance she once saw in Mr. Darcy, and learns to love him regardless.Elizabeth's younger sister elopes with Officer Wickham, and the family is ashamed. Elizabeth fears that their pride may be ruined. Even though the two are happy together the family acts callously towards the couple because they do not think that Wickham is good enough for her, and she would be better off with someone from a high social class.Jane and Mr. Bingley get engaged and everyone is happy again. Lady Catherine tells Elizabeth about Mr. Darcy's intentions on marrying her, and that she should say no. Lady Catherine does not think that Elizabeth is worthy of her nephew because he is so wealthy, and she is just average. Elizabeth says that she isn't going to throw away her happiness, and accepts when Mr. Darcy proposes.The book was very well written but the plot was a little boring and goes back and forth too much. I felt that all anyone really cared about was whether or not they were going to get married. I thought that the way the characters spoke, and how the actual words were written were very eloquent, and made a simple phrase sound beautiful. I feel like what the author was saying could have been said in fewer words, and she could have condensed it into a shorter novel.I also liked how Elizabeth didn't give into Mr. Darcy right away and she stood her ground, yet Mr. Darcy did not give up on Elizabeth. She thought that he was very arrogant but then once she got to know him she actually appreciated him.Because the book focuses mainly on the subject of marriage, and love, only certain people may find enjoyment and entertainment in it. I don't believe that this novel was written for one specific age group, and could be read by many different ages. I think that young adults might enjoy the novel the best, because it deals with finding love. Again, the book was very well written, but a little too repetitive."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Miss Elisabeth Bennet is a very witty, ironically and independent woman. She is the opposite of Mr. Darcy. He embodies the modern, educated and pride person of the upper class. She is full of prejudices against his behaviour. It is a story of resentment and misunderstanding. The first impression of a person is a constant picture which you carry along with you. It takes time to get rid of it and so does Elisabeth. Jane Austen takes this picture to develop her story. The reader follows the view of Elisabeth in the whole story to the rear end. During the elopement of Elisabeth younger sister Lydia she realises that Mr. Darcy is not the kind of person she always thought of. Her change of mind takes place in the off. The reader is not familiar with it because Elisabeth rejects the love of Mr. Darcy every time. You feel astonished in the end when you hear what she reveals to Jane.The novel is characterised as a battle of words. There is no much description of the setting or the social class in the nineteenth century. It concentrates on the feelings and situations of the characters. Chatting all over, I think it is the typical pastime of every girl. The book is full of these situations. It is about love, envy, parties and what is hot in town."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted so badly to love one the classic romances of all time, but couldn't. I found the story incredibly dated. I was able to get past the archaic use of vocabulary, but not the lack of plot. Most of this lengthy novel is about idle English gentry socializing at each others homes. I had nearly decided to give up on finishing the book, when it picked up a little in the final third. I read the free Kindle edition. While the formatting is not as good as with paid editions, it is perfectly adequate. I can't see any reason to get one of the paid versions, unless you are an Austen fan who wants the collected works organized with an active T.O.C."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is a classic and a must read for everyone.

I love getting caught up with the Bennett family. There's just something about the book...The real reason I'm writing this review is not to dwell on the wonderfulness that is Pride and Prejudice, but to note my slight distraction by the formatting. There were certain spots where lines broke oddly, and strange words that were written in all capital letters. It was often enough to be slightly distracting, but still a good book and a wonderful read (if that sort of thing doesn't bother you too much)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well it's quite simply a classic! I was only 12 when the TV show came on and remember becoming transfixed by it. It propelled me to Austen's books and I haven't looked back since.

Annoying but it was free."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic tale of the &#34;play hard to get&#34; gets you far! A little hard to read through if your not used to the old english. But never the less a classic tale of the dating game."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read parts of this book to my wife, who, like so many female readers, had previously read it. So much has been already been written about the superb characterization and a decent plot, that I don't feel I can add much to it. I found the dialogue witty and intelligent.Austin demonstrates that timeless problem of how men and women continue to misunderstand each other. The language of civility is a hoot, and descriptions of what is socially appropriate add tensions and obstacles. This is a marvelous read and a worthwhile way to spend some time over the holidays."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There was a time in our 20's and into our 30's that a slight film covered our lives. Metaphorically speaking, of course, we were wandering around in our own world of literary complacency. We never realized this, though much like those Claritin D commercials, all our surroundings became sharper and brighter, due to Jane Austen and her charming novel, Pride and Prejudice. We would ask you, oh kind reader, to cast every last ounce of your sense and sensibility aside and read this book. Just be careful that in hast you don't pick up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which has a slightly different take on this classic love story.Miss Elizabeth Bennett is the second oldest of five girls raised in a poor(ish) family on the English countryside, outside of London. Smart, funny, passionate, loyal, and a tad bit prideful, she is the literary heroine of our dreams. Enter Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth with a pair of awesome sideburns). Seemingly arrogant, self righteous, and uppity; our Eliza quickly decides what he can do with all his preconceptions. Upon our word, there is hardly a man quite as standoffish and rude as this gentleman... or is there? Don't be too quick to pass judgment.Pride and Prejudice is likeable on so many different levels. Austen does an amazing job of changing rudeness into shyness, fierce animosity into extreme thankfulness, and all around bad guys into good ones...and then changing them back with the snap of her fingers. Pride and Prejudice stands as one of our absolute favorites and we are still anxiously awaiting an invitation to Pemberley Estate so we can check out Darcy's impressive home library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Unlike many required readings for high school literature classes, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is an engaging read. She builds the complexity of this novel with each additional character introduction. As the story progresses, I felt the connection between myself and the Bennet women develop. Though not as dramatic as the early 19th century, the same credentials for an acceptable relationship exist in the modern 21st century. Wealth and social status, as well as appearance were essential to the acceptance of a spouse, to avoid embarrassment to one's family. There remains an element of judgment in relationships today concerning individual etiquette, wealth and physical characteristics. This prejudice extends to peers and family members. In Pride and Prejudice, it contributed to the anxiety in the developing relationships between Jane and Mr. Bingley, as well as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In the opening of the novel, Darcy's pride leads to Elizabeth's prejudice against him. His admiration grows because of her rebuke. This scenario takes place in all aspects of our society. We want what we can't have or that which seems out of our reach. We are never satisfied. Darcy falls victim to these desires as Elizabeth's rebuke transforms his pride into admiration for her.Looking past the intricacy of the English language, I found Pride and Prejudice to be a novel of great complexity, where the lives of all characters are intertwined. From Mr. Collins marrying Charlotte Lucas, to Mr. Darcy finding Lydia for the Bennet's, each character had some effect on all the others. Austen keeps the reader wondering, only putting their minds to ease at the conclusion of the novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Vapid and pompous! Despite the clever rhetoric, the plot and characters are simply too shallow, predictable and archetypical. Yes, this novel is a classic, and an original of the romance genre, but that doesn't make up for the fact that it, in fact, is romance genre: WAY to simplistic.Couldn't stand the book, not when I read it at 20 and not when I gave it another chance at 49. Disappointing because I loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" (with Kate Winslet, Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman), so I thought I would like the author.And yes, I do love Dickens. Despite her myriad adoring fans, in my opinion, Jane Austen's writing lacks depth and cannot truly be compared to Dickens."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to purchase this book after I watch the movie, to be honest, the movie is somewhat more entertaining than reading the book, the landscape is best describe in the movie. I need an extra effort to read every line in the book, word by word. Maybe my perception would be different if I read the book first, then see the movie."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a required book in high school English. Thank God for Cliff Notes, because this is the book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading.This summer, I forced my way through the book, because I wanted to understand what was so great about it. I discovered it was GREAT to finish the book. Don't give this book to a kid to encourage reading.This book was clearly written for a different time.

So basically, don't pay attention to these people. :) It took me a while to get through Pride and Prejudice for an AP English project. I agree with other reviewers that it was extremely well written.

It just continous with the same things before for another 100 pages. Although you expect an end you aren't really interested in it.

Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society, noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life, writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the same lessons being learned."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"jane austen is the most manly woman i've never met. her books are full of the kind of intricate analyses that i've only ever found in men, like myself, and have never observed in women, even women supposedly very smart, with all the benefits of formal education, indeed, even phd's from such places as harvard and berkeley. women, however smart they may be, always fall back on intuition when confronted with perplexing problems. even when their intuitions are completely impotent. i've had women tell me that they \\"thought\\" the economy was on the edge of deep recession because their \\"intuitions\\" told them so. or who said they \\"thought\\" a new business venture was destined to fail because they had an \\"intuition\\" about it. yet, when pressed for further \\"reasons\\", they were able to elaborate no further.so it is against such a background that i approached ms austen. and having read p&p; and mansfield park i am truly astonished that a woman wrote these books. certainly, the subject matter betrays a woman's concerns. yet, she must have been a rare woman who could patiently analyze and untangle the thoughts and actions of so many confused characters, who could resist the feminine temptation to jump to easy intuitive conclusions. i am amazed. would that there were just a few jane austens in this world. or lizzie bennetts, even. but alas, the world positively teems with lydia and kitty bennetts - and mrs bennetts! sigh."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a book with themes such as reputation and class horribly expressed.

That's how my favourite book of all time begins, and it just keeps getting better.This novel deals with the pride and prejudices of the main characters Miss Elizabeth Bennett, and Mr. Darcy, as they try to find true love in pre-Victorian England. Elizabeth is a gentleman's daughter and Mr. Darcy is a gentleman, but Elizabeth, along with the rest of her sisters, are not good catches because, their inheritance is being entailed away to their cousin Mr. Collins, leaving them with very miserable looking dowries. Along with poor family connections, they stand little chance of marrying well or at all; they only have their charms to help them.That is until Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood along with his sisters, and accompanying them his close friend Mr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley becomes captivated with Jane Bennett, Elizabeth's eldest sister, and Mr. Darcy has an eye for Elizabeth herself, but can he see past her poor conditions, and can she see past his pride in order for them to get together? That's the question that keeps the audience captivated right up to the end.I try and find time to read this book at least once a year, and I've been doing that for a few years, and yet, it's always fresh when a get around to reading it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was 12 years old and had the rare privilege of going shopping alone with my Mum. (With 2 sisters and a brother, this event was EXTREMELY rare.) I asked if we could browse in the book store. Half an hour later, we emerged. I was carrying a paperbag in which was enclosed my first copy of 'Pride and Prejudice'. As soon as we got in the car I started reading. I finished the book that night and I started it again the next morning. Even at 12 years old, I knew I was experiencing a masterpiece. In the 15 years since that day I have revisited the story of Elizabeth and Darcy numerous times. It just keeps getting better and better. Elizabeth was my idol. Darcy replaced Prince Philip, (from Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty'), as the man of my dreams. Mrs Bennett's nerves began to irk me as much as they did the long-suffering Mr Bennett. I love this book and I can't even begin to praise it, and the wonderful Jane Austen, enough. If you haven't read it - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? If you have read it, I think its time to get it off your shelf, or get down to the library and relive the magic of 'Pride and Prejudice' all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although it has to be called a romance, I personally feel that the fascination is much more about the rules of behavior and courtship in Victorian society. The same story set in the modern day would not be nearly so interesting because you no longer have the rules to navigate that are present in the time in which it is set. It is the compliance with these rules and the reaction when they are not followed properly that makes the social structure of the time (as it is presented here) more like a chess game than a simple romance story. This given with characters and settings that have a feel to them that reminds me of Little Women made this book a great deal of fun to read. It was fast paced with plenty of intrigues.The back of my book puts the entire plot into one short paragraph. I was at first concerned that this would take the fun out of the reading since who marries who in the end was spelled out right there. However, in reading it I realized that it is not WHAT happens in this book as much as it is HOW it happens and in this Austen is a true master. Essentially the story is of the five daughters of the Bennett family. The addle-brained mother has no other concern than to marry her daughters off and the detached father generally just makes fun of the whole situation. Jane and Elizabeth are the two eldest daughters and Jane forms an attachment early on to Bingley, a gentleman who has leased a house/estate nearby. When a pompous Mr. Darcy interferes in Jane's attachment to Bingley, Elizabeth is turned vehemently against him - a sentiment further deepened by aspersions made by Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy's father's godchild. As fate would have it, Mr. Darcy develops an attachment to Elizabeth and has to redeem himself in her eyes, despite his feelings of social superiority and her many resentments.I don't know if the title is to reflect the pride of Mr. Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth against him. At one point she says the following: \\" Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.\\" I see her really exploring this in the character of Mr. Darcy and his relations and feel that the title may have more to do with the exploration of this sentiment than in any of the individual characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"For the typical male, the only thing worse than reading a romance novel is reading a two-hundred-year-old romance novel. So why'd I bother? Because I'm a firm believer that serious readers should occasionally expand their horizons and sample books from other genres, especially those they'd normally pooh-pooh. Because that's when we get pleasantly surprised.Pride and Prejudice fell into this category for me. I wanted a break from the mystery/suspense genre and had heard good things about Jane Austen. As I dug in, my expectations were met early on: plodding, expository chunks of Old English describing landscapes and feelings. Ugh. But then she got me.Like peeling an onion, Austen uncovers characters and a story that are simply genius. Like Shakespeare, she proves again that time and technology have no impact on basic human impulses and the complexities of love. This book will be just as popular in another two hundred years. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My 13 year old daughter and I just finished reading this book and LOVED it! As we read the book, we kept noticing that many of the characters remind us of people we know! It was funny, and really says a lot for Jane Austen's insight on human nature. Her characters are very realistic in my opinion.We learned from the book that in Jane Austen's time in England, it was very important to say and do the right things and to be excruciatingly polite. P&amp;P can be tedious to read until you get used to the way they talk, but once you do it really makes it even more amusing to read.I tried to read P&amp;P once before a few years ago, but I only got about a third of the way through the book. I just couldn't understand it well enough. I would recommend to anyone who was put off by the book to give it another chance. See one of the excellent videos first if you don't understand it, and then come back and literally FEAST on the book, which is so much better! I know that reading it has expanded my ability to appreciate good literature, and I know I will read all of Jane Austen's novels now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.I have read this three times in three sittings. In case that is not clear, I mean to say that I have sat down to read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on three separate occasions, and did not get up until I had finished it. I once stayed up all night long to finish it.Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book). She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice. Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most-beloved novels by Jane Austen. Words cannot do it justice, but I'll try anyway, since I love it so much. The story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy is absolutely timeless. From the opening line, which is my all-time favorite opening line- \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a large portion must be in want of a wife,\\" we are drawn into this superb love affair, one which it is difficult to pull ourselves away from. I've read this book numerous times now and I always wonder what's going to happen.Here Jane Austen uses a sufficient amount of wit to satirize the social graces and foibles of the middle and upper classes in Regency England. From the modest Bennet family, with its five daughters, to Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, to whom social class is everything, we are given a superb picture of life as Austen saw it.There's also an undercurrent theme in which not everything is what it seems to be. Darcy is not the proud, cold gentleman he seems, nor is Elizabeth as feisty as she appears to others. And, while Elizabeth certainly understands the intents of others, she does not necessarily understand the workings of her own heart."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Not bad overall, but missing punctuation and some half sentences serve to pull the reader out of the story. Unfortunate, as this is one story in which the reader hopes to get perfectly lost."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read this book was at the age of 13. My mother had an old, worn, 1950s copy of the book on our bookshelf, and one day I just decided to give it a try. I think the first 50 pages were a bit of a mystery to me. I remember struggling with the language at the beginning, and having to look up several words in the dictionary. After 100 pages, I had finally \\"learnt the language,\\" and managed to at last translate it into my native tongue. I enjoyed it, and over the years I returned to it again and again. Now, at the age of 35, I practically have numerous passages memorized, and reading the book is no longer a culture shock. Every word of this novel is an old friend, and I wouldn't remove a single one from the text. This is the book I turn to when I'm in the mood to read, but not in the mood to read something new.Every time I read it, I am struck by its relevance. I don't mean the morals or the need to marry well in order to win approval from society (although I think we still see a little of that to this day). I refer to the characters. Their personalities and basic code of principals are timeless. I can identify with every single character in this novel. When Lizzy and Mr. Darcy fell in love, their courtship could have taken place anywhere and at any point in time. That is why her novels are so well adapted into modern films.You cannot possibly do wrong by reading this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me tell you about my first impression of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. At the age of thirteen, it was one of the most amazing love stories I had ever read. Five years later, it became one of the most wittily crafted stories I had ever read. By the time I was twenty-one, it was the finest work of literature I had ever experienced.Elizabeth Bennet is a byproduct of genteel poverty. The second daughter of five, she possesses the most sense, tact, poise, and sound judgement of the family in general. On the other hand, she is also irreverent, daring, and judgemental. She stretches the envelope of what might be construed as &quot;polite&quot; society. She also acknowledges the limitations of her gender even as she subtly tries to defy them.As a part of the landed gentry, Mr. Darcy is the embodiment of all that is dignified and honored. He is a gentleman who was born to privilege and money. His kind make up the &quot;polite society&quot; Elizabeth dares to flout. His pride, his disdain, and his arrogance make him unappealing to the people of Longbourn, as well as the community surrounding it. It is his interference with the relationship between his friend and her beloved sister, however, which is a personal affront to Elizabeth.It is fortuitous that Austen retitled her book because First Impressions does not begin to touch upon the complexities that Pride and Prejudice, as a title, connotes. In Darcy and Elizabeth, Austen has drawn two very complex characters who, on the one hand, seem simply drawn and characterized, but on the other, are so much more than they seem. It would be easy to say that Darcy is arrogant and Elizabeth is willful. The truth is, looking beyond my own first impression, as a reader, Austen has deceptively crafted two characters whose thoughts and actions make it clear that they aptly straddle both of the title characteristics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a perfect novel. The characters, story structure, humor and insights are brilliant."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm very biased because this is my favorite book of all time by one of my favorite autors. The story comes alive, the characters come alive. To me after years of reading and rereading the story, these characters are like people that really lived and I feel like I know them better then alot of real people. Wonderful book, if you've never read Jane Austen, start here and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No need for lots of words here: this is one the best books ever written. Each re-reading highlights Austen's genius, as new gems are discovered throughout in various forms. 'nuff said."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book! It is a timeless story about the tangled relationship between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. What I love so much about this book is how relevant these situations still are and how easy it is to relate to all of the characters. I have read other Jane Austin novels, and so far this is by far my favorite. Elizabeth is such a strong female character, and Mr. Darcy is a wonderfully complex and interesting male character. This is definitely one of my \\"comfort books.\\" Whenever I have had an unpleasant day or need to relax, rereading Pride and Prejudice always makes me feel better. Truly, it is on of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this 'Collector's Library' too. Yes, they used to have it in Barnes and Nobles but somehow they discontinued it. It is a very small book but that's why I like it, I can carry it everywhere I go."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you have never read any of Jane Austen's books, I recommend you read this one. Definitely her masterpiece. Wonderful love story, great characters. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This particular DK edition includes footnoted definitions of terms, illustrated lessons about the time period and culture, and is unabridged. It is a sturdy, glossy paged paperback and has decorative edges on each page. A good library edition or student copy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While this title was Jane Austen's second published work, it is her most popular. First published in the late 18th century under the title \\"First Impressions\\", it was later revised and re-published under the current name.It is an entertaining view into 18-19th century courtship. Recommended for students and literature aficionados alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided on my own to read this book when I was just 12 years old. I immediately fell in love with the language, era, and setting, not to mention the characters and story. My all-time favorite book, I have read it several more times, and probably own every movie and mini-series version as well. Although ours is no longer a culture of manners, life events and human emotions never change. Superb reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The core character in this novel is Elizabeth, an attractive and intelligent 20 year-old and the second daughter (out of five) of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. . Her mother's main interest is to see her five daughters, all eligible, nicely settled down and married to respectable and rich gentlemen.Elizabeth's personality, very unlike her mother's, unfolds throughout the pages in a crescendo of emotions resulting from various issues connected with the whole family saga and especially to her own contrasting feelings towards a certain young man, Mr. Darcy. Will Elizabeth's passionate and sensible nature, combined with a certain degree of boldness (for those days), make her discover what lies beyond his seemingly unpleasant and unreadable personality?The graceful politeness in the prose is charming, delineating a faithful image of life at the end of the 18th century in England.The intrigues beyond wished-for marriages are very accurately described by Ms. Austen, with a touch of humour \\"hither and thither\\". I could not help myself comparing similar issues with nowadays. Beyond the characterisation and a part from the language, style and general progress, I believe that human nature, as depicted, is the same as it always was and it is not all just about \\"love\\", it is also about people attempting to incorporate into a higher position in society, seeking integration at a greater level. It was also interesting, I thought, to see how relevant (or irrelevant) the \\"worth\\" bestowed on the female gender was back then, compared to the present day in most societies. This, combined with the rapidity with which one fell in love, got engaged and/or was forbidden or denied to marry, could be stimulating subjects for ensuing conversations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time - I love rereading it. Elizabeth Bennett is the perfect heroine and a worthy role model for young women. Give a copy of this book to your daughters and nieces - I promise they will love it. Long live Elizabeth and Darcy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You can see from all angles in this book...and then you just want to tell them to express their feelings!! The end is so amazing..how it all comes together, when you almost lose hope it all pulls together. A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A very well written work. Pride and Prejudice is a novel you would want to read again and again. I love the idea of romantic notions--- love letters, unexpected meetings, and 'false hateful feelings.' It's a must have... Jane Austen is one of a kind!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It's such a good read. You will absolutely love the characters, I guarantee it. Elizabeth is such a refreshing heroine, not simpery or weak or stupid but smart and funny and all that stuff. The book itself is hilarious. The funniest scene is the one where Mr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth. It's priceless. Anyway, if you've read Emma and hated it, DO NOT let that keep you from reading this, because they are totally different and this one is worlds better. I highly highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had a lot of fun reading Pride and Prejudice. That is the kind of novel made mostly for intertainment, but it certainly inform us about how people behaved in the old times and what were life perspectives for a girl. Jane Austin was also a master in capturing and describing peoples mind."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must say that Pride and Prejudice is my absolutely favorite book. I have worn out two copies of the BBC/A&amp;E version taped off my t.v. during the broadcasts. I bought the &quot;official&quot; video tapes recently and was estatic to find that this version had 30+ new scenes or parts of scenes. You have one very happy P &amp; P fan."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Pride and Prejudice movie is the best movie along with the book I've ver read and seen. I did'nt think that the movie would stay so close to the dialogue and story. I think Jennifer Ehle is the just the perfect Elizabeth[ pretty, intelligent and witty] and I cant imajine that she is anyone else and Colin Firth- Mr Darcy is everything I'd imajined him to be. I loved all the characters including Mr Collins and have seen this movie 4 times. I was so upset when it finished I wish Jane Austen had written a sequal. If U haven't seen the movie go to the video store and rent it now!! You'll love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book i've ever read in my whole entire life. I just totally fell in love with Elizabeth and Mr Darcy and all the other characters Jane, Kitty, Mr and Mrs Bennet. I think Elizabeth is the perfect role model for all women. I loved her because she's witty, stubborn, polite yet intelligent and gentle, I mean what a woman! I've read the book 7 times and cant get enough of it.The BBC adaptation of the book was brilliant Jennifer Ehle was the perfect Elizabeth and Colin Firth was the perfect Mr Darcy, both were exactly how I'd imagined the characters to be like. I would recommend this book to everyone of all ages because although it was written in the 1813 it's characters are truly hip. It is just the coolest book, I LUVE IT!."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is wonderful. Pride and Prejudice was a joy to read. I had the worst nights' sleep this past week because I truly couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This has to be my favorite Austen book, and my favorite heroine, ever. Elizabeth Bennett is intelligent, witty, and strong, the kind of woman that all women should aspire to be like. The fact that her counterpart, Mr. Darcy, values all of these qualities in her makes it one of the most romantic, yet unassuming stories ever told. The BBC video production is also excellent, and really captures the essence of the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Chapter 12 is my favorite chapter because it talks about what happens around the lives of the family, like when Elizabeth is alone with her sister, and her mother is in another place. The appropriate age for this book is 15 years up because it has words that are difficult to pronounce and comprehend.The literacy device, which l most appreciate, is characteristic because it is the way to know more about the character. This book l like because it is well written and lets you know about how entailing affected the family in those days, which means the women could not inherit property only the male or brother of them. As a consequence the daughters marry someone they don't like so their husbands could inherit the property."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a romantic novel which I absolutely recommend to readers. If one is able to comprehend a 19th century woman's role and priorities, entailment, and discover insights on characters within letters and situations, you will surely appreciate this novel. I would mostly recommend it to readers ages 16 and up.One of my favorite chapters was chapter 34. In this chapter Darcy declares to Elizabeth his love for her and proposes matrimony to her. He does this when his love for her is at a stage where he disregards all obstacles that kept him from doing this earlier. He also does it at a point where Elizabeth's anger towards him is at a crucial point.One of literary devices that I mostly appreciate was irony. For example, in chapter 34 Darcy accuses Elizabeth of being prideful while Elizabeth accuses Darcy of being prejudiced. Even though both characters have fault in pride and prejudice, I found it quite ironic how the reader may think that Darcy symbolizes pride while Elizabeth symbolizes prejudice. Yet these two characters are viewed in the opposite way, where Darcy symbolizes prejudice and Elizabeth pride.I really did like this book, mostly because it did not bore me. I hope other readers appreciate this novel as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group. I recommend this book to whoever is interested in reading it. There is no violence, or any misconduct. The only thing mainly talked about was of love and the social class differences in the 19th century. One literary device that I appreciated is called allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings, and events stand for abstract and moral concepts. An example of this is the distinction people made in social classes. We can see this clearly in the way Mrs. Bennet desperately wanted her daugters to marry rich men, but Elizabeth wanted to marry for love. This moral concept shows readers that money, even though it has a great effect on many people, does not buy true love. I believe it has been one of the best books I have read so far. It was a beautiful, yet confusing love story. My favorite chapter was Chapter 18 from Volume 3. In this chapter Elizabeth and Darcy resolve the unanswered question of their relationship. Darcy had come with Bingley to Longbourn to see if he could make Elizabeth love him, and he knew from Lady De Bourgh's lecture to him about Elizabeth's evilness, that Elizabeth must have cared for him. Elizabeth insists that he only came to love her because she did not try to please him. She tells him &quot;You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them.&quot; She is still embarrassed by the way that she misjudged him from the beginning. He is just as embarrased of his first proposal to her and his behavior toward her until that proposal. Since both Jane and Elizabeth have been proposed to, the entire neighborhood hears of the engagements, and both Elizabeth and Jane recieve congratulations. This is my favorite chapter because this is where all the conflicts are resolved, and thus begins a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I believe that this is an appropriate book for any age group.

I thought that was really hilarious because it determined that Mrs. Bennet just wanted her daughters to marry her no matter what.I think this book is appropriate for teenagers like me who could understand the meaning of the book, and in some situations be connected with the characters. It relates to me because just like Elizabeth didn't marry because of the money, I know that when I marry, I'm going to marry for true love not because of the wealth the man I marry has.A literary device that I appreciate was that Jane Austen used imagery. She helped her readers feel as if we were with the characters. For example when Jane was sick, Elizabeth went to visit her on foot trails and she arrived with soaked and dirty stockings to the house.I like this novel because it made me realize that you should not judge a person with out knowing them. I recommended this book to anyone who enjoys reading love and realistic characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought that this book was a great book. I liked the characters and also the plot. My favorite chapter was chapter ten of volume three. This chapter is about Mrs. Gardiner writing to Elizabeth and telling her about what Mr. Darcy did for his sister. This letter showed Elizabeth Darcy's true character and how much he really cared for her. I think that because of the letter Elizabeth was able to confirm the feelings she had towards Mr. Darcy.This book is appropriate for teenagers and up because Pride and Prejudice has characters with these ages. Elizabeth, Jane and also the Darcy's and the Bingley's were around their twenties. Elizabeth younger sisters were teenagers. The other characters were around their thirties, forty's, fifty's and maybe sixties. Their actions and some of the events that happened with them can be related to some of the things that sometimes happen to us.A literary device that it is used in the story is allegory. Allegory is a story in which the characters, settings and events stand for abstract or moral concepts. Allegorical references are made towards the moral issue of marriage when the Bennett family is disgraced because Lydia has run away with Wickham without the benefit of marriage.I really liked this book because I was able to picture in my mind everything that was going on in the story. Jane Austen is able to bring images and pictures to my mind because she was descriptive, and she also used long dialogues for the characters. I liked the romances and misunderstandings about the main characters because it made the story interesting and it made me wonder what was going to happen in the next chapter. I enjoyed reading the story and also learned about some problems which women confronted in the 19th century such as entailment, which was the main conflict of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is by far one of the best books that I have read in high school. The meaning of the title, Pride and Prejudice, is present throughout the novel. The main characters portray the meaning of the title. It was a must that they, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, marry, but their pride and prejudice were keeping these two characters apart temporarily. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are so different, yet so similar. Pride is one of the main barriers that creates an obstacle to Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. Darcy's pride in his position in society keeps him from interacting with anyone outside his society, which includes Elizabeth. Elizabeth's initial prejudice against Darcy is rooted in pride of her own judgment of people. She was very proud in her ability to judge people by their first impression. But these characters were able to overcome their flaws and realize they were destined for each other.My favorite chapters are chapter 12 and 13 in volume II. I like these chapters because this is where Darcy reveals the truth to Elizabeth and Elizabeth begins to analyze Darcy's actions. Darcy explains the reasons why he prevented Bingley from marrying Jane and the reason why Darcy and Wickham dislike each other. Thereafter, Elizabeth realized the she judged Darcy completely wrong and that her vanity has been the cause of her prejudice. This is the chapter where both Elizabeth and Darcy realize their faults and it is also the turning point in the novel.This novel would be appropriate for people 15 years and older. It does not have a complex plot, and the reader is able to evaluate each character after carefully reviewing their role in Pride and Prejudice.One literary device that I appreciated was the way Jane Austen revealed the personality of each character. Jane Austen revealed the characters through letters, and revealing the character's effect on others. I liked the way Jane Austen used indirect characterization, which forced the reader to use his/her own judgment, thus putting clues together to figure out the personality of each character.I enjoyed this novel and I recommend it to others. Throughout this novel one is able to see the flaws of people regardless of social standings. People from all social levels are alike-they are all PROUD. Therefore, one is able to conclude that human happiness is found by living a life in accordance with human dignity, which is a life in accordance with virtue.

The emotion and attachment set to the characters of such novels is fully upheld and boundaries of literature appreciation are exceeded with the reading of Pride and Prejudice. The essence of a classic novel that can stand the tests of time is displayed in this masterpiece of Jane Austen. Wit and one liners by the ever enjoyable Mr. Bennet reminds you of your favorite uncle, while the observant eye of Elizabeth Bennet reminds you of friend you always wished to have as she takes a stand on the dullness of humdrum society, constantly giving something to ponder and test the limits. This satire on nineteenth century Europe has a wonderful approach, allowing some periods of a curved brow that silently screams in agreement with our heroine, Elizabeth, all occuring between a chuckle of amusement that is often choked by a surprise twist of the storyline of the other well illustrated characters. This novel is recommended for the modern day romantics who would appreciate a played story of hard-to-get; for the everlastining realist who loves the power felt when a opinion and lifestlye is presented against the grain of normality; and finally, for the everyday classical reader who can ever remember a time where self-pride has made a place, only to be broken by the realization that prejudice is only what sets people apart. A classic situaion in our heterogeneous society where everyone carries a pride-filled opinion of our surroundings, forgetting that individually we make up the prejudiced society. Gradual and humble realization is to follow, as in the likewise case of Miss Bennet, while the timeless saga and appreciation of Pride and Prejudice continues..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While I had many high expectations for this novel, they were all far exceeded when I actually picked up the book and read it -- and then could not put it down. Jane Austen's wit and charm constantly present throughout this story make it quite possible to laugh out loud. At a time when marriages were to go not beyond political correctness and money, Austen writes about the Bennett family, whose 5 daughters are all meant to find these advantageous lifestyles. While Mrs. Bennett is on a hurried and frantic quest to marry off each of her daughters, the two eldest, Elizabeth and Jane, are each on a journey of finding their true loves, whether they first realize that at meeting them or not. The plot line keeps entertainment and holds captive attention, and the twists and turns of this novel keep the reader coming back for more. It has my highest recommendation -- so go out and read it today!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After seeing a number of adaptations, I finally decided to read all ofAusten's novels. Northanger Abbey was not bad, and Sense and Sensibilityis excellent. However, this is the best so far. While there is a lot ofinsightful comment on the custom of English society of the time, anddiscussion of the character's motivation, the book just sparkles duringthe interchanges between them. While those between Elizabethand Mr. Darcy are justifiably famous, I would say that many of the othersare at the same level. My favorite are perhaps the interchanges betweenLady Catherine and Elizabeth. I am very much looking forward to readingthe remaining three completed novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a gorgeous little edition of Pride and Prejudice.

But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh. And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years. Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes. In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more. And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\" We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\" \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"We are wrongly told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart. But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion. Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue. Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently presented. Few plays can match such work."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seriously does not get any better than this! This book unfolds slowly allowing you to fall in love with the characters and get a feel that world and time. An amazing love story, it leaves you wanting more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Jane Austen all around, but most especially Pride & Prejudice. If I can't find anything else to read, I pick up P & P. Austen is so very clever, and the multifaceted storyline never gets old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.AHarkius"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are few things more comforting in this world that sitting down with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and a steaming mug of tea. My mother first introduced me to the world of Jane Austen when I was quite young and I will say that this novel is one of the most battered books on my shelf due to how many times I have read it - at least once per annum. For years, audiences have been charmed by the likes of Elizabeth Bennet, the story's sharp-witted heroine, and admired the well-born Mr. Darcy, her verbal sparring partner. There is evidence to suggest that this novel in particular held a special place in Austen's heart, though one could hardly fault her if this is the case.It is impossible for me to resist being drawn in by the Bennet family - the tale of five sisters and an estate entailed away to particularly ridiculous male relation. Though it may be \\"a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" the prospects of marriage for any of the girls are far from ideal. However, more than love and marriage, character takes the center stage of this novel and within its pages is material enough for endless study and enjoyment.I hesitate to say too much more than that this novel is simply a joy to read; it certainly deserves its place in the literary cannon, withstanding the tests of time. I wish that all young girls would read it so that we may have more Janes and Elizabeths and fewer Lydias. I would also freely recommend a viewing of the 6 hour A&E; film after you turn the final page, as it truly does justice to the story - not to mention Colin Firth makes a particularly dashing Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You really need to use your imagination with this book.

Lovely to have it on Kindle to reread anytime, anyplace, anywhere!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen was one of the best writers ever. She has written many books and they are all great. She knows how to write and she knows what she's talking about when she writes too. Which is a major plus for her. She can write in different styles. She knows how to write about characters and she can easily make them seem real. When someone writes like that it is so much better because if you feel like the characters are real it's easier for you to really get into the story. It was a little hard to hard to get into at first but once you got into the book you didn't have a choice to read or not because you had already invested most of your time trying to understand the book. I had this problem. I would have liked it better if it was a little bit easier to read, but it was written a long time ago so I really have no room to complain.I thought the book had good context. Elizabeth was a strong and independent female character. She didn't let much pass her and she was mostly on top of things. I really liked the way Jane Austen had made her seem like a well raised, confident, young women who wanted adventure. She made Elizabeth seem real. Like she could really exist back then. I really liked that aspect of her.When she talked about Mr. Darcy you could tell he had so much pride for everything he had and owned. He was almost close to a stuck up snob, but he made him seem more pleasurable than that. You could tell he really did love Elizabeth too. At first she hated him. She wanted nothing to do with him and she got mad every time she saw him, which was conveniently often. Every time Mr. Darcy had tried to help Elizabeth or her family it just turned into a disaster and resulting with her more and more mad at him.I think Elizabeth finally realized how much she loved Mr. Darcy when he saver her little sister, Lydia, and her entire family from total embarrassment. He didn't have to go and save Elizabeth's family but he still did. Just for her. It probably helped that Lydia had run off with the right guy. If she had ran off with some poor guy she just met off the street he probably wouldn't have been able to do much damage control. But no she ran off with Wickham. This was good for their family, I think, because it brought Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy together once again and this time for good. It had to be a plus that he saved her family and made Elizabeth open her eyes to see that Mr. Darcy was the best man for her. Her perfect match. I would guess that after they got married they still fought like crazy, but what couple doesn't?Jane Austen did a wonderful job writing this book. You can tell she was a skilled author and writer. She cared about what she was writing and you could tell that in her books. It was almost as if she was putting a little bit of herself into Pride and Prejudice.Jane Austen wrote other books too, and like this book you can tell she really poured her heart and soul into her book. I will definitely be reading more of her books sooner than later."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely love pride and prejudice.

With dreams of someday becoming a writer, it almost seems necessary to me to read all of the great works. That was what started me on reading Pride and Predjudice. I was completely sucked in!From the first paragraph about the \\"obvious\\" intentions of a bachelor and his wishes to marry, to the ending underplayed scenes between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, this book is an utter delight from the get-go. Lizzy is by far the best female protagonist I have ever read about. I can relate to her on nearly every level and was thoroughly engrossed in the story.When you begin having dreams of being a character in a book, you know that the book has taken you to a new level.

Jane Austen is a literary genius! \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a heartwarming tale with a beautifully woven plot, filled with witty dialogue and, of course, a charming love story. It is no wonder that this book has been so wildly successful!Reading over the negative reviews of this book, I am very surprised that anyone could not like this story! I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Books i dont think ever get better than this. I recently saw the movie that came out in november and i immeditaly fell in love with the story. I love how this book shows a true romance story. In this day and age i dont think teenagers or people my age even know what a romance movie or book is without the pg-13 parts in it. I was so elated to read about nothing of that sort. It is in my opinion a timeless love story that will win many peoples hearts over and over for generations to come. Mr.Darcy I thought was a very prideful man at first but the more you learn about him, he becomes a very loveable character and suprising one too. As for Elizabeth Bennet she is by far a outspoken but loveable character as well. I think all the characters you run into in the book are so colorful and i wouldnt have thought that a book written so long ago could have characters like that let alone some humor in it too. I think this book never got dull and that everyone should read it. However the words that are used can be quite hard to understand sometimes without having been exposed to words ,and phrases that are said differently, before. Over all it has become one of my favorite books and Jane Austen did a exceptionally good job at writing this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the all time best love stories about a young, feisty women in the 18th century, coping with everything from a mother bent on marriage to a seemingly snotty neighbor's friend.Elizabeth is the second oldest of five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, living in England during the 1800s. And as you can imagine, Mrs. Bennet's main goal is to marry off all of her daughters to wealthy suitors. When word comes that a rich bachelor, Mr. Bingley, is moving into a neighborring manor, the Bennet sisters are beside themselves and Mrs. Bennet's mind is soon set on the pairing of beautiful Jane, the oldest sister, and Bingley after one ball. At said so ball, Mr. Bingely is not alone, accompinied by his sisters and importantly, the very handsome (and very wealthy )but snobbish Mr. Darcy. Darcy later insults Elizabeth, aware she is in his presecene. Now holding a grudge, Elizabeth casts him aside. From then on, event after event seems to throw the two together but the question is: Will their grudges every be able to transform into love?I expected this book to be boring and untolerable but I was forced to shove my own words down my throat after only one chapter. This book is funny with hilarious comments and realistic moments. Everything you could ask for in a book.Recommended- 14 and up. This book can be hard to understand so give or take a couple yearsOverall- This book can be quite confusing to the average American at first considering its sophistacated text, so read it slowly and maybe a second time after awhile. It truly is a great and classic love story so I would encourage everyone to show their support to Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy by reading this enchanting book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you love reading about ballroom dances, castles, romance, and classic British humor, than Pride and Prejudice is the book for you. This 19th century novel has everything you want. It is filled with romance, passion, and drama, with just the right amount of comedy sprinkled in.

Also, the mystery of Mr. Darcy's' true intentions of romance is held up in the air as you whip through the pages of this captivating read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. New York: The New American Library Inc., 1961. 332 pages.Pride and Prejudice is the story of The Bennet family. With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other. Mr. Darcy however slowly starts to fall for Elizabeth and tries to woo her indirectly. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful heart warming story about a journey of love. This book is recommended for anyone who likes to read a good romantic seventeenth century novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the first novel I read by by Jane Austen couple of years back while doing my graduation. And this novel made me an ultimate fan of Jane Austen's writing. Elizabeth and Darcy's characters are carefully and meticulously created.Pride and Prejudice made me buy the entire collection of her works.Highly recommended! :-)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was truly surprised by this tale. I was drawn from the very first page by Mrs. Bennets gossip. What was equally delightful was the sarcastic manner in which Mr. Bennet responded to her chatter, and she was none the wiser. And so begins a tale of wit that engages the minds.From the moment Darcy is mentioned, with his ill manners, we know that he will be key to the story and surely he is. The engaging repetoire between Elizabeth and Darcy is what makes the novel such an interesting read. From their haughty demeanor to falling in love, this tale is rich with engaging conversations.This novel gives an enlightening aspect to the 'higher' society of British life. There is a wicked vein that runs throughout the book, for the outlook on such a life seems quite vain if not ridiculous. Miss Austen does an excellent job of conveying that life to us, with enough wit and sarcasm.I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend it to anyone wanting a witty read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's, Pride and Prejudice, is an intriguing, nerve riveting structure pieced together with utmost meticulousness. Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The lasting appeal of Pride and Prejudice is worth explaining to those who haven't read the book or seen the movies before launching into a review of this British classic. First, there may be no finer book at exploring the topic of how appearances can be deceiving. Those who are physically attractive, employ pleasant manners and flatter us will earn our approval and cause us to feel affectionate towards them. Those who are less attractive to regard, keep to themselves and say insulting things will become people we will think poorly of. To see how misleading those reactions can be in assessing character, compare Abraham Lincoln to Jefferson Davis, the head of the Confederacy. Lincoln was dour, ugly and awkward with people. Jefferson Davis was just the opposite. When it came to character, Lincoln had enough to hold the Union together and is now viewed as one of our greatest presidents. Most people don't remember Jefferson Davis unless reminded.Second, at another level Pride and Prejudice is a delightful romantic comedy that looks at how love develops through a series of painful mischances. Although not as light and funny as Shakespeare's comedies are (A Midsummer Night's Dream comes to mind), Pride and Prejudice will certainly bring a smile to most readers' faces in this regard.Third, Elizabeth Bennet is one of the best heroines ever imagined. Most readers will identify with her and be rooting for her to succeed. You'll almost feel like you've developed a good friend from reading this book.Fourth, Jane Austen is very good at poking fun at the pretensions of those who are self-absorbed or fascinated with social position and money. But it's a loving kind of fun. She realizes that these people are just silly . . . and don't know any better. We can enjoy a good laugh at their expense, but we should still love and support them. It's a good model for dealing with any goofy relatives we have.Fifth, Pride and Prejudice is a benchmark at how far women have come from the days when they often couldn't even inherit property from their fathers. You'll be as outraged as Mrs. Bennet is at these anachronisms . . . but you'll be assuaged to know that the worst of those bad old days are behind us.So, if those reasons to read Pride and Prejudice appeal to you, read on as I briefly describe the story.The Bennets have a challenge: They have five unmarried daughters who cannot inherit Mr. Bennet's entailed estate. With few prospects in the neighborhood, Mrs. Bennet is always on the hunt. Mr. Bennet views Mrs. Bennet's fascination with this challenge as being something he would like to distance himself from.When an eligible young man moves into the area, Mrs. Bennet's instincts are engaged to the fullest. One of her daughters must marry Mr. Bingley. At the next ball, the pickings seem to improve when Mr. Bingley arrives with a friend, Mr. Darcy. Darcy \\"soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person, handsome features, noble mien; and the report . . . of his having ten thousand a year.\\" But Mr. Darcy soon turned the fortune hunters off by only dancing with his sisters and refusing to be introduced to any of the other ladies.Bingley finds himself very attracted to Jane Bennet and their relationship develops nicely . . . until he leaves suddenly for London with no plans to return. Jane waits for some news from him or his sisters and finds herself being cut off.In the middle of this, Mr. Collins arrives. Collins will inherit Mr. Bennet's property upon his death. He has just received a position as a clergyman from a powerful and opinionated sponsor, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and she has told him to get married. With four unmarried cousins, Collins decides the Bennet daughters are his best bet. In this way, he can provide a home for them and their mother after he inherits. First being inspired by Jane, he redirects his attention to Elizabeth after perceiving Jane's interest in Bingley and quickly proposes. Elizabeth will have none of it, and Collins soon finds a more enthusiastic prospect in another local family.The younger sisters are finding themselves more than entertained by the dashing officers in a local regiment. Through this connection, Elizabeth becomes acquainted with Wickham who confides in her that Mr. Darcy had treated Wickham with great unfairness after Mr. Darcy's father's death. That's just one more nail in the coffin for the case against Mr. Darcy.But in the background, we get hints that something is shifting. Mr. Darcy goes from finding Elizabeth to be ordinary in appearance to commenting favorably about one small aspect of her face, her mouth. But put the two of them together, and civil words do not follow. They are like oil and water.Jane and Elizabeth eventually make it to London where both hope that Jane will reconnect with Bingley. But no such luck.Just when things seem to be headed in a most bleak direction, a terrible event occurs that shakes everyone like an enormous earthquake. In its aftermath, each character finds herself or himself needed to re-examine their position and perceptions of one another.Will Jane and Bingley connect with one another again? Will Elizabeth find happiness? Will Mrs. Bennet marry her daughters off? You'll just have to read the book to find out. But unlike modern novelists, remember that Jane Austen wasn't against happy endings.Enjoy a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's great achievement (and she preferred \\"achievements\\" to \\"accomplishments,\\" if you speak early 19th Century English) was to produce a novel esteemed by its contemporaries for what they called its \\"probableness.\\" They noted she employed none of the fictional gimmicks of the time--their equivalents of car chases--and set a new standard for psychogical perception. Sir Walter Scott observed that he could \\"do the bow-wow thing\\" but he could not do this. Those who find fault with the centrality of marriage in the work do not recognize the limited possibilities for women at the time. Given the narrow sea-room available to her, Elizabeth did marvelously with the minimum possible surrender of her personal freedom. Really, though, the one who did marvelously was Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is, in my opinion, one of the best books written. Ever. I read this book as assigned reading in highschool, and fell in love with it. I was even accused of stealing my copy, which I didn't do by the way- I bought my own.Anyway, this book is so well written, the characters so well drawn, the plot so well planned, and the dialog so quick that I feel any praise I can give it will fall short of the mark. So suffice it to say that if you have somehow not been exposed to Jane Austen by this point in your life, you should IMMEDIATLY invest in a copy of Pride and Prejudice.For me this book was a gateway to the wonderful world of Jane Austen novels. Most highly recommened after P&P; (by me anyway) would be Northanger Abbey and Sense and Sensability. I found Emma and Persuasion interesting enough, but did not love them quite as well as I did the three others. I have yet to read the rest of Jane Austens works, but I most assuredly plan to do so.Anything written by Jane Austen is well worth your time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic. Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about. Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income. A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett. In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman. To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction. Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot. The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel. The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter. The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character. The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects. It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said. Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is available for free on the kindle (Pride and Prejudice) or cheaper by other publishers:Pride and Prejudice (Arcturus Paperback Classics)orPride and Prejudice (Oxford World's Classics)orFavorite Jane Austen Novels: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion.It is a great book, but there are other editions that would save you money. I have no idea as to why it is called a 1st edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Sometimes people make assumptions about others without really knowing the person. Almost every character in the book Pride and Prejudice has some type of prejudice towards someone else whether it is money, pride, or jealousy. Elizabeth made the assumption that Mr. Darcy was stuck-up, but he was really just shy and uncomfortable with social events. Elizabeth also thought Mr.Wickham was nice and truthful, but he really was a poor, gambling liar. Mr. Darcy thought that Jane didn't really like Mr. Bingley, but she just doesn't show her feelings very well. Both of Bingley's sisters and Lady Catherine were both against the Bennet family because they were \\"lower class.\\" Some of the prejudices faded, and others grew through out the book. This book is full of pride, prejudice, and love. The theme in this book is really not to judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth. On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Just finished my second time through on this beloved novel, but first time on the printed page with this cool cover that I won online! Just as fun as I remember. Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another, but they both have to overcome their pride and prejudices in order to see the reasons why they should be together and fall in love. I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary. My husband even enjoys watching Pride and Prejudice with me! He's a sucker for the romance!

No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension.

I won't go into detail about the plot, it's a tried and true story, done many times in many forms of movie, I'll cover just a few here. But Mr. Darcy is the epitome of men. A specimen worth lusting over, he is the type of man that all women secretly want. Tall, handsome, and true, he is arrogant, prideful (or not prideful? That's for you to decide), and conceited. He's the type of man that although confident, will make you feel like once he takes you in his arms, you are safe and loved forever. There are many wonderful reasons to read this book, but I believe Mr. Darcy is the main reason women have been reading it for generations.Besides Mr. Darcy, my next favorite characters are Lizzie and her father, a relationship worth noting. They have an affection and understanding betwixt them that is both endearing and enviable. He understands her in a way that most don't and does his best to protect her from her worst enemy, her mother, the one who is always trying to give her away to the first available man. He is commendable. The other daughters are not as noteworthy, obviously Lydia is meant to be childish and annoying and it comes across well. Someone should have slapped that child silly. I almost wish two characters, Mary, the middle sister, and Charlotte, Elizabeth's best friend, had gotten more play. I understand Charlotte was there to represent the many women out there that are sensible and marry for reasons other than love, and so we need her, but it didn't seem fair she got the short end of the stick. And poor Mary, who just wanted to shine in her own way, whether through her demurely moral comments or her piano playing, and was often ignored or rebuffed. I think she had merit and would have liked to see her end up with someone. Alas, it was Elizabeth's story, and more so Mr. Darcy's and so we must focus on them. I absolutely loved it and it was just another example of Austen's genius.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story.

There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...), this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix.

It's inexpensive ($6 or so when I purchased), though compact it is very legible. The paper is thick enough so that the font on the other side doesn't show through. Binding is tight though the spine gets bent quite a lot even after one read through. What I particularly enjoyed was the Collins classic English literature dictionary in the back. It includes many outdated or no longer used terms and words so that you don't have to reach for the computer if you don't really know what an 'entail' is or what 'persnickety' means. But it is a compact, standard mass market paperback size, and that's my one beef.As for the novel. Classic English literature is amazing, and this novel is one of the cornerstones of the 19th century English literature scene. Along with Dickens and the Bronte sisters, Austen's novels seem to capture the lives of the English in these times. Though Pride and Prejudice deals mainly with the wealthy, or at least the privileged class, we get to see a wonderful story unfold. Like the title states, this story deals with the pride of one character and the prejudice of another. Many peripheral plots unfold and help add to the overall story while the main plot moves along quite well.It's a novel that is often placed on reading lists in school, though I feel that in reading this in my early 30s that I can really truly grasp the emotions and trials of these characters more completely. If you read this when young, then do yourself a service and re-read this novel. It's amazing! Then watch the Colin Firth BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Absolutely amazing!

So of course, I bought them as well!When I first started reading the book, being that it was written in 1813 and the language being slightly different then, I found the book a little hard to get into. Although, once I got to know the characters and the story began to unfold, I found myself unable to put the book down (literally). The romance, as well as the relationship, between Elizabeth Bennet & Mr. Darcy was highly intriguing and only added to the chemistry that makes this love story truly amazing! Now, I don't want to give away any of the juiciness that lies within the book so I won't say anymore. You'll really just have to read the book!NOTE: While browsing around, it appears that other authors have written books continuing the \`Pride and Prejudice' story regarding the lives and love of Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth Bennet.

This novel can be enjoyed by anyone, as long as they are not male sexists. Women can write great literature too. This has all right to be called an alltime classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have just finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the second time, and I liked it even more the second time around. (I daresay I might like it even more on a third or fourth reading.) Contrary to some of the reviews I've been reading, it's not just about five shallow young women trying to find husbands with the help of their annoying mother. Sure, some of the young women get married by the end, and the romance of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy is very diverting, but that's not the whole point of the story. For the most part, it deals with the observations of the author, as well as those of Elizabeth and, on a smaller scale, Mr. Bennet. There is social commentary on the ideas of class that many people of that era held so dearly, and the way some of them behaved to get the results they desired, regardless of whom they hurt. Pride and Prejudice also pokes fun at human frailty and absurdity, which, I believe, crosses the boundaries of time. I found myself laughing out loud at some points at the behavior of the minor characters and how some of the major characters reacted to it. Most importantly, there is a lesson to be learned: how a good person can overcome his or her first impressions, his or her pride and prejudice, and get to know the real heart and soul of the person. As some other reviewers have said, the enjoyment of this novel is in the journey, not the ultimate ending.I think those who called it boring more likely found the slightly antiquated and verbose language a bit too difficult to follow. I will admit I was a bit daunted by it at the beginning, but once I got into the flow of the novel, I realized it wasn't that hard. One thing that really helped me get into the novel (which I highly recommend) was watching the excellent 1995 A&amp;E/BBC adaptation before reading it. By doing that, I knew what was going to happen and could pay more attention to the inner workings of the novel, the commentary. As I read, I found myself really enjoying the language (rather than hoping for a translator to appear) and wishing I could argue as eloquently as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy seemed to do.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a sharp, acerbic commentary on the absurdity of human nature, and I wish those who gave it one or two stars would give it another try."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"_Pride and Prejudice_ is the story of Elizabeth Bennett, one of my favorite heroines(I think that every strong heroine since must be based on her in some way), and Mr. Darcy, one of my favorite heroes(I've been in love with him since I first read the book). There are misunderstandings and scandals and very irksome supporting characters that you just want to strangle, but it's a wonderful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My measure of a superb novel is the ability to read it many times and be able to find something new or to see characters and occurences from a different perspective. This novel never disapoints. With each reading, Mr. and Mrs. Elliot have become more complex, funnier, and also sadder. Jane has become more than just a sweet girl pining for a lost love. Her passivity and inability to express her emotions seem a subtle warning to those of us who may share Jane's foibles. Elizabeth seems more self-conscious, more aware of her times, a woman's place, and the class system within which she must operate. Against this background she appears braver and wittier, her observations more trenchant. It would be hard to find a character as pompous and awful as Mr. Collins, yet he also elicits one's sympathy. And Mr. Darcy is wonderful in his rudeness and his smoldering desire. His haughty proposal to Elizabeth and her stinging reply are still hurtful. His subsequent letter is the opening gambit to the breaking down of Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice. These characters are so real and their emotions so true that the 150-plus years that separate us quickly disappear."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thought this book was great. Not only is Elizabeth a strong main character, but the supporting characters make the book very enjoyable. They are so funny; especially the mother. I couldn't put it down. I loved it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must confess up front that I am a sucker of love stories. As such, Pride and Prejudice had me hook, line, and sinker from the beginning, turning page after page to find out if Elizabeth, the heroine, would find happiness in the end.A female friend of mine recommended the book to me (as did my girlfriend) with the caveat that most guys she knew complained that &quot;nothing happened&quot; in it. Needless to say, if you're looking for action and intrigue, look elsewhere. There is some little intrigue in Pride and Prejudice, but the heroine(s) play a strictly passive role. All the excitement in the novel stems from the suspense of the Bennet sisters' romances.Another minor caveat: I was initially slightly distracted by Austen's style of writing, which sometimes seems a bit distant from the action of the narrative (at least to someone more accustomed to more modern works).However, I feel that this hardly detracts from what recommends Pride and Prejudice the most (and what all love stories require): interesting characters to whom the reader can become emotionally attached and believable obstacles to their deserved happiness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a true English masterpiece. Not only is it magical,funny and sensitive. Austen also manages to entice you into her world. She creates the most perfect hero in Mr Darcy, a man willing to do anything to be with the woman he loves, even if it means having to stand Mrs Bennet as his mother-in-law. With Elizabeth, Austen manages to create a heroine who could easily be envied in both the nineteeth and twentieth just for her wit, intelligence and her honesty. Do not judge this book before reading it as a girly, old and an out dated piece that your English teacher rambles on about. It really does make you realise that there was life so long ago, and people have not really changed that much."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of the greatest classics I have ever read. The story of five young daughter's lovelives, along with their impertinent mother and lovable but sarcastic father, it is definitely a good read. The plot picks up as the book progresses, leaving the reader striving to know one thing: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy realize their profound love for one another and finally get together? I definitly reccomend reading this book. Try it, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must be honest and say that I had a prejudice against the book. I never thought that I would ever enjoy such a novel. To my surprise I could not put it down. The characters had charisma and charm and the tale holds a universal theme that can be understood despite the decades. I throughly enjoyed this book. A classic, timeless, and amazing piece of literature, I have the utmost regards for this novel. It was a spectacular piece of work that I cannot say enough about. Wonderful!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel took me completely by surprise. I had seen the movies &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, and I decided to give this one a chance. It is by far, one of the best romance novels I've ever read. It is old-style romance, and yet the language and the feelings of Elizabeth Bennet truly capture every essence of what a woman feels when encountered with different situations. Although we see everything mostly through the eyes of Lizzy, a person cannot help to admire Jane Austen's ability to let your imagination be transported, momentarily, to a world where human beings are not so evil after all, and love is worth more than what is portrayed today in the media. Although the movie is very accurate, I would strongly encourage everyone to read this novel. If it is, indeed, Jane Austen's best work, it is absolutely worth every penny. Let yourself be absorbed into this magnificent story of all-time, and don't be surprised if by the end of it you feel like reading it all over again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anyone who has ever abandoned a first impression of another for quite an opposite assessment of the person... or had a disingenuous &quot;friend&quot;... or been mortified by a parent's behavior in front of someone whose opinion mattered... or had a wanton and unrepentant sibling... or been able to lay bear to an object of affection the true meaning of all of the crossed signals and misunderstandings that occurred up until that point... To any such persons (and several more), Austen's novel, though nearly two hundred years old, will surely ring true. As in most any romantic comedy, there is not much question of the couple(s!) getting together in the end, but it's the getting there--and, of course, the revelation of it all in the end--that is the fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An amazing book. After watching the movie more than 20 times I always wanted to read this. It was as great as the movie and a must read/watch."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Wonderful look back into a more romantic time. When ladies were proper ladies, and men were true gentlemen. Sweet love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Everyone should read this. The English in it is from the era it was written.

A beautiful story well written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":".it was a freebie. it was a paperless book. why not take advantage of it right? not like WHOA! book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of 10,000. and Bingley 5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, it still makes me smile. An American classic beyond measure!

There are TONS of these types of adaptations and explorations of the original novel, and for good reason: it is excellent."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Believe it or not, I had never actually read Pride and Prejudice, though I have been an English and Drama teacher for over a decade. This book not only gave me the full text, but the little \\"insights\\" in the margin were interesting and often inspired my interest even more into the works of Austen. I think this would be a great book for everyone - those who have never read it and those who are on their hundredth reading. Kudos to the author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I would have liked to have met Jane Austen, and I think she would find it entertaining that her books have lasted as long as they did.I won't review the book itself, but rather, the Kindle version of it. The book was free (amazing) and works splendidly across my non-Kindle devices, my iPod touch and my Blackberry. That way, I can sneak 10-15 mins worth of reading in on the train or bus without worrying about people making judgements about a man reading Austen.The test of a classic novel is whether or not you want to keep it handy and refer to it when you need inspiration, a solid read or just to get lost in a different world. Thanks to the Kindle edition of Pride and Prejudice, I can pretend I'm in the world of Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason.

I loved the movie and I was inspired instantly to read Jane Austen's classic novel. Despite the fact that I had already seen the movie and knew the general progression of events I was still captivated by the novel. Jane Austen writes with an incredible literary style that is lacking in the works of most contemporary authors. She has an eloquence of words that is complex and yet far easier to read than most people seem to think. Though I am usually not a fan of novels that are based in reality without any hint of the supernatural I was enthralled by Austen's timeless love story which will leave every female reader pining for the dark and brooding Mr. Darcy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is an incredibly talented author and although I do love her other books, I do believe that Pride and Prejudice is her best work. I am one of those individuals who thoroughly enjoys reading great literature from around the world but to be completely honest, I had never read this book until after the new movie was released a couple years ago. After falling in love with the film, I went out immediately to purchase the novel and upon completion, Jane Austen \\"bewitched me body and soul\\" (as Mr. Darcy would say).Elizabeth Bennett remains to be one of the most complex, interesting, and relatable characters I have ever read. She encompasses all the alluring qualities a respectable lady was supposed to possess from that time era but additionally, many rebellious attributes that links her personality and inner battle with personal feelings vs. societal conventions, to modern day. She knows the place of women in the community- how they should talk, interact in society, her social standing, especially in relation to men, however, she also struggles with ideologies of romance and being her own individual- speaking her mind, voicing her opinions- no matter if it is Lady Catherine or her best friend Charlotte, as well as denying reputable marriage proposals for the hope of finding true love.Pride and Prejudice is not just an enrapturing love story but really transports you into a time period that is much different from today's world. It gives you insight into a completely different lifestyle, exposes the flaws and obsessions of a culture, and most importantly, it is all done so from a revolutionary point of view- the perspective of a woman who doesn't necessarily agree with the rules of societal acceptability.It is a great book and I whole-heartedly recommend reading it. And it only gets better each time you read it. I guarantee you too will fall in love with all the characters of Pride and Prejudice. If Lizzy or Mr. Darcy don't satisfy your need for a personal connection, I'm sure you can identify with the many other colorful characters- the deceiving, selfish, yet undeniably charming Mr. Wickham, the benevolent and kind spirited Jane Bennett, the frivolous Lydia Bennett, or even the middle child Mary Bennett, who even though is most accomplish, often goes unnoticed and under appreciated.

What I can do, however, is give an honest and heartfelt account of what I thought of Jane Austen's 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE'.

I thought if I was going to start reading a classic novel Jane Austen would probably be a good author to start with and what better choice was there than her stand out 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' ? I was pleased to find out that I was absolutely right. 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' has to be one of the most romantic novels that I have ever read. The romance between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy literally made me swoon quite often (and I don't swoon!).

The female narrator reads all of the character's dialogue, but in a way that is easy to listen to. She doesn't overemphasize, nor is she monotone. It's the perfect companion if you are taking a long drive alone, which my mom often does. I recommend this product 100%."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story is famous and in no need of review. The Penguin classic has decent size print and makes the effort to come as close to the original manuscript as is reasonably possible. What more is there to want? Also the price is excellent, so that it will not be difficult to replace after I have worn it out."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from \\"Gossip Girl\\" and \\"The Hills\\". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused.Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity.The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing.For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as \\"she fancied herself nervous\\" (page 7) or \\"a mixture of quick parts\\" (page 7).Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These little classic editions are perfectly sized (small) and handsomely built. And the price is RIGHT. They are my favorite reading books -- nice binding and pages. I also enjoy the occasional illustrations. And they look very nice on my bookshelf. I'm so glad Amazon is stocking them!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with &quot;Once you get past . . .&quot; but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never before have I read a book as Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice. Honestly, I don't read much book but I'm glad that I read this one.Throughout the first and most of the second volumes, Eliza criticized Mr. Darcy for his conceited, haughty attitude. She berated him for being so snobby at the balls. Eliza made assumptions about Mr. Darct only using his appearance and brief conversations with him as her premise. She also believed rumors from absolute strangers (Mr. Wickham) that slandered Mr. Darcy's reputation. Any bad news that she could find even the most baised resource was a good enough for her, just as long as it intensified her hatred for Darcy. One of the greatest accusations she put against him was his acts of prejudce and his big pride. However, she had made these conclusions based on her own prejudce against Darcy. This is the irony. She was a hypocrite in her own way. She deserves equal censure for her pride and prejudice. Unfortunately she realized her defects at near end. It is not surprisng that hse feels horrible about her discovery of her true self. The irony in all of this is that she got so caught up in finding Darcy's evil that she became who she hated most. She became the vain and prejudced one. She became the enemy she loathed so much. As you can plainly see, this book had a lot of impact on me. It was really enriching to read and Austen's delicate use of language which integrates the formality of that time along with slight English humor. The amalgam of languages helped me develop an intense vocabulary. I learned a lot of new words and feel better about writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, truly shows what great books are made of. The novel revolves around a distressed mother desperately trying to marry her daughters off before her husband dies. As a result, some hilaroius mishaps and misunderstandings occur, turning the novel into a humorous love story. Its conclusion will leave you smiling for days. A great book for anyone interested in love and all its follies!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's novel, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, was a great novel written as a portrayal of what life was like in the eighteenth century in England. This amusing tale revolves around an embarassing couple, named the Bennets and their five daughters. The Bennets, were what I would consider to be one of the most disfunctional families in all of history. The book starts way back in time when women could do nothing but to marry well, and as one can see having five daughters was more a curse, than a blessing.In the beginning Mrs. Bennet starts off by telling her daughters to marry well. At the same time, a wealthy man moves close to Netherfield, the house that they live in. The oldest of the five daughters, Jane, falls in love with this man, whose name later turns out to be Charles Bingley. Charles falls in love with Jane, depite her family's strange ways. Mr. Bingley and his friend Darcy talk often of the Bennet sisters, and later Mr. Darcy falls in love with one of them... the oldest Elizabeth, but she unfortunately turns him down, even though she later begins to have some other feelings for him. Lydia, the youngest daughter elopes with a man named Mr. Wickham and the family is very upset about this action. Jane and Mr. Bingley are getting closer but his younger sister Caroline tries to break them apart.Jane Austen's novel reflects many ways of life, including both the good and the bad times, all while in the search for happiness. This novel's story almost reminds me of another classic called, Little Women, which surprisingly enough was not written by Austen, because it has the same type of story line."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read &quot;P&amp;P&quot; when i was very young and i enjoyed it but didnt understand much other than Lizzie Bennett was adorable. but i recently read it again and it was so wondeful, all the subtle humor and irony behind what seems to be just a simple love story. what's amazing is that even thought the book was written in Regency England the characters seem so recognizable: the pompous sycophant Collins, the overbearing mom Mrs. Bennett, the dishonest charmer Wickham, and of course, the sometimes self-righteous, sometimes sharp-tongued, but always lovable Lizzie, who's just my favorite. Now that i have a boyfriend i can understand the relationship between lizzie and darcy much better: unlike today's soap operas, where people jump into bed within minutes of meeting, Austen recognizes that true love takes time to develop and that lovers dont always say or do the right thing. it's just wondeful, the whole book, and i recommend all girls read if only to have a real role-model in Lizzie Bennett."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They \\"went to town on business\\" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E; movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story. I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it. However, I was very mistaken! I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period. I loved it! I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E; movie kept, but no movie could ever compare! I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutley loved this book and had to keep reminding myself it was written ages ago. Apart from the dialogue, which was sometimes hard to understand, the story is timeless. Each character in this book was well developed and interesting. The twists and turns of the novel were well planned and thought out to keep the reader wanting more. I loved the setting of this book and Jane Austen's descriptions made you feel that you were there with them. This book is witty, charming, emotional and endearing. There is only one thing I didn't like about it...there wasn't a sequel. I recommend this book to anyone who's interested in a classic and a true romance.Bravo Jane Austen!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is the first classic I've ever read and I really must credit Jane Austen for her wit. That's what got me sitting through the whole plot!The story is clear from the first chapter: Mrs. Bennet is trying for get her daughters married before her husband dies because since all five of her children are female, they won't get to inherit any of their father's money. Smart and sharp Elizabeth is the heroine in this book, and has a thing for judging people at a first meeting. It is not surprising that she developes an immediate annoyace for the arrogant Fitzwilliam Darcy. Darcy's friend falls madly in love with Elizabeth's sister Jane, who is astonishingly beautiful and shy.It's actually pretty boring to sit through the parties and dances, but there are some characters to keep us alive. Mrs. Bennet is one of the most comical characters ever; I can picture every one of her expressions when she is freaking out about her poor nerves. Lydia is flirtacious to the point of silliness. Mr. Collin's proposal to Elizabeth is so absurd,the seriousness of his stupidness and love for Lady Catherine de Bourgh is absolutely funny. Jane Austen has made her characters so lively and significant, you think you know them.Aside the fact that I've got a problem with Mr. Darcy being so rich and handsome (if I remember correctly), I liked this book. There are several turning points in this story, such as the letter that uncovers the charming officer into a man exploiting girls for money, and Elizabeth's sister eloping. I know Pride and Prejudice is incredibly old-fashioned, but that can't be helped. Try reading it at least."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book, my eyes have been opened to not only outward character but inner personality. Truly no other book has ever acheived international acclaim for so long. The reason is clear one of Jane Austen's best works, Pride and Prejudice has proven to contain the finest of elements which only contibutes to it's immortal relation of what happened during her days.

The observations are sometimes humorous and add to the text. I only wish there was another book after this one, or two or three. :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a book of great literature merit. The articulate language and complex characters draw the reader into the story of sisters trying to find their place in life. The way in which it is written is rare to find in today's society, creating a sense of mystery and the unknown about society of the past. Elizabeth Bennett, the heroine of the novel, is a character that is easily relatable to for women both in the time that it was written and for modern women today. She struggles internally to find where her heart truly belongs, and leads the reader to question whether they themselves are actually proud and/or prejudiced."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a masterpiece and the Penguin Hardcover classic version is pure pleasure to read. The screen printed cover is novel and appealing - though some of the image came away with the sticker on the back. It has a good size/shape/heft and the pages have a nice thickness to them. I did not notice any errors in the text. I have not yet read the introduction to this book, but have greatly enjoyed the introductions included in other Penguin Hardcover classics (especially Jane Eyre).I definitely recommend this copy of Pride and Prejudice. Not only is it delightful to read, but it also looks lovely on the shelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had the pleasure of being assigned this book in my senior year English Literature class. It quickly became my favorite book. 20+ years later....I've read it cover-to-cover so many times, I wore the binding off. I now have this on my Kindle and read my favorite chapters quite often.Don't we all secretly wish for our own Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was my breakthrough, oh my God I love reading, book back in high school. I always did well in English class, but I never deeply loved literature until we read this book. I read far beyond the assigned pages in class because I loved Jane Austen's writing, her characters, and her witty lines. I often found myself smiling and occasionally laughing while reading the book. This book had such a profound influence on my life that I'm now an English major in college. After reading this I sought out other books in the same style like the Bronte sisters. Over the years, I've basically forced all of my friends and poor boyfriends to read this book so I could talk about it with them. I'd recommend this book to absolutely anyone who can understand and tolerate the language and dialogue. I'd recommend reading the first few pages for free here on Amazon, and if you can follow the writing of the time, get this book right away. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a true timeless british classic romance.

Jane Austin really knows how to make the characters come alive and you experience the book as if you are the one telling the story. You also get to see what life would have been like back then, you get to see and experience something you would not have otherwise experienced yourself. I am sure it was not an easy task to write feelings for another person. Unless you experience them yourself, how can you say it for another? The book kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next, and I truly did not want to put it down, until I had read it all. If you like history, romance, and a great story line then I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen masterfully tells this story which helps the reader engage in the relationships of people. Like her earlier compelling novel, Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice is a romance story. Although there are many different printings of this work, T. Egerton, Whitehall first published it in January 28th 1813 with roughly 370 pages. While the original print did not have illustrations the first wonderful pictures were by Pickering & Greatbatch.Pride and Prejudice owes much of its popularity to its vivid portrayal of character. The story is set in early 19th-century England, a trying time for any unmarried maiden. Elizabeth, the second eldest of the Benett sister, was as open as a closed book shielding her true feelings. While Mr. Darcy would proudly separate himself from the common folk. Both characters are very likable despite their flaws.This pleasurable tale begins with the worries of a caring mother. Back then it was incredibly important for women to get married and none of her five daughters had. Thankfully a young bachelor by they name of Mr. Bingley came to town and was immediately attracted to the oldest Benett sister, Jane. Elizabeth on the other hand was somewhat fond of Mr. Darcy but he seemed to show no interest. Although Jane and Mr. Bingley had grown quite close, he left along with the rest of his party leaving a brokenhearted Jane behind. Elizabeth found out that Mr. Darcy was the one who convinced Mr. Bingley to go. While she was visiting at a friend's house she and Mr. Darcy crossed paths and he tried to propose to her. Still upset that he had broken up Mr. Bingley and her sister she declined the proposal.After a heated argument with Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth saw eye to eye with him and realized they had both been prejudice and maybe a little proud. Fortuitously, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy both moved back to town were they showed up to the Benett's house and had a somewhat awkward conversation. Later Mr. Bingley, who arrived alone, asked if he could speak to Jane apart from the other. A proposal maybe? If that wasn't enough to fill the mind of Elizabeth, knowing she thinks of Mr. Darcy differently would.Interestingly Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both recognized that they were prideful and prejudice. Which hints to why the title is call Pride and Prejudice. They're imperfect characters, and that's what people like about them! When I was reading this book I realized what made it different from other romance novels is that the love unfolded gradually. At some points in the book it seemed as if they didn't like each other at all. A lot of stories now a days quickly get to the point, forgetting that telling the story is the best part."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I wanted to read some of the classic novels that are available for Kindle, and now I am hooked!

Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down, Austen immediately sucks you in with witty word play, dramatic irony, and catching plot points. The novel captures a wide audience, whether the reader is a hopeless romantic or more practical. It appeals to everyone; I can guarantee that future readers will not be disappointed. The main character, Elizabeth, is complex, stubborn, and full of wit. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both exude passion. Although there are multiple story lines the majority of the plot revolves around the love-hate relationship of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet. Their relationship is full of twists and turns that are incredibly enticing to the audience. \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" this is the opening line of the novel, and it is perhaps one of the most know phrases in literature. It is incredibly ironic, and ties into the whole book.Pride and Prejudice is a spectacular book for the reason that it leaves readers wanting nothing. Some readers may say that it is an unrealistic ending, because many of the main characters had their fairy tale ending. In my opinion that is what makes this book a great read. There aren't enough happy endings in the world, but when reading about them it feels as if it's your own personal happy ending. Overall, it's a classic romance that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a clever, well written, and whirlwind romance."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for my English class, and I have to say that I loved it!

It was a gift for my girlfriend because she loves Pride and Prejudice as well as books with classic and artful bindings. It was a perfect gift and I plan on buying the collection."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen has been considered a classic for many years and now that I've read it I definitely agree with its status. I read this book for a school project and did not expect much when I began reading. It was very difficult for me to get into the language and understand what was going on in the plot. I considered the book a bore until I was more than half way done reading it. I'm not sure at which point this transformation took place but I found myself completely engrossed in the characters and the plot. I wanted so badly for Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy to get together! I absolutely could not stop reading until I was done with the last page of the last chapter. Once I had finished I just sat there for a few minutes, reflecting on my experience with this book. My advice to readers who are struggling with the language is to keep reading! The challenge is part of the success you will feel when you finish the book. Jane Austen writes with beautiful imagery and has wonderful diction. This love story will touch you to the core. I am convinced that I will read Pride and Prejudice again, and in the second reading I will enjoy the first half of the book much more. I would say the ideal age to read this is college or older, at the youngest I would say a senior in high school. I urge you to read Pride and Prejudice and to let yourself appreciate Jane Austen's brilliant writing technique."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is one of my all-time favourites. It's Jane Austen's BEST literary work. This book revolves around 2 main characters- Elizabeth &amp; Darcy. Then there is Elizabeth's elder sister, &amp; her lover, Mr. Bingley. And then there are these other members of Elizabeth's family-Kitty, Lydia, Mary &amp; her mother, who are all silly &amp; superficial. Mr. Bennet (Elizabeth's father), feels Elizabeth is the only sensible one of the family. She certainly IS sensible, but not in love. When Mrs Bennet learns that Mr. Bingley &amp; his friend, Mr.Darcy have moved in Netherfield, she is overjoyed. After all, a bachelor with a huge fortune is always a target for matchmaking mamas. She schemes different ways to make Mr. Bingley fall in love with Jane, her eldest daughter. In the mean time, Elizabeth is busy antagonising with Mr. Darcy. But while all this is going on, a military regiment comes to town, &amp; the younger Bennets are busy flirting with the officers, the most popular of all being Mr.Wickham. After a few months of staying in Netherfeild, the Bingleys &amp; Mr. Darcy depart, leaving behind a trail of broken hearts. (the most important being Jane who really is in love with Mr.Bingley, but is no match for Mr.Bingley's sister,Caroline Bingley). After their departure, Mr Wickham discloses something about Mr.Darcy which makes everybody declare that they always knew him to a proud, selfish &amp; disagreeable man. Elizabeth, of course, believes him. Darcy, meanwhile realises that he has fallen in love with Elizabeth, but his pride is revolted by the very fact of marrying beneath himself. Whether he overcomes his pride &amp; proposes to her, what she does when he proposes, &amp; what happens after that, I'll allow to read it yourself. In the midst of all this lies the magnificent &amp; imposing figure of Lady Catherine de bourgh &amp; William Collins (also Elizabeth's cousin), who worships the very ground she walks on. This a VERY good book, &amp; the potrayal of the characters is so true, like its taken from real life. Take my advice..READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel of which I spent many a night, studiously reading, was a true masterpiece. The irony and satire with which Austen displayed the seventeenth-century society was beautifully mastered. The humor was impressive and understandable to the common reader. The relations, especially between Darcy and Lizzy kept the reader guessing about how their relationship would turn out. Thanks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is a truth not universally acknowledged, that \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is probably not Jane Austen's best book. That honor is reserved for \\"Mansfield Park\\", a much deeper work. But it's almost everybody's favorite Austen, including mine, as much for the unforgettable characters as for the story.Elizabeth Bennet is the perfect heroine: she's bright, sharp, likeable, perceptive, nobody's fool, infinitely fallible, like all of us; but, unlike most of us, able to see and admit when she is in the wrong. Unlike her wacky mother and her shallow younger sisters, she does not see snaring a husband as her sole object in life, and thus she is supremely capable of putting Mr. Darcy in his place. Darcy's progression from an insufferable snob to an empathetic human being results from the realization that money and an old name are insufficient recommendations to a woman with real class, intelligence and character.Elizabeth's family is also well portrayed. We can understand why Elizabeth is her father's favorite child; he is as sharp and perceptive as she is, totally sensible and down to earth, a perfect foil for the ditzy Mrs. Bennet, who is so ridiculous you wish a chandelier would fall on her head, obsessed with marrying off her five eligible daughters. We know how the book is going to end almost as soon as it begins; Jane will hook Mr. Bingley in spite of the machinations of his nasty sisters, and Elizabeth, of course, will become Mrs. Darcy.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is very much of it's time, set at the end of the 18th century, but it's been loved by generations of readers for the past two hundred years and looks good for at least another two hundred. It's quintessential Jane Austen.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my first Jane Austen novel. It did not dissapoint!! New Years Resolution to read as many of the \\"classics\\" as I could. I have been pleasently surprised by this book. It left me wanting more and sad that it was over. Now I can't wait to read all of Jane Austen's books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"So many people - especially in the younger, 'trendier' generations, quite literally groan at the thought of reading a classic. And yet they do not realize these books are classics because they relate so well. They may not know that some of today's hottest blockbusters are based on this story; the unlucky in love bridget jones was based on this eloquent novel. as was the bollywood hit Bride and Prejudice.This story is about the wit of a young woman, who is unable to fight for her position in society with anyone else. This story stands for the right-minded, showing how they can change everything around them with only a touch of cleverness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a charming and witty excursion through the trials and tribulations of a middle-class English family at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Most of the action centers around a young spitfire named Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy), who, along with her four sisters and mother and father, is trying to negotiate the erratic fortunes of love and courtship amid the complexities of economics and social class.The independent and stubborn Lizzy meets the proud and very wealthy Mr. Darcy. His pride won't allow him to admit his feelings for her, and her adamant refusal to see his better qualities (her prejudice) stands in the way of their making a closer acquaintance. And so it goes for about three hundred pages -- but they are an intriguing three hundred pages of revelation, counter-revelation, comedy, and light suspense. However, to any experienced reader of romance novels, the ending will never seem much in doubt.Since Pride and Prejudice is a nineteenth-century romance novel, a prospective reader should bear in mind that the vocabulary and syntax reflect the time in which it was written. It has been called a seminal work and is standard fare in high school and college English courses; it certainly deserves that distinction. However, loading all this importance onto the book will constrain the casual reader from enjoying it as I imagine Jane Austen would have preferred -- a simple work of entertainment.The Oxford World's Classics edition includes a useful (but quite scholarly) introduction that provides the reader with a historical context for the novel and some background on Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is possibly one of the most beautifully written novels of all time. As one turns the pages of this timeless classic, she is brought into the wonderfully romantic world of Elizabeth Bennet and the rest of the so vividly depicted characters. One becomes familiar with the lavish mansions and picturesque countryside that envelope the setting of this novel, and at once becomes a part of the drama that surrounds the young women on whom the novel focuses.By far, my favorite character in Pride and Prejudice was Mr. Bennet. His quick wit and ability to survive in a household filled with marriage obsessed females are prime examples of the wonderful humor Austen brings to the novel. Another character I became quite fond of was Lizzy, for as a young female myself, I felt that the obstacles and tribulations she faced throughout the novel, especially the pressures put on her by her family and society, were timeless trials that all women go through.The turn of events in this magical novel leaves the reader both enthralled and ultimately satiated with the happy endings for the main characters. The plot is both unexpected and fulfilling at the same time, for Austen's writing is, at times, more gratifying for her characters than one could even devise in her own imagination. As the reader enters the world of the Bennets she gains a new perspective and appreciation of this era that lasts throughout the novel and leaves you thirsty for more at the end."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read the Barnes and Noble Classics edition. This book dragged on and on in the middle and it is not an easy read due to the language of the time. But it's a fun, character-driven novel. My favorite character was the father - he's a riot! Don't expect much to happen, but there's a lot going on. For example, it's an interesting study of British class differences at the turn of the century. Also, the options women had were much more limited than today and it made for very different relationship dynamics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I started this book, I must say, it was with dragging feet. It was assigned to me for school and I was prepared for a sappy romance story, probably with big words, like most classics. The first half seemed to be living up to my expectations, minus the big words. In fact, it was so simply written that I began to wonder why it was called a classic at all. I know I may be speaking blasphemy according to some people, but all I could think in the beginning was that this was some twaddle about a bunch of giggly girls from the Victorian era! Then the middle came. At just about the exact middle of the book, things got interesting. Tension was rising; emotions were running like a river through rapids, and I was hooked. I suddenly found myself reading more chapters than I was assigned to that week, and of all the books I had to read in a week, that was the first one I picked up. I can't tell you any more specifically what grabbed me for fear of giving too much away, but I will tell you this: it may take awhile to get there, but it's well worth the wait. Once I had finished it I had to go back and read all my favorite parts! Now I, who sneered at Austen at the first, am planning on reading \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" over the summer. Austen, you have me converted!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you haven't read this book yet, you really must do so! I never read any Jane Austen in school etc, and just out of nowhere picked up \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" recently. It instantly became my new favorite book.

I warned my husband, though, that I'm not in love with another man.. and his name is Mr. Darcy :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is simply timeless, I reread it this Summer for the first time since high school and somehow I learned to appreciate Jane Austen's work even more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can not even begin to write the review that this book deserves. My only regret is that I didn't read this book sooner! If you enjoy a good love story then you MUST read this book! The characters were so well developed and the story was so well delivered that it was virtually impossible to put it down. In my opinion, this book deserves way more than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always had a soft in my heart for Jane Austen. In fact, I can not say that there is any of her books that I do not like. About a month ago, I received my first kindle, as a graduation gift, from my boyfriend. I have to say at first I was very uncomfortable with using it because it just seemed like it would be very hard to read from it. I hate reading off the computer. However, I promised him that I would try. However, with this experiment I did not want to waste money on a book that I may never read from the piece of equipment. After searching Amazon I found the free section of ebooks and was delighted to find my tried and true author amoung those. This was the first ebook I had heard and though it has been many years and still enjoy it, greatly. Plus, I found that the kindle was right up my alley.Thanks, Jane; for giving me a book that never fails to capture my attention."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This story is one of the greatest pieces of English literature to ever be written. It may take some time to actually get hooked to the book, but once you do, don't count on putting it down. The tension between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy leave you wanting more. The love in the story leaves you speechless. It's a battle between the rich families and the poor families. I loved the book because it is a beautiful story that deals with tension, love, heartbreak and so much more! Also, the version of this book is easy to understand. The book is amusing, well written and I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I could read P&P; over and over again, watch a million film adaptations, and never get sick of the seething love story behind it. The story of Elizabeth & Darcy is what all fiercely independent women (or those of us who would like to become such) dream of -- uncompromising love with a man who is somehow both kind and sexy and equal in every way.No one does romance like the Brits, and most subsequent romance stories are just rehashing the tales of Austen, Bronte, and the like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"*happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i really love this book! i liked the movie with keira.

I really do. It's one of my favorite novels. But, I must confess, it's not my favorite Jane Austen novel. I like both Persuasion and Emma better and Sense and Sensibility is very, very close.I first read the book when I was 14 and I absolutely loved Elizabeth Bennet and her sharp wit. I really liked Darcy too, but everyone paled in comparison to Elizabeth. I thought the story was incredibly romantic. I even thought Mr. Bennet was a doll. I saw the 1995 version very shortly after I finished the book and my opinions were less than favorable. But that's a review for another day.My opinion has changed over the years and frequent rereads. I saw what a bad father and husband Mr. Bennet really was. I still like Elizabeth and Darcy, but mostly because they are dynamic characters who mature and grow to become a worthy couple. I find Elizabeth quite immature and a bit too sure of herself in the beginning and Darcy to be on the controlling side. They are both proud and both prejudiced in the beginning but I do like that they learn from their mistakes and change.The book is a delightful comedy of manners. But I more highly admire Elinor Dashwood, Anne Elliot, and even Fanny Price than Elizabeth Bennet. And I'd take Frederick Wentworth, Henry Tilney, Mr. Knightley, or Colonel Brandon over Darcy. Although the 10,000 a year does work in his favor..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and it is one of my favorites of all time! the characters are very detailed and believable, and the plotline is very interesting and dramatic without being totally unbelievable. having wanted one guy before discovering that another one was my match myself, I totally relate to this book. I also find the 17th-century culture aligned in the book interesting, such as the fact that girls were forced to marry for economic reasons by a certain age, often with men that they were not in love with. This book paints an amazing portrait of what 17th-century life was like, with all of its balls and activities, along with an amazing love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Just like Sense and Sensibility, I bought this for the amazing cover design, designed by talented letterer Jessica Hische.

He is a rich and seemingly arrogant gentleman and she is a poor and very feisty young lady in a large, happy family of girls who must marry well.

All of them except poor Mary, she kind of reminds me of myself actually, she's the nerdy one.Elizabeth judges everyone, her mother, her father, her sisters and especially Mr. Darcy.

It includes the story of a family who holds the possibility of falling into financial trouble. In order to maintain financial stability and remain in line with the standards of society, the daughters are pushed into marriage. This novel recurrently explores the theme of if one should marry for true love or if it is acceptable for the daughters to marry in order to fit in with society and attain financial security. Jane Austen does a great job expressing the ideals of her society in a creative and interesting manner through her novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is, of course, a timeless classic. Beautifully written. I haven't read it in years, but look forward to reading it again on my Kindle."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was the first time I had read one of Jane Austen's novels, and I am so enthralled with the story-telling and characters I am now looking to read every single thing she has written. The writing is filled with so many different layers; not only do I find bits of humor in a re-read that I missed the first time around, but the characters themselves are so different and have so much depth that you could easily imagine these people exist (or have existed) in real life.The dialogue is where this novel shines, which is good since the novel is mostly dialogue. Austen is able to convey the personality of a character simply through the way the character speaks, so that even though there are not a lot of descriptions of the characters, you have a clear idea of who each character is almost as soon as they open their mouth. Perhaps one of my favorite aspects of the writing style is the sandpaper-dry wit of Austen, which, when you understand it, can be very, very funny.Note that it may not be for everyone: since this book was written in the early 1800s, some of the turns of phrases are outdated, and may be difficult for a modern reader to understand. Another stumbling block is that while the writing itself is elegant and beautiful, the sheer density of words might make it hard for some people to read. For the former, my recommendation is to read as closely as possible, and re-read passages you didn't quite get the first time around; this will have the added benefit that you may be able to catch wisps of Austen's dry humor you might have missed the first time (I know I did). For the latter, it's a matter of preference. Personally, I love how poetic and elegant the writing is, and finding the hidden tidbits of humor as well as the ever-present underlying issues of the time was always rewarding to me; but if you find after the first chapter or two that you just can't get through the density of the writing, this may not be a good read for you.Since I downloaded the Kindle version, here's a review of the e-book format specifically: I did not notice any typos (yay!); it had a list of chapters near the beginning of the book, right after the cover, but does not contain an actual \\"table of contents\\" function. (i.e., if you click on \\"Go to...\\" the \\"table of contents\\" button will be grayed out.) Page numbers are included and total at 253; and for those who care, there are ten \\"Popular Highlights\\" at this time of writing, half of which are grouped around pages 12-15."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and PrejudiceLove Jane Austen Have seen the movie many times and read the book so much more exciting to read the book and let your mind visualize the settings.

It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though the language can be a challenge for me at times, I've ways loved this book!

Austen primarily focuses on the ridiculous pressure to marry. She does an exquisite job satirizing or \\"poking fun\\" at the extreme views of those who lived during that time. She gives the reader a good look at how truly important first impressions are and how love can conquer all. Austen develops her main characters Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, with very conflicting character traits. These conflicting traits allow the build up of tension between these two characters. This gives the novel a pleasant amount of intensity that leads to an ousting ending. Austen sucks you into a thoroughly enchanting world, making the novel impossible to put down. I recommend this novel to those who enjoy intellectual wit and have a soft heart for romance.

The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status. Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away. However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him. In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him. In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly. Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified. Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten. This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace. Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change. Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character? Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had the audio version of this classic in my car.

HE:a proud handsome man with a dignified background and position in the society, not allowing himself to stoop from his own level. but his unyielding heart is opened with her countenance and beauty in the country. sigh...this story may be common now in many books, but the magic of jane austen's words to her readers cannot be compared to others. she is really a genius in creating a story that would make a mark in the literature industry. her words, her characters, her plot is really extraordinary. i cannot imagine anyone else who had written a book that would equal &quot;pride and prejudice&quot;, among her many other works of art (emma, sense and sensibility, northanger abbey, persuasion). this book is for all...it's simply, truly, a CLASSIC in its own right...&Uuml;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is such a wonderful book. It should be, considering it has been a classic for so many years--it was written in 1813! But some people are pushed away by classics for just being &quot;classics&quot;--don't be pushed away from this! I'll be honest, I first discovered this story on &quot;Wishbone.&quot; It was my favorite episode. I decided to read it after finishing &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and aching for another great book. This is it! It has wonderful characters that you fall in love with, a wonderful love story, and insights that really make you think about . . . pride and prejudice of all things. It's wonderfully written, and it's fun to try to get used to the different usage of English. Read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like many people, I had heard of Pride and Prejudice but never cared to read it. Well, for anyone who is considering reading the book, I full-heartily recomend it to you. I previously just finished the book, and Jane Austen did a fabulous job captivating my attention and suspicions whether Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet ever truly get together. The latter is prejudiced against the handsome and &quot;supposively&quot; haughty Mr. Darcy, so until she realizes the truth does her opinion alter. Jane Austen adds humor to the story and created well-balanced characters which arouse much interest with the reader. An exceptionally written and intriguing story which anyone who has never read should."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep. I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however. It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment. There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine. There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence. Austen gets so much right: she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules. You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is. She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right. She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick. She is very witty but never casual. She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart. I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life: maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an enjoyable love story first and foremost but it is also an interesting commentary on the way that society used to look at the institution of mairage along with role of women with in that same society. The storyline is augmented by wonderful characters such as the witty Mr Bennet and the rediculus Mr.Collins. I very much enjoyed reading this book and would readily recomend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I was a young teen, a freind of my mother's had the 6 volume BBC movie version of this novel, but we never saw all of the episodes. Now, I am twenty, and I only wonder why I waited so long to read it. There were truly moments when I wanted to scream, laugh, and heave a sigh from the core of my innards. The book, and this is meant to be a compilement, is like a good Beatles song...deceptively simple, but rings so true and real, it can't help but tap into something very critical to the human experience. I recommend to all women, and all sensitive men. Also, women who come from families with all sisters will have a strong nostalgic reation (I sure did.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin is the first author that I have ever read all of her books and this is the first one that I read. I fell in love with this book and I have never found another one that quite compares with it's imapact. Maybe I am a hopeless romantic but i believe that things like this could have happened, and might still happen now! I mean you really never can tell. For example, in the beginning the main character meets the person that is to be her husband later in the book, and their intial meeting is not one of desriable happenings. Elizabeth sees Mr. Darcy as a arrogant and rude. He in turn sees her in the beginning as plain, except for her eyes, but he later developes feelings for her which mature throughout the novel. On her side the feelings mature as well...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My 17 year old daughter just loves this book.

The incredible depth of the characters and the richness of the detail creates a wonderful read. However, should you find yourself lost in the middle of the forest with only matches and this book in your hand in dire need of light and warmth, don't hesitate to rip out several pages from the middle of the book, gather a few branches and start a fire... you thus will have the light to read by, and know the start and the end of the story.

It is actually the book on CD. This would have been great, except that it is abridged. This book is one of the great classics. I do not think that it is appropriate for someone today to decide what parts of a book written in 1813 are important and what are not. I did not actually keep and listen to this selection. I was not interested in having PART of Jane Austen's great work. Therefore, I suppose that this can not actually be called a review of the CD, only of the case."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago.

In short: love the book, hate the formatting.There are many typographical errors from simple typos to random line breaks in the middle of paragraphs, often following a title (Mr./Mrs.). For some reason the book is void of italics and emphasized words are in all caps, which is rather ANNOYING, don't you know? The errors haven't kept me from reading, but they are an irritating distraction.If I knew of the slipshod manner in which this book was transcribed I would have just sprung for the $0.89 version. In fact, I think I will now."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I might be wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I. The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book. You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not detract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing.There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the wordswhere we Americans would more likely use is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress. Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat his opponents."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since reading this several decades ago, it has been my first favorite book. Only Shogun by James Clavill has been read as much as this volume! I keep it close in my messanger bag for when I need my monthly fix of regency romance and forwright characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice was an excellent novel because of its distinct feminine superiority. Elizabeth Bennet, being the heroine in the novel, was a great character to whom women can relate. Her clever, independent quallities are what makes Elizabeth such an admirable character. My favorite chapter would be chapter eleven, volume two. This chapter is when Mr. Darcy proposes to Lizzy, and he expresses his feelings to her for the first time. Thisis my favorite chapter because of the way Lizzy refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal. She wasn't intimidated by Mr. Darcy's arrogance and his billowing attitude or his wealth. Not only did she decline his offer of marriage, but she criticized him for all his faults of pride and prejudice. This book is appropriate for ages fifteen and up because of its complex speech. The one literary device that I appreciate was irony. I found it ironic that a prideful, arrogant man would fall in love with an independent, strong willed woman. It was ironic that Elizabeth could see Mr. Darcy's faults of pride and prejudice but not see it in herself. Austen was able to use this irony to create the plot of the story. I enjoyed this novel because of the way it was written, the characters, and the relationship between the characters, especially the relationship between Mr. Dary and Elizabeth. The way that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth despise each other at the beginning and later realized their true feelings for each other was very romantic. It was an explicit novel that I believe anybody who enjoys reading would enjoy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"An abundance of pride and prejudice inflicted on the two main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, is the main obstacle of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen. The actions of the novel revolve around the central characters who undergo tremendous changes to overcome their faults. Mr. Darcy is accused of having such a pride that he could not believe Elizabeth appropriate enough to barely be in his presence. From then on, Elizabeth formed harsh judgments about Mr. Darcy and his personality. Their first impressions of one another clung to them so deeply that establishing a relationship was all the more heartwarming. The actions of the novel, between not only Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but with the entire Bennet family and other acquaintances, kept me wanting to read on for more. My heart was into each character and I could not wait to find out more about their relations. I felt myself laughing and, at times, talking out loud because of the actions of the novel. I remained in suspense throughout, which made the events more enjoyable. I cannot wait for the opportunity to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; again in my free time. I highly recommend the novel to anyone in search of a plot and a love for characters to read the amazing writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice written by Jane Austen merits praise even with the high expectations I contained for it. In the first few paragraphs, I was confronted with flighty gossip and lacy trifles that were rather discouraging considering that I had expected something more profound. Yet as the novel progressed, the flowery language had a zing to it that amuses a person as it pokes fun at those with immense wealth in nineteenth century English society and at the traditions that were upheld. The Bennett family holds the attention of the readers in this novel, especially the women, as they deal with society's regulations regarding entailment. The fact that a male heir does not exist in the Bennett family causes Mrs. Bennett to become anxious to marry her five daughters off to men with fortunes. The aspect of the novel that truly provides the reader with contentment resides in the moral development of two of the main characters. The character flaws that exist within Miss Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy are discovered, examined, and steadily coached until both can live more fully. I appreciate this fine piece of literature for the magnificent writing syle that Austen utilized and the clever character development that she employed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only picked this up after watching the latest excellent BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's now-ubiquitous 'Pride and Prejudice'.Let me preface this review by saying that this is a novel like no other - it's Little Women with Declaritive Sentences, it's Gone With The Wind without the Overstatement. The story of the five Bennett sisters in their quest to make good marriages is as entertaining as it is relevant, and Austen's acerbic and subtle humour still shine today.Eliza Bennett has a problem. She is the only independant sister in a family of five girls, ruled by a weatherbeaten Father and a hyperactive Mother. She wishes to marry for love, and love alone, but times are hard, and if she does not marry for money, she will be poor, as her father's estate is entailed away to his only nephew, the connsumately hideous Clergyman, Mr. Collins. She meets and falls in immediate Hate with the snobbish, upper-class Mr. Darcy, and through a series of mishaps, revelations and balls, she discovers that he is not the man she first suspected him to be.Austen shows an almost unnatural intelligence with her prose. She is the definitive social commentator, and slips her jokes and judgements into her writing with such subtlety, that you forget she's doing it at all. Unlike Louisa M. Alcott's heavy-handed Christian-Morals littered about 'Little Women', Austen's morals are of a markedly more subtle nature. Truly ahead of her time, and an early feminist, her writing advocates independance for women, and shows clearly the faults and idiosyncrasies of men and silly women - a refreshing change for the period. Even today, her caustic protrayals of Mrs. Bennett, a woman as mercenary in her dealings with marriage as she is socially embarrassing, Lady Catherine DeBourgh, a wealthy, if somewhat inbred, dowager, and Mr. Collins, a greasy and truly venal human being, ring true as vivid and relevant descriptions of how to be an Idiot. The opposite can be said of her central character, Elizabeth Bennett. Clearly a semi-autobiographical heroine, Austen has created in Eliza an independant and intelligent heroine, but tempers this with several character flaws (the most notable being the titular 'Pride') to produce a young woman of believable depth and character.Her plot is long-winded and drawn-out, but, thanks to Austen's wonderful gift for making characters interesting as well as whole, it never once loses pace; instead, it becomes a joy to read. Her Cast Of Thousands each have a distinct part to play in uniting Elizabeth with her true love, and however small that part, Austen ensures they do it with memorable gusto.All in all, I urge everyone to read this novel. However, I think it's best read after seeing the TV adaptations, because while good, they cannot even begin to show the depth and intelligence of this novel. You'll appreciate Austen all the more after 'Pride and Prejudice'."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen is a classic that is well worth reading. The descriptions of the characters and their interactions with one another truly make this book enjoyable and unique.The book centers on the developing relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. They start out disliking one another, but as the story unfolds, they begin to see each other in a different light. Soon, respect for one another develops and eventually a love that is greater than either have ever hoped to experience.The setting for this book is 18th century England, where there is a separation of classes: upper class, middle class, and lower class. Elizabeth Bennet is from a respecatble, middle class family, whereas Fitzwilliam Darcy is from a very notable, upper class family. Mr. Darcy sees any alliance between him or his friend, Mr. Bingley, and the Bennet family, as highly reprehensible in the beginning. Elizabeth's oldest sister, Jane, is in love with Mr. Bingley and believes Mr. Bingley to be in love with her as well. Mr. Darcy does not want his friend having any connection with the Bennet family, so he takes it upon himself to separate his friend from Jane and believes himself to be in the right to do so. This upsets Elizabeth greatly and she refuses to have anything to do with Mr. Darcy, if she can help it. Fate had something else in mind, though, and they kept getting thrown together.The interactions between these two characters were, at times, very humorous. Jane Austen developed them in such a way that I had to keep turning the page to find out what was going to happen next. She definitely did not disappoint my curiosity in wanting to know how everything would eventually turn out for the characters.British Broadcasting Company, in partnership with Arts &amp; Entertainment television, produced the movie, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, starring Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet. I was so impressed with this movie after watching it on television, that I immediately went out and bought it. It stayed with the book for the most part and really brought Jane Austen's characters to life. It helped me to understand her characters and their situations even more.This is definitely a book I would recommend to most anyone who is looking for a great, romantic classic to read. It is my favorite book of all time and I look forward to reading it many more times throughout my life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Some might feel that Pride and Prejudice is just a feminine romance novel, but to me this book was much more. The words and language in the book were mesmorizing. I believe Meg Ryan put it perfectly when she said, \\"I get caught up in the language, words like felicity and thither.\\"(You've Got Mail, 1998) Considering Jane Austen's formal education ended at age nine, Pride and Prejudice proves that America as a whole has been \\"dumbing-down\\" their children. I feel Pride and Prejudice is a timeless literary classic."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definately an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. what more needs to be said...it is my favorite book..EVER! i place it above the rest, and truly believe there is no comparison. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"At first, I had no desire to read 'Pride and Prejudice,' I thought that it would be drivel like so many other romance novels are. After the insistence of friends, I finally gave in and read it. While reading the first few pages, I was sceptical, but soon I was hooked. I couldn't put this book down and even though I knew what was going to happen, I still was intrigued and enthralled.For those of you who haven't read this book, you are missing out on a lighthearted, romantic treat. It is intelligent and fun and the characters are extremely likeable. I now consider it to be one of my favourite books.Also, if you haven't seen the film version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, you need to see it. It may be about 6 hours long but it doesn't feel long at all. The book and the film are great companions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the first Regency romances ever written and still perhaps the best. This witty and complex novel features delightful characters, nonstop comic observations, clever dialogue and fast paced development of an excellent plot. Besides being a thoroughly entertaining read, Pride and Prejudice raises questions about appearance versus reality, society versus the individual and the nature of true love that still resonate deeply with us today. Elizabeth Bennet is one of the most complex, lively and fascinating heroines ever created, and her growing romance with the highly intelligent, proud and magnetic Fitzwilliam Darcy is one of the most compelling ever written. This is a seminal novel that no lover of romance-or student of human nature-should ever miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a must read. All the senior English classes at my high school watched the BBC movie. Everybody loved the movie. Even the boys. Everybody I know has either read the book since (or read it again in some circumstances) or has plans to read it as soon as they get a chance. The characters are perfect as well as all the description. The entire book is, in a word, perfect. Read It. Watch the movie. Fall in love with Jane Austen (like I have). I am now in the processing of reading all of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I was in fourth grade I picked up this book as a christmas present from my teacher. I still to this day cannot believe I chose this over \\"The Neverending Story\\", which I still haven't read but seems more down my alley. I got to page 50, then stopped. I can't imagine I understood most of that as a fourth grader, but anyway a few weeks ago I found it along with a few other adbandoned books from my elementary years. Now, as a 7th grader and a hopeless romantic devoloped through the years, I figured I could give it a shot, though my expectations weren't high. Well. This book was very good. I have to say I oly got up to page 110, I think, but what I have read was fantasticly (sp?) written. However, I'm more of a sci-fci, fantasy, adventure kind of reader, preferring classics like Black Beauty (did I mention horse nut?) and Watership Down, though I don't kow if that's considered a classic... Anyway, I also don't think I understood it as well as I could have and I seriously did not want to blemish my idea of this book, so I ould strt fresh in maybe another year or two. Who knows, maybe I'll even give it another go before 7th grade ends! But I'd like to say, if you're an older reader who can understand this sort of thing well, you can put up with a slow start, and enjoy classic works then this is the book for you! Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I will not make this a lengthy review, as there are many here already, but I will say that Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read. It is an amazing piece of literature, and I never cease to be amazed how many people can call it boring. For a story where surprisingly little actually does happen, with each read I cannot put it down. Each time I wonder if Mr. Darcy will be able to capture Elizabeth's heart, and I am always tickled when he does. I still get as choked up, and laugh just as much as I did the first time. Even compared to Austen's other brilliant works, I find Pride and Prejudice far superior.I also beg all lovers of its adaptations to actually read the novel itself. You will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have been looking for books on CD (long drive to work) and thought I would try this abridged version of Pride and Prejudice. I happen to love Jane Austen and Pride and Prejudice is a fantastic novel. However, this abridged version lacked some of the best aspects of the original story. They cut it down to 3 hours (can't be helped, I guess) and, therefore, the story really only deals with Elizabeth, Jane being a mere afterthought. The other sisters are barely mentioned. I am looking forward to when someone realizes that there are customers out there with CD players in their cars and they would like to hear the UNABRIDGED version of popular and classic books. I also felt that Jenny Agutter did not distinguish that well between characters, Mr. Bennett sounded just like Lady Catherine. I have listened to Sense and Sensibility with Juliet Stevenson and the difference between these 2 readers is amazing. You are really able to appreciate the acting skills of Ms. Stevenson versus Ms. Agutter on these CD's."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know it's a &#34;classic&#34;, but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a great example of life in late 18th century England that depicts the struggles of women competing in a society dominated by men. Her main character, Elizabeth Bennet, portrays an independent, headstrong women acting out against her duty as a woman to get married in a time where men are the dominant sex. Her eventual love with Mr. Darcy creates a novel that is both humerous and romantic. I highly reccomend reading this classic novel by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this book my senior year in High School and I was afraid that it would be a boring, long read. But I was so wrong! It's an amazing story of...well pride and prejudice! Jane Austen is very witty and I found myself laughing and sighing and worrying as I read. Elizabeth is a wonderful heroine that you find yourself relating to and wishing to be! What a life those young women must have led! And Darcy, well I fell in love with him immediately. You can't get any better than Darcy when looking for a man who would do anything to protect and help you. I loved reading about the cynical Miss Bingley and her sister; silly Lydia and Kitty; obnoxious Mrs. Bennet; and hilarious Mr. Collins. This book is my favorite classic! I strongly recommend reading it BEFORE watching the movie!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read many, many novels including all of Jane Austen's; and still there is nothing to compare to \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is unquestionably my favorite novel of all time, and what I consider to be the 'perfect novel.'and I've decided to break down the aspects that I think make it so.The Characters:Elizabeth Bennet is my favorite literary heroine of all time, for the simple reasons that she is probably the most consistent, well-rounded character that I have ever come across. Not to mention that she is extremely likable. Mr. Darcy, though not a very intricate character compared to Elizabeth, is undeniably well thought out, and perfectly drawn. But, for anyone who has read this(I think I can speak for just about everyone)there are three particular characters that are memorable, and even lovable, just for their perfectly delightful absurdity; Namely Mrs. Bennet whose \\"sole object in life was to get her daughters married; and it's solace was visiting and news.\\" Then there is Mr. bennet's pompous cousin Mr. Collins, whose proposal to Elizabeth is one of the best scenes in the book. Finally, there is Lady Catherine, Mr. Darcy's haughty Aunt, whose class consciousness, and condescending airs are wonderful!The Plot:A simple love story, and a Cinderella story at that. Though there is no really important issues covered, no intellectual depth to fathom, it remains one of my favorite plots, becuase it flows so easily, there is no awkwardness, is tied together so well in the end; there is nothing I would ever dream of changing.The Diolouge:This is it's absolutely flawless point; the diolouge is perfect; perfect and consistent with each character, it moves the story along, and charms the reader non-stop.Language:Who can resist a novel that makes frequent use of the words:folly, felicity, ductility, oddity, and every other charming \\"ity\\" Austen uses.I really can say nothing else. I have read this book so many times I have so many different perspectives, so many opinions on it, have so much to say that I could not possibly say it all, so I decided to take the literary view, and build on that. All I can say in conclusion is go out, buy this book, and read it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's stories have endured for years, and this one is probably her most famous work. It is a story about an empty-headed mother and her search for proper husbands for her five daughters. The book is a prime example of the manners and morals of the gentry in a small English village in the early nineteenth century. Ms. Austen does such a good job of displaying these strictures and morals in her novels, that to us in the present day it appears to be an entirely repressive era (which it actually was). The plot and the characterizations in this book are wonderful as in all Ms. Austen's works, and it tells a dazzling story. It is a charming and wonderfully warm tale that I never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is not your ordainary 19th century novel. It is so much more. Elizabeth Bennet and Fritzwilliam Darcy are the most amazingly interesting characters that I have ever come across in any work of literature. This is a book you can not put down and will be coming back to for years and years to come."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As I read Pride and Prejudice, one thing struck me--that I reacted to the twists in the plot rather strongly. I laughed aloud at the wit; I smiled at the *ahem* 'cute' romance; I shouted at the characters when they missed obvious signals and acted like idiots...but such as it is, lets just say that I was truly affected by this book. Touching, witty, and with happy weddings in the end...in short, a true Austen novel. I found this book immensely enjoyable to read, and it is among my top ten favorite books of all time (although, I must admit, my 'top ten favorite books of all time' list is often prone to change, as I am not very old and shall devour other books yet)...Nontheless, I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever liked any other Austen or Austen-like book, as this is perhaps my favorite written by this particular author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read three incredible books lately and NONE of them were remotely connected by theme, style, or author. &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the first, &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; was the second, and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; was the third. While all were excellent, P&amp;P was so great for me, simply because I didnt' expect it to be great. If you are like I was before reading this wonderful book, you probably can't imagine what could be so wonderful about Pride and Prejudice. How can it be interesting, you're thinking, when it's written in such a stuffy time period? I'll stick with my science fiction/romance novels/westerns, thank you very much. And it's true, you can't find any lusty young rogues, aliens, or gun fights, but that doesn't keep it from being an extremely wonderful book to read. The characters are full of life, the plot well constructed, and the entire story full of charm and humour. Don't be put off by the language either. It takes some getting used to, but once you're going it's not only completely natural, but makes today's English seem completely dull and simple. I cannot stress enough how wonderful this book is. Also try &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an amazing book; when I read it I just can't seem to put it down. This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story. Each one has their own distinct personality which is part of what makes this book such a classic. Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I welcome this new edition from Penguin Classics with expanded notes.How does one demarcate pride and prejudice, or bias and stubbornness? In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen deftly exposes the folly of and further ridicules judging by first impressions.When Elizabeth Bennet first met the fine, tall, handsome eligible bachelor Fitzwilliam Darcy, she immediately deemed him arrogant, conceited and utterly obnoxious. Her first impression of Darcy, who was initially looked upon with prodigious admiration, was quickly assured as his conceited manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity.Darcy's conceit and selfish disdain of the feelings of others formed the foundation of Elizabeth's disapprobation on which succeeding events had built so inevitably a hatred. When she later found out Darcy had deliberately altered Bingley's opinion of her beloved sister Jane and determined to separate them, she was determined to exasperate herself as much as possible against Darcy.In the comedy of manners that follows, Austen, in a superb manner and prose so elegant and lyrical, verbalizes the stubbornness, bias, and prejudices of Elizabeth toward a man whom resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of his admiration for her escaped him. Despite the fact that he struggled to maintain his composure, in his breast there existed a powerful feeling toward her, which soon procured her pardon and directed his anger elsewhere upon Elizabeth's weighty accusations of him.Pride and Prejudice presents us a romance comedy with a modern feel and touch. The opening of the novel Fitzwilliam Darcy is blackened as the most obnoxious snob for whom \\"there is not another woman in the room who it would not be a punishment\\" to him to stand up with. To Elizabeth, almost all of Darcy's actions \\"maybe traced to pride\\" and \\"pride had often connected him to virtue.\\" No sooner had Darcy's superiority of mind (pride) been fully exposed than Elizabeth's prejudice was revealed.Unlike her sister Jane, Elizabeth was more hasty in censuring anyone (especially Fitzwilliam Darcy) and never supposed the possibility of any extenuating circumstances in the case, let alone urging the possibility of mistake and misunderstanding. In confronting Darcy of his inexcusable act of separating Bingley and Jane, Elizabeth judged from assumptions, suspicions, and the biased first impression. In a sense she sought to discredit Darcy and the relation of events that might be capable of a turn which must render Darcy blameless throughout the whole affair.When Elizabeth finally considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided Darcy, her anger and indignation was turned against herself and Darcy's dejection (more or less disappointed feelings toward her) became object of her compassion. Elizabeth's folly and rashness also become object of our compassion. How awful her petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting Fitzwilliam Darcy.Pride and Prejudice evokes the fact that human nature is prone to pride and very few of us do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or another. Pride usually relates more to our opinions of ourselves, of which Elizabeth has epitomized. Pride is the real superiority of mind, when along with stubbornness, bias, and determination, would casue irremediable regret. The novel also evokes the friendship, the values of marriage, and snobberies of English middle-class life in the early 19th century. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Fast and quick delivery. We also saw the movie so I can enjoy the book the more. I hope to enjoy this for years to come. Thanks for the great service."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm proud to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The portrayal of Elizabeth and Darcy's love affair although not truly noticable was very strong and forgiving. Neither knew that they had feelings for the other until a rash judgement was made on both sides. Elizabeth declines the hand of her cousin Mr. Collins and therefore goes against the customs of the time period. Elizabeth defies most traditional customs when it comes to men. She wants to marry for love not money, or anything else. This novel keeps the reader interested and wanting more. Jane Austen is a superb author."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This was a really good book, although there was some confusing description at some points. It's about the daughters of the Bennet family, Elizabeth and Jane in particular. The courtships of Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Mr. Bingley are the focus of the novel. Jane Austen does a good job of describing the romances because the dialog for the most part is easy to understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has humor, drama, romance. Everything I love to read in a good old fashioned story. If you have never read Jane Austen you don't know what you are missing. Even my husband was a convert after Pride and Prejudice!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A classic that remains relevant in any century. The ultimate book on romance. It is tryly timeless and the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett will have you rooting for them throughout.A book that may be read a dozen times without ever losing its charm."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the very few &quot;classics&quot; that I can honestly say I enjoyed. Most of them, I hate to admit, I find difficult to comprehend and relate to, but not this one. The dialogue was its greatest strength; it was so incredibly real! This book is so rich in its use of the English language. Pride and Prejudice is truly an enriching reading experience, and one that is guaranteed to be enjoyed over and over again. I just finished my sixth reading ... I can't wait for my seventh!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a fun, descriptive book. I used to think that was an oxymoron but it's not! Fun, descriptive books actually exist. This book is enthralling because I am able to relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite Austen book, beating out my second-favorite, Emma, by maybe half a mile! Every character is believable and human, and perhaps more importantly, can be understood by those of us of modern times.Elizabeth is entirely lovable because she is NOT entirely perfect. She has a penchant for mischief and irony that she has obviously inherited or absorbed from her wonderfully eccentric and hilarious father, and a slightly over-developed sense of her own worth that springs from her highly and consciously intelligent observation of all the folks that share her corner of the planet. But she is also wonderfully honest and capable of eating crow when she sees the error of her assumptions.Although this is a beautiful glimpse into the ways and mores of a very different age, it is also a timeless human drama, loaded with subtle humor."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is charming and i love when the author describe the old houses with appletrees, wild flowers and all that stuff. There's really something about Austen... ....what ever it is. This novel is very fine!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really appreciated this novel because it embodies the painful and well deserved work of those women who lived a few centuries before us ...

I was so bored by the tedious nature of Emma that I couldn't see what the inspiration was of such a following as portrayed in the movie \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired to read some of her works. I prevailed and went on to read another of her books, Pride and Prejudice. I am pleased to say that I'm hooked and am looking forward to reading another of her works.

It may have taken 36 years to get to it, but I couldn't devour it fast enough once began. I was amazed at how easily the personalities were painted in Elizabeth's language of each man. You can't help but know each man exactly for who he is as Elizabeth does, not always timely but eventually the truth comes out. Splendid storytelling.

I was greatly entertained."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is not much for me to say about this book, other than to add my voice to the choir singing the praises of Jane Austen and &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; I recently read it for the first time (although I have been a long-time fan of the BBC series), and I was absolutely blown away. Without a doubt, one of the best books I have ever read.Jane Austen proves that brevity is not the soul of wit. Here razor-sharp pen peels back the outward polish and fine veneer of a host of stuffed shirts. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy live and breath, and I am addicted to their story even though I know the outcome. Plot is not the reason to read &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; rather it is just to take pleasure in good writing and cheer.After this book, I am diving headfirst into the world of Jane Austen. Amazing that it took me this long to discover her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I first started this book I thought I would find a novel with alot of old time english and bore. But as I started to read this classic I found that it was quite an interesting story.Pride and predjudice, I think,is a wonderful story that tells the reader that they should learn to know a person before they make assumptions about them.The way that Jane Austen sews romance with mystery and bewilderment makes it so that I would gladly reccomend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two.

I first read Pride and Prejudice when I was 6-7 (I know, a little young, but I love to read), and I loved it. I've read the book 12-13 times, seen both big TV miniseries and the Laurence Olivier movie adaption, and a stage adaption. It remains on my list of top ten favorites. I love everything about it. I love the charming Edwardian language, the character's, and the plot. This book is not a girly fluffy book, even though the plot is a bit of an old one (who knows, maybe the plot came from J.A.?). I fell in love with Darcy and Elizabeth from the very start, and I still love them. I've read this book at least once every year since I first read it, and it just get's better every time. I laugh in it, which is unusual for me, I rarely laugh in books, even funny ones. What more can I say? If you haven't read it, then you ought to, don't just watch the movies. The only thing is that I've never found a guy who has willingly read it, and I've never found one that liked it. What's wrong with our guys?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I absolutely hated &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; when I tried to read it in high school. While I absolutely loved romances and novels set in the 19th century, when I attempted &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; I got as far as the scene where Elizabeth strolls around the room with one of Mr. Bingley's sisters and thought that all this walking up and down was the stupidest thing anyone could do and quit reading it.I didn't start appreciating Jane Austen until I read &quot;Persuasion&quot; for a graduate history class that explored how the concept of womanhood changed between the late 18th century and the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign. Our goal was to examine whether the new Victorian ideal of womanhood was something women themselves embraced or a role thrust upon them. And at last, I began to appreciate Jane Austen.By the time I got around to rereading &quot;P&amp;P,&quot; Emma Thomson's delightful adaptation of &quot;Sense and Sensability&quot; had made it to theaters, and I was old enough to appreciate that love at first site can be a disaster.Jane Austen may have been the first novelist to write about love from a woman's point of view--and wrote at a time when marriages were becoming more about love and not just financial considerations. Throughout many of her novels, Austen struggles with whether money should matter in matters of the heart. She seems to want to say that money shouldn't matter, and yet recognizes that when a young woman's entire future depended on her husband's financial status, money still had to matter.&quot;P&amp;P&quot; begins with the wealthy Mr. Bingley renting a house near the home of the Bennetts, a family with five daughters, no sons and an entailed estate that would have to pass to the nearest male relative. Much to her daughter Elizabeth's frustration, Mrs. Bennett immediately begins plotting ways to snag Mr. Bingley for one of her daughters. At a party, Elizabeth first encounters Mr. Darcy. Overhearing his criticism of her immediately gets them off on the wrong foot. As the novel unfolds, Darcy and Elizabeth discover each other's true nature, and eventually misunderstandings are repaired, and they develop an appreciation of each other. The pacing of &quot;P&amp;P&quot; more realistically reflects the growth of true love than many novels that I've read. Austen's witty commentary about courting rituals makes the book highly entertaining.To enrich the experience of reading &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; pick up a copy of Fay Weldon's &quot;Letters to Alice Upon Her First Reading of Jane Austen.&quot; Weldon's collections of essays to her fictitious niece enrich the experience of reading Jane Austen's novels by exploring what makes certain works absolute classics, what life was like for women in the early 19th century, and what Austen's life was like as she was writing these novels."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Others may vote for EMMA, but the story of Elizabeth Bennett and FitzWilliam Darcy's stormy romance has been read, dramatized, and filmed more times for the delectation of more readers.

She is sharp to the point and remains a Lady."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoyed this e-book very much because I have seen versions of the film and TV presentations and reading the book gives a more indepth study of the writing style of Jane Austen. The film and TV presentations couldn't include everything in the book such as a study of each main character. You must read the book slowly to enjoy her usage of words or you will miss the message because there are so many words to describe an event, person, scene, experience, etc. This book is very similar to a Harry Potter book - you need to read it more than once to capture the little things lead to something bigger. She gets you involved with her characters and you feel for them and you might even cry with them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are neatly arranged according to wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful classic of English literature.

Once I got into it, however, I had to admit that not only was this book really well written, but it was far more captivating than I ever imagined it would be. The book is true to its title, using the plot of Elizabeth and her sisters and family to illustrate thoroughly the concepts of pride and prejudice as they related to 19th century England society. This book and its sister novel, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; are both not only better written than most contemporary novels, but also share appropriately the attributes of being timeless novels. Though much lighter in spirit than many other &quot;timeless&quot; works of that and other early eras, particularly Joyce or Wilde, the novels nonetheless convey well an important intellectual body of work and culture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book! I read it first when I was 11, and hated it. I thought the language was stuffy and the plot contrived. But then I read it again when I was 15, and it has quickly become my favorite book. I reread it every few months. However, those who don't enjoy a fast-paced plotline, beware: the action is slow. Just make it through the first hundred pages and you'll gobble up the rest. For guy readers, I can only say that this is one of my father's favorite books; whether he is abnormal or just romantic I don't know, but anyhow this is such a good book that it should be required reading! Also, for anyone who did not like the slow action in the book, you must see the BBC movie with Jennifer Elhe and Colin Firth. I promise you'll love the book after seeing it (not to mention Colin Firth). Thanks for reading my review; now go read P&amp;P!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Last Fall I saw a A&amp;E version of P&amp;P. I enjoyed the movie. If I had not seen the movie I probably would not have finished the book. The problem with this is that one can not develop their own picture or opinion on the characters.What I liked the most was the amount of wit displayed between the characters interaction. It is a true book about people. It is funny, charming and romantic. It really opened my eyes to society in the 19th century."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You must read this book, especially if you are just beginning to explore the world of classic literature. Out of all of Jane Austen's work, this is the best. It's pace and structure are perfect, the characters are so well defined that you could recognize them on the street, and the prose is delicious. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can anything be better than reading Pride and Prejudice? I feel so stupid about myself now after having seen by my own eyes the creativity, the skills, the intelligence, and the passion for love that another being of my race can possess, and even more embarrassed that that person has also a heart so good as to venture the task of puting all these into use in a single book of unbelievable plots and conversations. I suggest you not to read any reviews here at all, for they will spoil the elements of surprise.OH, how much I wish I can love like them!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a very well written novel by Jane Austen. When i first began to read it, i thought i'd instantly hate it. i'm not a big fan of romance novels, but i decided to give this book a try. I was delightfully suprized with the vivid language and great dialogue which Austen used, and the novel kept my interest better than i had ever expected. from the famous opening lines, &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife&quot;, to the wedding at the end, this was a great book. At some points, i got confused py a paragraph, or even chapter, and i had to re-read it carefully so i could fully understand the authors point, but other than that, i could comprehend the book easily. It is the first romantic book that has ever kept my attention, and i hope this will inspire me to try other books that i would otherwise walk right by without giving it a thought. The book did a very good job of developing the characters, as well. By the end of the book, i felt i had a good grasp on who's personalities Jane Austen wanted to emphasize, and what each character's roll in the plot was. Overall, i feel this was an excellent book, and i would reccomend it to enyone who loves to read, even if you're not a reguar reader of novels such as this one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a wonderful piece of literature. I have never read a truly great book until this. I have loved many books that I have read, but this book is beyond compare. As soon as I began reading, I became engrossed in it. I finished this book so fast it felt like the book was only 100 pages. I t was such quick read that I read approximately 250 pages in one weekend; I couldn't put it down. I strongly urge everyone to read this book, whatever the age. I am only in ninth grade and even now I'm able to understand its literary value. Although I can speak highly of the novel, there are some things that I can criticize. The most complicated aspect of the book was the language. At some points I had to go back and reread a passage to fully understand it. It is true that the language is beautiful, but frankly, I find it confusing. If you are not up to the challenge of figuring out the meaning of some different words, do not read this book The only other aspect of the novel that at times seemed irksome, was the long passages in which there was little dialogue. These passages sometimes contained Elizabeth's thoughts and observations, but it was the parts other than these that bothered me. The long descriptions of the fields and rooms bored me. This was unnecessary because it did not advance the plot or carry a large amount of importance. When a new plot line suddenly came into existence, this would be weaved in. In moments of suspense I just skimmed through these parts because they were not entirely related to the plot. My favorite plot line was the development and change of people and their feelings, especially love. This novel genuinely showed me how humans' feelings towards one another change, along with their judgments and prejudices. Throughout the novel the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy profoundly changed in enjoyable ways. Additionally, these changes describe the title, which I found most appropriate. When we first met Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy he was presented as aloof, cold, and full of abominable pride. As the story progresses we see a profound change in his character, which commences when he professes his love for Elizabeth. After this, we begin to see the real, improved Mr. Darcy. By the end of the story Elizabeth even says this about him, \\" Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable.\\" By overcoming his pride he leads Elizabeth to make a few changes of her own. Elizabeth is the character that I feel made the most significant changes throughout the story. I feel this way because she altered two major things in her life. The first, which I feel led to the second, is when Elizabeth realized her prejudice and surpassed it. She does not find this out about herself until wonderful Mr. Darcy places a white envelope in her hands. After reading what was inside the envelope she describes herself as, \\" blind, partial, prejudice, absurd.\\" The second thing that changed about her was her feelings towards Mr. Darcy. Over several months her feelings for Mr. Darcy grow fonder each time they meet, until she realizes her overwhelming love for him This is a classic love story, which I believe deserves much attention. In one word, this story is enchanting. The story of the Bennet girls will be one I will treasure forever. Finally, I will never forget the way Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy came together and overcame, their pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is not only an epitome of classic literature, it is actually interesting. I bet if they made a poll, the people who read this book would be happier in life than most. I love this book so much. Ms Austen truly made a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was a very slow going book, but a very good one anyways. I enjoyed and hated the running arounds of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I wanted them to fall madly in love (finally) and everytime that I thought it was going to happen something got in the way. It was a terrific book and I enjoyed the ending the most! :) I would recommend it to anyone with a high tolerance for boredom and also one that has a lot of time to actually read the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is just AMAZING! Once you begin to turn the pages you just can't stop! I've read it five times and I still read with the same number of heartbeats(which must be like 1000 per minute!) Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books in the world. I just love the story of five sisters and their foolish and funny mother who thinks about nothing but marrying her daughters. Mr Darcy ,who marries Elizabeth, is my all time favorite male novel charachter. His passionate love for Elizabeth and his incredibly romantic nobleness will make him a favourite with female readers.There are people who consider the book boring , but if it is because of the Victorian English I think it just makes the book more classic and valuable."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've just recently started reading classics, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Jane Austen's novel, and what a pleasure it was to read. I was fascinated by the little details of the characters' lives."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a look at times and customs from a point of view not available in books by modern authors."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved classic literature, and belive Jane Austen to be one of the best classic authors! &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; are my two favorite books of all time. I think Austen was brilliant in this book because she is able to write so well about (and let's face it, fellow Austen fans--) such a mundane story line! The plot is very simply the story of five un-wed sisters and their very normal life at trying to get engaged. That's all there is to it. Why, then do we find this work so intoxicatingly enchanting? It is because of Austen's brilliant way with words...her descriptions of her witty heroine and handsome hero.If you like this book, I highly recommend reading Emma by Jane Austen and my other fave-- Jane Eyre. :) I give this book six stars!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin wrote a story set in what i originally thought of as a boring period in time. Her story, however, is about five daughters and their love lives. The parents in the story are funny(the father is very sarcastic and the mother is obsessed w/getting her daughters married well off). I was surprised at how easy it was to read and how much it reminded me of modern teenage drama."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is definitely a book I would want my daughter to read. I first read it in high school and can not get enough of it. I love the characters and storyline. It is amazing the way she writes. I love watching Elizabeth and wishing she was a 90's woman who could tell Darcy what she really thinks without worrying about the do's and don't's of her time. I live for the ending when Darcy calls her his most dearest Elizabeth. Romantics this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This work is just wonderful and once you've read it, you can't forget it. Elizabeth seems so close to us, women, and Darcy so cute that their story makes everyone sensitive dream. With Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre, P&amp;P remains the treasure of Victorian Literature.Just read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As a fan of other types of literature (Stephen King and Steinbeck, for instance) I can't begin to express the way I devoured this book! Not only did I find the character development incredible, but I also enjoyed how Austen brought in other themes such as extreme embarrassment caused by relatives (haven't we ALL been there...)the ability to laugh at oneself, the empathy for a family member that has been wronged and regret of a decision. I liked this book so much that I went out and rented the A&amp;E production and liked that so much I bought it. This is one story I will revisit again and again!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I saw the 1995 tv series before I read this book, and I think that was good. Although the book is better than the series, I don't know if I'd fully understand the sarcasm and irony in the description of the characters. I despise Mr. Collins, but I also find him very amusing. And I admire Elizabeth for her honesty to herself and to others. Despite the fact that it might seem trivial at first, Jane Austen wrote a truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&amp;P is one of my favourite books.The attention given to minor details and the portrayal of both Lizzy and Mr.Darcy is very endearing.I loved the witty remarks and the satire in the descriptions.I think Austen's command of the english language is enviable.Each sentence has it's own significance and there is no line in the book I would have omitted. I particularly liked the scene between Lizzy and Lady Catherine where Lady C demands a promise of her-that of never agreeing to marry Mr.Darcy-every dialogue is so well thought out and even though there is so little of a story to relate,the way the book keeps you rapt with attention is amazing! Whenever I feel lonely or left out this book makes me feel like a part of all its frolicking and ball-dancing.I think that is the power of an author-to be able to make a reader empathise and live thro' the pages. I am still living in the glorious days of Pemberley and Netherfield!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice so many times that by now I should have the book memorized. But, I don't. Instead, I cringe every time Elizabeth Bennet refuses Mr. Darcy's proposal and sit in suspense as I near the part where I think he should propose again. What if this time, they don't meet by chance as they ought? Or what if Mr. Darcy decides not to propose again? What if Elizabeth doesn't realize how wonderful I know he is? Jane Austen is the only author who captures my imagination so vividly every reading; I love her for it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The first time I read Pride and Prejudice I was in seventh grade and I found it difficult to read and of little interest; so when I picked it up again as a senior in high school and discovered its brilliance it came as quite a surprise. I should not have been surprised, however, for any work authored by Jane Austen is bound to be genius. With her witty dialogue that had me laughing out loud and the heartachingly poignant love fiascos that left me in tears of frustration, she successfully turned me into another Darcy fanatic.The characters are timeless-Elizabeth with her candor and brilliance, Darcy with his romantic soul waiting to explode, and Mr. Bennet with his stoic attitude towards the Mrs.-and the plot will never grow old. Even if the book were as long as War and Peace I would not be deterred if I knew I was to be rewarded with the defining moment when Elizabeth returns Darcy's declaration of love. What makes this book what is though is not just the tryst between Elizabeth and Darcy, but the social commentaries Austen makes about the period and all of the outcomes that are swayed by the civilities of society. Clearly a classic that remains just as magical as the day it was written, Pride and Prejudice should be required reading for everyone, boys and girls alike (hey you boys out there might just learn something from Darcy's quiet love approach)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though Jane Austen might sound stuffy and old fashioned, her enthralling novel Pride and Prejudice is as pleasing today as it was in the 1800's when it was written. The story is all about two girls-Jane and Elizabeth Bennet- and their trials and tribulations in middle-class, snobby English society. Austen uses sophisticated word choices and witty remarks to portray what life was really like, and how everything wasn't always as it seemed. The main character, Elizabeth Bennet, finds herself caught up in an elaborate love triangle--involving her sister, Jane, a wealthy, intelligent gentleman named Mr. Charles Bingley, and a plot to tear the two lovers apart. As the story goes on, more and more is revealed about who is responsible for breaking up the budding romance between her sister and Bingley. In the middle of all of this, Elizabeth finds that she has fallen in love with the man that ruined sister's relationship. With a tangled web of lies and deceit, the tale takes a sharp turn from entertaining anecdote to a gripping suspense story. Will she tell her sister who is responsible for the breakup? Will she continue her romance with the man that has made her sister so unbelievably miserable? All in all, the story is a riveting piece of art that shouldn't be taken for granted just because it sounds boring."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, \\"Pride\\" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and \\"Pride\\" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and \\"Pride\\" provides excellent insight into her time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Oh! Can I even say enough about this delightfully wonderful book? I won't give any of the plot away. But, I will say that the tension and the passion between the characters is so strong that it comes through the pages, transcends time and you can relate to it precisely today as readers could a hundred or so years ago. The humor and wit is British, of course, and most of the sentencing isn't used any more; therefore it might be a difficult read for some. I admit I had some hard times getting through it. But it was well worth the effort! And now I read it once a year just so I can relive the pleasure. A good read for anyone. And much advised by me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book because it really grabbed my attention from the beginning. It also kept me away from the fridge for a good while so I skipped out on a lot of fatty snacks. I lost five pounds reading this book. Never mind &quot;The South Beach Diet&quot;. Read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is one of the best books I've ever read. The intricate style Jane Austen used to write this love story made it so the reader was sucked into it in every turn of the page. The way all the characters interact and the vivid picture the book gives on every person helps the reader understand the contents of the story and the reason the main characters act in the manner that they do. Apart from love, this book also has mystery and suspense. The novel never takes the reader to a dead end, but instead takes him/her to a sort of maze where anything can happen. This book is full of twists and turns that keep the reader on his toes and because of its contents dealing with society and its morals on being prejudiced, it is appropriate and a must read for any age group. In &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; the chapter that interested me the most was chapter 8. In this chapter Elizabeth is taking care of her ill sister when she joins Miss Bingley, Darcy, and Mrs. Hurst and the topic of an acomplished woman arose. In this little dispute of the upper class, a vivid description of an accomplished woman is given where a woman is accomplished when she has mastered all of the fine arts and has read many books. This was my favorite chapter because it gives an insight into the prejudiced mind of the upper class. To them an accomplished woman is one who has mastered the fine arts, but the only people in the 19th century that could afford the classes that helped a woman master anything were the upper class families. In laymens terms the only way for a woman to be considered accomplished was if she was rich and famous. The fine arts that were considered refined were the ones that could not be studied by just anyone and those were the art the upper class studied to feel superior. What made this my favorite chapter was the way Elizabeth reacted during the dispute. Even though she was being put down, she did not say a word to fight back. All she did was listen and let the birds chirp. Her pride was too great to let anyone tell her differently and that's exactly what I liked. Even though she was lower class, she had more respect and pride than the ones that were believed to be high and mighty. This book is appropriate for people of all ages. As long as the person reading understands the meaning of big words, this is a great book for them. This is so because of the morals of the story, and the connection you can make with the present time. This book shows you how and why some people feel superior to others and how in the end, the people they looked down upon ended up being the greatest people they've ever met. As you read this book, you come to realize that what you are learning is priceless and meaningful. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; gives you an insight into a problem facing every average person and, if read right, the solution to being prejudiced. If you haven't read this book, read it, and if you have already read it and understood it, read it to some one who hasn't, or give your book to someone you like or appreciate."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let me begin by saying that, although I have been an Anglophile since the age of eight (for some strange reason!) not every novel from or about England captures my fancy like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; has, through the years...I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book (and was able to read it in England the second time, which really gave its words and sentiments added significance). What makes it special for me each time I read it is its historical content and reference. For example, the fact that some of the English people of the times spoke so concisely and brilliantly has always been, for me, a mental pleasure. The customs of the day have also appealed to me compared to some of the casual ways exhibited in today's world. (To say I am Victorian at heart would not be wrong...)Although &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; mirrors universal truths and concepts, it is the aura of propriety (sometimes abused and falsely applied, such as in the case of the Reverend Mr. Collins, the pompous Lady Catherine de Burgh, and the haughty Miss Bingley) which I like. Despite their ability to de-nobilize the demeanor of their time, I still enjoy their antics. They serve as a meaningful counterpoint to the serious business of living which drives Elizabeth and her sister Jane to seek more high-minded and worthwhile pursuits. I like &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; because it illustrates, once more, that &quot;there's always one in every crowd,&quot; that there exist among the civil gentry those who would thwart and turn back and simply congeal to impress (Mr. Collins, again!)In this same vein, Mrs. Bennett serves as the original &quot;stage mother,&quot; constantly pushing her daughters to the forefront of dances and other situations, wanting them to marry well. Yet she consistently annoys and insults those about her so her daughters' chances to &quot;marry well&quot; are minimized almost in direct correlation to her pandering.Mr. Bennett is one of my favorite characters, although he is not as clearly-drawn as most of the others. In him, I see a man of his times, saddled with a silly wife whom he married for looks and not for her intellect, and trying to make the best out of her urgent desires for her daughters' future wealth. In that regard, he is not so much depressed as resigned, a quiet man who keeps to himself but who also acquiesces to his wife because (alas) he still does love her. He is caught by son-less fate to have to cede the home over his family's heads to the Reverend Mr. Collins, a cousin. This causes Mr. Bennett grief but serves the reader as a historical footnote, a sign of the times that, fortunately, has come and gone.Since I have only limited space, I will describe only one more character, Miss Elizabeth Bennett. Amongst these pages, she has such courage, such intelligence, such a command of the English language, and an acute sense of responsibility in all areas of her life. (She is fictional, of course, but I find myself hoping I can someday identify with her - not only that, but she gained the affection of the equally-noble Mr. Darcy!) Elizabeth is the embodiment of cool reserve and ready wit, but she is also quick to comfort. As she stood out among the other characters in this book, so would a real person like her, during those times. The historical perspective of Elizabeth's life is informative, pleasing, and remarkable - a worthy history lesson as well as an entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the work of a scholar. Granted, it is expensive. But compared to other editions of Pride and Prejudice that imply scholarly expertise, this edition is a scholarly work. And Rogers credits his sources, too! Kudos to Professor Rogers!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I walk into a bookstore, you'd rarely see me pick up a classic. I typically head straight to the Young Adult Fiction section, home to my favorite first-class, high-quality novels such as Gossip Girl, the A-List, and The Clique. However, this time I opted for a change, wanting to read, for once, a really good book. With the movie coming out, I decided to give Pride and Prejudice a try. I fully expected to put the book down forever after the first page or so--- it seems to me that most authors writing before the 21st century hadn't quite caught on to the method of captivating the reader in the first few sentences, or even chapters--- but I was surprised. From the start, Pride and Prejudice was interesting, humorous and engrossing. I read on. Taking my clean hardcover copy with me everywhere I went for the next couple weeks, I read whenever I had a spare moment. I loved the language, of both the chatty and funny narration and the dialogue of the interesting, loveable characters. Some phrases and words were unfamiliar, but instead of making it hard to understand, I caught on quickly... for example, a teenage female's 'coming out'. And another thing I loved about this book--- it wasn't just a typical love story. There were all sorts of twists and turns, most noteably with the crabby, snobby Mr. Darcy-- who, by the end, had captured the hearts of the readers as well as the characters. All in all, I'm so glad to have overcame my fears of boring, difficult-to-read 'classic' novels--- this book is really one that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is an old time classic for me and one of my favorites.I have went through it about 5 or 6 times already, listened to it on audio cd and watched different versions of the movie countless times.Splendid conclusion!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Obviously Jane Austen was amazing and Pride and Prejudice is incredible.

Austen did a fantastic job with the characters, and their strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, she did a great job persuading the reader to switch back and forth to Wickham and Darcy's different sides.P and P is a book to not be overlooked! Everyone can get something out of it, whether that be knowledge, or just another wonderful and fun read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"With that incredible sentence Jane Austen draws the reader into her story. Is she serious we ask? 'A truth universally acknowledged' is the language of mathematics, of science, of logic; it is like saying: \\"we are dealing with self-evident truths--axioms.\\"How does this statement apply to society? to families? to manners?Although I have read many articles and reviews on Pride and Prejudice, its perennial enchantment has eluded me until now. What makes this novel a favorite of so many readers after so many years?The title to begin with, is provocative. Both terms pride and prejudice are applicable to Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy. But prejudice is directed more towards Darcy than Elizabeth. I would have like Jane Austen to use the word 'Prejudgement' as opposed to prejudice because the former word is laden with situational biases such as when Darcy prejudges Elizabeth: \\"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.\\"Ah, the title is also alliterative; and it would have also worked with prejudgment.Not wanting to walk along the trodden path I want to propose a few personal impressions. First, it is a syntactically flawless--British English at its best-- narrative which is never boring; perhaps due to Austen's adroit handling of the Indirect Free Speech. Second, the characters are diverse: some attractive (Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, Jane and Bingley) and others picturesque (Charlotte Lucas and Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine de Bourgh). Third, that it is a moral work in which not only good manners and judicious decisions are privileged, but also virtue.When Plato cast poets and artists out of his Utopian Republic, little did he realize that one can learn virtue from literature as well as from philosophy. And that is a 'truth universally acknowledged.'[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i thank god for ms austen. amazing writing, i just don't have the words.

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn.

The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.

If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it. There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off. I didn't think that this book would have anything for me. I was too cool for Jane Austen.I was wrong. Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read. Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness. I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best. There are some weird line breaks. The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest novels in English literature and is truly deserving of being called a classic. First published in 1813, it is set at the turn of the 19th century in a fictional town near London. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are blessed with five daughters, ranging in age from 15 to 22. The novel opens with Mrs. Bennet anxiously thinking about how to marry her daughters off, as that was the primary way for women to achieve financial security during those times. The story is told in third person from the point of view of the second eldest daughter Elizabeth Bennet.Of the four Jane Austen novels that I've read, Pride and Prejudice is my favorite. This is not because I didn't enjoy the others, I most certainly did, but rather because Pride and Prejudice affected me on so many different levels. It touched my heart and swept me away, as I absolutely fell in love with Mr. Darcy. It also provoked my mind, as I reflected upon the many issues that Austen explores in this novel. It is a subtle book, as all Jane Austen novels are, and that is its beauty. All of the issues that Jane Austen raises in this book slowly simmer in your mind.One of the reasons I love Pride and Prejudice is that it is a romance for those with a bit of a feminist streak. Elizabeth Bennet is a strong character who isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is no weak wallflower. Many romantic plots feature a damsel in distress who is saved by her knight in shining armor. That is most definitely not the case here. The love story in Pride and Prejudice shows that you can have chivalrous man and grand romantic gestures without a weak heroine.I also love Pride and Prejudice for Austen's excellent treatment of the characters. Both of the main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, grow, develop, and change throughout the novel. Their character developments are deep, thorough, and convincing. In contrast, the supporting characters do not change much. Their constancy provides a nice point of comparison to the growth of the main characters.The novel is a full-fledged social commentary on marriage, love, money, wealth, social class, propriety, as well as pride and prejudice. It is fascinating to learn how different those times were from today, especially in the lack of opportunity for women; and yet, it is even more fascinating to think about how relevant the issues are to today. The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same.If you only read one Jane Austen novel, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Be patient with the old English language. It is not an easy read, but it is worth your while."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Beautiful clothbound edition. It is well made and will last a long time. I believe the typeface is Times New Roman, with standard margins. There is a ribbon bookmark in the binding. I plan to get some more of the Penguin clothbound editions in this set."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may believe from the title of this review that the reviewer is prejudiced. What took you so long to figure that out? Age and other afflictions of the eyes have robbed my ability to read to some degree but this edition is very kind to us ancients. Oxford has a good reputation and this publication will not dretract from it. The editorial material is even somewhat amusing: e.g. one note in the chronology \\"the United States declare war on Britain.\\" There is nothing amusing about the War of 1812, the use of the word \\"declare\\" where we Americans would more likely use \\"declares\\" is symbolic of the British conception of our republic. But we digress.Austen has been a favorite since I first encountered her in college. It was much later I realized one reason for the fine prose in Hiram Grant's Memoirs. He spent many hours at West Point reading Jane Austen novels. There he was given his more familiar name Ulyses S.(stands for nothing)Grant, hero of the Civil War and Republican president of the U. S. Had he spent his time reading the French tacticians as his classmates did the war may have been prolonged to allow McClellan to beat Lincoln in 1864.I apologize for wasting the readers time on things that really spread no knowledge of the book reviewed. I'll not spend words telling you the story, describing the characters or the time, offering opinions on the social state of Britain at the time of the novel. There are other reviews that attempt this. Jane Austen is much better at these tasks than I.The reviewer is an anglophobe. If it is given five stars here it should tell you a great deal about the value of this novel. For one who protects what is left of vision to read this book three times should say even more. It is strongly suggested reader that you uit wasting time on reviews and read the book.Thank you for your patience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Does the world need another P&P; review? No. Will anyone read this? Probably not, but I made a resolution to write a review of every book I read - and I read this for the umpteenth time while recovering from surgery.What is it about this novel? On the surface it is an ever-so-polite romance featuring the Bennett sisters, whose biggest concerns are their ball gowns and gossipy letters. However, what makes it ageless is the fully developed characters and the deep insights into the human condition. I never tire of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Since I was a business major in college, I wasn't made to read a lot of the standard classics that most people have already read. I'm finally starting to make up for lost time.I loved this book. I have always loved 19th century literature, mostly because I love the societal rules and manners. (The House of Mirth is one of my all-time favorite books.) However, I was a bit surprised that I could be drawn in so much to a romance where no one even kisses. (Especially because some of the paranormal romances I read are practically pornography.) But I couldn't put this book down and I am now in love with Mr. Darcy like so many other women before me."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"These clothbound Penguin classics are even more beautiful in person! I have 3 of them on a credenza in my living room and they look great!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I bought several of these books for Christmas presents this year. They arebeautiful and the built-in ribbon marker is an added bonus!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I shopped around for a good copy of Pride and Prejudice for a long time before coming across this one. I ordered Pride and prejudice and Jane Eyre. I recieved them yesterday and was very please with them. The pictures do not do them justice. They are gorgeous. I was afraid they would not be very durable, but they are very sturdy and the paper used for the pages is nice and thick. I wanted to find copies of my favorite classics that I can have for a long time and that would hold up to many re-reads and that is exactly what I have found in these. It doesn't hurt that they look great on the boofshelf either. I am also very glad that I ordered them from amazon and not from someone else (I did see them on a few other sites, for full price) because the price was amazing and they arrived properly packaged and in perfect condition with not a single flaw or bent corner, which happens easily to hard covers. I can't wait to order the rest of these beautiful penguine classics!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this audio version of the popular novel. I often play the CDs while I am driving and the time flies. Susannah York's animated reading of Jane Austen's novel includes voicing the lines of the various characters. Even though I have seen the 2005 movie and the 1995 TV miniseries, I feel I have a much better understanding of the various plot points after listening to this audio version. This rendition follows the book more closely, although it is an abridged version."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my all-time favorite book, so I felt like it was time to replace my old, torn paperback. This hardback copy feels like it is a book to be both treasured and enjoyed. The cover is gorgeous, and the book comes with a built-in ribbon to mark your place (no more turning down corners!). I love this version of the book, and it is a must-have for anyone whose favorite novel is part of this series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I won't bother to review the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", just this particular edition. It's lovely! There are about 20 color illustrations by Ian Beck, the typography is graceful and easy to read, and the binding is sewn as one should be. It doesn't have a cover -- came without one. The binding is a handsome print on fabric. Lovely book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is Jane Austen's best novel. The story is a mixture of intrigue and passion with an appropriate ending. The goog guy should always triumph!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admit I'm one of those bibliophiles who collects the different editions of favorite titles, and I could not resist this cover by artist Ruben Toledo. The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers. This is a novel to be savored time and again - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There are literally thousands of review of Austen's seminal classic Pride And Prejudice out there already. This is a review of the Dover facsimile edition based on the 1894 copy.From the beautiful Hugh Thomson illustrations, to the embossed floral end pages, this edition is top notch.

I believe, eventhough the story was written in the 1800's, mostly anybody that have been in love could relate with the complexity of feelings portrated in this story. As well as to relate, not only with the main caracters but also the surportive; the embarrazing relatives, the adoring aunt, the beloved sister, the lost love, etc...What ever I could say will not do justice to this master piece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little intimidated at first when I began this book, afraid I wouldn't be able to understand the old English language and terms.

Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen was PAINFUL to read.PAINFUL!!!!!The book is filled with rich people being super proper. Oh my goodness it was bad.Although a little more than halfway through the book, I did start to enjoy it. Mainly because they stopped being so stuffy and started being a little more real.There were a bunch of funny, underhanded proper comments, similar to something like \\"Why, doesn't she look pretty today?\\" but really meaning that she's super ugly and happens to have made herself look good for this moment.The overall story line: Daughters find people to become their husbands.Done.I just couldn't handle it.But it's a classic and I already know some of you are going to agree with me while others are like shouting at the screen in frustration at my review.So tell me your thoughts on Pride and Prejudice!Thanks for reading,Rebecca @ Love at First Book"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Brilliant writing. What a use of the English language. So rich and complex. It takes a while to get into her writing stylewhich is so sophisticated and witty.Besides her use of the language which makes &#34;american English&#34; so much more pitiful, it is incredible how she weavesa fascinating tale, page after page, on the basis of a very simple story: i.e. boy meets girl.One is constantly in suspense and the level of eroticism is so high without even a hint of touch between the twoprotagonists for more than half the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"All I had hoped for and then some!!!

I am now surprised at myself that I had not read a single Jane Austen book at nearly 30. I fully intend on reading all of her works. I loved how dialogue based this novel is."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this for the umpteenth time on the PC Kindle, and the formatting seemed fine to me, so maybe it's been sorted by now. Either that or I was so bedazzled by the story that I simply didn't notice any problems.A librarian once remarked to me, upon my commenting how few people were in the library that particular day, that if people had to pay to gain access the line would be around the block. This seemed to me to display a wise understanding of human nature.Just because something is free does not mean it is worthless, any more than there being a guarantee that something costing a lot is bound to be valuable. The reason this book is always free on Kindle is that it is long out of copyright. This fact alone shows that it has stood the test of time, along with Jane Austen's other novels.Many people shy away from reading so-called classic novels. They feel that they will be full of long descriptions or such dated language that the narrative will be impossible to penetrate. To anyone reading this book for the first time, therefore, the writing will be a revelation. It is perceptive and witty in its social commentary, and full of interesting, sympathetic (and sometimes unsympathetic) characters who remain forever in the memory.The story itself is the great-great-great-grandmother of all romances, even predating Jane Eyre, which so many people liken to Mills & Boon or Silhouette romances. The heroine and her hero are real, flawed people rather than cardboard cutouts. When you consider that Jane Austen's settings and characters genuinely reflect her own time (the late 18th/early 19th century), rather than being researched in modern times, there is added interest from both cultural and historic perspectives.If you have never read this novel, regarded by many as the writer's best, please don't pass on it this time. Not only is it a wonderful experience in itself, but it may open for you literary doors to other fascinating worlds that you have kept firmly closed until now. If you have already read it once, of course, this review is preaching to the converted, for you have probably done so several times, with its charms only increasing with every reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is the first book I happened to read on my Kindle. I was afraid the quality may be bad, for it was among the cheap or free classics. It is not the case, the format is very enjoyable.

The topic at hand was Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and the class was a noisy, disrespectful circus. It may be that this novel is essentially inaccessible now to all but a handful of young readers, and probably many older ones as well. A terrible shame!The book has much to teach us, after all, about the human condition, and the ways in which we handicap ourselves in the pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth's travails, and Mr. Darcy's, are as much self-inflicted as they are levied by the society in which they live. That said, Austen has an exceedingly generous and sympathetic touch with all of her characters, and the novel is one of the funnier pieces of the period. It goes without saying (or should) that her mastery of the English language is without peer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Somehow never read Austen as a youngster but decided to read it on my new Kindle! I'm so glad I did! The story got off to a slow start, dull and dry! As I plowed on through a lot of dinners and dances some of the characters became appealing, the plot thickened.

Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Remembered reading this in high school and not fully understanding a lot of the complex issues raised in this book. It's nice to have another read at an older age to appreciate the author's words, and have a better understanding of what makes this such a classic book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I finally read P&P; at the insistence of a very good friend...we disagreed on the merits of the recent Keira Knightley P&P; film (I liked it; she didn't)...she challenged me to read the book so that i would understand, and now I do!The goal of all the great novels, the experts tell us, is to arrive at some fundamental TRUTH.The genius of Jane Austen was that she told us the truth from the get go: \\"that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" and the MORE important truth: \\"However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\"And by declaring the truth from the get go, she brilliantly illuminates it throughout.This is a book for EVERYONE:For fathers (like me!), who love all their children, but recognize each for their faults and good parts...delights in the marriage of their daughters if they will be happy (like I am going through now)...the most touching part for me was how much Mr. Bennet loved Elizabeth and Jane and missed Elizabeth so much when she was gone.For children, especially, teens who are MORTIFIED at the behaviour of their parents in front of their friends. I mean, could Mrs. Bennet BE more embarrassing?!For brothers and sisters, to see the beauty and challenge of being siblings, especially in a large family!But, especially, for people who are - as Jane Austen put it - *violently* in love. She expressed it so well in the almost manic internal ponderings of Elizabeth and even Darcy, and and all at once: I hate him/her, I love him/her, I hope he/she will see me, I hope he/she doesn't come, how could he be so uncivil, how could he/she be so kind, I think he/she loves me, he/she could never love me...and also the joy of being friends before being lovers.I loved how she portrayed Mr Collins only in terms of his ridiculous language and habits; the filmmakers \\"cheated\\" by making Collins short to be ridiculous and then piled on; Austen saw the comedy not in his stature but in his silliness.I also loved the emphasis on letter writing to pour out ones fears and feelings...it is a lost art and we are the worse for it.The only thing I didn't like, and will likely never appreciate, is a culture where people don't have to show up at work everyday...I just don't get it...I guess that's why I enjoy historical fiction of common folks of the 18th and 19th century (by Matthew Pearl, Louis Bayard, David Liss, and others), where even the elite have to actually *do* something.I thanks my friend and Miss Austen for helping me appreciate a true classic!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long age. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun.\\"This sentence is from the novel Pride and Prejudice, the most famous book written by Jane Austen. The author set the background as conservative and traditional British countryside life which still pay attention to the reputation and have their own social circle. It contrasts with the people who are upper- class. They are selfish and prideful. Through five middle class girls how to choose love shows the values of marriage in that time, in that society. But among them there still exists people like Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley who finally choose their true love. And the sentence expresses the true love in a class structure society is really cherished between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. It fully shows Mr. Darcy's love to Elizabeth.For a long time, because of Mr. Darcy's pride, he hides his love to Elizabeth. It leads to Elizabeth has a misunderstanding to Mr. Darcy since the first time they meet. As the most important themes in this novel, love plays a special role in this book. The whole story develops around the different barriers in the true love and how people to respond these difficulties. And all of these difficulties come from one reason that is the social force. The social structure makes Mr. Darcy's pride that he feels like he should be proud of himself. Because he is richer than others and live in the upper- class. At the same time, it also the social structure makes Elizabeth's prejudice. She knows she and her family is just in a middle- class. So she is more sensitive than others and she does not want others such as Mr. Darcy looks down upon her. But just because of her sensitive, it makes her different from other girls. Elizabeth is the most intelligent girl in her family. She is clever and high- hearted. When she first meets Mr. Darcy, she has a really poor impression about him. Mr. Darcy is a wealthy and intelligent gentleman, so faces Elizabeth's prejudice; he chooses to be silent and does not explain anything. When he proposes to Elizabeth, Elizabeth determined rejects him and mentions Wickham's deceit. But Mr. Darcy still says nothing about it, the only thing he says is \\"I don't want to talk about it at all.\\" This is just one obstacle between them. Before they realize their sincerely love to each other, they have faced the different troubles and numerous stumbling blocks- Miss Bingley's snobbery, Lady Catherine's attempt to control her nephew, Mrs. Bennet's idiocy and Wickham's lies. All of these obstacles make a big difficulty exist in their love. Especially, the class- structure and reputation is more serious. The class- structure is really significant in that society. There are so many differences between them. They have the totally different life style since they were born. So from the origin of their mind is different. In the beginning, Mr. Darcy's pride to the people who live in the countryside hurts Elizabeth a lot. He thinks as girl as Elizabeth should be happy that he loves. Therefore, in the first time he says courtship to Elizabethj, he thinks she would love to say \\"yes.\\" But he gets an unexpected answer. And finally he knows Elizabeth in the only woman who loves him, not his money. So he helps Elizabeth's sister Lydia and Wickham, who is a fortune- hunting officer. And he explains all things through the letter from Elizabeth's aunt. He earned his love back. That proves love is a force that can be separated from social structure and facts and it shows love can conquer anything even the hardest thing- people's mind.Reputation is another theme in the novel; it helps to strengthen the difficulty between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. For Elizabeth, reputation is not that important for middle class girl. She prefers to live with her family than cares about the reputation. So when she knows her sister Jane is ill, she walks to Netherfiled alone. She arrives with muddy skirt, to the shock of reputation- conscious Mass Bingley and her friends. She does not care how people judge her. In Miss Bingley's eyes, her behavior is absolute not acceptable in the upper- class. From Miss Bingley's reaction, it expresses Elizabeth's unique and her natural personality. But when sister elopes with Wickham and lives with him out of wedlock, the reputation- conscious happened again. Bennet family is not invited to the ball anymore, and even they walk as they run. Whatever Elizabeth does not care her reputation, but her family cannot avoid it. The social force still exists in her life. She cannot escape from it. But in her most difficult time, Elizabeth finds Mr. Darcy is the only person that wants to help her to find her sister back, give her sister money and solved all problems for them. She suddenly realizes she is wrong about her prejudice. So she decides to accept Mr. Darcy's courtship. They break the social structure and rules and finally get married.This novel reflects how people treat marriage in that society. People only pursue wealth and reputation. Girls can marry with a guy such as Mr. Collins, only for his money. Parents pay attention to the man who their daughter will marry is rich, not whether their daughter really loves him. They pursue social position instead of love. But just because of that, it shows the true love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth is special and cherished. The author in this novel also tries to tell people, in this world we need to change, change can solve anything."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One friend asked me why the book, Pride and Prejudice, became one of the most famous classics of all time. She knew it exemplified a great English writing style, but after reading the book, it only gave her the impression of an early 19th century \\"chick-flick\\", targeted for fans of romance novels. The book, however, offered me not only a witty, romantic comedy but also educational and historical values through the realistic depictions of an early 19th century English society.Throughout the whole book, the main characters constantly reminded me of the famous maxim: Don't judge a book by its cover. When the heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, meets the male character, Darcy, she finds him handsome, young and rich; the type of men that any women during her time period would consider to be the perfect husband. But his proud arrogance and aloofness prick her pride, causing her to stubbornly decide to dislike Darcy. This fire of hatred is further fueled along when Wickham, a handsome soldier, wins Liz's heart through his seemingly agreeable personality. Providing her with spiteful lies about Darcy, Wickham helps Liz's prejudice to grow. When the truth is reveled, however, Liz realizes that she had made the wrong impressions about both Darcy and Wickham based upon their exterior behaviors and appearances. In fact, Wickham turns out to be a scandalous liar whose addiction for gambling has broke him poor and Darcy turns out to be a truly noble person who knows how to care for and love those dear to him.In the end, Liz learns to correct her mistake of making misimpression and eventually marries Darcy who loves her for who she really is. This unrealistically happy ending, however, caused me to be aware of the real matrimony system in the early 19th century. The main characters ended happily; a girl from a poor family married the perfect man from a wealthy background due to their true, inseparable love. But other characters showed otherwise. For example, Liz's friend, Charlotte Lucas, agreed to marry Mr. Collins despite the fact that her friend had rejected him a few days ago. No love existed in this marriage obviously, but Charlotte could not have been happier as the marriage had much benefit for her: it saved her from her poor financial status and even from the shame of remaining unmarried at her old age. Just like Charlotte, many lower class women settled to be content with marriages, if they brought them or their families a little benefit.On the other hand, Ms. Bingley and Lady Catherine show how the upper class of the early 19th century married. Ignoring love mostly, both compared Darcy's social class, financial status, and family background to judge if marrying herself (Ms. Bingley's case) or her daughter (Lady Catherine's case) would be the most advantageous combination. In both cases, the source of wealth and power could be traced as the men, whom the women had to depend on and negotiate with to marry as best as they could. Both classes considered greatly the effects on the future and the family that the marriage would bring and the way how these female character perceived marriages proved how the real women during the early 19th century actually married.In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice should not be only read for observing Jane Austen's talent in writing or for mere enjoyment of romantic comedy, but also for development in mature perception and the cultural history that the book offered. Pride and Prejudice is an educational novel that clearly depicts the difficulty in forming perspective about other people and the dangers that could arise when our impressions or senses are trusted too much. It does not only offer an insight into how women of the early 19th century really lived but shows their lifestyle, way of thinking and the harsh reality of the matrimony system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book a million times. That is, I've read the library's book as well as an old 80's edition that had pages ripped out and taped back together. I ordered this copy as a special gift to me to celebrate my favorite author.

If you like reading a book that sends you off in twists and turns that throws both irony and realism in your face, then you'd better not delay. The book is about a twenty-one year old girl struggling with three stupid sisters and an arrogant mother, with only her father and elder sister as her true friends.

Line breaks follow pretty much every occurrence of \\"Mr.,\\" for example."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Any reader of the novel Pride and Prejudice, be it novice or veteran, has certain expectations and apprehensions based on its incredible popularity and renown. The same can be said for the media, whose recent over-use of its famous opening line, \`It is a truth universally acknowledged...' can be found repeated in the opening of many a news, magazine or blog article announcing some creditable or dubious connection to Jane Austen's characters or plot. Interestingly, it has become the meme of the day passed along and re-used by those who want to appear in the know, but are sadly missing the point. It is debatable if Pride and Prejudice's profound truths can be reduced to just universally acknowledged one-liners. If the novel was that easy to figure out we would not care two figs about it, and after nearly two hundred years, it would have been lost to obscurity! What one can expect though is so much more; an engaging plot that keeps you thinking and re-evaluating characters every step along the way, witty, sharp and humorous dialogue that others wish to emulate but never quite achieve, and a love story which just might reign supreme for all eternity. With all of these expectations before us, who could not be a little intimidated?The Oxford World's Classics new edition of Pride and Prejudice might just meet your need to read and explore Jane Austen's classic novel. This edition presents the reader with a wide variety of supplementary material to help you along in your discovery of the universal truths in Pride ad Prejudice. Like many editions, it supplies us with an unabridged text that has been carefully edited by prominent scholars since it was first published in 1813. \`Carefully' is the operative word here, since the debate is on about what has been changed or removed from the text. I will again defer to my learned co-reviewer Prof. Moody to delve into that arena. In addition to the brief biography of Jane Austen, select bibliography, chronology of her life, and two appendixes on dancing and social status that are repeated in each of the six editions in this series, (and previously mentioned in our first review), this volume includes a twenty-six page introduction by Fiona Stafford, notes on the text including a publishing history, textural notes and explanatory notes unique to this edition filled with insights and facts neatly organized and easy to find.Writing an introduction to one of the most beloved and highly scrutinized novels in English literature is a daunting task indeed. My sympathies went out to Fiona Stafford even before I had read one word. Pride and Prejudice is so many things to different people, and not everyone's pet project could be addressed within the limit of space. I just hoped that she might enlighten me in some small way about a truth or insight that I had previously missed. She did not. But like one of the main themes in Pride and Prejudice, accounts by different people of the same events can have different truths. We all judge by our own unique agenda, so what I saw as lacking, another reader might find diverting. She did however, hit upon some interesting points; how the strength of our convictions can cloud our belief and disbeliefs, the divergence and attraction of different personalities, and how truth or the misconception of it can alter our judgment and future happiness.The truth may be uncertain in Pride and Prejudice, but on this fact I am convinced. I had difficultly writing about this introduction even after taking copious notes. This can be a telling sign to its clarity and content. I did however find one point of amusement when the author mentioned that characters can be distinguished by their speech patterns and gave examples; \\"Lydia's use of \`Oh Lord', Miss Bingley's \`Abominable', Mr. Collins' \`Lady Catherine de Bourgh', and Mary Bennet's lengthy, but largely content-free sentences distinguish her from her vivacious sisters.\\" This is definitely true of Austen's unique characterizations, but this introductions \`content-free sentences' certainly distinguished it from any other vivacious introduction that this writer has the pleasure to read.Besides my disappointment in the introduction, the remainder of the supplemental material including the very helpful explanatory notes and the extensive chronology were a delight. For the new student the additional material is a must to understand the full context of the novel; - and for those Janeites who are ready to start your annual re-reading of Pride and Prejudice, pick up this edition. It is a perfect size to stash in your handbag or brief case, and whip out when the next debate ensues about whether Mr. Darcy was too proud, or just shy."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"...This book is a romance, and I liked it.My only excuse is, it's a CLASSIC romance!I loved it, in fact.

(I might say that a few more times.)I loved Elizabeth, Jane, Mr. Bennet's relations with Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingly, Mr. Collins (my cousin cannot say his name without falling over herself laughing from what she saw in the movie.)I can't even find words to describe how much I loved this book.

It has the wonderful dialogue and character development. AND it's funny! A must read for any self-respecting bookworm!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I went to a bookshop, this book 'Pride and Prejudice' charmed me with pretty book cover and familier title.When I started reading this book, I could not stop, i had to finish it. This book is very classical love story, even though it is written in a difficult english style. I was able to fall into this book very easily.Firstly, it was interesting how Jane portrayed the fluttering mind of village people like how all the villege people tried to contact with new villeger Bingley.Also it was interesting that how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's first impresstion is bed. That shows the first impression is not everyting, it's changeable by knowing the person in depth.Combine with that period of time, the love story continues. I was queit impressed how their only hope is to get married. For example, wickham's case. Elizabeth's sister get crush on him, and just fall into him and gets marry with him.I also knew that in that period of time, there was big gap between rich and poor same as today. This story is more meaningful because the story overcomes the richness. Also the way Mr. Darcy acts out, how he helps Elizabeth without letting her know and how he tries to protext him was really romantic.One another thing is that these days, most of the love stories reverse the story at the end that might give readers a thrill. But this very classic book just kept on going to one direction the way that i predicted. That is the reason that i chose this book to write a review on.Lastly, as I read this book I learnt that the appearance is not everything, the thing that charms person is one's scent. What kind of personality and chracteristic the one has. I think everyone wants to be pretty and be nice like a flower infront of a person the he or she loves. But important thing is that should be not determinded by a appearance but by inner personality."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although this is my first Jane Austen novel (I started Emma but returned it to the library after a boring few pages), it suprisingly was a fun read. I admit I read this because of the movie and the BBC miniseries, but even watching both does not give the full story behind Pride and Prejudice. The book can be boring at a few scenes, namely, Mr. Collins, but whenever we read Elizabeth's and Darcy's banter, it makes it all more worthwhile. Definitely recommend the book if you enjoy the movie/BBC series."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's books are fabulous. Her writing is superb and captivates the reader.

I was the first novel of Jane's that I've read and I could not put it down. The suspence and humor of this book makes it great.... you must read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found this book to be humorous and light-hearted. It was also satirical about society during the eighteenth century. Historically, the book was accurate and interesting. The book had a variation of themes; comedy, romance, irony, and so on. The style of the book enables you to feel the moods of the main characters. I felt hatred for Mr. Darcy and his stubbornness. Mr. Bennet's attitude about his wife and family was witty. Each character had their own unique characteristic, which showed the differences and faults of society.The situation between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy grows along with their love. The irony of how subtle their love has grown for each other is very entertaining. No one truly believed that Elizabeth loved Mr. Darcy rather she was spiteful towards him. But as the book progresses, she learns about her harsh judgments about him and falls in love for him. Her sister, Jane does not even believe in this love.The book also shows how life sometimes works out for the better when expecting the worst. The complications and different views on marriage show how people do not think a like. Charlotte Lucas, Lizzie's friend, does not believe in marriage for love, rather she thinks marrying comfortably is more than enough. In life, there are ups and downs, along with each human being. She rather learns about them after she is in wedlock, then learning before hand. Although everyone believes that Jane and Mr. Bingly would be married and loved each, conflicts occur. Different people, separating the two, misled Mr. Bingly and Jane. Luckily, the truth is learned and things work out. Lizzie has the most conflicts of them all. She finds a new guy that she likes, but realizes she loves the person who she least expected it from, Mr. Darcy.Overall the book was well written and I enjoyed the letters from others, showing each person's different perspective and styles. The details and descriptions are magnificent and captivating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"although some may not notice it, this Austen novel is romantically-centered. The subtlety of the liaison between Darcy and Elizabeth and their psychological games leave the reader with the impression that the protagonist is doomed to spinsterhood, while her sisters one by one are exfoliated away by their respective bridegrooms.It's not until towards the conclusion of the story that Austen finally gratifies her desires by ( spoiler! ) bringing Darcy and Eliza together. Romance, courtship, and flirtation perceived as daring back in Austen's pre-Victorian era are so uncouth and perplexing to the modern reader that he/ she might miss out on a truly light-hearted romantic comedy with ludic characters and good-natured humor.This is one of Austen's finest works and I regard her as one of the great writers, female or otherwise."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book. In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest. It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot; And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits. In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius. Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel. To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax. Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people. It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny. Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up. There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and because I had watched the Wishbone show and did not believe that the main character could be a dog. The words were a bit difficult but I read it and was really surprised. It starts out a bit slow, but after the middle, it became really interesting and after the book, I felt really good. I actually read the end a couple times again. The characters are really charming, especially Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I guess you could say it was the ultimate miscommunication. It is an adult fairy tale, is what I can describe it as."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But for this book I have to. I first picked up Austen's P&amp;P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test. (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.) I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today. Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters. In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it. Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage? What about passion? And does passion or regard equate to love?

I've always liked Jane Austen's style, and I'm much interested in books during this period. This novel is a perfect example about feminine frivolity and Victorian ways of mind. It's also epidemizes the importance of humbleness.All the characters plainly suggest that the highest standard a woman had in during the early 1800's was being a rich man's wife. Pride and Prejudice narrates a story about a poor man's daughters and their stuggles in &quot;catching&quot; a man of high society.Jane, the beauty, longs for the attention of Mr. Bingley, the owner of Netherfield Park. Through parties, dinners, and occasional ailments, their love blossoms into a possible proposal.Elizabeth, the easygoing, proud daughter, battles the intolerably rude and snobby blueblood, Mr. Darcy. Though they can't stand each others company, this friction grows into love. The only problem is their stubborn pride, each refusing to acknowledge the fact that they've fallen for people whom they regard as the scum of the world.Lydia, the youngest and the rashest, hopes to marry the crooked Mr. Wickham, but Wickham has different ideas.I loved Pride and Prejudice, and I recommend this book to anyone who loves romances."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was an extremely funny story. The funniest parts were when Mr. Darcy said he would consider Elizabeth a beauty as soon as he would consider her mother a wit. Not that her mother is totally stupid or anything. They were the two best characters in the book. Mr. Bennet is funny too at the begging when he sayd he is not going to go talk to Mr. Bingley and he does. He is one of the most likable or I should say 'agreeable' characters in the book. Why does my review have to come last?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of those books that I just keep coming back to over and over. Austen has spun an very romantic love story with this one, but it is much more than that. Her social commentary is biting and true, even for today's standards. Her dialogue, though that of over 100 years ago, still sounds true and real. The plot keeps you reading so you forget that this is a classic, and just enjoy it for the story and the beauty of the language.

This was the first of the Jane Austn books i ever read and it got me hooked on oall the others...The relationship between Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth is s romantic it almost makes you wish you could be there in Pemberly and Netherfield..."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently bought &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; for my daughter. She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, &quot;Who's going to come courting me today?&quot; But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was assigned this book for my AP Literature class and the grunts and groans running through the room were audible. A comedy of manners at first seemed like it would be no comedy at all. From what others had told me, Jane Austen had always been lumped with that group of 19th century authors to avoid at all costs.I couldn't have been more wrong. Jane Austen is delightfully humorous and the sarcastic humor that underlies the characters of Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bennett rounds out the book and the characters themselves. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennett is an intelligent young woman stuck in the early 19th century. And while she is resigned to fitting the role of young women at the time, she is also able to see the silliness by which other girls govern their lives, and though she does nothing to warrant it, the reader automatically places her above the others. She contains all the elements of a charming protagonist as she is honest, intelligent and witty all at the same time.I loved Mr. Darcy, as well, on his first appearance. Admittedly he was haughty and conceited but from first sight Elizabth begins to chip away at his pride, though she frequently refuses to give him so much as a word. Reading the back cover I thought this was going to be a typical romance story, but it wasn't that either. Despite many other 'romances', the one the reader really wants to see is held off time and time again, and by the last few pages it feels like it may never come about.This is definitely worth reading and is above the ruin that college discussions will often cause."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was with wonderful anticipation that I sat down with Jane Austen's seminal work, Pride and Prejudice. I had previous knowledge of Jane Austen only as a giant of Western literature, but I resolved to read her work after seeing the delightful Emma Thompson movie Sense and Sensibility. I briefly entertained the notion of reading the novel Sense and Sensibility, but decided instead upon Pride and Prejudice. Mainly because Pride and Prejudice is widely considered to be the better book, but also because I wanted to read one of Austen's works that I had no previous familiarity with the characters and plot. I can happily say that this book has awakened within me a voracious beast of a reader who has every intent of devouring every Austen novel he can get his hands on. It is a testament to Austen's incredible prowess as a writer that she is able to breathe life into a historical period that 21st century readers are far removed from, and by the end of the book you have come to look upon Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy, not as the heroine and hero of a book 200 years old, but as completely fleshed out characters who could exist in any time, in any novel. The reader comes to understand their joys, their pain, their defeats, and their ultimate triumph, as if these emotions were his own. The hallmark of all great literature is an ability to awaken in the reader a true sense of understanding for what the characters are thinking and feeling, and that is certainly the case in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book recently as an SSR book for my Honors World Lit class.

I was blasphemously thinking, &quot;Why has everyone made such a hype about this book for the past century or so? It's just a bunch of prissy girls wasting their lives away by waiting around on parties, dates, and personal Prince Charmings to whisk them away&quot;.However, as the novel went on, Austen's prowess at prose whisked me away, and I was totally intrigued. The Victorian world was opened up to me, and I tossed all former feminist theories momentarily aside as I became immersed in this setting, yearning for that time and place, where icould have lived like a princess and been loved by all, simply for being born female.I loved Austen's depiction of the relationship between Elizabeth and Jane, and I saw the closeness of my own relationship with my sister reflected in it. I was amused by Mary's disgust in boys and her blatant disregard for most people. Lucy and Kitty's attempts to capture the eyes and hearts of possible suitors were timeless characterizations of so many girls, at that time period and today. Most of all, I loved Mr. Bennett's sense of humor, and his remarks (especially those directed toward Mrs. Bennet) made me laugh out loud throughout the book.Count me in: I am the newest Jane Austen fan, and the one who deserves to receive the Procrastinator of the Century award for waiting so long to read her. For any of you who are putting off reading her like I did, there words of advice: do it, now. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Mrs. Bennet was a simple woman, with but one goal in life: to get her daughters married. She went about this task in a dedicated manner, pouncing on every man that comes by, from nobles to officers. Marriage was the only option for a respectable girl and the husband had to be chosen with care. We usually automatically make the assumption that the love and marriage go hand in hand. But at one time a marriage was thought of as a business transaction. Wealth and social standing were thought of first and foremost, love and happiness could come afterward. Any wealthy bachelor was \\"considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.\\" Elizabeth Bennet thought she knew better, for a happily ever after there had to be love and understanding. We follow her misadventures in search of happiness with a range of comical characters from her assertive, matchmaking mother to her arrogantly, meek cousin. Marriage, it seems, is more than both an economic decision and an emotional rush. We are given examples of each of these extremes through Elizabeth's sisters. Through this and Austen's humor and wit, we are given a delightful satire of the British matrimonial arrangements."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"it is a nice book for all age group."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Tapes were very good, but it helped to have seen the video to REALLY understand it all"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though the Darcy has a personalities that are unacceptable throughout this story, this character attracted me a lot because of it's peculiar persona that he had. This sense might be derived from the sense of value that I have personally. It is certainly a true that external features of a certain person predispose a people to estimate his general personality traits, however, this should be a thing that ethically discouraged. I like to recommend this book to person who would like to ponder over fundamental matters of human relationship. Pride is thing truly made by Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the best classics written by Jane Austen. The character of Elizabeth and Dracy are brought out beautifully. The vivid range of emotions of all the characters are a pleasure to read they involuntary invoke reponse from the reader"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride And Prejudice is a very good novel; it takes place during the 19th century, when women were inferior to men. The title of the novel Pride And Prejudice has an actual meaning in the story that describes the main characters. This novel has some similarities to today's society in various ways.The meaning of the title describes the personality of Darcy and Elizabeth. Darcy had the personality of being proud, and Elizabeth was very prejudiced. The reason Darcy had that personality was because he was a wealthy man who didn't associate with people who were from a lower social class. He didn't have the confidence to tell Elizabeth that he liked her because of his pride. Elizabeth was really prejudiced because before she met people, she distrusted them. Elizabeth thought Darcy's love for her wasn't real when it actually was true. I think the way that Darcy and Elizabeth were acting was foolish because pride and prejudice are not good things to have. It causes problems among people.In the story the strong one was actually the woman because she did not let him play with her and that attracted Darcy to Elizabeth.. Chapter three appealed to me because that was the beginning of all of the misunderstanding in the novel, which made it interesting for the readers to read. The sparks lit up in that chapter. The pride and prejudice of Darcy and Elizabeth started and kept on getting worse throughout the novel because even though they felt an attraction for each other they had misunderstanding that made them have bad feelings. But like all stories it always has a solution at the end. I liked the misunderstanding because it kept on make me feel a great suspense that made me want to keep on reading to find the answer, especially when Darcy asked Elizabeth to dance and was rejected by her. This part of the chapter was the best part because it life me with questions about what was going to happen later in the story with them, and it also confused me because I didn't think that they were going to end up marrying at the end.I liked this book a lot. It is one of my favorite books right now. The rating that the critics gave this book was a wise decision, five stars, because it was well written and interesting. This book is appropriate for people in the age of 14 and up. If you like to read suspense novels, you will like this novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, although I found it to be quite difficult to get into at first, proved to be a truely enjoyable reading experience. Despite its difficult language and rather lengthy descriptions and dialog, which tended to confuse me and cause me to lose interest at several points throughout the novel, the plot and events of this book left me in uplifted spirits and with the positive feeling that love truely can overcome any obstacle put in its way. The romance between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, as well as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley, left me guessing throughout the entire novel, and motivated me to trudge through the somewhat uneventful chapters inbetween exciting events. I recommend this book to any person with a high attention span interested in reading an uplifting story about the powers of true love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is generally considered a pretty, romantic book - like a swan on a lake. But much like the swan, it's what happening underneath that's important. I have always admired this book for its wit and sharp observations but also for the title. Clever and astute, as usual. But is it Elizabeth who is proud and Darcy who is prejudiced? Or vice versa? Or are they both proud and prejudiced? These questions keep me re-reading this masterpiece at least once a year and I change my mind about the answers every time. This book will give me a lifetime of pleasure."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:PThe book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit that this is a very well written book: the situations, the characters, the idea. I must also admit, though, that for that very fact, I didn't enjoy the book. The book was a comedy of manners on society and people. Most of the people were irritating, and I couldn't get into it. This is not to say that there is a flaw in Austen's writing. She is a most excellent authoress. I was so annoyed by the well-written characters that I couldn't enjoy them."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"i love this book!i read it first in 5th grade[though it was hard to understand!] then in 6th, 3 times in 7th and 4-5 times in 8th.i m like obsessed with this book!i also loved the film version, and i watched all the 3 versions.jane austen is indeed a great author. the way she portrays her characters is really creative, and u can just imagine what they look like, their personality, etc. i simply enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this book in my sophomore English class. For me, it was a perfect introduction to the Classics. The language is similar to books such as Anna Karenina and the like, but there is an element of humor that even us twentieth century dimwits can relate to. Sometimes subtle, and sometimes not, Jane Austen keeps us on our toes with her eighteenth-century characters that somehow manage to be hip. No matter who you are, you will find yourself rooting for one or another of the characters as they struggle for something ... if not hapiness, then an extremely desirable position in life."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I read this back when I was in Jr. High and fell head over heels in love with Jane Austen, with her sparkling wit and lively characters. Now, I am a college English major and after reading hunderds of books, I can safley say that this is still among my favorites. It is a classic story and an easy read in my mind, at least. The charcters of Lizzy and Darcy are among my favorite in all of literature.But after reading all the reviews on this site, I have became convinced that this is a book that does not belong in American High Schools. I had some of my friends read it in High School and they all loved it. I can only assume that we went to a batter HS or something, as every other bad review on this site (in fact, almost all the classic book reviews) it from some poor High School student who has never read a book over 200 pages in their life, doesn't know anything about literature ( I was laughing out loud at the \\"facts\\" presented in some of the 1 star reviews) and is just upset that they have to take time away from being spoon-fed things to pick up a book and think. It distresses me that we have become such a culture that we chide cultured books like this for not having sex and then turn around and call it a \\"soap opera\\" (anyone who has ever seen a soap opera and then read this book knows that there is no comparison between the two--for one, no soap opera writer has Austen's wit, her intellegence, her perception of the human condition).So, to potential buyers--it is a light, comic work that you shouldn't have to think about (don't believe the negative reviews--there is nothing deep in this) and I'm sure you will enjoy it, if you have a respect for art and a bit of intellegence. It is one of the best ove stories ever told. And if you are going to write a negative review, try not to make yourself look like an idiot in the process."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books of all time! Although it was written about 2 centuries ago, it doesn't matter because it tells a timeless and believable story. All 5 Bennet daughters need to find husbands, preferably rich ones. How they go about it and how Elizabeth learns to love Mr. Darcy is absolutely fascinating, not only because of the way it is told, but because it shows people as they really are when something important is at stake. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try. This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class. Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing. Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues. I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett. I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The plot is intriguing: an assembly of eligible men take short-term residence in a town full of unmarried women. As a result, several couples pair off and a few marry. The novel is concerned primarily with one couple: Eliza and Darcy.Obstacles prevent these two from seeing each other's worth. Darcy at first thinks Eliza possesses no great share of beauty. He is prejudiced and only sees her as a product of her class. But by gazing through the windows to her soul - her dark eyes - he slowly becomes fascinated by this enthralling beauty.Eliza, proud herself, will not accept the advances of a haughty, cold man like Darcy. Instead, she offers her affections to a bright-colored soldier, who possesses pleasing manners to match her own. But experience teaches her that a cool temper can hide love, and pleasing manners can mask cruelty.Appearances are deceiving, and lessons are hard learned in Pride and Prejudice, a light romance, occasionally skirting the depths of human psychology."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel. I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel. Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though. This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days. The characters are deep and well written. Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past. This book is a classic for a reason. I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Is she proud and he prejudice? Maybe it is he who is proud and she who is prejudice? Despite the arguments that could be made both ways, Jane Austen does indeed do an excellent job in bringing together two people of such different moral standing and ensnare them in a delightful and romantic story.The heroine, Elizabeth Bennett, is a witty, presumptuous young lady with an uncontrollable urge to speak her mind. Her antagonist is the very wealthy and very blatant Mr. Darcy, who has his own ideas about how certain people should act and behave. So how can two people so wrong for each other and so different ever be brought together?Elizabeth finds herself alone with Mr. Darcy on many awkward occasions and always manages to say something to hurt his precious ego. I think it is absolutely amazing how he can fall in love with a woman who has nothing but utter disdain for him and everything he stands for. She is, however, an amazing woman.Elizabeth is caring and considerate and very much eager to be in love, although she sometimes hides it well. She has the utmost affection for her family, and especially for her older sister, whose heart she would gladly do anything to keep from breaking.In Mr. Darcy&#65533;s defense, he is a very well rounded gentleman. He has the highest and most prestigious upbringing. However, he lets his social status and wealth dictate his heart and cause him to spiral into a soul searching debate over love verses social standing.The entire story leaves the reader captivated and in agony, ready to flip to the end to see if Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth truly find love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" Thus begins the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Jane Austen. Written nearly two centuries ago, the novel still seems fresh and new owing to its radiance of wit and uncanny sense of candor. The characters are quirky, at times satirical. However, their actions and concerns mirror those of our own. Should we value property, position and esteem over virtue and principle? Should we forgo all romantic notions of love and marriage and instead be practical and settle for material wealth and security? These are questions the characters in this novel ask themselves and each other. It is a comedy of manners, but also, a story about young people trying to make rational and intelligent choices, pulled this way and that by their morals, their conscience, and often, their mothers.At the center of the story are Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and opinionated young woman, and Mr. Darcy, a proud, haughty gentleman. They meet and almost immediately, dislike each other - Elizabeth because she finds Mr. Darcy incredibly proud and completely lacking in humor; Mr Darcy because he thinks Elizabeth and her family are beneath his station in life. But one cannot help who one loves, and Mr. Darcy eventually feels great admiration for her. Elizabeth, on the other hand, realizes that she has been too quick to judge, and begins to look upon Mr. Darcy with some measure of interest. What follows is a delicate waltz of flirtation and witty repartee. We the readers, 21st century get-up-and-go, can't-stop-for-a-minute workaholics, then have the bucolic pleasure of bearing witness as to which will melt away first in the warmth of true affection - Mr. Darcy's pride, or Ms. Bennet's prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This classic detailed description of the problems faced in olden day England regarding women, enchanted my mind immediately from the books first sentence.

It is also a great insight for the time period. A must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The novel Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen intrigued me just by its mysterious title in which the two seemingly irrelevant words are put together. After I finished the first reading, I was impressed with her witty and sophisticated language that enlivened the characters with distinctive features and the descriptions of landscapes and atmospheres of that certain time period. Moreover, the most remarkable aspect of this novel was the title itself- Pride and Prejudice. The two words do not agree upon a uniform theme but after the reading, I could make multiple links between the plots/themes of the novel and the title. The only aspect I did not really enjoy was how the basic structure of the entire essay was stereotypical and the plots being somewhat hackneyed to the readers who are exposed to a wide range of romance novels.Before I started the novel, I could not really expect in advance what would happen and how the characters would advance. However, as I finished up the novel, my curiosity was fully disentangled. Some readers may interpret the title as Darcy being the proud character and Elizabeth being the prejudiced character. However, from another perspective, one can also interpret the title as that both characters are prejudiced by their first impressions and their social classes and are blinded by their pride, which explains why they both continue to be put in a form of conflict. Either way, the title lets the readers expect something that they have never thought and thus turns the thing around after the reading, which maximizes the dramatic aspects of all.Jane Austen's use of language is certainly highly sophisticated and classy especially when she describes the background scenes or setting of 18th century of England. Without watching movies, I could easily imagine each scene vividly. When she describes Longbourn, a typical country town, or Darcy's estate, it gave me right away an impression of what it was like during that epoch. Also, not only her picturesque and descriptive language, but her actualizations of the atmosphere of that certain era were directly conveyed to me that I once thought I was one of those daughters of Bennet family. She uses lots of details to offer the most explicit mood of realistic lives of an ordinary family in England and she successes regard to that.Austen's characters and perspectives are also some aspects that did captivate me a lot. The protagonists Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy stand out as very distinctive characters but minor charactors such as Jane, Bingley, Collins, Wickham, Lydia, Lady Catherine, and even her parents play tasteful roles that keep the novel stimulating until the end. The setting and background of this novel is something to focus on also because the lives of people in England during 18th-19th century were typical while the novel and plots deviate from such clich&eacute; by Austen making characters unique and distinguished. Elizabeth Bennet is unlike other women who were expected to be obedient and passive; Elizabeth seems vigorous in expressing her opinions, honest, straightforward and intelligent (and problematically she knows it too well). In a scene where Elizabeth confronts Lady Catherine, she does not fall back or cringes due to her lower class, but rather, she stands up defending herself and remain confident in saying what she wants to say to Lady Catherine. Her unique characteristic definitely explains why Darcy is so attracted to her in the first place.Austen integrates basic components of the lives of ordinary people naturally so that the readers today can easily compare their lives to that of old live and easily understand and even sympathize with the characters. She makes several conflicts between different class such as between Elizabeth and Lady Catherine or Ms. Bingley looking down on Jane to demonstrate how class distinction was so conspicuous during that time period. Also, the typical mindsets of women are displayed when Mrs. Bennet is very desperate to let all her five children be married to rich men or when Elizabeth's friend, Charlotte marries to Mr. Collins even without love. It was a prevalent thought back then that love is not the most chief determinant in marriage (This is why Elizabeth-Darcy relationship is more enthralling). The readers today can easily perceive what it was like in England by reading the novel and place themselves in the middle of the setting. Nonetheless, along with this, it was also an intriguing component that Austen used four different couples to demonstrate that diverse situations allowing the readers to compare.Except the fact that the basic structure of the novel was formulaic, I enjoyed the novel and I would like to recommend to those of my age because anyone of my age could easily relate to Elizabeth and be easily impressed by her attractive characteristics and eye-catching development of Elizabeth and Darcy's beautiful relationships."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It wasn't hard to not like, but it is introduced to me by my mom. In fact, it is her favorite translated books and so well known, it connected us to a time where everyone still cared about society decorum. It was more about finding love and still believe domestic live is still good for reason. It made women look good but made the truth more bearable about the constant bickering around home. It explained like Mr. Roger in the Neighborhood about who is coming and going in the social circle, and it made serious strive to explain the role of women in society and politics, but it did not aim to increase their role. It was a cup of tea on the role of gentlemen in their children's education, and it made their role around home more explainable. It made warring segment of the society less popular, but it reflected the sentiment of the times, it made peace more acceptable and finding the person to share life more condoned. It was the voice of the unpopular and the bluestocking type of \\"Jane\\" at the time, who wants their men to stay home and their women to enjoy the social life more. It is nothing but deplorable people who marry unsuitably and this reasoning made it ways to every nook and craning, essentially, it set out to destroy as much of unsuitable marriage as possible. But it did this elegantly, and the main character there, Elizabeth and Darcy, as well as Jane and Bingley as good as married. It does not seek to destroy any more thinking process on the other facets of the ordinary life in unordinary times, but it brought unrealized expectations as well. The thoughts of English ways does not prevail in their society is like reducing the mind to think only of the times they were conquered by the Normans, but it does not however, make the case for the natural ways people will continue to live their life as much as possible. So, at the end, everyone hoorayed at the English marriages and made sure whoever named Eliza will marry Fitzwilliam Darcy in the End, and not anyone forgot about Jane as well.The less known character then all got their satisfaction and knowledge that they all had their share of matrimony of stable life, which in fact, is the well-known intent of Jane Austen in almost every single one of her books. Perhaps all of them, though their maybe one or two which is read by the reviewer or because it is only partially finished. Most like the latter.So, who really cares about the malapropism of the weaker characters or the seldom attuned to reality Eliza, it was actually more fun to read it and not have to over think on who could possibly love the Darcy and Bingley set of the world. It was so well described, and it made the whole Bingley and friends' family the most beloved or the most hated family of all time. It made their social gatherings the crown of the gazette, all to serve and divert the attentions of the war. It also made some of their actions unforgiving at the same time as well, so in as much as the Bennet family created happiness by entertaining their social circles, it made the Bingley family more unimpeachable when the made the match for their son, right when they made the error of crossing over their duties their neighbors for more frivolous things like work and better gain for themselves.Reading through Pride and Prejudice is also a worrisome venture when in fact the reader is often at a loss on how to cope with the idea that Jane Austen herself is at the lower level of the society, without either access to explain their actual lives or scientific tools to deduce on how people like the unforgiving aunt of Darcy. It took witticism and it took the audacity to write based on hearsay, and it made philosophy more acceptable to women, perhaps. Least in my opinion it did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I couldn't find anywhere whether or not this was an abridged or unabridged version. I found out when the book on CD got here that it's abridged...not what I wanted at all. Although it lasted a car ride back home from school, I would prefer to listen to the whole book, not a synopsis."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I give this an average rating for the poor editing. The font was fine, but there were so many typos. That said, it was the first Kindle book I ordered because this is my favorite book of all time. I love the book so much, I kept reading through the typos and that's not easy for me. It was free, however. I guess you get what you pay for, right?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Is there anything better than a sleasy romance novel. How about one from the late 18th century early 19th century? Not the literature that everyone expects but it is a wonderful window into the life and times of the people of a certain class of a certain time. Most of her works are over rated but Pride and Prejudice is absolutely not. You can relate to everything in it. Proving once again that somethings never change."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 years old, and I loved it. Even though it took me some time to understand the old english text, the meaning was still there. Just recently (now I am 18) I saw the tv mini series of Pride and Prejudice, and fell in love with it all over again! You can feel Mr. Darcy's anguish as he watches Lizzie from afar, and you squirm in your chair knowing that Lizzie despises Darcy because she thinks that he abhors her. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet make you laugh, and you can just feel the embarrassment that the younger sisters bring to the older ones. This is the most amazing story, and I do not feel that it is in the least an ordinary one. It is a hold-your-breath romance with comedy, intrigue, a little suspense, and coincidence. A beautiful tale of old English life, and an easy to love character - Elizabeth Bennet. This is by far my favorite story of all time. I recommend to anyone - including younger people."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY THAT HAS EVER BEEN WRITTEN.

It's definatly a must read for those who seek to understand themselves and other better as well as enjoy a great story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved the book, it is before its time.

The descriptive language brings to mind romance, fancy balls and gallantry no longer found in this modern age."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is obviously a classic and easy to read. However, the amount of characters is too much to follow and also the author sometimes doesn't let the reader know when a different character is speaking. Which made it a bit frustrating fir the first couple if chapters. Also, I did not feel attached to the characters. Their emotions were held back through the whole book, so when Darcy and Elizabeth finally get together it is not as exciting and heart wrenching as it should be."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great read. Enjoyed it very much. Going to read it for a second time. really enjoyed the read. Great story and book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I want to recommend you this novel,\\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Have you ever heard \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and \\"Jane Austen\\"? I read it two times, last year and early this year. It's very interesting for me to read this book.Jane Austen lived small village so her view about world is limited and her works mainly deal with marriage. A model example is 'Pride and Prejudice'.There are many character in the novel. Many man character and woman character enter the story. At first, each person misunderstand each other but they remove misunderstanding and finally many man and woman character fall in love each other. The story is happy ending.Many character point the other man's mistake but they don't know their mistake. They realize that they made a misunderstanding, they begin to know themselves mistake. I think many people make a mistake like the character's mistake. I also the same so I read this novel and realized many things. I presume that maybe the novel teach you many things.The novel show character of realism. Generally realism literary work explain everything in details. 'Pride and Prejudice' is the same. Writer explain everything very detailed so people said that realism literary work is limited people's imagination. I don't agree with that because I think that the more detailed writer describe, the more detailed we image. For example, if the writer describe like that \\"There are a table and chair and a flower vase and so on.\\", I can image like that \\"maybe the table color is black and chair color is same, and.. maybe the flower are rose and forget-me-not. So I think realism literary works can make us more imaginative, just my opinion.I recommend 'Pride and Prejudice'. I'm sure that you'll be intersted in this novel and Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I cannot even hope to do justice to how well written this book is. For the reasons already stated here by others and many more I love this book! I have read it a good 10 times and I never seem to tire of it. Through a stroke of genius that is purely her, Jane Austen has created timeless characters that manage to capture your heart. The witty banter between Darcy and Elizabeth is always engaging and never fails to bring a smile to my face. Read this book. It is a must for everyone."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen, in her novel Pride and Prejudice, contrasts characters through a battle of social conflict. Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman of lively character, strives against an equal adversary, Fitzwilliam Darcy, a man well endowed by fortune. As the two haughtily battle wits, Mr. Darcy falls in love with Elizabeth, further complicating the story's intricate plot; while Elizabeth's sister, Jane, falls for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy's best friend. Mr. Darcy's pride against Elizabeth's social standings and Elizabeth's unfounded prejudice against Mr. Darcy's seemingly snobbish habits form a classic tale of romance and humor.The intricate twists of fate intertwine the lovers in their conquests, defeats, and humbling of character. Mix-ups in the tale create a humorous love story with a relish for varied characters undoubtedly human in their emotions and actions. Austen vividly illustrates contrast in social class during the Regency era while exposing human flaws. Characters such as Mrs. Bennet, Lydia and Mr. Wickham warn the reader of the mishaps caused by characters unscrupulous in their wayward actions. Yet as the story unfolds, one cannot help but fall in love with this tale of a man and a woman beset by emotions they fall victim to."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Although I picked up the book for a 12th grade English class, Jane Austen captivated me with her polished dialogues and intricate descriptions. Pride and Prejudice is more than just a love story between Darcy and Elizabeth, and Bingley and Jane. It is a satire of a society in which money is the driving force behind love and social status means everything. The story is set in England and focuses on the four Bennet daughters, primarily with Elizabeth Bennet, who is the second oldest daughter. She meets Mr. Darcy at a ball and detests his pride. Although he is very rich and quite handsome, she is certain that Darcy thinks he is above his company, and that disgusts her. But although she is drawn to him by hate, the hate turns into love through a series of events and dialogue. Austen uses rich dialogues to form her comedy, and in the end a reader will not only learn that love can conquer all pride and prejudices, but he will also laugh at a society full of arranged marriages and love based on what a spouse could bring to a marriage. This book is a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason. Austen's diction is exquisite, somewhat challenging, but after a few chapters, she has the reader hooked. Although picked up for a 12th grade English class, I know I will pick up it up again and will pick up some of Austen's other books. I would recommend this book to other high schoolers that need to read a classic for school, but also to people of any age looking for an excellent piece of writing."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I like when that what I read is realy interesting. I must say that Jane Austin wrote about life in England in the begining of 19th century. Lots of my friends think that it is'n actual at the moment, but I think it is nesesery to now how live people 200 years ago. I like her books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a wonderful book with a wonderful theme that is a good lesson for everyone to learn. I loved all of the characters and even if I didn't love their actions, I loved the artful description of them. Though in the beginning I really did not like Mr. Darcy, by the end he was one of my favorite characters along with Elizabeth. The ending was great and I was very satisfied with it. It had a great plot and kept me looking forward to the next part. Another great thing about, while it was described wonderfully, it was not confusing and I was able to follow the story the whole way through the book. I also thought that the whole time period back then, though it had many bad aspects like a great rift between the very rich and others, was still a great time period with manners and etiquette that we in this time are lacking. Overall I really loved the book and am looking forward to reading other Jane Austen books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You may have heard that literature is an example of the time and place during which it was written. Pride and Predjudice is such a book. While many think of it as a serious book, it is actually quite humerous. Austen's portrayal of love and marriage is a perfect example of how it should be. From marraige-obsessesed Mrs. Bennett, to the intelligent Lizzy to attractive Fitzwilliam Darcy, the book is a masterpiece! This is one book that I could (and have!) read over and over again. I challenge someone to tire of it! If you are looking for a classic, witty and all around fun book, this is it!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book only very recently. It is truly an excellent piece of literature. It is a story of appearance and reality. The author, Jane Austen, uses extensive and challenging vocabulary. The words flow off the pages. Sometimes, I read the same passage three or four times to fully understand what it was trying to convey. The main character, Mr. Darcy, is extremely proud. He is selfish and rude, until he meets Miss Elizabeth Bennet. But, Miss Bennet is far below his social standing. It is interesting to see how the characters change in the book over time. If you want a challenge, have some time, and love good literature, this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read this book only very recently.

Pride and Prejudice basically was about marriages. In old England, a man who has good fortune must need a good manner and charming wife, and a grown girl who has good education, high manner, a litter beauty must in want of a husband. That is why the whole story happen. In the author Miss Austen's book, she used very decent and nice words, and she described the emotion of the characters truely and let people feel the characters really existed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic, no doubt about it, but why should anyone read it now? Austen's humor and satire are a bit understated in today's world, but for the reader who pays attention to the details and to whitty dialog, should get a kick out of numerous scenes throughout the novel. Another gift that Austen has is being able to portray intense emotions without having to spell those emotions out. I first read this book as a freshman in high school and I didn't finish it until the second attempt. After that I forgot most of what I read and then had to reread it about four years later and now read it every year just to remind myself what a classic book is really like."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've just finished reading this book again for probably the 20th time. The first time I read it was in my early 20s. I was amazed that Elizabeth, the main character, a young woman in her 20s from early 19th century England,was so likeable and full of life. I definitely related to her.Seeing the famous BBC/A&amp;E production in the mid 1990s only increased my joy of this book.Austen was an incredible observer of the manners and mores of her time. This book lets her playfulness and human spirit shine through.This is one title I will never tire of reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is filled with memorable characters and beautifully written prose that deserve applause. I instantly liked it from the first paragraph. Certainly literature that demands a second reading."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is surely the most delicious of Jane Austen's novels. Austen writes with superb insight of the era she was living in!The characters are wonderful - the spirited and rebellious Lizzie Bennett, proud and handsome Darcy, the gloriously silly Mrs Bennett and the ogre that is Lady Catherine de Burgh. If you only ever read one classic novel, then this is the one to read. Follow it with the BBC video version (1995), a glass of wine, a large box of chocs. and curl up on the sofa. Enjoy !!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was forced to read Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; as an assignment in my British Literature class. Though it was not a voluntary thing at first, it soon became one. I could kiss my english teacher for making me read this! I read it in three days, hardly stopped to put it down, it was so engrossing. After reading it I promptly went out and watched the 5 hour A&amp;E movie (Colin Firth is to die for, and it stays truer to the book than any other movie I've seen thus far).Austen's writing style is brilliant and has such a nice, familiar tone that even though she is poking fun at much of society, she was probably quite fond of her characters. Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine, was a wonderful character and is by far one of the most real fictional people I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I love how her relationship with Mr. Darcy changes gradually and his true character is revealed. My only wish is that sequels were in style then and Austen had thought to right one or simply make the book longer.I had to read this book because it is a classic. However, I would recommend this book to everyone, not because it is a classic, but because it is such a beautiful story with 3-dimensional characters who will pull you into a world you will not want to leave."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an amazing, amazing critique and representation of nineteenth century society. All I have to say is wow. This edition, however, is very small print, and definitely not easy on the eye. I am reviewing this one because it was the version that recieved from school. It is so enticing, once i reached about halfway through the book, I couldn't put it down at all. I was delighted with the complexity of the characters and the way in which Jane Austen opens up the thought process of the main character, Elizabeth. This is one of the few classics that deserves the word &quot;classic&quot; to be applied to it. Pride and Prejudice is a must read for anyone, but requires a substantial amount of thought and maturity.

This is by far the best story i have ever read in my short life. This woman is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and this novel got me hooked. I was so detirmined to finish it that i stayed up all night long reading. I could not wait to see what was ever to become of Elizabeth and Darcy. I started reading it as an assignment for my 9th grade honors english class one week ago and was kicking myself at the end of the book for not reading it on my own. I have now started Sense and Sensibility but I am sure that nothing could be as good as Pride and Prejudice. If anyone hasnt read this you are missing out on a great story. I have yet to see the mini series but i plan on borrowing it from my teacher. I urge everyone to experience Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book was recommened to me and I did not think that I would enjoy it, but I started reading it anyway. The book drew me in adn I could not put it down. The characters are all so charming. Elizabeth Bennet is by far my favorite character. She is very admirable, witty, smart, well informed and always polite. She was always more concerned with her sister's love life then with her own. This brings us to another character, Jane Bennet. Jane is the prettiest in the Bennet family and her mother's favorite child. Her relationship with Mr. Bingley, the new neighbor, is the talk of the town. Their relationship is referred to a lot in the book, but the novel focused mostly on Elizabeth and her relationship with Mr. Darcy. This is waht kept me interested in the book. The story line is romatnic and kept me guessing as to what was going to happen next. The question throughout the novel is if anything will happen between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic story lines."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austin truly brings out the reality of courting and marraige of nineteenth century England.

The book was realistic and I thought the eighteenth century English language to be fully enchanting. I think my most favorite parts were when Elizabeth refuses to marry Mr.Collins, her cousin (YUCK!), and her discussion with Lady Catherine deBourgh!

Those who haven't read it yet: get it"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I always feel unworthy to review anything classical, or that even written a long time ago, for the simple fact it is not my place to critise the masters of the written work, or to even begin to understand what it was like to live in that era. Therefore, I am left without an option but to base a review on the level of my enjoyment, which is no reflection of how great the novel is written or what a classical piece of artistry it may be. I cannot give this novel 5 stars because I truely found my attentiion wavering, and I felt thankful that the book, which seemed drawn out to me, was closing to end. It is undoubtably a classic storyline, the 'prejudice' of Mr Darcy, the love developing between the unlikely, but I had seen the movie, and generally knew the storyline, but felt to fully apperciate this story, I must have read it. Maybe that contributed to the sense of boredom that came with this novel to a degree, particularly whilst it was winter (in the novel) and Mr Darcy and Jane's friend were out of town. I got sick of the letters in the book, and began to think about other things while reading them, increasing the time it took me to read it. Sadly, I think with a increased patience, I could have really liked this novel, but I just was thankful I had finished it. I am sorry to burst any 'Pride and Prejudice loving' bubbles, just telling it how I saw it. Then again, I don't really know that much about the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I liked this book, because it describes a situation that isn't weird. It could really have happened. I was surprised that I liked this book, because classic books are mainly boring, because of the fact that things happen very slowly. In Pride and Prejudice things didn't happened quickly but the book kept your attention.Melissa Nuis"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There seems to be a tendency to interpret the works of Jane Austen in political terms (Jane Austen and the State, Jane Austen and the French Revolution) which overlooks the question of gender and class conventions in Austen's novels, which go to establish the comic tone they bear so well. The critical introductions for Pride and Prejudice in both World's Oxford Classics and Penguin, by Isobel Armstrong and Vivien Jones respectively, do follow this trend and tend to overlook the rigours of feminist criticism, as appeared in Marilyn Butler's Jane Austen and the War of Ideas. As a post-revolutionary romance, Pride and Prejudice provides a reflection of political events, but this theme is only secondary to the critique of class and gender conventions, and which is only indirectly related to political conditions.The use of silence, or the withholding of information, as a narrative strategie to produce the complications in the plot that go to make up the story, follows from this indirect association. Another important theme in the novel is the difference between public and private space. The exchanges of information (gossip, if you may) between the characters, particularly between Elizabeth and her relatives and friends, reveal a society in which individual worth and reputation is decided by rumour. When rumour is too strong, this is, shared by many, it may not be worth one's while to attempt to change it even if it is found to be false. It is for this reason that Wickham is allowed to fulfil his mania for elopement and achieve a suitable marriage.It is no surprise that a society so concerned with opinion should be given to prejudice, this is, the conversion of uninformed unfavourable opinion into a general judgement. Prejudice is by no means to be seen as a privilege of the aristocratic class. The community at Longbourn are seen to be equally capable of misjudging and misrepresenting character, in particular Mr Darcy's.Elizabeth's one aristocratic feature in her character is her general dissatisfaction with everything she sees. Her critical gaze links her to the aristocratic crew that she meets and alienates her from her surroundings. But if she wants to become one with Darcy's \\"family party\\" it is precisely this quality that she is to tame. By looking at Pemberley's grounds, she learns to express her own (sensuous) satisfaction with things as they are.Elizabeth's sensual gaze has been educated through the novel in a process of humiliation and denial. It is when she accepts the humbling experience of Charlotte's wedding and goes to visit the Collins' that she learns to appreciate the stately fixity of Rosings and starts to give the appropriate steps to becoming Darcy's consort.In the words of Isobel Armstrong in the Oxford World's Classics \\"Introduction\\": \\"it is through the uncomfortable limits of sexual signals that the novel indirectly explores a deep political question: when is it right to conceal or to reveal information; when isit right to speak out?\\" Nevertheless, this question is in the novel less political than gender and class- based.\\"Female elegance\\", according to Mr Collins, consists in \\"rejecting a man on the first application\\". Affectation is taken for granted among women, which poses a problem for women who, like Elizabeth, wish to decline a proposal in spite of their economic need. Twenty years had scarcely passed after the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's Vindication of the Rights of Women, and it is characteristic of the peculiar genius of Jane Austen that she had already produced the first post-feminist heroine, a woman capable of turning the issue of marriage into an unselfish and pleasurable conquest - unselfish, because by marrying Darcy Elizabeth establishes her family socially, and pleasurable, because in accepting the stately home of Pemberley she fully reconciles herself to the sensuousness of life -."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book has well earned it's reputation as wonderful, but I would be much more inclined to place it in the romance section of the library than alongside Civil Disobedience and Wuthering Heights. Hold on, don't turn red just yet. My reasoning is such: this book was well thought out, much considered and had a depth of plot and characterization that I thought was approaching immaculate. The title was appropriate: this book is about pride and prejudice IN RELATION TO HAPPINESS, and only that. Austen dosn't go farther; she dosn't explore the depths beyond treading the seashore of what COULD HAVE been. We were only allowed to \\"dip our toe in the slough\\" for forty or fifty pages, until pride was rebuked, the truth was told and love recovered. Something more is required of a book than following the realms of happiness. \\"Suffering - perhaps that hasn't been properly looked at.\\" A classic must give something more, but this was a wonderful, heartfelt read! Put it between sessions of Bronte and Dostoevsky!For those who have read W & P and Pride and Prejudice: Tolstoy killed Andrei - Austen should have killed Darcy!

I wish it was either more boring or more feminist. It was so witty and well-written that I couldn't put it down. But I felt uncomfortable with the underlying assumption that a woman's ultimate fulfillment is to marry a rich and gorgeous man. Of course it has very strong female characters, and was a very progressive novel for its time. The fact that it is still so popular makes me wonder how far we have come. I preferred Eliot's Middlemarch - a similar type of novel with a more balanced view of female ambition, morality and emotion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was difficult for me to read. The main drawback is the English (the real English they use in England) or maybe it's my lack of sophistication. The story of five daughters, seems like something for a teenage girl. There always seemed to be gossip and people really concerned about how others saw them. Maybe that's what makes Liz the main character standout.

I didn't find any of the characters particularly interesting or the writing style very engaging; in fact, this was one of the few books I had to force myself to finish. All the characters were very pretentious, only caring about how you looked and what family you belonged to.

It was annoying to have such a thing, but it was free & didnt make me love the story any less."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of my favorite Authors of all time if your looking for a classical romance this is a must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"So...what to say about this. Well, it surely is a girly book since the majority of the story is about romance. There are also themes of family, marriage, society, class, etc. The story was pretty good but boring in some parts. However, the ending really left me wanting a sequel. It made me want to know about *spoiler* the life after Elizabeth and Darcy's marriage. I also wanted to know how Darcy's sister will turn out and if she will also find her fated one. Mr. and Mrs. Bennet's situation in life is also greatly altered. It would have been interesting to see how they will get along and if there would be any rekindling of past fires or not. The two unmarried sisters can also be a topic of exploration, especially Kitty seeing as to how civil and improved she's becoming. I will miss Elizabeth and Darcy's witty conversations and I would have been delighted to read about a jealous Darcy. A sequel would have been perfect. Seriously, it would have been fun to read about their life after marriage and if they were going to have any kids or not. Then maybe there would be someone new in town who would intimidate Darcy and fight for Elizabeth's affection, which of course, can only belong to Darcy. Ohh! The possibilities are endless! How I wish for a sequel. Before anyone else writes one though, I will have to be satisfied with my imagination. I am aware of the fanfiction sequels out there, but there will never be a true sequel to this book. I'm also curious as to whether Elizabeth would conform to the upper class or not. Wonders if she improves her piano and other skills like the arts. And their kids.....would they be more like Elizabeth or Darcy? Hmm...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had borrowed this CD set from my local library, and the narration by Nadia May is so wonderful, I had to buy a copy for myself.

And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle.

Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is said that a good work of fiction represents the ways and manners of the people during the period when it was written. Being the case, I have a number of observations:1. The conversations feel that the parties involved are having an oratorical debate. It was an art in itself. Obviously, nobody speaks this way anymore. The language was so lyrical, very personally addressed, either face to face or through a proper letter.2. It was a time when ladies were expected (as dictated by good manners, decorum and propriety) to have knowledge of the arts and music. In contrast to the present time, parents and elders lovingly cultivate/develop the natural talents of their children. For those with no natural inclination, it is openly accepted as such, and never forced. At least this is what I have observed in general.3. It is a good thing that women of the present time share an equal footing with men (at least in many parts of the world), that they are not just relegated to marriage when they become of age. Imagine being set for marriage the moment a girl turns 16, with the mother almost in panic if her daughter is not engaged by the time she's twenty!4. What a closed and judgmental society it was during that time. The elopement of one daughter to an \\"undeserving\\" man ruined not only her reputation but that of her whole family as well, in the process making her other sisters almost unfit for marriage.5. Fifty miles of good road equals half a day's journey by carriage! Thank God for the automobile!I enjoyed this novel a lot, though it took some time for me to read because of the lyrical prose, which I am not so used to, and also the typos. Just the same, lyrical prose and all, it brought about the same excited feelings as when I read modern chick-lit fiction. I would have rated this a complete 5-star if not for the many typos in the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful).

I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf.

The characters are beautifully crafted and the relationships they form complex. The novel remains an important social and historical commentary. It is an easy and charming book to read for young adults and rich and complex for those who want to re-read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen is one of the great masters of the English language, and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is her great masterpiece, a sharp and witty comedy of manners played out in early 19th Century English society, a world in which men held virtually all the power and women were required to negotiate mine-fields of social status, respectability, wealth, love, and sex in order to marry both to their own liking and to the advantage of their family. And such is particularly the case of the Bennetts, a family of daughters whose father's estate is entailed to a distant relative, for upon Mr. Bennett's death they will lose home, land, income, everything. But are the Bennett daughters up to playing a winning hand in this high-stakes matrimonial game without forfeiting their own personal integrity?This battle of the sexes is largely seen through the eyes of second daughter Elizabeth, who possesses a razor-sharp wit and rich sense of humor--and who finds herself hindered by her own addlepated mother, her sister Jane's hopeless love for the wealthy Mr. Bingley, and her sister Lydia's penchant for scandal... not to mention the high-born, formidable, and outrageously proud Mr. Darcy, who seems determined to trump her every card. But the game of love proves more surprising than either Elizabeth or Mr. Darcy can imagine, and sometimes a seemingly weak hand proves a winning one when all cards are on the table.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is simply one of the funniest novels ever written, peopled with memorable characters brought vividly to life as they both succeed and fail at the game of life according to the manners of their era. It is a novel to which I return again and again, enjoying Austen's brillant talent. I have little respect for people who describe it as dull, slow, out of date, for as long as men and women live and fall in love it will never be out of style, always be meaningful, and always be funny. A masterpiece of wit and style; a timeless novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"One of the versions listed is published by \\"General Books LLC.\\" Another reader complained about the tiny and almost unreadable font - you probably bought the version published by General Books LLC - and here's the reason.General Books LLC is an imprint of VDM Publishing, (google them and take a look at the Wikipedia article on them) and they specialise in publishing books that are free of copyright without doing any editing or quality control.

Whether you're the hopeless romantic or you just love the classics, you're going to love this book. Though I am only sixteen, I consider myself to be moderately well-read. I love reading, and, when I am between books, my life feels desolate and empty. One day, while in the most barren pit of ennui, I picked up Pride and Prejudice at my mother's recommendation. I do not ordinarily like my mother's taste in reading; her favorite books tend to be very dull, but so deep was my boredom that I succumbed to her suggestion. I wasn't displeased with what I found. I fell in love with the book at the first sentence. I brought my beloved book to the dinner table, to my classes and late into the night. I love everything about it. I love the characters; especially Elizabeth Bennet! I love the Victorian vernavular which works so well for this particular novel. I love the scintillating plot and the suspense created by knowing that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy should be together but their pride and prejudice (hence the title) are temporarily keeping them apart. The language that the novel is written in might be a little more difficult to read than contemporary literature, but once one gets accustomed to it, it makes the novel even more pleasurable. I cannot imagine Elizabeth or Darcy or Bingley or any of the other characters speaking any less eloquently; it would ruin the whole experience! The flowery language completes the whole effect of reading a Jane Austen novel. If a disgruntled female reader put down Pride and Prejudice, pick it back up! I strongly suggest it because it may prove to be tedious at first but if read again, it would probably read more easily. I can offer no suggestions to the male reader, however, because generally this book, in ever essence, is a female novel. I am not saying that men would definetly not enjoy it; I'm simply saying that I have yet to meet any male who has not addressed this book in a very vehement manner. I simply love this book in its entirety, and I know it won't be too long before I pick it up again. Jane Austen surely knew what she was doing when she wrote this one! Her Pride and Prejudice will always have an honored spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am really enjoying this book. I won't comment on it from a literary sense.

Every so often the author has emphazied a word and it shows in the Kindle as all upper case. I supposed it was supposed to be italics. A similar situation occurred in the Complete Sherlock Holmes. Certain symbols are not translated properly. The intent was still obvious. I was very reluctant to buy a Kindle at first, but I have used up all the available space in my home for paper books. The Kindle is a joy to read though and it goes very fast."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a most amusing and entertaining love story which has ever written that shows human limitations at its best. The title of the book is indeed well-named for pride and prejudice are the essence of the whole book. Pride of the hero Mr. Darcy and prejudice of the heroine Elizabeth Bennet combined to reveal what kind of character a person can be, regardless of his/her financial situation and social stature.British society under the Regency rule was exemplified and made explicit to generations of readers. The author was telling us about the everyday life of people living in rural England after the Napoleonic Wars, and Britain was on its way to become a maritime power in the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution of Charles Dickens' days had not yet arrived to upset the power of the English nobility and the landed gentry, so much so that gentlemen like Mr. Darcy, a landowner of vast estates, could live a life of luxury and self-importance, and could easily look down on the less fortunate who had to work for a living.Reading Jane Austen's work is always a pleasure. It puts me in with the characters, as if I were an unseen and unknown observer in the room! In fact, I feel that I am living in the early 1800s, doing the same things that those characters are doing, and feeling just as they are feeling."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classics come to life under good audio treatment, as Irene Sutcliffe demonstrates by reading Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE with passion and style.

The details that Jane Austen injects in her story tellings paints a vivid picture of the era in which the story in told.

Jane Austen uses impeccable, meticulous language full of long descriptions and explanations to give the reader insight into the minds of all the characters. The character development indicates the author's striking understanding of human nature and acute observation of human tendencies. The story provides an intricate plot involving the intertwining lives and feelings of a few characters and is based more on character development than on actual events. Although the book is complex and somewhat wordy, it is interesting and not all that difficult to read. The story shows how individual tendencies and personalities can get in the way of love and happiness. It also adeptly portrays inter-family relationships and the profound impact they can have. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in classic fiction, or who enjoys stories about people and their relationships with one another."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Honestly folks, did you really enjoy reading this book? After paragraph after paragraph of needless description and rhetoric, one must scrounge up what's left inside their brain after it being destroyed by Jane Austen's pointless circumlocution to dig up what was actually said in modern English.

I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved. Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed? It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for. I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?I'm not sure if I will be reading another.Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I purchased this recording (read by Lindsay Duncan) through the iTunes store (something I will not be doing again), on the understanding that it was an unabridged recording.

Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of reviews of this book, I somehow feel it important to share my thoughts. This is one of my favorite books of all time, though I came to it very late in life. During my 5th reading of it, I started musing over why this book had such an incredible impact on me. I finally figured it out. This book and almost of all Austen's other brilliant novels speak to me about the life-altering possibilities of love. This reality was completely integral to the lives of women in the 18th and 19th century. If you were a woman, your fate -- whether you became a wife, a mother, a mistress of a fine home or stayed at home the rest of your days taking care of your parents -- was completely determined by a man choosing you. But this idea, even in our times in which women actually have options and power to change their lives, is highly compelling. These books -- these characters -- capture the feeling that everyone who has every fallen in love has that in one instant their lives, if joined with another, will be changed forever and exponentially and in ways they cannot even imagine. It is that feeling of possibility that Jane Austen has put into words, and why, I believe, her books are still as influencial as they were 2 hundred years ago."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had heard good thungs about this book from my school friends and heard great praise from my librarian the day I checked it out. I had always wanted to read a Jane Austen novel and this was my first. I had completley fell in love with it when I was stuck inside, at home, on three snowy days and could not put it down. I immediately began seeking other Austen books, but this one stuck in my mind. I have read this, Persuasion, Lady Susan, and have seen the Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion movies. I have yet to see Pride and Prejidice, but I am looking forward to it.Pride and Prejudice's main character, Elizabeth Bennet, is strong-willed, intelligent, and witty. She makes snap judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudices. She is the second youngest of five sisters and no brothers and is the favorite of her father.The eldest, virtuous Jane, is her favorite who rarely sees the wrong in anybody. Jane is considered the handsomest sister. The middle child, Mary, is principled and only lives to improve her accomplishments. The next is timid Catherine, or Kitty, who is followed by exasperating Lydia. Lydia is silly and, if you have ever read Persuasion, like the Musgroves. She is cheerful and a flirt going after the soldiers' and fancying herself always in love. Her mother is hopelessly silly and her father is sardonic. They meet this man, Mr. Charles Bingley, who is considered very rich that just moved into the neighborhood. He is a perfectly wonderful man who fell in love with a Bennet. His friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, his name even convinces us that he possesses arrogant pride, is even more rich than Mr. Bingley but is disliked by the shole neighborhood.\\"It is a truth universally acknowlegded that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\\", the first sentance of the book, states a theme of the novel. Marraige is talked of often in the book. Elizabeth meets both Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy and judges their characters. One she likes and one she doesn't. You can probably guess. But is her first immpression of Mr. Darcy wrong?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you don't fall in love with Elizabeth Bennet and her existentially endearing family, well, your heart must be made of stone.Jane Austen's best heroine is at the center of this romance that is so strong and true that it can be mined by the film industry - with good, better and best adaptations - and still manage to stand on its own pinnacle of imaginative wonder.Pay attention to Elizabeth's words--I feel that she is most often voicing the thoughts of Jane Austen. There are many occasions where Elizabeth's character shines through. She is a complicated person, and did you notice, at the center, she combines aspects of all the other Bennet sisters in herself. It is as if Jane said, \\"Let us show in the sisters, what having one or the other trait, without a balance, might look like.\\"Elizabeth is multi-layerd.What can we say of Mr. Darcy except that he is Jane Austen's ideal man. He may not be your ideal man, but there are a lot of other men with other traits to choose from in the book, so plenty of variety, there. And, we admit, Darcy comes close to disappointing at several key moments in the narrative; he is allowed to keep his own counsel to such a degree that this fine quality almost becomes his personal tragedy. Isn't it funny how our best qualities can sometimes do that to us?Also, pay attention to Elizabeth's relationship with Mr. Bennet. Parents are not supposed to have favorites, are they? Yet, in a household of all daughters, you find that the two of them have a bond of love and sympathy that is endearing even when Mr. Bennet seems to be kidding, unobservant or flippant. He comes close to being the omniscient observer, yet, like Darcy, keeps his own counsel.Mmmm. Perhaps this has something to do with how Elizabeth is able to find and appreciate in Darcy qualities she has already admired in someone else...?Darcy is so well off that the reader is tempted to wonder whether Elizabeth has the qualities worthy of a Mr. Darcy. This may be why we have the interchanges with Lady Catherine de Bourgh. There is strength of character and nobility in both women, and we get an idea that in her youth, Lady Catherine may have been much like Elizabeth. We might even push the matter to suggest that in her old age, Elizabeth could possibly become as imposing as Lady Catherine. Or perhaps not, since there is so much of love and tenderness in her.I have tried to say all of this without giving any of the fabulous twists and turns of the plot away.Replete with bon mots, tender and surprising scenes, and characters that even when they are at their worst, are deeply loved by their creator - and us - this book deserves every paean of praise that comes its way.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read \\"pride and Prejudic\\" by Jane Austen a total of 5 times now, and it just gets better every time. This book is definately a classic. The characters are witty, and the story is timeless. \\"Pride and Prujudice\\" is an interesting love story involving a very proud man named Mr. Darcy, and stubborn beauty named Elizabeth Bennet. Together they create a conflict so strong that at one point, neither wants anything to do with the other. But their love for each other is undeniable, once they both get over their pride, and yes, prejudice against one another. They arent the only love story in this classic novel, however. Also fighting for love is Elizabeth's gentle, kindly older sister Jane. She has fallen for the very rich, handsome Mr. Bingly, and it is as if he is under a spell of her charm. Though his sisters try to tear them apart, they somehow find each other again before its too late. Still the question of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's love for each other remains, will they ever give way to their love for each other? Or will pride and strong will keep them from eternal happiness? Only time(and lots of page turning) will tell. This is one of few books that has kept my interrest and i hope it can keep yours too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel. After getting a list of books to read from my teacher, my dad said this would be the perfect one for me. I was slow to begin, but once I got started, I was quickly consumed. It had everything a great story should have. This book reminded me of a Danielle Steal novel, but written much better, and surely not a beach read. It took time and effort to complete, but in the end, the novel was worth the hard work. This book taught me a lot about myself. Even more than that, a lot about who I want to be. When I finished reading and discussed this book with my dad, I told him that I wanted to be Elizabeth Bennet. She was a great protagonist to watch grow throughout the novel. She was a very round character, who was revealed in pieces, not showing the true whole self until the end. It was amazing for me to see how much I could relate to a story written so many years ago. I feel now like the times have truly not change much. Love is still love, loss is still loss, and friends are still friends. This novel was a true untimely classic. Although this story is about love, it is not all good times. It takes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy a long time before they become lovers. There are twists, turns, broken hearts, and shy wit along the way. This book was one of the first that made me both laugh and cry. I came out of reading this book with a slightly different outlook on life as I had before I began. At some points I wanted to just jump into the novel, rearrange some things, and come back out. It was so important to me for everyone in the novel to be happy, and everything to work out as I had it planned. The literary value of this work in unbelievable. As young as I am, and even though I have not read that many classics yet, I can tell you that this one is worth it. My favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of the beautiful rolling hills, the wonderfully decorated rooms, and the people. Austen must have had an amazing picture in her head when creating this work! She truly moved me! This literary work was enchanting. As great as the novel was, there were some downsides you should know before picking it up. Although beautiful, the language was difficult to understand sometimes, for me at least. It was spoken in strong 18th century English, and not always easy to comprehend. This novel takes you winding through the souls of two people, both filled with pride and prejudices, hence the novels title. The long journey to love, is far, and difficult, but in the end true love prevails."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Do not waste your money on this! I thought i would get a book that looks like the original 1813 edition (ie., a scanned version of an original 1813 edition) but it looks like someone just typed the original version into word. There is absolutely no difference between this edition and the free version or any other version of Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The \\"Enriched\\" Pride and Prejudice sits somewhere between the Penguin Classics editions, with introduction and endnotes, and the more comprehensive and scholarly-minded Norton Critical editions.

This, of course, can be amended by manaualy adding a bookmark when you reach each chapter.You can think of this enriched P&P; as a general reader's Norton edition. Or as a Warner Bros.

The well-set text and the supplements and notes provide a much needed added value in these times of freely available e-books of classic literature.... as for the novel. Jane Austen rocks, baby!note: somebody at amazon made a mistake, and the cover that appears up there is from the Oxford Classics edition."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time. ThePride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen has been made into several movies, and remained apart of High School reading lists for decades. It is a heart warming book that discusses family dynamics, true love, money, social order, first impressions and reputation.The story is told primarily in dialogue. This is perhaps why it has been able to be adapted into several movies. It is the story of the Bennet family and their romantic entanglements. Jane Bennet and her relationship with Mr. Bingley, as well as Eizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. The interactions between Miss Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are simply priceless. The famous proposal scene, and the line, \\"You are the last man in the world I could ever marry!\\" make this book an absolute gem.The only flaw with this book is the under developed characters. Only Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through changes. Even though the characters are under developed they are unforgettable. From Lady Catherine to Mr. Collins they are all very different. Read this book you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of those novels which most people know the plot and the characters even if they haven't read the book. For myself, I had not read it in a long time, and I had also not seen any of the movies made using its plot, with the exception of the musical \\"Bride and Prejudice\\" a few years ago. I finally made time for it, and it was better than I had remembered. This was the second of Austen's novels to be published (published on January 28th, 1813), though the original novel (titled \\"First Impressions\\") was written between 1796 and 1797. There is no way to determine how much of the original novel remains and how much was rewritten, but clearly the two dealt on a larger scale with the some of the same themes.The main character of the story is Elizabeth Bennet who lives with her parents and her four sisters in the fictional town of Meryton. Elizabeth is the second eldest of the sisters after Jane. Outside of the Bennets, there is a large cast of characters including the three Bingley's, brother and two sisters, Mr. Collins, The Darcy's, Lady Catherine and her daughter, Colonel Fitzwilliam, the Lucases, Mr. Wickham, and the Gardiner's who are Elizabeth's aunt and uncle. The novel is told in three volumes, the first covers the period at Meryton where most of the key characters meet for the first time, the second covers the period after Bingley leaves Meryton unexpectedly along with those who came with him, and covers the period up to Elizabeth's visit to Mr. Darcy's home know as Pemberley, and the last covers the visit to Pemberley right through to the marriages and beyond.There are several plots running through the volumes. There is the relationship between Bingley and Jane, which Mr. Darcy tries to put an end to, along with the help of Mr. Bingley's sisters. There is Mr. Collins attempts to marry either Jane or Elizabeth, but ending up with Charlotte Lucas. There is the relationship between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy as well as between their families. There is Lydia's scandalous running off in volume three. But by far the mail story line is the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.In volume one, Mr. Darcy arrives as the guest of Mr. Bingley. Mr. Darcy's prideful manner results in a negative first impression with Elizabeth whose pride is hurt by his attitude and she develops her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy as a result. Mr. Darcy becomes intrigued with Elizabeth, but her own negative impression of him is reinforced by stories told by Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy's silent attitude towards her which she takes as his looking down on her. Thus, first impressions play a big role in the story, though to be sure other first impressions, such as the first impression of Mr. Collins which is shared by nearly everyone are fairly accurate.In volume two, their relationship develops. Mr. Darcy cannot ignore the feelings he has developed for Elizabeth and this results in three key events in this volume. One is Mr. Darcy's declaration of feelings to Elizabeth. The second is Elizabeth's stern rebuke of Mr. Darcy's feelings followed by an attack on his behavior towards the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley as well as Mr. Darcy's treatment of Mr. Wickham. This leads to the third key event, which is Mr. Darcy's letter to Elizabeth where he sets the matter straight about his actions. The second event results in Mr. Darcy writing the letter and changing his behavior, though we don't witness the latter until volume three. The third event is important as the reader is privy to Elizabeth's change in attitude resulting from what Mr. Darcy has told her.In volume three, their relationship completes its change, as Elizabeth gets to know Mr. Darcy from where he lives, and by those who work for him, and she also learns about his character from actions he takes on behalf of her family, which he never means her to learn about. We also witness the change in Mr. Darcy's behavior, not only towards Jane, but towards her entire family. Of course, it is obvious that the two will end up together, but knowing the end does not spoil the journey.There is good reason why this book is a classic and why it is still read and enjoyed today. The characters are believable and well rounded for the most part. There is humor, societal and family challenges, and moral lessons weaved together throughout the book. I can also recommend the Penguin Classics edition of this book, as it contains an introduction and notes by Vivien Jones, as well as an introduction written by Tony Tanner for an earlier edition of the book. The introductions are both interesting reading, and the notes are useful as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The Book:Dover Publications does it again. This has to be the ultimate reasonably-priced edition of Pride and Prejudice you could ever get your hands on. Don't be fooled by the image of the stuffy dust cover; underneath the beige paper is a red cloth-bound, gold-printed cover which would enhance the finest library. The endpapers are embossed with a floral design, which is a lovely touch.This is a republication of an 1894 edition, in which the typography is perfect - that is, there are fewer words to a page making it easy on the eyes, while your progress through the book goes rapidly through its 476 pages.

Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This novel begins with one of the most recognizable lines in literary history: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" With that begins, perhaps, the most copied plot-line in human history. Sisters Elizabeth and Jane Bennett are of a marrying age. When a handsome and wealthy young man comes to stay in their neighborhood, the Bennetts waste little time making his acquaintance. It turns out the handsome newcomer, Charles Bingley, is a fine and friendly gentleman and he has a liking for Jane.Mr. Bingley's cohort, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is, however, not nearly so friendly. Cold and formal, he quickly incurs the dislike of Elizabeth. Mr. Darcy, though, appears somewhat taken by Elizabeth and makes some half-hearted advances. Despite his great wealth, Elizabeth distaste grows the more she learns of Mr. Darcy's past.Just as the relationship between Jane and Mr. Bingley appears set for matrimony, Mr. Bingley suddenly leaves the neighborhood. Certainly, it seems, this is the doing of Mr. Darcy. Jane's hopes dashed and Elizabeth finding only comically unsuitable suitors, the Bennett sisters are headed for old-maidom. That is, unless the terrible events are due to improper pride and/or prejudice.Though I am not a great Jane Austen admirer and find much of her writing overly ornamental and preoccupied with unimportant subject matter, there is no disputing the greatness of this novel. The language usage is clearly Austenesque, but this book is nevertheless genuinely a page turner. Moreover, the tone is pitch perfect - touching the emotions, but maintaining an appealing comic feel. I found myself delighted to be in the company of Jane Austen who, though her writing is over two centuries old and her experiences obviously much different from ours, has a surprisingly modern voice.Even more importantly, this book is an invaluable cultural gift. Though perhaps not in the same league as the Bible or some of Shakespeare's works, the influence of Pride and Prejudice on our culture is simply vast. Familiarizing yourself with Pride and Prejudice will make literally hundreds of cultural products more comprehensible (or reveal them to be unoriginal). The plot-line alone has spawned countless imitations, slight modifications and commentaries. The characters, especially Elizabeth and Darcy, have become veritable archetypes. This is one of those stories that you are already familiar with through its imitators. None, however, has done the material so well and so thoughtfully as Ms. Austen.Even if you don't have the stomach for Ms. Austen's other material, this novel is worth reading. It's both good for you and an enjoyable read - often a tough mix to find."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Never fear this is not a novelization.

If I could write well enough to do the book justice, I wouldn't be a programmer, but I can say that it satisfies my craving for &quot;romantic slop&quot; without being in the least sloppy, and it entertains with both low comedy and keen perception. But my favorite feature of the book is what I've heard described as the &quot;comic precision&quot; of the speech of the characters. It would take a week of polishing to utter a single such phrase, and the idea of a group of people bantering effortlessly in this manner fills me with delight. And to the high school kid that said it wasn't &quot;profound&quot; enough: I might have said the same thing 25 years ago, but now the books that I thought profound then seem obvious, tedious, and/or pompous.

I also think Elizabeth is great heroin. the only thing I didn't like about the book is that the famly is so worried about the father dying and he doesn't even die. So what was the use of worrying. I also feel that Jane Austen was a great author and really wrote what womwn felt during the time when very few women wrote. What do men know what women feel. What gave men the right to write when they don't even know what women felt during that time. But I feel now that women and men are egual.

Anyone who likes upper class, sappy, drawn out scenes of lovers trying to get each others attention can read this book and be enthralled.

I put it down at about page 100. From a fan of IMMANUEL KANT, this was too boring. Honestly, after I put it down, I had to study the Diamond Sutra and the Book of Job to get the vapid feeling out of my head. Someone on here wrote something to the effect of \\"as Blake saw the world in a grain of sand, so did Austen see the world in a drawing room\\". To this, I'd say that there is a vast difference in seeing the world in a drawing room, and thinking that the world IS a drawing room.Basically, it felt way too narrow for me. I will admit that I dislike British culture, as a whole, and have yet to make it through a third Dickens novel (have tried four).

The plot concerns a mother, Mrs. Bennet whose sole purpose in life is to see her daughters married. That's it. End of story and yet Ms. Austin takes several hundred pages to repeat this Theme Ad Nauseam.One has to remember that this book was written in a time when the only four things to do at night were get drunk, sleep, read or make love and some people did all 4 of these things in one lonely night!!!Ms. Austin takes full advantage of this and decides she has a story worth telling which is without plot, believable characters or any hint of suspense or excitement.

Most previous reviewers have considered only prejudice itself to be the theme of this book, but I am convinced that this was not all of Miss Austin's theme (though it was a major part of it), but rather she was also showing the folly of judging people by our first impressions of them. Elizabeth (the main character), judged Mr. Darcy by her first impression of him (which was bad). She let her opinion of him be decided by this first impression, thus she was prejudiced against him. I think most people tend to focus on the prejudice and pass over the step that leads to it. Also, the same thing happens with Mr. Wickham. She lets her first impression of him (which was good) guide her opinion of him, which later turned out to be completely wrong, just as she had been about Mr. Darcy.Now, do not mistake me, prejudice is a major part of this book, but I think it is important to note that Miss Austin is not just showing us the effects and foolishness of prejudice, but even deeper, she is showing the precursor to prejudice, which is (in many cases) judging by first impressions.As for the form of this book, I thought it was very well written. There was no action whatsoever, unless you include going for a walk in your definition of action. I found it incredible that Miss Austin was able to write in such a way as to keep one's attention for hundreds of pages while including (almost) nothing but dialogue and very minor events.I also loved the believableness of her characters. Almost every character strongly reminded me of someone I knew, they were so like real people, which is very rare in novels, especially in Miss Austin's era. I think that Mr. Bennet quickly became one of my favorite fictional characters with his wit and dry humor, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were very good characters as well. Mrs. Bennet was, as I suppose was Miss Austin's intention, very annoying and frustrating, even to the reader. Somehow the characters in this book were just more \\"real\\" than they are in most books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful book. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. A review in here got me thinking though. They said there is no such thing as books that are better than others because it's all subjective. This person is wrong, simple as that. Certain books are not literary towers because people have said &quot;wow! amazing!&quot; people say that about Harry Potter! I mean really! What distinguishes a book and makes it &quot;better&quot; than others, is if it's around in fifty, one hundred years. Pride and Prejudice has done this. It is &quot;better&quot; than other books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I admired Darcy the first time I read this book at the age of 12 and yet now again at the age of 31 after having reread this book, I find myself surprised to experience the same feeling.Yes, he is pretty disagreeable in the beginning, but then I find people who don't intend to impress everyone to be more honest in the long run. Darcy's character grows on one as one goes forward in the story.As for Elisabeth, she matures remarkably, in general I find the book very realistic , we are all full of pride and prejudice when we meet people and they prevent us from seeing many of their more valuable qualities."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can still remember the act of reading this book, during a rather blase summer vaction in the middle of my college years. It inspired me greatly, maybe because I identified with Darcy, and thought that I could be a hero, too. For whatever reason, I enjoyed it thorougly."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A MUST READ for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Austen is a wonderful omniscient author and has a delightful perspective on people's traits and character. She realized that people are complex, and included their different sides in these characters. It's a feel good book, and we need those once in a while. Its like a mature fairy tale. This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"I\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\" This is the opening that initiated the whole story with a click, that not only addressed the theme of this book, but also of a \\"universally acknowledged\\" truth.In my long search for a literary classic that I could both enjoy reading as well as get something out of, I finally ended up with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", by Jane Austen. Upon reading the first sentence of this book, I was immediately captured by the story liveliness and soon found myself hooked. In addition to the lively, vivid tone of the book, what enchanted me the most was the seamless way in which each character behaviors and interactions were so carefully woven together in an intricate plot.Some characters that appear in the book are:- Mr. Bennet, a brilliant, sarcastic man who likes to ridicule the silliness of his wife- Mrs. Bennet, a middle aged woman who is eager to marry her daughters off to rich and prosperous families when they come of age- Their five daughters:- Jane, who, being the eldest, believes in human good and righteousness in all human beings,- Mary, their third child, who is always absorbed in books thinking about this and that- The shy Catherine, also known as Kitty, who always followed her flirtatious younger sister, Lydia around in flirting with officers.However, all the characters and indeed the whole story revolves around Miss. Elizabeth Bennet the second oldest sister, a witty, headstrong girl, and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, a very queer, shy man. At first sight, Elizabeth's assumption and observation towards Mr. Darcy pride made her prejudiced against him. Yet in the end an unexpected twist ends this book in a very satisfactory manner.Although many readers especially teenagers might be \\"prejudiced\\" against reading the old \\"classics\\", I found this book to be quite interesting. This book gave me an insight on the thoughts of the people during that time period, and some hints how they were suppress or discriminated by the class system."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Like others, I came to this novel after years of it being pushed upon me like a drug. \\"Read it, you'll love it!\\" It took several starts and a snowy winter far from home to finally render the book's period drama understandable. As a student and fan of women's history, I was initially drawn in not by the plot of the story (though it is what soon carries you through to the delicious conclusion) but by the fascination of viewing family life in another time. As with any period piece, geographical, political, and mannerly allusions are lost without some historical understanding of the time. Not every \\"great book\\" is for every person. Also, PandP is very much a romance; you must be willing to romanticize to truly appreciate Eliza Bennett's struggle and change of heart. So don't feel you must read it just because others tell you to. But if you find yourself in a wistful mood, ready to be immersed in another world, give this one a try. Chances are, it will lead you to a minor obsession with Jane Austen.Extensions of the original: If the recent movie starring Kiera Knightley was enjoyable, the book will be more so, with richer details and more drama. Also recommended as a companion is the fullest dramatization of the book, the BBC's version starring Colin Firth. And for a chick lit homage, read the Bridget Jones books."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this is definitely an amazing piece of literature. i love it now, and will with no doubt still love it in the years to come. i believe it to be flawless, and Jane Austen deserves all the credit in the world for this book. the fact that it has endured the test of time, and has been enjoyed by generation after generation speaks volumes. i believe that the subtleties and simplicity of the story is what makes it the masterpiece it is. Jane Austen's ability to turn a simple love story, into something greater, while completely engrossing us without the fluff of a typical romance are what make her a literary genuis in her own right. her novels are literary dessert. they aren't filled with the complexities and deep themes of dickens', hardy's, or eliot's works, they are light-hearted and this very fact is what makes pride and prejudice an amazng piece of art. Elizabeth and Darcy come to life, and simply jump out of the text. The characters, their lives, the struggles they face, the decisions (and indecisions), and most importanty their eventual happiness are what make the book. no praise i can offer will completely do this masterpiece justice, so i urge you to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It is, to put it simply, unequalled. Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does. Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language. You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one. Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word. She understood people. We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work. How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity. I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so. If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph. Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished my 3rd reading of P&P;, and I cannot begin to say how much I loved it. This is one of those novels that you can read over and over and never get tired of because you find something new every time! One of the most satisfying experiences is just being able to go through it slowly and savor every little turn of phrase, though for me this was not possible until I had already read it and didn't have the urge to rush on and see how it ended. As for the novel itself, so many people have given a synopsis that it would be pointless for me to do so. All I will say is that if it sounds dull just from reading about it, I still would not give up because Austen is one of the few authors whose works are very difficult to give a plot summary for that does justice to the story.One other thing- I would also recommend this edition because it is one of the most pretty and elegant I have seen, yet still very affordable. A fan of Austen who would like to upgrade to a nicer edition of the novels should really consider Everyman's Library because there are few others that are more lovely or durable.In short, don't miss out on this wonderful reading experience!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is one of the most beautiful and well-written stories throughout the centuries. It isn't meant to be viewed as a serious tale, but is instead satirical, poking fun at the different conventions of society at the time. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, is well-developed and extremely likeable, as is her sister, Jane. Even Mr. Darcy, whom everyone dislikes in the beginning of the novel, is likeable in his somewhat clumsy love for Elizabeth. The struggle that Darcy and Elizabeth go through to finally admit their love is complex and draws the reader into the story even further. I must say that my favorite character is Mr. Bennet, because his off-the-wall humor had me laughing out loud several times throughout reading the book. I read this book when I was 13 and thought it was wonderful, and over the years it has become even better. This book is such a remarkable piece of literature that it only gets more interesting and more fruitful of a read the more times you actually pick the book up and read it. Jane Austen is a master of literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"When I read this Jane Austen novel, I couldn't help falling in love with it. The romance, which I think plays the main part,was overwhelming, along with the beautiful charactirazation and the so well-thought plot. This novel contains everything it should contain to be a bestseller, and a besteller it is, even almost 200 years after it was written. This book is a true recommendation for everyone who likes his or her books well-written and full of humor, love, intrigues, social developments and such lively and realistic characters. Somehing that struck me, was the fact that Elizabeth is such an quick-witted girl that is so modern for her time: she wants to marry for love, (which girl wouldn't want that?! it really is just like a fairy-tale) and she has got a will of her own. She doesn't like to be toyed with and she has got her feminin pride that makes her so strong. Should you be considering reading this book, don't hesitate and just grab it, and you will soon see: it grabs you!&lt;BR"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; Jane Austen creates an entire universe out of the circumscribed world of genteel British society. The main focus of the novel is the Bennet family, consisting of a nervous and silly mother, her indolent and sarcastic husband, and their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet desperately wants her daughters to marry wealthy men, especially since Mr. Bennet's property will go to a male cousin, Mr. Collins, upon Mr. Bennet's death.Soon, a likely marriage prospect appears in the person of Mr. Bingley, who rents a nearby home in Netherfield Park. Mrs. Bennet hounds her husband to call on Mr. Bingley immediately so that the Bennets can make his acquaintance. To Mrs. Bennet's delight, Mr. Bingley proves to be a perfectly amiable and wealthy gentleman. However, his close friend, Fitzwilliam Darcy, is quite the opposite of Bingley. Darcy is a man whose arrogance and cold demeanor make him immediately unpopular with the Bennets, especially with Elizabeth Bennet, one of the daughters whom he particularly insults.&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; deals with the preconceived notions that people have about one another and how these ideas wreak havoc with relationships. Austen also casts her astute eye on the social mores of the time which made both men and women slaves to convention. Marriage was not just a pleasant state for a woman. It was a necessity, especially if her family lacked the means to support her for the rest of her life.One of the most noteworthy aspects of this novel is Austen's lively cast of characters. Elizabeth Bennet is surely one of the most vivacious, witty, and entrancing heroines in British fiction, and she meets her match in the dashing, proud, and inscrutable Mr. Darcy. Austen's portraits of the stuffy and pompous Mr. Collins and his overbearing and opinionated patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, are hilarious.Austen's novel is a high-class soap opera in many respects, with a myriad of romantic entanglements and much intrigue to keep the reader engrossed. However, it is much more than that. It is a masterful tale of how people deceive themselves and the traps that they fall into when they are weak-minded and easily manipulated by others. &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is also a beautiful and romantic story of how men and women find their soul mates in spite of seemingly insurmountable obstacles."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If a classic is boring, then this is not a classic. If a drawing-room comedy is stiff and trivial, then this is not a drawing-room comedy. This is quite simply one of the loveliest, wittiest, most utterly _wise_ novels ever written about human relationships. Every word sparkles. The dialogue fairly dances. And Austen does this without any of the things that we often assume make for an exciting novel. The most suspenseful question that arises is whether a certain two characters in the novel have gone to Scotland or to London (this is suspenseful for reasons having to do with 18th-century English marriage laws and social mores). And this event, certainly the most sensational in the book, is really only important because it helps the two central characters make up their minds about each other. Austen's world is a world in which every detail really counts--in which the slightest look or the most insignificant word can have earth-shaking meaning. And the result of this, as of all great literature, is to send us back into our own worlds with the renewed conviction that it all really does matter. In that sense, Austen's &quot;realistic&quot; fiction is a lot like good fantasy, such as Lord of the Rings. By heightening certain aspects of our experience, Austen gives new life to the &quot;commonplace&quot; world we live in. This is a book that makes you feel alive, and glad of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I found Pride and Prejudice an engrossing and well written novel. The book gives modern readers insight into the Victorian society, morality, and etiquette. The novel is made up of fascinating, well-developed three-dimensional characters. I loved Darcy and Elizabeth; although both were flawed people, they also had an essential humanity and goodness to them that made me root for them to get together. I thought the way Elizabeth's feelings for Darcy evolved was very realistic. I admired Darcy's love for his sister, and his strength, while finding myself frustrated by his arrogance and aloofness. I thought Elizabeth was a heroine modern women could relate to - she had fire, confidence and forthrightness.I also enjoyed the complex relationships between the various characters, be it Jane and Elizabeth, Elizabeth and Mr. Bennett, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. What I liked was that even the characters we weren't meant to like, such as Lady Catherine, were not one-dimensional (this isn't the case in Mansfield Park). I was just as interested in finding out what would happen to Lydia and Jane as I was in the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy. The one complaint I have here is that I wish that Darcy and Elizabeth had gotten closer sooner, so that the conflict with Lady Catherine could have been a bigger part of the novel. There were events that I wish had occurred earlier so that more time could have been spent on them - the novel got off to a slow start.That said, overall this novel has much better pacing than other classic literature I have read (notably Mansfield Park). The author does provide a great deal of detail and description, but she is such a good writer, and the prose is so captivating, that I didn't mind at all. The dialogue is superb. The novel had a lot of charming, funny moments. The uses of satire and irony were exceedingly well done; Austen is the master of this sort of comedy of manners."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my all-time favorite book, and believe me, I've read MANY novels. Jane Austen has excellently captured human nature here, and all of her characters reflect the environment they grew up in which was determined by the social classes of the time period.The main conflict of the book is based on the interactions between these social classes, which is reflected by the title. The prejudice and pride of BOTH the upper and middle class is what the story revolves around, but it isn't the action and intrigue that mark this book, it is the characters that make this &quot;Timeless Masterpiece.&quot;Elizabeth Bennet, whose liveliness and quick wit have often attracted readers, is the main character from the middle class. Mr. Darcy is her counterpart from the upper class. These two drive the book, adding humor and depth with every word.Everyone over the age of 12, including BOTH males and females, should read this book. This isn't a silly romance novel for young girls, it is a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book. It has so many levels. On the surface, it's a book about 5 silly airheads who chase men &amp; go to parties. They obsess over all the single men in town &amp; how much money the men have. On a deeper level, you see that women in that time period had no rights. They couldn't even own their own home. Their very existance depended upon finding a suitable husband. Of course they were interested in catching a rich man!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people! A smart, witty, and sarcastic heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, a man like *drool* Mr. Darcy...and the burning question: can they overcome their first impressions of each other? My absolute favorite book!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little disappointed that this issue didn't have any illustrations in it, but the book is wonderful. It is the best love story ever. It truly teaches us that you cannot judge a book by it's cover. A definate must read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice, is perhaps my favorite book of all time. Miss Austen's trademark wit and whimsy style of writing is appealing to readers of all ages, even to a modern teen like me. I find something, many things, to relate to within the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as I, like she, \\"[takes] delight in anything ridiculous.\\" Since the moment I read that infamous line: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged......\\" I have considered myself to be a firm and loyal Janeite, joining the ranks of thousands of hopeless romantics and head-strong women whom only hope to one day find their Mr. Darcy.Between the playfulness of Miss Bennet and the comically formalness of Mr. Darcy lies a classic lesson to be learned. Originally, Jane Austen thought to name this tale \\"First Impressions\\", as the moral of the story lies within the importance of not relying on just that. Lizzie Bennet's fatal --- or perhaps only --- flaw is her characteristic quickness to judgement, which nearly cost her the love of her life. Although by the end of the story one is almost always in love with Darcy, his personality at the beginning of the story is purposefully icy and rigid, depicting him as the perfect example of an excess of pride. By the end of the tale, however, Darcy stands proud as perhaps the most romantic hero of all time.Prepare to be \\"bewitched body and soul\\" by the whit and wisdom and Miss Austen, perhaps the most perfect romantic author of all time. In addition, plan to be enchanted by the playfulness of Lizzie, charmed by the misadventure of Darcy, rendered speechless by the nerve and lack of tact within the Mrs. Bennet, charmed by the sweetness of Jane and Bingley, enraged by both Miss Bingley and Lady Catherine, and most of all, infuriated by the ridiculousness and insufferability of Lydia and Kitty. There is always something to take from a story so perfect and so classic as this. I make it a point to return to it's familar story at least once a month. This beautifully penned tale only stands to prove that Love, more often than not, will be not so easily defeated."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I recently finished reading Pride and Prejudice for the sixth time and can honestly say it was better than it ever has been before. The first reading, in high school, was a little rough. Since then, this book has grown on me each time (silly to say, since it is my FAVORITE book and the only one I have re-read as often). The humor is fantastic, the characters are both wonderful and suited so well to the time period, and Mr. Darcy is a classic \\"leading man\\". Who doesn't want to find the modern day version of Mr. Darcy?"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It has been one of my favourites for years. Wheather you have read the other Jane Austen books or not, this is a \\"must read\\". This edition is really good and comfortable (in size, type size, etc.) to read and carry along for bus/ train travelling. Good to read and then watch the film."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"this book is one of the most romanitic books i've read. i love this book. it is a turly romanitic story between a Women with alot of Pride and a man with both Pride and prejudice."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The beautiful language in this novel made it an instant favorite for me. The witty back and forth dialogues and characters created an amazinig atmosphere of intelligent and quirky people. Though the book does not give the reader an idea of what was happening historically at that time, that is part of what makes it a timeless classic. One gets a very good idea of what it was like to live in that time, but without the history it makes it open to all audiences. Pride and Prejudice is an amazing novel that does not disgrace the reputation of classic literature, but gives it a boost up."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"we received our book in one day. the book was in excellent condition. 5 star service"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Best romance book ever written and one of the top ten books of all time, in my opinion. Jane Austen has a remarkable skill for capturing cultural snapshots and portraying the essence of human nature like no other author I can identify. I also love the BBC movie version for the complete story and the recent movie with Keira Knightly for the highlights. I only purchase the Barnes and Noble collection for my classic books because they look nice together on shelves and have interesting introductions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Best novel ever!! And this one is the perfect size to tote around while on vacation or commuting. It is very small, but still easy to read. I really like the satin ribbon bookmark that is attached to the spine.

I hope they come out with more!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read this book twelve times, and I will never get bored with it. I'm hoplessly romantic, and I love the different conflicts, the interesting and independent characters, the plot twists, and the happily ever after at the end. Elizabeth Bennet is an independent, youthful, clever, and witty young woman in the eighteen hundreds. She is my favorite character in the novel, and has a wonderful spunky nature that keeps the book alive. The characters are fully formed and realistic, from beautiful Jane to the hilarious Mrs. Bennet. This is, by far, the best Jane Austen book ever published, and recommend it very strongly for anyone starting to read eighteenth and nineteenth century literature."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Its been my favorite book for last 25 years.

Pride and Prejudice is a reading bliss with its unique and beloved plot. The unsuspected decisions and changes of plot keep you on your toes wishing for more. The description and personalities of the characters is extraordinary and you feel yourself intrigued within the story, and falling in love with Mr. Darcy alongside Elizabeth. The end is perfect in every way possible, but you can't help yourself wishing for it not to end though. Her vocabulary and formality may at times be more difficult but it makes it all the more interesting. It's a timeless classic which I love and adore, and never tire of no matter how many times I read it! ~A.C."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is written in the language of its day and is very enjoyable as a light read.

Who would I recommend it to? Any literate person. This is classic fiction and very enjoyable however often you read it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Wonderful writing, great characterisation, and themes that aren't so outdated as you might expect. The book is difficult to plod through, but once you get used to the intricate writing and you look past the rather uninteresting plot, you'll be surprised when you really start enjoying yourself.Pride and Prejudice is a classic in its own right!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice turned out to be a well involved tale of drama and romance. At first the book runs slowly, sometimes getting off the point and losing interest, but in a whole, when you finish reading the last page, you know you've read something great. The book truly tells a tale of pride and prejudice. Along with the many other stories involving other characters, the main interset is about two people- Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth along with her sister Jane and others are all finding their way into marriage, when two men Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley come along. Mr. Darcy at first appearence is a crude proud man who does not involve himself in social confrantation, while Mr. Bingley comes to be a charming well wittted man. The story continues on with marriage proposals, refusals, and devious scandals. In Pride and Prejudice, many characters develop. Jane Austin creates their stories very well but sometimes as I was reading, I felt that there were too many people and I found it hard to keep up and get involved with it. But in a way, that was also the beauty of the story.So if you are intersted in this book, you have to be willing to be patient. But it will be worth it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"My favorite chapter in the novel Pride and Prejudice is chapter 16 of volume III (or chapter 58) because Elizabeth finally accepts Darcy?s marriage proposal. It amazed me how she was still able to say yes after she was insulted in every way possible especially after disliking him so much in the beginning of the novel.This book is appropriate for anyone who is able to appreciate well-written literature. Anyone would enjoy reading this book, from teenagers to adults.One literary device I appreciated was epigram, which is a brief, clever, and usually memorable statement. An example of this would be ?It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in wants of a wife? which is found on the first page of the novel. The entire novel was based on this quote. Mrs. Bennet wanted to get all five of her daughters married before her husband died.I liked the novel. I found Elizabeth?s romance with Darcy intriguing. It was interesting how in the beginning she rejected his proposal and disliked him, and at the end she marries him."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"You will find Jane Austen in high school classrooms, as inspiration for contemporary movies and fiction (Clueless, Bridget Jones' Diary), and at a book club or two. Otherwise, she is not part of us: Her laser-eyes, scathing commentary about society, and merciless fun at the expense of over-the-top piety are missing. In our current Press-Release era, where ads blanket our cities, and celebrities alter their image every other week, Jane would have a field day-- her observations would have been invaluable, her sharp humor liberating.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\"-- the story of independent-minded Elizabeth Bennet's journey to a happy marriage and her rousing rebellion against the stultifying and stale social system of 19th-Century England-- is an adrenaline-rush of a book.As Elizabeth battles the defenders of society (her marriage-obsessed mother, a condescending suitor, and several members of the \\"upper-class\\" trying to stem her promising relationship with the affluent and handsome Mr. Darcy) we sample a world where family, money, and class dictate your friends and suitors.When Elizabeth and Darcy move to his stunning home, they leave the hostility of an uncaring society behind. Through rebellion and stubbornness, they have found Eden."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice centers around the Bennett family, mainly Elizabeth Bennett, the second eldest of five sisters. Throughout the novel, family relations, economical issues, humiliation of making a mistake, and falling in love are thoroughly described amongst all of the characters. Three of the five sisters marry in the book while encountering pride and prejudice of position or status. The eldest daughter of the Bennetts, Jane, falls in love and marries a man named Charles Bingley. She is the second of the three daughters that marry during the story because of a delay caused by Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy who had initially made Bingley think Jane does not love him because of her poor economical status and family relations. However, it is also Darcy who later convinces Bingley to finally marry Jane out of his own love for Janeas younger sister Elizabeth. After both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth overcome their pride and prejudice against each other, they are also married. Elizabeth is the third daughter to marry. The first daughter to marry is Lydia, who foolishly elopes with the untrustworthy George Wickham whose primary intention was not to marry her, but who eventually agrees to the marriage on terms agreed to by Darcy and Bingley. The novel describes the pride and prejudice that all of the characters manage to overcome in order to live contentedly.Although the language used in Pride and Prejudice was difficult for a fourteen year-old, as I kept reading it became clearer and easier to understand the 19th century speech. The womenaes rights that Austen presented were beyond her time and I developed great respect for her. The message about overcoming pride and prejudice and marrying not for money but for love was very powerful and I felt that it was appropriate to be read for a humanities class because it was closely related to the topics we have been going over in class. Overall, I thought that Pride and Prejudice was a very well written and entertaining novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Originally entitled First Impression, Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is a sophisticated love story, elegantly portrayed during the 18th century. Satirizing the Victorian woman's quest for an ideal husband, Austen's witty humor provides much amusement for the reader. The complex plot and the dramatic lives of the Bennet family enable the reader to become engrossed within Austen's masterpiece.The points of view of the novel are shown through Austen's usage of the limited omniscient as well as first person accounts, which are shown through personal letters of the characters. Her unique literary style enables the reader to better understand the mood and dramatic emotions of the characters. The letters intertwined throughout the book, advance the plot and greatly invoke the interest of the reader.Although all the characters contribute to the entertaining quality of the novel, the most auspicious were indeed Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy. With Elizabeth's out-spoken manners and Darcy's arrogant yet shy persona, both characters were quick to judge the other based upon their first impressions. As the novel progressed, Elizabeth's humor and charm, not only won over the reader but Darcy as well. We also enjoyed Darcy's evolution from a shy and rather self righteous aristocrat, into a kind, endearing, as well as understanding man. His interactions with Lizzy provided conflict and laughter. Mrs. Bennet's \\"nerves\\" also served as our source of amusement.This intellectual novel entails deception, love, comedy, and above all, a glimpse into 18th century society. We enjoyed the conclusion, in which Austen meets our satisfaction by tying all the loose ends together. Despite it's title, the characters of the novel overcome prejudice, but never lost their pride."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college. Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book. A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary. Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England. Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with. Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances. The read is well worth it. The reading is engaging and will keep you turning pages. I would heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is Jane Austen at her best. It is witty, well-written, and captivating. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who tend to dislike literature from this period."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had always meant to read this book, but never got around to it until I saw the movie &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot; It was fun to see the how the movie plot follows the theme of the book Meg Ryan's character loved so much. I am a fan of the British classics and found Jane Austen much easier to read than the Brontes, but not quite as passionate. There is plenty of humor as well."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is Austen at her best. This classic never gets stale no matter how many times I read it. Great story, fascinating characters and wonderful descriptions of English society and class differences. You just can't go wrong with Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It as a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen, in possession of a good novel must be in want of a reader.Undeniably one of the greatest authors in classic literature, Austen begins her classic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, with her renown truth. Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was looking for a hard back book and was happy to have found one, when it came I was very disappointed that it was a bed book. I had never heard of the bed books before and I can't get used to the sideways printing. Amazon should make it clearer that you are buying a bed book and not a normal book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work. I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men. A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth. As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society. Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life. Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming. Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading. And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen. The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly. The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write. It's the perfect addition to any library!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin is a very interesting novel. It not only tells but also, shows what young women went though in the 18th century. Elizabeth Bennett faces many expirences that women go through today. From getting maried to dealing with friends, family, and men from a day to day basis. Elizabeth has seven sisters who are also going through the same expirences. She is closest to her oldest sister Jane. They seem to understand each other the best. The mother is the most interesting charatcter out of the whole novel because she wants the best for her daughters and tries to live their lives for all seven of them. Elizabeth does not let her mother do this and in the end her mother disowns her. This novel teaches what is worth in life and what is not.You should only do what is right for your self and on one else.This novel gives you hope that in any life you can become your own self and not be criticized for your own actions or how you think. This is a great novel and if you read it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love Pride & Prejudice. It's one of my all time favorite books. Therefore, and because it was free, it was the first book I downloaded for my Kindle. I have to say I found some typos in the edition. I'm not sure who's uploading these things but I don't like not being able to trust the content."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love my Kindle, but was hopeing to read a famous classic without any editing, meaning reduction, of the text. This edition is so poorly edited as to be confusing at some points, when, for instance, suddenly we are reading about a previously unintroduced Miss King, who is mentioned and then forgotten. There are no descriptions of clothing, very little of scenery, none really of homes/estates. The book consists of conversations, which are terrific due to the author's skill, and the bridges that get us to those. How can I get an unedited, unabridged copy of the book? That should be made clear when we order these \\"free\\" books: they are vastly edited. If that's not what you want, don't get these."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P&P is a book I come back to every couple of years. I first met Mr. Darcy and Miss Elizabeth Bennet when I was a young teen. I never tire of this book. For anyone who has only seen the movie, I urge you to read the book as well. Nobody writes like Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is considered a \\"classic\\" for many reasons. For one thing, it deals with themes that are still very relevant in our society today. The ideas of pride and family relationships are both important factors in every day life today, and help bring the book to life. Also, the characters in the novel have many character traits that are exhibited almost 175 years after the book was originally published. Aloof, rich people, flirtations, young women, and social, eligible bachelors are common types of people even today. By incorporating characters such as Mr. Darcy, Lydia, and Mr. Bingley into her story, Jane Austen has kept the book popular for hundreds of years. The plot is very interesting and keeps the reader engaged from start to finish. A family living in the British countryside that is almost continuously worried about marriage may not sound like an intriguing plot to many people, but in fact the plot is fascinating.Somebody who read the book might be a little bit disappointed by the fact that it was written 175 years ago. This affects many aspect of the novel and radically changes how the book is written. Although most of the vocabulary and style is easy to understand, every now and then there is a small section that is hard to understand. In terms of themes, the obsession of young people with marriage is not as apparent in today's society as much as it used to be. Finally, various decisions in grammar and punctuation may make the book more difficult for some people to read. At some points in the novel, such as letters or other dialogues, the whole page may be filled without any paragraph breaks. This makes for a more intimidating reading experience and may serve as a deterrent to people who are considering reading the book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I loved this book, everyone had kept telling me to read it and I kept putting it off, then I saw the film and I read the book and I loved it. The language was a bit difficult to begin with, but I soon got used to it and it was well worth the effort. The book's very funny and the story's excellent, all in all a must read.If you want more, there's a book out called Darcy's Diary by Amanda Grange and it tells the story from Darcy's side, so you see the things you don't see in Pride and Prejudice, like Darcy going to London to track Wickham down, and it also goes on after the wedding, so all in all another good read. But make sure you read Pride and Prejudice whatever you do!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is and will always remain to be an all time favorite romantic comedy in the history of American literature. The story never fails to emphasize on the ethical manners played out in the 19th Century English society, an existence in which wealth, social status, and love prevailed lucidly in pithy marriages. It also differentiates with our human behavior in the modern world, how much we have changed in a sense.The emotions and intentions of the characters in this book are beautifully written and brought to life as they are living life to the rules of respect and manners. I highly recommend this book to all ages interested in reading romantic classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This seems a somewhat redundant exercise reviewing a book that already stands as an English language classic and example of free indirect speech. Even if most people could not necessarily recount the plot and characters, the countless editions of the book, combined with movies and literary spinoffs stand in testimony to it as a cultural icon. There are not many who would not recognize the book by name and have some sense of its position and impact.This review then cannot do much more than to echo these commonly known facts and direct attention specifically to the Kindle edition of the book which was downloaded as a free public domain book and which I confess, my first time reading the entire book as originally written. The strength of the book and timeless qualities of it can be affirmed by the attention that it elicited from me. I was able to enter into the plot and see both the masterful writing as well as the true insight into human nature that this book represents. Apart from a few typos and the chapters not being very well differentiated, I had little difficulty wanting to return to my Kindle to continue the read and glad for the experience.This is one of the most appealing elements of the Kindle in my estimation. There are so many books in the public domain that provides an opportunity for the reader who has heard of and knows the place and importance of a particular book who can then download the book and take the opportunities during the day (and for me of a long commute) and fill the gaps in one's reading by pulling books that have stood the test of time as well as the convenience of the newer books that are available at a considerable discount over the new Hardback price.What a pleasure to read and more yet to come in the days ahead.5 Stars for the novel AND the medium!Bart Breen"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've been reading Pride and Prejudice on my iPhone through my Kindle for iPhone app...I purchased the book as well but found it easier to read in small increments that the Kindle provides.

I bought a hard copy edition but never took time to read it, just kept watching that movie. Kindle had a free edition, I said what the heck and I loaded it. Knowing the story already, I delved into the book. Happy was I to see that the movie was almost totally in sync with the book! I absolutely love the story. The \\"prejudiced\\" Lizzy reluctantly falling in love with the \\"proud\\" Darcy, and the Darcy who had too much Pride to get over his Prejudice towards her \\"lowly connections.\\"I will read it again definitely; it's got to be my favorite book, especially in the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Two hundred Years this book has been around & still a bestseller. Sure the language is verbose & flowery , But Never has one book spawned hundreds of cookie cutter wannabees. Nothing will ever compare to the wonder that is this book. Jane Austen was a people watcher,I'll bet. As a writer, Jane Knew how to get under the characters skin to bare their souls of what mattered to them. What still matters to us.It was a satire of the times. Middle Class Women had to marry well because if they didn't they would be homeless or working at the lowest of jobs.So,alot of times they married the first dude that asked them to dance.I think Jane saw how unhappy the women surrounding her were in marraiges without any common ground or affection.She also explores the intricities of marriage and how differant personalities date and eventually marry. For some love for starts like a raging fire only to evaporate in middle age, for some love seems to elude them for no good reason ,and for others it comes softly at the strangest time. Some couples are dear friends, some roommates,others HAD TO GET MARRIED.Above all ,Ms. Austen shows us that Love can be savage,beautiful,tragic ,sudden,brutal,frightening,awkward,exciting,mysterious and confusing. That, my friends will never change.If this isn't enough reason to read this book, At least check it out for Lizzy Bennet and her well meaning,goofy mother, who loves playing matchmaker. Even though she is bad at it.Lizzy is everywoman. The men want to date her and women want to be like her."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book...it is a look into the window of how people use to behave in such a comical fashion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Dearest Readers of the century first and twentyith,I prooffer my highest and most esteemed recommendation of this fine book. Be not intimidated by formal British writing style of nearly 200 years ago, the occasional serpentine sentence, and words not oft' seen since the SAT exams (if at all). You will be highly rewarded with a most engaging story, skilled character development, and above all, acerbic wit. I trust you will be as delighted as this reviewer to have the felicity of reading this book.Very truly yours...P.S. Any 21st century western female reading this book will likely be as relieved as I am that we no longer live in a society where property conveys automatically to men, and women are totally dependent on men for their support. It's easy to understand why one character married for money and security only, and why the protognist's mother was completely obssessed with marrying off her daughters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It was a good book and i enjoyed it greatly.

One of my all time favorite love stories! All young girls should be required to read it...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have to say that Pride and Prejudice is one of the best books I have ever read...and I have read a LOT! I think the first time I picked it up was back in 6th grade. I loved it then, but how much does a sixth grader really get out of it? Reading it again for my English class opened my eyes to some of the more subtle humor and details Austen includes in her witty satire of Regency England's society and customs, particularly those dealing with marriage. Perhaps one of the reasons I liked this novel so much was-it wasn't a \\"fluff\\" romance. I admit, I love romances, but this one surpasses them all, simply because it has sustenance. It has a fully-developed plot, well-thought-out characters, etc. It is thought-provoking and at the same time, a fun read.The heroine of the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, is intelligent, witty, and-of course-prejudiced. Mr. Darcy, the proud hero, epitomizes the saying, \\"Appearances can be deceiving.\\" Lizzie's journey to true love is fraught with obstacles-some of her own making and some due to her matchmaking mama; her indulgent, sarcastic, and perhaps at times insensitive father; her love-lorn older sister; and two boy-crazy younger sisters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The reason I liked this book so much was the main character, Elizabeth Bennet. Her honesty and spunk are a wonderful combination. In a time where frankness was discouraged, hers grew. I also admire how she matures through the course of the novel. Her 'pride and prejudice' are put in their proper place. Her and her father also contribute much humor to the story. Their sarcastic wit made me laugh. Generally, I enjoyed Austen's sense of humor: there were many funny moments. I also found the story's end heartwarming... perhaps I am just a sap, but you should read it and find out!!! I think this would be one of my favorite books so far; I definately want to read more Jane Austen in the coming months!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have never read another book that kept my attention as constantly as Pride and Prejudice. The novel involves such a vast array of diverse characters all involved in the search for love, whether willingly or unwillingly. Mrs. Bennet's incessant stress of finding a husband for her five daughters is quite a difficult feat. Not only does she want them to have a man for the rest of their lives, but he must be one with much opulence. The need for an attraction between the couple is quite peripheral in the eyes of Mrs. Bennet. However, Elizabeth Bennet, the second-oldest daughter, would rather renounce the popular tradition of marrying solely for wealth. She searches for true love and happiness, and wealth is an added bonus. A very unexpected set of circumstances causes Elizabeth to question Mr. Darcy's love. As their lives continue, Elizabeth reconsiders her initial judgements of Mr. Darcy and other characters. Jane Austen's satirical and ironic comments and situations give the reader great insight into the customs of the early nineteenth century. Austen presents a very tangled web of people and events. The transformation and reactions of the characters from beginning to end is very drastic and presents very sagacious lessons about life. This is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed at anytime. I cannot wait to read it a second time!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The book Pride and Prejudice was a book about love and its consequences. This book tell us about the life of people on the 19th century in England, how they lived and how they felt. It also shows a true story of love, how sometimes pride can be stronger that the love that people feel, and marry for love and not for social status which happen to woman very often back then. Elizabeth Bennet is the second oldest child on her family. She is a strong, intelligent, and a beautiful, independent girl, she makes good judgments of others and must live with the consequences of her prejudice. The best chapter was the last one when Mr. Darcy goes to Elizabeth's house and they tell each other about their feelings, and Mr. Bingley and Jane got together too. I would give this book five stars because this is a great book of love."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"In my view,I think Jane Austen is a very successful author and I enjoy reading her book very much.For example,Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility,especially Pride and Prejudice.All are very perfect works but Pride and prejudice has always been the most popular of her books.And this novel is now available in new movie version.I think it must be very exciting.Pride and Prejudice is widely-read and well-loved.The story is about the love between Elizabeth and Darcy and it is really romantic which readers can easily fall into the role and know their feeling.Also,this book is centrally concerned with personnal happiness and Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy-tall,handsome and rich man-is the stuff of wish -fulfilment.If you want to know more about the story,you must read this book&quot;Pride and Prejudcie&quot; as soon as possible.Because it is really a wonderful fiction and a romantic love story.hope you enjoy this nice book.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Well, I first read Pride and Prejudice while in 10th grade and I fell in love with the book and its characters. I finished it in about 2 days while the rest of my class were reading the required amount each day. Lol, I became very ahead of my class for this book.The book is just so universal. It could happen anywhere, to anyone, at any time. Which is why I related to it, I could see what happened in the book could very likely happen in my time(and I wouldn't mind it happening to me, ;).)Also, I like the strength of Elizabeth's character. She is smart and witty and has a mind of her own. She doesn't allow her mother to pressure her into anything she doesn't want.I highly recommend this book, so go out and read it today,...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the best writing of Jane Austen's.The title aptly says in a few words what the wholestory was about. Elizabeth is a middle-class female with too much pride, and Mr. Darcy is an upper-class male with too much prejudice - or is it vice versa? It appears that both these characters had a little bit of both...Anyway, the characters were very believable, with feelingsand emotions that were surprisingly accurate.Everyone came out a winner in the end. I particularly likedMr. Darcy's reactions (or actions) to Elizabeth's retorts to his proposal. In all cases, they were both right in their own ways. They just needed to get together enough times to finally say what they had been feeling all along. And they do.In the end, it worked out, and oh, did it make me happy!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was probably one of the first novels I read during this time period. The first time I read it, I was amazed by the eloquent but simple writing of Jane Austen. The second time I read it, I was astounded by the way the charactors were portrayed. The third time I read it, I was blown away by the plot, and the rich detials and descriptions that surrounded her story. Since then, every time I read it I am more and more captivated by the certain truthfulness and plain exertion of human nature. The writing is of incredible quality. I would say that this novel is one of the best I have ever read, second only to Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"After reading this book I thought that if the early 19th century had soap operas, they would be a little like this. I thought I was going to be bored but I was quickly proven wrong. The best parts of the book is when Elizabeth is around Mr. Darcy (you'll see why). I found Mrs. Bennett (Elizabeth's mother) to have a sort of comic role(you might agree with me). And the juicy secrets revealed later in the book will have your jaw wide open. By the end of the book you'll fall in love with the charactors and you might be tempted to read it again (I know I did). There is a reason why this is Jane Austen's most widely read and most loved book: It's just entertaining reading!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The story is a little bit complicated at the beginning because of the many protagonists introduced but in the end it is quite remarkable and gives you some insight into the life of the English landed entry.When you have read this book and and also understood its content, you will agree that it has been worth reading even if it is only for the language used. Since I have really enjoyed it, I would give it top marks."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride & Prejudice is one of the few books that I can honestly say earned its status as a classic with a huge fan base. It is brilliantly written plot-wise and character-wise, set in the time of propriety and manners in Regency England (early 1800s). Jane Austen at her bestSynopsis: (WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!)The novel opens with the arrival of a wealthy young gentleman, Mr. Charles Bingley, at Netherfield Park, accompanied by his rather haughty sisters and friend, Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. Seeing the wealthy newcomers, the Bennet family of the nearby village of Longbourn, is in great excitement. The silly and impractical Mrs. Bennet thereupon aims to marry off at least one of her five daughters: Jane (the eldest and the kindest), Elizabeth (the most sensible), Mary (the most studious), Kitty (the simple-minded), and Lydia (the silliest). Almost immediately, the amiable Mr. Bingley is well-liked by the community, while his friend, Mr. Darcy, appears just the opposite. From the start, since he rejected her at a ball, Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darcy is to be arrogant, proud, and conceited. Her dislike of him is only heightened when she hears an account of Mr. Darcy, as ruthless and cold-hearted, from a handsome and sociable young officer, Mr. George Wickham. Meanwhile, despite Mrs. Bennet's embarrassing meddling, Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennet begin to develop an attachment, and though unawares, Elizabeth's liveliness and intelligence grows on Mr. Darcy, who unconsciously falls for her - despite all his objections to her inferior birth status and her ridiculous mother and younger sisters. As Elizabeth, the main protagonist, eventually discovers, one of her two admirers - Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy - has all the appearance of goodness, while the other has all the genuine goodness."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The content of this book receives five stars with ease. This version gets two at best. There are countless errors in spelling and grammar, which annoys me greatly. Despite this, I found this novel to be a delightful read. I haven't enjoyed a book like this in ages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have the story mostly memorized from reading the book and watching the movies, and the narrator does a good job of changing up the voices and carrying the emotion of the story.

At first, she thinks he is prideful and prejudiced. But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than \\"venison\\" or \\"meat.\\" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I did read this book in school (many years ago) and had forgotten much about the book.

And the movies are great too. Strongly recommended to read."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Can you imagine a more classic tale of romance?You are immediately transported back to the 19th century--I want tobring this book with me every time I travel to the English countryside.More than any other novel, this story really captures Austen's wit.Books these days are so lackluster in comparison, and it's becomeso incredibly hard to find a hero to live up to Darcy. I'm never, everbored when I pick this up--even on the hundredth read!PLEASE give this one a shot if you haven't already--you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Blame Jane - Austen that is - for The Marriage Plot: the idea that a woman's ambition and happiness rests solely upon marriage to a man; and that she is free to use any means to land her man, including to a great degree: gossip, deceit, and deception. In addition, she need not worry that he is not the ideal man, for she can mold him into what it is she wants because he is witless--putty in her hands. Unless he is a scoundrel, who turns the plot upside down on an unsuspecting nubile. Cheers, Mr. Wickham.Nora Roberts owes Austen for her fortune and success. Austen was the pioneer that many other romance writers have followed. Not only writers, but including real girls and women for, apparently, centuries, right on up to today; and is responsible for much of marriage's misery (sometimes for some people.) For some, I know, The Marriage Plot works.Jane Austen was a young, little (Actually, I don't know if she was little or what she looked like - but I do know she had one fine imagination.) twerp--writing wishful fantasies in her attic about things she had little experience with, having never been married, or \`properly in love,' or, \\"\`violently in love.\\"' Thank goodness she didn't write sex scenes.Oh Miss Bennet, no not you Jane, or you Mary, or her niece, or the other sister, or her cousin, or his cousin - yes, you Elizabeth, the creature that is Mr. Bennet's daughter, or should I call you Lizzy? Eliza? The writing is often confusing and redundant and nothing happens but gossip and sideways conversations - which is probably accurate for the times. It certainly is today. So there is that. If Austen were alive today she might be a stand-up comic. She's funny, and if you can muddle through the bad writing - amusing and entertaining. I struggled to finish the book, but then I'm not a fan of The Marriage Plot nor bad writing. Nevertheless - five stars because she was way ahead of her time - a true pioneer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I LOVE the movie so I decided to finally read the book. It's great! Beautifully written. I downloaded it to my kindle. It has quickly become a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What sets this work apart from many others is that the story is so well focused that one does not lose track of any of the main characters. Really, there is no need for sequels because all the loose ends are tied up. For that reason, Austen has given us a remarkable masterpiece.I will not go into the plot, you need to read it, but just know that this book is at one time a fanciful and a serious examination of the lives of women in the neoclassical era."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice was one of the remaining Austen novels I have not read (Northanger Abbey is the other one). Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion...loved them all. So I figured it was about time I pick this one up off my shelf.Boy, I was not disappointed! It almost felt like coming back to an old friend, even though I have never read P&P; before. But I know the story very well, having fallen in love with the BBC series. And I loved it. I loved it so much that I don't know what to say. It is that good. And it is jumping right up to the top of my all-time favorite lists.It's witty - I love the early banter between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth when Jane is recovering from an illness at Mr Bingley's home. It's funny - Mr Collins just cracks me up, and you just have to laugh at Mrs Bennett's scheming. Almost 200 years later, it is still a page turner. And as much as I love reading classics, I would not describe most of them as a page turner!It is also a comfort book. I can't help but love almost all of the characters, despite their flaws. Immersing yourself in the novel is like having a cup of tea with an old friend. It's a joy to read, and I am positive that over the years I will be reading it again...and again...and again."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book was so interesting!

Obviously."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book lives up to what it is supposed to be--a classic love story. I can easily identify with and like the main character, Elizabeth. Throughout the book, I find it's easy to sympathize with her when she's embarrassed by her family or angry with Darcy. I feel her love for her sister. And, of course, I feel her anger and dislike for Darcy and the feelings of attraction and love that start to take their place. This is a love story. If you want to read a love story, read this book. If you're not interested in that type of thing, then pass this up. I promise you, though, that if you're interested in reading a simple love story, then this is a great one."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"But I'm going to read it now and find out--have just in fact borrowed the book itself this minute from me local library where Pat, a woman as it turns out and a reference librarian to boot, procured a paperback edition from the stacks and placed it right beside me here at the computer which I have to use now in the library coz I don't yet have a box of rocks installed back in the hut. I do have a clock and a radio though. And a calendar too although strictly speaking that particular item is made out of paper. I do believe that I am going to bigly dig Pride and Prejudice in any case, hence the bold five stars. Well for starters it's considered a classic, innit? Plus I am very favourably disposed towards this writer on account of having read and thoroughly enjoyed some years ago the very bleeding brilliant Persuasion. That truly is a lovely book that is and an abiding pleasure to read. The BBC made a great film version of Persuasion too so they did, in the middle 90s and not long after I savoured this memorable novel for the first time, with deeply satisfying turns by Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. That little flick still strikes all the right notes for me. And so happily on to P&P."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks. This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness. You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments. The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality! Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library! I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence.

With the additional notes and whatnot, the book is the number of pages first listed. The story itself is the number in the parentheses.On to the review! I'd always loved the Pride and Prejudice movie; the one from 2005 (I've never seen the really long one). I automatically fell in love with the story, just because I'm such a romantic and found everything about the characters and story so incredibly sweet. Finally, I dragged myself to Borders and forced myself (slash my mother, because I'm broke, hahah) to finally buy the book. I was not disappointed. I love old-fashioned stories, with old-fashioned language and learning about how they did things way back then. It's entertaining on all levels! Mrs. Bennet, though, could drive any sane person crazy, but she's leveled out by Mr. Bennet and her two sensible daughters, Elizabeth and Jane.The love story between Darcy and Elizabeth is priceless; I can see why this book is considered such a classic. However, this isn't a book to be recommended to someone who doesn't like lengthy descriptions and can't really translate nineteenth century speaking into modern day language. You will not understand a thing that is going on. If you read young adult romances and nothing else, this isn't the book for you. For the more mature teenager and adults who love a classic, read on!Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"P & P is one of my favorite books.

I myself have read it at least twice per year since the age of sixteen. The characters are extremely well developed and the time period well defined. One of the best books of the period to be sure. Mr. Darcy is sure to win the hearts of every girl who reads about him. Emma is the next best book to follow up with, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is not a review of the novel itself, (which is wonderful) but of the Winchester Austen Edition (henceforth WAE) of Pride and Prejudice, published by Word Press in 2007.After buying a copy of WAE &#34;Emma&#34; in Costco, I knew I had to have &#34;Pride & Prejudice&#34; in WAE as well. Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look. The covers of all WAE, are completely black, except for the title and author and also have rounded corners. Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars. Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel. The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P; the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable. I am very hard on books by intention. I read while I eat, before I sleep, while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself. I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the &#34;feel&#34; of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels. Let me know what you think."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Great book I read it in a week loved this classic book Lizzy and Darcy is a true love story"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Imagine, this was the first download for my new Kindle International edition.

For the technical types, an incorrectly formatted text file was used to create this book. It has embeded returns that just should not be there. An incorrectly formatted book of this nature should not be on the Amazon store at all!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I was a little nervous when I first decided to put this on my summer reading list. The book was 367 pages of text, close together, justified and not written in easy language (i.e. modern English). I was optimistically hoping to finish it within a month.But I really liked the movie with Keira Knightley and wanted to see how closely it compared and if it was as good as the movie.Two weeks later, I am done, and I am pleased with the ride.Plot:Mr. Bingley, an eligible, wealthy bachelor, moves nearby the Bennett family, who have five unmarried daughters. The Bennett family must secure good marriages for their daughters since they will inherit nothing when their father dies. Romance is in the air between Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, while the first sparks of love appear between the proud, wealthy Mr. Darcy and the exuberant, Elizabeth Bennett.Good:There are so many good parts to this book! I don't quite know where to begin!The characters are believable and real. Elizabeth is a well rounded character. She starts out proud and prejudiced against Mr. Darcy but as she learns of his true quality is not afraid of changing her mind. Mr. Darcy was sweet, opinionated, and equally prejudiced against Elizabeth's \\"poor connections\\".The plot was wonderful and well paced. It kept me on the edge of my seat (although it was not an action book); I couldn't wait to see what would happen on each page.I enjoyed the arguments between Elizabeth (and her fiesty personality) and Mr. Darcy (stiff and proud). The quips they came up with! The chemistry between the two was perfect!Lastly, I enjoyed how the author emphasized (via Mr. Bennett) to marry for love and not for money or connections or the like. This is something very much beyond her time (as many marriages in the late 18th century were arranged).Bad:Well, this is being exceedingly petty, but the language of this book makes it difficult for a modern reader to fully understand the nuances of what Jane Austen is trying to say (the notes at the appendix help with this, however).Dialogue/Sexual Situations/ViolenceNone. Talk is made of how Lydia and an officer run off to live with each other without marrying. None.Overall:Sweet. There is no better word for the free-spirited, witty romance between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. I would have to say this is the best, purest romance story I have ever read (besides, maybe The Princess Bride). The movie does a fabulous job with the book, but the book is even more enjoyable than the movie (if you can imagine). You will not be displeased with this one.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane is prejudiced and Mr. Darcy is prideful, or is it Jane is prideful and Mr. Darcy prejudiced, or do they both have a bit of pride and prejudice, which lends itself to a delightful novel filled with social boundaries, romance, disappointment, and comedy.The movie inspired me to read this novel for the first time. However, do as I did and read the novel before seeing the movie. You will not be disappointed. The first section of the novel introduces you to the character, setting, and social rules, as well as acclimates you to Austen's style. Once you have moved into the remaining sections, the book takes so many twists and turns that you cannot put it down. Even after my third reading, I still love the suspense of what will become of each Bennet sister."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham. Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"If you can help it, read this book before seeing any of the visual versions of the story. I couldn't help but put the visuals from the BBC mini-series version of the story everywhere.

Was I ever wrong!While the language is more proper and formal than what we are used to today, and certainly the customs and arrangements are very different, P&P; is in many ways a simply timeless love story about two people who seemingly dislike each other at first sight, but who are truly so right for one another. A century or two will not diminish this romance!At the heart of the story is the Bennet family, a family that has been \\"cursed\\" with five daughters and no sons to inherit the family's home and estate - - lovely, softspoken oldest daughter Jane, spunky and spirited Elizabeth, bookish, serious, almost dour Mary, silly, giggly Kitty and flirty, precocious and spoiled Lydia. Mrs. Bennet's sole consideration and worry in life seems to be finding appropriate husbands for her daughters, mostly so that once Mr. Bennet dies, she shouldn't be kicked out of her home with nowhere to go. It will quickly become apparent to the reader that Mrs. Bennet's favorite child is Lydia, mostly because Lydia seems the closest reflection to Mrs. Bennet's character herself.Into this story comes the Bingley and Darcy families - - sweet, good natured Charles, who quickly falls in love with Jane, his critical, judgmental sister Caroline, who secretly yearns for marriage to Charles' best friend, Mr. Darcy, who seems uninterested in the entire endeavor.As with most romance stories, the road to true love is a bumpy one. Mr. Darcy, although obviously finding Elizabeth attractive, feels that her station in life is beneath his. Elizabeth finds his pride and aloofness infuriating. Jane and Mr. Bingley, although in love, are torn apart by his sister, who believes that a marriage to one of the Bennet girls would be most unfortunate for her family. Add the arrival of Mr. Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins, who as the next male of kin will inherit the Bennet home - - and his frantic search for a bride and Mrs. Bennet's efforts to assist him; Elizabeth's dear friend Charlotte, a spinster of twenty-seven who accepts what life has offered her and makes some difficult choices of her own, in order that she might be merely content with her arrangements; Mr. Darcy's haughty aunt, and Mr. Collins' benefactress, Lady Catherine De Burgh, who has serious aspirations of her own to make Mr. Darcy her daughter's husband; the seductive Wickham, who shares a secret past with the Darcy family and catches the impressive Lydia's eye, nearly bringing downfall to the Bennet family.All in all, this was an incredibly satisfying story on all fronts - - a rich character study, an earnest romance, and comedy. The ending seemed almost rushed and an afterthought - - but perhaps because I had fallen in love with the stories and characters, I simply did not want P&P; to end.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This book is timeless and never grows old.

This has got to be one of the most romantic stories of all time.If you're not a Jane Austin fan, you will be within a few moments of entering into her world.For those of you unfamiliar with the story ~ (Do people like that even exist?) ~ Here is a brief summaryThe story takes place in Victorian England. We meet the Bennett family, the mother's sole intent is to marry her daughters off to successful men, ensuring they will be cared for properly since only males can inherit property. The story focuses on Elizabeth Bennett, the second daughter, who is attractive, but not as attractive as her older sister ~ She is also witty, smart, well-read and confident. Now we meet the wonderful Mr. Darcy. He is handsome and rich, but quite prideful and arrogant and rude. He is intrigued by Miss Elizabeth Bennett although he can't really figure out why. She mocks and teases him, and doesn't seem at all impressed with him, like every other female who has crossed his path.Throw in some other characters that help carry the story and you now have in your hands the most wonderful and romantic story ever written.Hmmm ~ perhaps I'm a bit biased.

I have never read this novel before, but have seen a couple of movie versions of it and really liked the story. This version had decent reviews, so I gave it a try. I was not disappointed.The reader was Kate Reading who did an excellent job capturing the characters and what I imagined the accents for that time and place would be. I found myself drawn into this novel and was always anxious to listen once again. I normally just listen while I'm driving but found myself listening at home for a few hours.Jane Austen's writing style and characters are very captivating. I found myself recognizing some of the characteristics of the characters in people I know and liked how she showed strengths and weaknesses in the major players. I especially liked the father's subtle sense of humor. I will definitely read more of her books.I strongly recommend this audio book for anyone wishing to enjoy literature at its best.

Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. First marketed as a romance, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" might today be labeled a romantic comedy. Its enduring appeal lies partly in Austen's biting and still relevant social commentary on the rituals leading to marriage as practiced in Regency-era England.\\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife.\\" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. The wealthy young man, Mr. Bingley, quickly becomes attracted to Miss Jane Bennet, the pretty, even-tempered, but reserved oldest sister. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets but immediately dislikes his seemingly haughty friend Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth is more interested in the charming young Army officer Mr. Wickham, who feeds her derogatory stories about Mr. Darcy that she is all too prepared to hear. As the relationship between Mr. Bingley and Jane deepens, Elizabeth is ardently courted by her cousin Mr Collins, an obnoxious and clueless clergyman. Elizabeth, to the despair of her mother, will not have Mr. Collins, who instead marries her spinster friend Charlotte. When Mr. Bingley suddenly departs the village without proposing to Jane, Elizabeth soon suspects the proud Mr. Darcy of curtailing the relationship based on Jane's lesser social status. While visiting Charlotte, Elizabeth is astonished to receive a proposal of marriage from Mr. Darcy, which she refuses in the most scathing terms.This failed proposal is the dramatic crux of the story. Mr. Darcy, mortified by Elizabeth's refusal and by her accusations with respect to his pride and his actions toward Jane and Mr. Wickham, writes a long letter to her. The letter, if not exactly an apology, makes clear that Wickham's accusations were false, and that Mr. Darcy's actions in separating Mr. Bingley and Jane were based on the perception that Jane was less enthusiastic about marriage than her intended partner. Elizabeth begins to realize that she has been guilty of prejudice as well, a feeling reinforced by a chance meeting with Mr. Darcy and his adoring sister at his home of Pemberly in Darbyshire. When Elizabeth's flirtatious younger sister Lydia elopes with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Darcy will have the opportunity to prove his character and his love to Elizabeth.Austen's novel contains a huge cast of well-developed characters and a series of cascading social mishaps, yet the story remains tightly focused on the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. They are attracted to each other fairly early in the story, yet are unable to appreciate each other's qualities for pride and prejudice.Underlying the humor in the social mishaps is a grim economic reality of Regency England, that failure to make a good marriage could doom middle class women like Jane and Elizabeth to a life of poverty. For Elizabeth's friend Charlotte, still single at 27, a loveless marriage to Mr Collins brings the saving grace of financial security. Lydia's elopement with Mr. Wickham not only disgraced her family but threatened to make her sisters ineligible for marriage as well. The Bennet family's lack of social standing and manners was a serious barrier to the making of good marriages, a fact less obvious to today's readers.Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" features a engaging plot, lots of excellent dialogue and two classic romantic characters in Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, a combination that holds up astonishingly well nearly two hundred years on. It is very highly recommended to fans of the various Jane Austen film productions as the entertaining source of the story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Classic, timeless, beautiful fiction. Perfect for young and old (I've read it a dozen times, but it was also a great gift for my niece to introduce her to classic literature)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end. Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends. This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see. They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively. There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed the sense of humour and the plot. The action is developing very slow so if you are not fond of this kind of a plot you might not like it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I know that my daughter will always remember getting this lovely book on her 18th birthday. A beautifully bound and illustrated edition of a classic story."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It took me a while to read it, about 2 months, because it's definitely not fast paced. I was glad I had seen the movie first because it made the whole thing easier to understand.Mr. Darcy is \\"pride\\" and Elizabeth Bennett is \\"prejudice\\". These two are made for each other, unbeknown to themselves. This is essentially the story of how they fall in love, with lots of twists and turns.I really like Mr. Darcy. He is the perfect gentleman. He is readily willing to admit his own faults, when they are brought to his knowledge. He also doesn't retaliate when rejected by Elizabeth and accused of things he didn't do or that are misunderstood.Elizabeth is also wonderful. She is doubtful about people and quite cynical. I really like that about her. It makes for some great banter between Darcy and herself.My favorite part of the book is when Elizabeth see Darcy at Pemberly. This is where I think she begins to fall in love with him. Pemberly is where he is at home- where is is truly himself. I would probably be charmed by him too!This book took a little commitment to get through, but once I got into it, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, even though I already knew the story. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Regency England."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I can't believe it took me until my mid-thirties to read this book. What is equally astonishing is the elequence Miss Austin was able to write this book at the young age of 21. Let me first speak to the well-done character development. The author does a great job of creating likeable, interesting characters. You have to love Elizabeth Bennet and her boldness. You must also love: Mr. Bennet's wonderful sense of humor, Mr. Collins' silly behavoir and what a haughty b*tch Mrs. de Bourgh is. Secondly, the author is very crafty in unfolding a plot in which the reader fully understands how their could have been lots of misunderstandings between Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Very well-written and entertaining. Don't wait as long as I did.

However, most of her works sound quite applicable and reasonable today as well, so many years onwards, i.e. after her. Nonetheless, her literary talent and skill are still unsurpassed. This story in particular is told in a very intuitive and psychological way, being very personal and touching, at the same time. The author is constantly flowing in the realms of human mentality, feelings and emotions; whereas keeping very sound and practical judgments on the wide social world surrounding the protagonist. Overall, it is a lovely story involving a whole spectrum of human moods, feelings and conditions, such as: love, romance, grief, happiness, longing, desire, rivalry, remorse, achievement etc."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Admittedly a challenge in verse from today's language... once beyond that, one is easily transported back in time and entranced by Austen's story-telling!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read.

Then the entire time you read the book you hate it, but you are sure there is some reason it's a classic. Finally, at the end of the book, you realize that you just wasted your time reading an awful book. Well, this book isn't like that. It's actually really great.

Definately worth the read over and over again"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There's not much new to say about Jane Austen though in my experience readers of classic novels either love her or hate her. When I was younger I found her books to be too sugary for my taste but now I find her work to be very enjoyable. Perhaps it comes with age :-). It's a great love story to read on a stormy night in front of the fire. Wonderful character development. If one prefers more angst I'd recommend something like Rememberance of Things Past :-)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"All of Jane Austen's writings are exceptional but Pride and Prejudice has always been my favorite.

It gives a great description of the period (19th century) and Austen's character development is wonderful. There are many lines often quoted today and many miss out because they never read the book. Her humor is subtle but witty. It's doesn't have the action of many books today but it is relaxing reading.The Kindle version of the book is good. It is clear and easy to read with good navigation (for a Kindle)."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Such a great read. The book and movie are both amazing. I would recommend for anyone to read this book. Jane Austen was an amazing writer."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old. In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails. Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered &#34;normal&#34; in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother. She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be hard to put down,"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"who doesn't love this book?

Congratulations, and hopefully always remain so and so retain the confidence that you deposited your customers"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I own both Insight Editions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and I only wish they had continued this series to include all of Jane Austen's major novels - Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club. It is a fun introduction to Jane Austen's books for those new to Austen, and it's just another way to enjoy this classic book and really feel a connection to and a part of the kinds of conversations of \\"Janeites\\" JASNA meetings and book groups. It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have always been a romantic. I\`m that sucker who is always looking for a great romance novel or movie to captivate me and make me fall into the wonders of love overcoming all obstacles. So, yes, you could say I have seen and read my fair share of love stories, but this is the best.I first read this book when I was 12 after hearing incessesantly about how it was such a classic and a must-read (and of course I heard it was a romance, so that little fact right there solidified any scruples that I may have had at the time). I was mesmerized.Yes, of course it was rather difficult to understand the language at first and I did expect that. Instantly, though, I read it a second time and I locked in with Austen\`s flow of words and the sensations that I went through while reading her novel were incredible.Elizebeth Bennet is such a fantastic and relatable character and I believe any woman can relate to her. She\`s dignified and witty, but at the same time she\`s shy and believable. She\`s never ridiculous or over the top. Mr. Darcy....where do I begin? The changes in him and Elizabeth are just incredible and no matter how many times I read this book I can\`t help but fall in love with them all over again. Mrs. Bennet is truly ridiculous, but she means well. Mr. Bennet is a man who always settles and never really has determination to go ahead. He keeps to himself, sometimes it seems like he even avoids the truth of things unless it becomes dreadfully grave. Nonetheless, a great character. Mr. Collins; What a man! He will keep you laughing at how absolutely ridiculous he is. And Elizabeth\`s younger sisters are truly precious. Jane and Bingley are sweet and endearing. Miss Bingley is the perfect &#34;mean girl&#34;. Mr. Wickham is delightfully decieving and really supports the phrase, &#34;Looks are decieving.&#34; And lastly, the Gardiners are easily my favorite characters after Elizabeth and Darcy.The whole plot is wonderfully paced, and I will confess that first time reading it that it may seem slow and boring. But, when you really take the time to delve into Jane Austen\`s world and understand the truths that she expresses with such precision that still resonate in todays society, you really become intranced. You really feel like you know the characters and maybe even recognize the truth in them and recognize people you know. Austen was insightful and really understood people and characters and the morals of her time. She was brillant and I really wonder what it would be like to have met her if she was alive today. Pride ad Prejudice is my favorite novel and I really hope this review has done is justice. This is the best of the best and it will forever remain my favorite novel.Thank you Jane Austen for sharing with the world your characters and your truths."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"love this classic!!! only, what's with the incomplete names/titles? eg: ----shire ? I've read my grans' copy of this and it did not have those...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am not sure why everyone is so negative about this timeless classic. Yes there are no big car chase scenes, no unusually attractive female that makes everyone go \\"gaga\\", or large scale destruction. If you can get away from this and look at the story with a open mind and conscience, you will get a story that is moving and just right for just about anyone. I loved it and I think that it never gets old. Slow is the way and steady is the hand that created this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"a true classic. i have always wanted to read this book, and i was not disappointed.Although set in the 1800s it continues to teach life lessons and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I adore Elizabeth and the fact that she is headstrong and opinionated in this time when that was beyond frowned upon. I like Jane and her shyness. I LOVED Bingley and his charismatic charm. I also really love Mr Bennet and his sense of humor. Mrs Bennet & Lydia Bennet on the other hand were those characters you alway wanted to smack in the face for being so stupid...like so:And then there is Darcy.... At first, like everyone else, I wasn't very into him. He was standoffish and he insulted Elizabeth behind her back mere moments after meeting her! Seriously, what is wrong with you dude? I was fuming as much as Elizabeth...but then you realize that he is shy and awkward when conversing with people he doesn't know and he does all this amazing stuff just to help Elizabeth. I followed Elizabeth right down the rabbit whole when she started to fall for Darcy.My only real complaint, oddly enough, was the prose. I truly did not expect the way it was written to bug me. I am an historical romance novel fanatic so you would assume that this would be right up my alley, no?But it really wasn't. Apparently I only like to listen to them speak this way, not read it. When I hear them speak, it's like aw! He is paying her an extreme compliment and using all these pretty words. When I read it, the dialogue I can handle, but the entire page of description that basically amounts to \\"they lived in a large house called Longbourne that had many rooms and a lot of land with woods\\"....well I wasn't so into that. And when Mr Collins spoke, I had the biggest urge to just yell at him to spit it out already! Seriously dude, pull your head out of Lady Catherine's ass and speak for yourself! Stop paying Lady Catherine compliments every other word! Trust me, we understand that you think she is the awesome.Wow...this is probably the crappiest review I have ever written, but seriously there are tons of reviews out there that really explain what this book is about as well as several films, so if my review has left you confused, please go consult one of them (or just google it) and they will answers your numerous questions."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this publishers collection of Jane Austen books, with all the facts, and side notes throughout the story it makes for a great read!"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful work.

Example of the life and times during this period, giving an insight of day to day living"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"There is nothing to say about \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that most readers don't already know. It is a brilliant novel from the pen of Jane Austen, and therefore should be read be every intelligent person. I already had a copy or two of the book, as well as countless film versions, but I needed a large print edition since I'm now old. And it's nice to be able to read the book without my glasses again. So if you're in your 40s and love this book, your home library or bedside table needs this large print edition of it."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I love this book and read it every couple years, now I have it at my fingertips, with the kindle app."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"As a high school student I was not sure I would like this book at all. This book was an easy read because of how well it was written and how much the story grabs on to you. Ever since reading this book I have gone on to read all of Jane Austen's book and found that they were equally as good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is an excellent novel that explores how love fits into a society consumed by an obsession with marriage. As expected from a nineteenth century British novel highlighting upper society, Jane Austen's writing uses a proper and sophisticated syntax. Working with the dignified tone, the syntax often coats the characters' bluntness and turns them into seemingly kinder remarks. These situations tend to be the most humorous, because the readers and the characters all know what is being said beneath all the comments. These dialogues also add important dimension to all of the characters. For example, Elizabeth is very witty and can uphold amusing and complex conversations with Mr. Darcy, but afterward her reflections show that she has insecurities despite her verbal strength. Without the depth of Elizabeth's character as well as the depth of the other characters, the novel would seem much longer and more dragged out than it can be at times. If the readers have the patience to get through some of the slower parts and can focus on the brilliant interactions between the characters, then they will be incredibly satisfied at the end of the beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I first read this book this past school year (11th grade), with a teacher who is an active JANSA Member (The Jane Austen Society of North America). The one thing I will always remember from him, was that in this book the characters are so real that you can see them in your everyday life. Along with my teacher we took a trip down to memory lane and saw all of Jane's characters in his High School (he wrote this as an essay he read at a JANSA congregation). And of course he ended by finding his Elizabeth, who's name is actually Jane (ironic isn't it?).I TRULY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Meet the Bennet sisters: demure Jane, witty Elizabeth, bookish Mary, impressionable Kitty, and lusty Lydia. It's the usual story: they don't have much in the way of dowries but need to marry upstanding English gentlemen...Elizabeth Bennet quickly emerges as the heroine with her wry sense of humor and take-no-prisoners attitude to social life. She puts all twentieth century heroines to shame when she tells off Mr. Darcy (while maintaining perfect decorum). Unusual twists and turns spark up the &quot;marriage plot&quot; of the book. There are some great villains, too."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Let this serve as a warning that at least one of the reviews below details most of the plot developments of this most endearing of English novels. In the unlikely event that you haven't already read Pride and Prejudice, and you like to have some surprises the first time you read a novel, you explore farther at your own peril."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I had to read this for school and at first it was really hard to get into it. After awhile, though, it seemed to get better. Some of the words were really hard to understand and I needed a dictionary by me. It is actually a really good book. I was suprised because a lot of people said it was boring. It was boring at first, but if you stick to it and make yourself read it it will get better. I recommend this book to people who like to read romance. The characters are very well developed and the theme of the story is good."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"With pride and Prejudice Austen has at last created a heroine that does not go to pieces at the first sight of an eligible young man. elizabeth Bennett's mind rules her heart not the other way around. thus Mr. Darcy who is attracted to her must first prove his love and loyalty before Elizabeth will consider him. this novel is one of austne's finest and I found myself captured by the story. In those days marriage was essential to a woman's happiness and thus she strove to do all in her power to find a suitable match. it is a task that frankly has not totally died even today despite all the social change that has taken place since this book was written. One has to wonder what Austen would think if she was alive today. the main message of this novel is not to rush to judgement in regards to others. A notion wich still holds great importance. Though at times a little too lighthearted this book nevertheless is an enjoyable read or in my case a listen. Naxos did a great job in making Austen's novel come alive. the narrator read the text with the right amount of tone and intonation and the classical music breaks between scenes was a nice touch. When it comes to audio classics noe one does it better then Naxos. I will have to buy more of Austne's work done by them.this audiobook contains 3 CD's and is abridged; yet i do not think i have missed anything in regards to the overall story. I found listneing to the book very pleasing and will be a fine addition to my audio library."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice is only the second Jane Austen book that I have read, but certainly not the last! Though the numerous characters and complex sentences provide the reader with a challenge and requires some concentration, the end result is definitely rewarding. Complicated characters and complicated relationships leave the reader constantly on their toes, and you never know what to expect next. What's so wonderful about this book is that the characters are so real. There are so many memorable characters in this story about Mrs. Bennet attempting to marry off her five daughters, and these characters aren't perfect, merely human, making them easy to relate to as well as laugh at. In reading this book, you see yourself in the same tough situations and awkward moments as them and realize that we sometimes forget that we don&iexcl;t have to be flawless. Everyone is proud and prejudiced at sometime or another; we aren't perfect, and it's okay!Though perhaps an easier read than Emma, Pride and Prejudice is similar in that it is also full of the same brilliant dialogue and subtle humor. This book is great for anyone who is interested in a romantic comedy that will that twirl you around with its genius and surprises."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"It seems like a simple statement. Mr. Darcy, the hero of our novel, simply doesn't have time to write to his overbearing aunt to inform her of his engagement to be married. But, like most things in Jane Austen, it has more meanings than one.I will be the first to admit that the plot of the novel is transperent. Anyone who has read a romance can see from the outset that Darcy and Lizzy (a.k.a. Elizabeth Bennet) will end up with each other. The only question is how, why, when, and who will be affected. To find that out, you'll have to read the story. I don't believe I'm giving anything away by saying that the seemingly sub-human Fitzwilliam Darcy (he's got quite a name, has he not?) will thaw eventually, and that Lizzy will warm to his new, altered state. For, simply put, the point of the novel is not the story, but the beautiful prose and dialogue. The deliciously satisfying banter of the newly-engaged Darcy and Lizzy in Chapter 18 of Part Three (some versions are not divided into parts, but I trust you can find this chapter) leaves you tingling with glorious anticipation of their soon to be union.The reader will thrill when he calls her &quot;Elizabeth&quot; for the first time (as opposed to a cold &quot;Miss Bennet&quot;), and the effect is somewhat heightened by his adding a passtionate &quot;dearest, lovliest&quot; before the name. For Darcy, despite his reserves, is a deeply passionate man.Back to my original point. There is something deeper in Jane Austen's seemingly silly and pointless escapades. The novel is an examination of human foibles (sp?) and follies, a critical probing of the pitfalls of society. Austen's points are timeless, for some things never change. In any case, when Darcy says, in response to Lizzy's inquiry as to when he will find the courage to write to his aunt, the despised Lady Catherine DeBourgh, who greatly opposes his marriage to Lizzy, that he is more likely to want time than courage, it means more than it seems to. He is saying, subtly perhaps, but he's saying it all the same: he treasures his time with Lizzy, and he hates to darken it with a cloud of impending doom. Besides which, he loves to talk to his fiance, and wile away hours wandering the country lanes in a state of happiness beyond that which he has ever known. Why waste the precious minutes writing to that stupid Lady Catherine, anyway?As you can see, a philosopher like myself can find reams of meaning in a simple sentance of Austen. If that isn't reason enough to read her novel &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, I don't know what is.--Child of the Burning Heart"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"The most striking feature of my experience with &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is the sense of overwhelming changes in society in the last 200 years. What was considered boorish and vulgar in 1800 would be considered conservative behavior today. The characters in Austen's work display such subtely of thought and self-restraint that it's hard to believe that humans once acted in such a way...."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Even though I am a guy who had accompanied his wife through every film relating to \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" I enjoyed reading the book. Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, \\"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\\"In my Kindle version random line breaks occur. For example, one often encounters \\"Mr. [line break] Darcy,\\" even when \\"Mr.\\" is almost the beginning of the line. Although this is a little annoying, the Kindle version can't be beat for price and convenience."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I enjoy Jane Austen as an author and I have always favored Pride and Prejudice. The digital version on Kindle has a lot of capitalized words that were not written that way and, with today's technology, it does appear to be shouting. Some of the words are missing half of the letters and one can only guess at what the word should be. The overall story remains one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. When I read Pride and Prejudice (at least once a year) it takes me to a time that I wish I could visit. The rich characters seem like true friends, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to spend an evening with The Darcy's."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Nothing short of excellent.

This was it. If you want to buy a new version of this classic book, I'd highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Pride and Prejudice, Jane's most well known work and for good reason. This book is a must read classic. It is a light hearted humorous novel that tells the story of how two people, Mr. Darcy, a conceited man of a much wealth, and Elizabeth Bennet whose family has no wealth to brag of and insignificant connections, fall in love once they each cast their prejudices and pride. This book overall was very much enjoyable from my standpoint."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this classic. I thought the language and different spellings (staid instead of stayed, for example) would be a hindrance at first, but I soon became so accustomed to the rhythm of it that it became a part of the story's charm. I thought the slower pace would be a turn-off, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed discovering the nuances of the relationships even more this way. I'm looking forward to reading more of Austen's gems, as well as other classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is my first experience reading one of Jane Austen's stories. I am only 1/3 of the way through, but am a huge fan already. Cannot wait to get back to the story. I have viewed dramatized versions of the author's stories on PBS and always loved them. I feel like I found a treasure chest full of gold! Thank you Amazon for the free Kindle downloads."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Each time my daughter and I read this novel, we discover more evidence of what an exquisite blend of entertainment and precision it is. Austen simultaneously captivates the casual reader with a page-turner, while amazing the serious reader with her knack for meticulously echoing earlier details when elaboorating on them in later pages."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"This is one of the excellent works that has to be studied for chosen words. I have studied it. I have checked all the definitions that I didn't know. She has used rich vocabulary that adds so much. If you don't check the meaning, you will lose on the context of it. You need to think constantly and be alert while reading. Words put weight on the meaning that when you're tired, you might not understand fully what the author has meant. Understanding its meaning gives you so much pleasure.The author states the situation the character is in by finding the perfect word to describe it. The words chosen were so perfectly used in given situations.Some dialogues may seem unnatural of the words spoken. Did people really talk this way? But after getting deeper into her work, you just get used to it like to the commodity in everyday life.I loved in Jane's work the development of the characters. It is extraordinary and so complex. The author has captured in most not an ordinary way of life back then making it in every sense very realistic.The feelings of being modest, shy, and lacking self-confidence when in love were perfectly presented. Readers who look for romance won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I sent my niece this book as a primer for the Jane Austen world. It is easy to read and understand, with a great type face. I recommened it for readers eager to immerse themselves in a simpler yet more complex time."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I've read Pride and Prejudice nearly every year for a decade and I have to say the Penguin Classics new clothbound edition is the best read I've had yet! The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"A treasure of a read. I certainly had some negative precognitions regarding this book but slowly these were eroded as were Elizabeth's sentiments and towards the end I was happy with the characters."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I re-read this book, at least once a year! i just love how Jane Austin gave true strength and a mind to women in an era where we believed to only be good to have children, she made us so much more.

A great classic to read over and over."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Really enjoyed reading P&P by Jane Austen. The dialogue was relatively easy to follow except for the occasional English coloquialisms and the characters were superbly fleshed out. Her social commentary regarding gender roles was definitely ahead of its time. Did find some text discrepancies/typos(they could have occured during the download, I'm not really sure?)but most enjoyable reading nevertheless. Am planning to read more of the classics."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I didn't remember reading this in school so I thought I'd give a try. It was free with my Kindle app. I thoroughly enjoyed it. A very sweet story that had you hoping for a happy ending."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I am a huge bookworm and bought this book specifically because of its fabulous cover. The book came in perfect condition and I am a fan of the ribbon attached, which can be used as a bookmark. Such a great book in a chic packaging. Definitely a great addition to the bookshelf :)"},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"Anyone who has read Jane Austen before knows that she's a fantastic author. She makes the words \\"good book\\" into flesh and blood. This is prime Jane Austen, complete with dry humor and convoluted relationships. The book itself is ok. I bought it from Amazon because I was close to the $25 free shipping rate. But a used Pride and Prejudice anywhere would be fine, as the gems are inside the book, and reading them is the whole point."},{"Title":"Pride and Prejudice","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice several times. I think that this is most definitely one of the best novels written in the English language. Jane Austen explores the relationships between different sets of people. At the age of 16, I was never really into the \\"Classic novels\\", but when a friend recommended the book, and I saw the movie (which does not do the novel justice), I decided to try. I instantly fell in love with the characters and Jane Austen's works. Elizabeth Bennet is truly an inspiring character as the story is told through her, and her interaction with other characters clearly shows Jane Austen's view on all kinds of love. This is a novel that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good read!"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:j},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],z={key:0},D={key:1};function S(n,a,r,u,s,i){const c=y("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(e(!0),t(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",z,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(E,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-95113075"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/61.md","filePath":"library/61.md"}'),C={name:"library/61.md"},W=Object.assign(C,{setup(n){return(a,r)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(x)]))}});export{q as __pageData,W as default};
