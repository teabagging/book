This story was attacking so many different subjects in the time it was first published, which makes it all the better to read. I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone, only people who can appreciate how the text of this book was written and how the Hardy wove many different ideas together to create a tragic life and ending for such a young girl. The impact of what happened throughout Tesses short life is what stunned me the most. Innocence or mentality? Only the author knows."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"What else can I say that the other positive reviewers havn't yet? It was wonderfully written and truly heart wrenching. It took a lot of guts for Hardy to publish it as well because it was was a very contriversial for its time and contains messages that can be carried over into today even.

It is hard to find the right words to express my feelings about this beautiful and tragic story. Tess, the lovely, tenderhearted milkmaid who, in the face of much adversity never gives up, is one of my favorite heroines in all literature. I could fully understand her dilemma, and that of Angel as well. It is true that there are times when Destiny is stronger than us, no matter how good our intentions."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel which focuses on the double standards of the Victorian era. It is a beautifully written novel about one wopman and her struggle to find love and her duty to her family.Tess was a child who sought to right her wrong by working for her &quot;cousins&quot; she hoped that by doing this she could become a productive member of the family particularly as the eldest child. She was required to take care pof most of the chores as her siblings were too young to help the family. As a daughter she was taught that it was her duty to marry wealth so that her family would not have to live in squallor. In her attempt to do this she was taken advantage of, but not raped, and she was made pregnant. She could not abort the child, and she could not properly carry the child to term without being married. She did the latter of these because she hated the childs father. Many times she wished that the child would die so that it would not have to live with the bastard lable. She felt that it was best that the child be taken from the earth to make her and her child's life easier.Tess soon finds that there is a doiuble standard for pre-marital sex in Victorian England. Her husband, on there wedding night admits that he has been promiscuous, Tess is greatly relieved by this because she thinks that he will be more accepting of her situation when she tells him, this is not so. Angel, her husband, walk out on tess and leaves her to fend for herself, an unloved and un cared for woman. This novel ends sadly with Tess' death after Angel comes back to her and they live happily for a number of days.This novel is an excellent example of social commentary in the form of literary art. This novel is a poinient dipiction of the life of a young woman in Victorian England. A well written novel with excellent character development one of the best book that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, unlike the description of the mixer included in a second user review, is a fantastic, if not incredibly difficult, book that is a must for any woman. It follows the story of a young girl who, in an attempt to help her struggling family, makes a series of mistakes that result in a loveless affair, an unfortunate pregnancy, the loss of a child, an estranged marriage, and ultimately murder. I was so caught up in the injustice of it all, that I scribbled responses to Hardy in the margin. In addition, the beautiful descriptions of 19th century farmlife in Britain are amazing. At times, this book seems hefty and longwinded, yet it is one of those rare gems that you suffer through only to find at the end that you are surprisingly satisfied."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Morality is subject to some rolling blackouts in this book. At the end, the law stepped in and made sure that the destruction was mutual. Law seems to be particularly inept in situations where a book is this hard on the reader, and those critics in the Norton Critical Edition who consider this novel almost a crime against literature have a point. If all the characters were being put on trial, instead of merely trying to live, the law would allow each of them to be tried separately because of the doctrine of mutually antagonistic defenses. There were parts of this book I enjoyed: Angel Clare sorting the cows for milking made a lovely theme. Hardy kept referring to the barnyard as a &quot;barton,&quot; but I'm sure he wasn't directing that jibe at me, personally, because this book was written long before I was born. I've been to barnyards that were as full of &quot;mulch&quot; as the &quot;barton&quot; described in this book, and Hardy is putting things mildly. I liked the part when Alec had been reformed and Tess discovered him preaching to the Methodists without thinking that he was any better for all the things he was trying to say. Somehow Alec getting on the other side of things was still Alec, and he would have preferred to be happy than to preach all the time. For me, the plot revolved around Angel Clare's need to find a place where he could get money without shame. Alec had as much money as Tess would ever need, and he wanted to give it to her in his own way. There is an early baby problem that Tess didn't tell Alec about until they had more problems than any novelist could make disappear. D. H. Lawrence tried to understand this book in unfulfilled male and female principles, and aristocratic principles which isolated Tess and Alec d'Uberville. I'm glad this book has been appreciated so long that I finally read it. It was an involvement that went further than just feeling like a barnyard."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover.

DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Having read a number of classics recently, I have come to the conclusion that many of them are \\"classics\\" because they are great books to study, not great books to read. I'm sure I could spend years dissecting this book and finding new allusions, hidden references, and coincidental parallels. In fact, I found myself forced to re-read and, in some cases, grammatically deconstruct such large portions of this book to \\"get\\" it that I could probably claim to have read the book twice with a pretty straight face.If the book had been just a little worse, I would have been spared a lot of effort because I could have just written it off as being bad. Unfortunately, every time I was ready to throw in the towel, Thomas Hardy would throw in a turn of phrase or new way of seeing something that made me decide to ride along just a little longer to see where this was headed.In the end though, I have to cast my vote with many of the low star reviews here. Thomas Hardy's characterization of the landscape, farms, and villages beats his character development hands down. The plot moves like a fault line (millimeters per year followed by sudden jumps) and, frankly, by the end I felt more sense of elation at having reached the last page than a sense of regret that \\"the President of Immortals had ended his sport with Tess.\\" For once, I'm guessing that the Cliff's notes would be a better read than the actual book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"WHY are poor, innocent school kids forced to read this intensly dull text?

I understand this book was written in an era when women were not strong but still...couldn't Hardy have given Tess some common sense?? This book put me to sleep more than once with its long descriptions of the same valley...and can anything else happen to Tess at the end of this novel? I think every bad thing that could happen to a woman happened to Tess...a bit melodramatic, maybe? I don't know how this book became a classic...was it classic for its ability to put somebody to sleep...or how about sending someone into a depression or fits of anger because Tess is a moron? If you want to read classics read Crime and Punishment or even Madame Bovary...I also had to read those this summer and I actually enjoyed them...so don't go saying to yourself the only reason I don't like this book is because I was forced to read it...I was forced to read those other books and I liked them.

Now I'm thinking she was switched at birth with some stranger. I won't go as far as saying I hated the book, (though I really did) but it's sure close. Tess is a brainless twit with no backbone and NO common sense at all. I wanted to shake her into reality. Even her own mother thought she was nuts for confessing to her husband (on their wedding night) that she wasn't a virgin, even though it wasn't her fault. Of course the self-centered husband can't even look her in the face and leaves her as soon as possible - sending her home to her mother. The book is all about Tess and every wrong turn she makes - not one good decision. I was disgusted with Tess and had to fight my way through to the end. I had to force myself to pick it up. I kept thinking there must be something good about the book - I was wrong.I have downloaded another Thomas Hardy book, I won't count him out yet, but if it starts being as horrible as this book, I sure won't force myself to finish."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I have read several Thomas Hardy novels starting with The Mayor of Casterbridge many years ago in high school and I never really appreciated the style and the fact that like other Hardy novels Tess is a love story and a very good story.

Tess herself is a dynamic character; but the novel as a whole becomes dreary and calls for skimming."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Thomas Hardy's second to last novel, published in book form in 1891, is considered by many (Hardy himself included) to be the finest novel by the great Thomas Hardy (1840-1928).The story centers around Tess Durbeyfield, a wife who is ancestor to an ancient and powerful family. She goes to live with some guy named Alec and falls in love with him or something. I never read it but have studied Thomas Hardy's works and that is all I know about this classic. I also know it has a very sad and tragic ending because I ruined it for myself by reading spoilers on wikipedia so don't ruin it by doing that, read it and reach the tear jerking ending, if you can survive a TOME! HA HA HA HA! (Of course you can \\"survive\\" this one. I was just cracking a joke about the length of this book. Thomas Hardy was one of the greatest writers who ever lived and this book proves it beyond a shadow of a doubt)The story attacks the role of woman in Victorian society and because of that, it wasn't really well received in 1891 but at least it did better than Hardy's final novel Jude the Obscure, published in 1895 (some sources say '96 I'm not sure) Jude the Obscure was hated so badly that it was mockingly renamed \\"Jude the Obscene\\" and Hardy stopped writing novels altogether and focused on poetry.This is essential Victorian age literature and is Hardy's most famous novel. Read it today!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was a little bit disappointed by Tess, but it is a good outlook of late Victorian Era on the progress of woman. It is a simple story of how a Norman family declined and rose and declined again. It is also about how a men can control the lives of woman. It is a good read for those who like a mixture of feminism wiht social history with a little romance thrown in."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The book starts out strong, but ends in an inexplicable state of affairs. English milk-maid meets the X-Files"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my oldest granddaughter.

And that is really what makes this book so grand. Its take on the double standards of the society in which fictional Tess lived may seem very distant from today's post-60's equality society, but it was very real then.The book follows Tess' journey through the English countryside, but what makes it so fascinating is the constant flow of her thought patterns as she tries to rationalize the hand she has been dealt. The modern reader may be befuddled, as her thoughts are representative of another culture and another time, but what is fascinating is the little insights on human nature that shine through. The joy she feels tempered by the despair in her past. The ignorant self-righteousness of overzealous youth. The mistakes that even very good, well-meaning people can make, without realizing it, that hurt others deeply. We hope for her as she lives through the initial tragedy, the slow recovery, the surge of joy she experiences, we are disgusted at the hypocritical betrayal that eventually leads to her final breakdown.The prose itself too has a personality, often taking time to smell the roses and indulge in the lush scenery, fascinating historical anecdotes and social interactions that Tess deals with on a daily basis. For those who over-glamorize the past, here is a very honest look at the physical and mental hardships people faced in it. Hardy quotes Ascham: 'We find a short way, by a long wandering.'"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I had to write a review just to bring up a rating that was unfairly knocked down by a handful of obtuse reviewers. I wasn't an English lit major like some of these reviewers, but I have read upwards of 10,000 books in my life -with a concentration on literature- and have to say that the descriptive writing in \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" is the most beautiful and poetic I have yet encountered. It is not the most exciting, nor the most stunningly transformative(that honour goes to \\"Altas Shrugged\\") book, but the construction and execution is exquisite.The book is in fact slowly paced - so much so in the first couple of chapters that I was rebuffed the first time I started reading it. However, a little patience will grant you entry into the gorgeous spell Hardy invokes. Yes, it is a \\"victorian\\" novel, but the sublimity of the writing and of the plot's tragedy emancipates it from the staidness of the genre.The upshot is that you shouldn't turn to this book if you want a fast paced thriller or \\"clever\\" writing.

It's long and the writing style is a bit wordy by today's standards, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. The story centers on poor, innocent, good-hearted, beautiful Tess who, at age sixteen, is persuaded by her parents to visit their wealthier relatives in hopes that they will help Them out financially. Tess gets taken advantage of by her sleazy \\"cousin\\", Alec d'Urberville, and returns home pregnant, her reputation ruined. Thus begins Tess's sad, sad tale. Tess eventually marries Angel Clare, a man she idolizes, but on their wedding night.... Well, I'll let you read it for yourself and find out what happen. The story really picks up in the second half, so don't give up on it.Tess, Alec, and Angel are all complex and fascinating characters. The story deals with issues of religion, morality, class differences, the changing English economy, and the double standard that pertains to men and women. It never loses its focus on Tess and her incredibly moving story. It builds to a devastating conclusion that I never saw coming. Have a box of tissues and a carton of ice cream at the ready when you finish this book. You'll need them!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess is one of the more depressive novels I've read lately. My wife will attest to the fact that I have a strange affinity to depressing stories. With that in mind, let me say that I really enjoyed this book.The writing was at times a bit too much for me for the reason that I get annoyed at many 18th and 19th century novels...namely, that Hardy focuses far too much on minute descriptions and in-depth analysis of setting and location. Don't get me wrong, I love a vivid and lush environment and I much prefer a fleshed out character to a flat one. I just sometimes feel that all of the flowery descriptions slow down the story telling element too much. There were a few paragraphs/pages that I tried to skim through in order to get to the next relevant points of plot. Still, I don't know that I'd want to edit out the descriptive text since it does comment on the narrative itself in a metafictional sort of way.The main characters in this book are wonderfully composed. They are absolutely and completely frustrating but they are superbly crafted nonetheless. I wanted to smack each of the main characters on many occasions.Tess is far too willing to simply be acted upon and then to bemoan her fate. Alec is an absolute pig (although towards the end of our experience with him, it's debatable just how awful he truly is). And Angel is far too inconsistent to be liked at all...at first he seems almost lovable...then he deserves to be hated...then he seems slightly adequate...then he becomes repulsive again...he's just far too wishy-washy in his behavior and ideals to ever be fully redeemable.The story itself falls into the realm of realism taken to its extreme. The plot elements felt almost like the Bible story of Job...whatever could go wrong willgo wrong. And even though Tess was generally found to be almost whining about her circumstances rather than trying to make things better for herself, the story was still rather thought provoking since it makes you wonder just how you would handle horrific circumstances and what can truly be done about them. Is it better to try and solve the problem or better to just let fate and happenstance take its toll.Personally, I try to make the best out of any bad situation...perhaps that's why I like \\"depressing\\" stories...they make me realize my life could be worse and they help inspire me to always think of the best possible outcome.I'm sure this book won't be for everyone. Those who want a happy fairy-tale romp through a girl's life would do better to stay away. Those who are easily frustrated by fallen characters, will find themselves hating all of the primary roles in this book. The book isn't terribly lengthy (~300-400?) but some of the longer descriptive passages do crawl by at times.Still, I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those who are willing to look imperfection and awful situations square in the face and come away smiling. It's not a happy book. It's not a terribly fast past book (which can also be frustrating...I wanted to shout Just do it to Tess many times).But it is a wonderfully rich book and definitely worth getting into.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Any woman who has been pursued by the likes of an Alex D'Urberville will appreciate with a shudder his sinister characterization. Hardy's pastoral description is beautiful as is his handling of diary life especially if one is familiar with such rural settings and labors.However, as Tess's persistently over-sensitive conscience regarding her past rumbles on and on and on, I began to wish she would find the river and put herself in it. But there are philosophical gems here and there such as \\"By experience...we find out a short way by a long wandering\\" that make the reading worthwhile."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy is a definite for anyone serious about literature. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is not to be passed up, it's a treat. I didn't find it at all over descriptive nor boring."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Having read Tess several times years ago and then revisiting it now, I am reminded how frustrating a book it can be: frustrating that Hardy's 19th century England could be so cruel; frustrating that Tess (and others) blamed herself for being ruthlessly violated at 16; and frustrated at Angel's initial behavior after he learns of Tess' tragic and blameless past. It's just too incomprehensible for someone living in the 21st century to relate to--and you wonder about Angel's incompatible behavior--for someone of his supposed character. As much as I love the pastoral beauty of Hardy's described vales and heaths, I loathe the society under which the characters lives are always ruined. The whole books starts to seem silly and tedious when viewed from such a perspective."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Although written well over a century ago, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a surprisingly modern novel with unmatched poetic beauty. The author, Thomas Hardy, jabs at the age-old issues of sexism, social class, and morality in this seemingly simple tragic romance. The heroine is the titular Tess, an elegant but unassuming countryside beauty from a poor farming family. Her misery begins when the family discovers that they are not the shabby Durbeyfields after all, but rather the descendants of the illustrious and ancient D'Urbervilles. But Tess' doom goes hand in hand with her heritage. Introduced to her newfound rich relations, she is forced to become the mistress of her cousin Alec D'Urberville. Naturally she is blamed for her \\"defilement\\" and resulting pregnancy. Tess of the D'Urbervilles cynically examines the high-strung, sexist Victorian society and the hypocritical Anglican Church, while simultaneously providing a window into the human soul. Hardy captivates the reader with his luminous heroine, a saintly creature forced to commit terrible deeds against her will. He questions the very nature of morality, asserting that neither society nor the church has the authority to judge virtue. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a masterpiece of literature--tragic and romantic, poetic and critical--a wondrously perceptive literary work. The reader is captivated from start to finish, from the opening imagery of the lovely English countryside to the fateful, deeply symbolic conclusion set amid the cragged rocks of the Stonehenge."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Deep. Tragic. Memorable.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a wonderful read and highly recommended. I had high expectations of this book and they were all surpassed after reading it. It is very moving and the story stays with you long after you've read it. It is also full of memorable scenes such as the one wherein Angel sleep walks with Tess in his arms.Read it. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles must be one of the most moving and beautifully written novels ever created. Hardy's writing doesn't just move the plot from one point to the next, it undulates and flows from season to season with Tess as her life flows from one point to the next. As has been pointed out in other reviews, it does have a good amount of pagan imagery and associations. Tess is dancing on May day (the first of May) when Angel and she first cross paths, Angel often calls her by the names of pagan godesses when he is wooing her at the dairy and she agrees to work for Farmer Groby until \\"Old Lady's Day.\\" The imagery that Hardy interweaves in the novel is even more pagan. Tess is virginal and innocent and hopeful, like a nymph or thing of nature. And even when she's no longer a virgin (a rather important event in the novel) she's still innocent and hopeful. Truly, she does not lose her hope until the very end and then she is allowed to regain it, if only momentarily. The hardest thing about reading this novel is that it is tragic, for Tess anyway, the whole way through. But that's the way Hardy meant it. And in the end it breaks your heart. But not in a melodramatic way, drawn out, Hollywood ending/Braveheart kind of way. More like the slice of the guillotine: quick, clean, but certainly not painless. It's definitely worth the time and effort to read this masterpiece of a novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Angel's perceptual turnabout comes a day late and a dollar short. In Hardy's Victorian world, the victim was the co-perpetrator. He had to justify to his audience that despite her technical loss of virginity, Tess was pure in essence. She was a victim of bad luck, particularly that of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I loved when Irving Howe remarked that \\"Tess is...goodness made interesting.\\" Unfortunately, Tess never got to appreciate or even recognize her goodness. She was so full of (unmerited) shame and a sense of inferiority. Angel's liberalism and code of ethics gave way to censure, and he reinforced Tess's self-doubts. He could overlook her being a milkmaid from the fallen D'Urbeville lineage, but not a victim of rape. That even a man like Angel would be influenced by the Victorian attitude (and not recognize the timeless double standard) is Hardy's sharp social critique."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess Durbeyfield is an outstanding character that overcomes several obstacles to find where she is trully from. She leaves her home to discover if she is a part of the weathly family-the D'Urbervilles. She does come across a distant cousin by the name of Alec. As the two get to know each other, Alec takes advantage of the young dame. Tess then leaves and find work. She finds work on a dairy. A young man by the name of Angel Clare grows quite fond of the young Tess. They both grow to love each other. As the book continues, Tess and Alec re-unite; but, she commits a crime to return to her true love-Angel. This is a wonderful novel of the heroine Tess and her fight through the early society of men dominance."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a rather difficult book to read and complete, speaking of the dull parts, but all in all, this is the tragic and touching tale of truth and hate.

Peer pressure and upbringings clash and combine in this powerful classic."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The most well known Thomas Hardy novel, is also the hardest to read. His writing sways back and forth, keeping you perk and alert, trying to understand what's going on. I had to keep on flipping back to see what I had missed. As long as you understand this book, you will like it. From any other point, if you don't like the typical average classic, this one will addict you.Even after I finished reading the last page of this book, I was still thinking: &quot; WHY?

It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This was a very chilling and creepy book to read, I highly enjoyed it and recommended it.

Unlike most classics, this book was very hard to put down."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess is a very difficult book and I would not recommend it to the average old contemporary reader. There is so much more meaning behind the birth of the rapist's child, and the break-up of Tess and her &quot;husband&quot; Angel. You have to read the fine-lines and &quot;footnotes&quot;. In other words, there is absolutely no way you could relate to this book, and anyways...why would you want to relate to books?

She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again.

It is so beautifully written that even through the frustrations and hardships the heroine faces, you are drawn on by the power of the language and the force of the story. Hardy was trying to make an important point in the writing of this story, and while such a tale seems unimaginable in today's world, it nevertheless resonates, particularly with women. Shocking in it's day, Hardy's efforts were felt. Tess is a provocative look at the plight of the 19th century woman, unnaturally naive to a world run by world-wise men. I'm not sure I've ever recovered from this book, and it has been a powerful influence in my own work.But yes, it's always wise to read the forward and preface LAST in any book, particularly literature."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A MUST READ! Although I was originally recommended this story alongside The Scarlet Letter on a reading list, other than the theme of love and extramarital pregnancy, Tess exceeds in every way. My favorite aspect is that it is intricately woven with complex characters that make the reader question whether they should love, pity, or hate each (or all of the above). And I love that the story is complete... almost a series of stories following Tess, flowing from one stage of her life to the next. I can't go too in depth with this review without giving away important details I think you'll enjoy discovering along the way. All I can do is recommend that every read Tess of the d'Urbervilles at least once!

The language was full of beautiful imagery and the characters were unforgettable. Hardy's use of birds and colors as symbolism provide a vivid picture of the novel. Tess's story is compelling, tragic, and beautiful. Despite the difficult language, once one begins to catch the flow of the novel, it is almost impossible to put the book down.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is the tragedy about a young maiden who is seduced/raped by an incorrigible Alec Stoke-d'Urberville. Her life from there only becomes worse. She falls in love with Angel Clare, who does not know her secret, so their relationship is doomed from the start. Circumstances and human nature drives the innocent Tess to unspeakable bounds, finally leading up to a murder and an execution. Like a bird, Tess has unknowingly flown too high and tragically falls from grace. She is the 19th century version of Eve. Hardy's subtle yet profound allusions to the Bible, more specifically Genesis, cannot be mistaken.This novel is one that should, or must, be read by all. It is a grand tale about love, fate, and the human condition. Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a classic novel because it never goes out of style."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is truly a classic. Hardy's use of vivid imagery to evoke emotion was magnificent. His ability to bring life to the scenes of the novel made the comprehension of the story much easier. The sad story of Tess' demise was provided with a great deal of emotion, which made the novel incredible to read.We follow Tess throughout her life, experiencing all the emotions associated with her horrific teenage years. We are able to see the progression of her character and the emotions that drove her all the way towards the end of novel. It was evident that Hardy used his keen ability to address his opinion of the imminent will.Hardy has done an outstanding job, and though Tess' story, he has addressed serious problems with society that have transcended to even this era. An outstanding job! To see that the only a few people have given this novel five stars amazes me! Tess was an extraordinary novel; the power of this work of literature is unlike any other. It is unique and a must read for any high school student. I'm proud to say that this novel was enjoyable and an interesting read. From start to miserable finish, Hardy kept my eyes glued.

I read purely for enjoyment (and sometimes education--read Lolita if you want to discover new words).In addition to what mulcahey said, the book is simply highly enjoyable to read. It's very touching. It's the kind of reading experience that will leave you thinking about it for days or weeks. The writing style is elegant and poetic. Anyone who has tried to write will appreciate the grace and beauty.It's not a light read, like something you take on a plane to ward off boredom. It's the kind of read that takes a little effort. The reward is definitely there, however."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) created one of the great heroines in all of world literature when his pen drew Tess in 1891. Tess Durbeyville is a poor girl in rural Wessex. Her father is a drunk with a weak heart. Her mother is childish and her parental skills are sadly lacking. Tess is the leader of the family. Her father learns their family descends from the aristocratic but decadent D'urberville clan who came to Britain with William the Conqueror. Tess visits a nouveau riche branch of the family. She is quickly seduced, drugged and becomes pregant by the evil Alec D'urberville.Tess returns to her family in disgrace. She baptizes the illegitimate child Sorrow who dies soon after birth. Tess travels to a a dairy owned by the Cricks. Here she meets Angel Clare the nonbelieving son of a ruralclergyman. Complications and irony ensue as in all Hardy's well plotted novels. Angel is a weak man who is a fallen angel on what Hardy calls this blighted star (earth). I did not care for him or his pious family!The culmination of the novel comes when Tess murders Alec; flees with Angel; is captured at Stonehenge and is hanged for murder. These are the plot developments but Tess is so much more.The book is a poetic prose masterpiece. Hardy the countryman provides rich evocations of the English countryside yielding its pristine beauty to the coming industrial age. Reapers and trains are intrusions into old Wessex's slow progress of the bucolic season. Throughout the novel I appreciated Hardy's hatred of killing animals and birds such as the poignant incident of the dying pheasants in a field following a wantonhunting expedition by humans. Tess too is hunted, hounded and caged like a bird entraped by her dire circumstances.Hardy fell in love with the fictional Tess. Who is she? She is woman!An earth mother; sacrificial victim; a panther; a temptress; an innocent country girl; a pagan goddess sprung from the soil of England; a mysteriious presence who is often pictured in the fog and mists. Tess dreams as does a fairy tale princess. Tess is a woman of strong passions inherited from the D'urberville family who kills and loves, laughs and sings, cries and rejoices in the complicated and tragic life she is given.The prudery of Victorian England disdained Tess causing Hardy much pain. He often had to change the text of the novel to assuage the prim souls of his editors. And yet Tess lives in the minds of the reader as the acme of his creation of memorable female characters. One can never really understand the multifaceted Tess; we can simply spend time with this fascinating witch and madonna. Tess will live forever in the minds of all of us who consider Hardy a genius."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess's father, Mr. Durbeyfield, is told by a minister that his family is the direct lineage of an old, noble family that was once thought to be completely gone. There's nothing left of the family's land and fortune, except the family name (d'Urberville).However, Mr. Durbeyfield and his wife see this as a chance to move up on the social ladder. They devise a plan to send their daughter to become acquainted with a rich woman who's last name is d'Urberville. From then on, Tess is left to try to maintain her dignity and honor and to pick up the pieces of her broken life that resulted from her parents' need to be important.This is my first time reading anything by Thomas Hardy. I was warned that he was cynical man, and I'll agree that Hardy's prose is cynical, yet heartrending. I couldn't help feeling bad for Tess through all her troubles. This is not a happy novel. For a moment, you think that things will get better for Tess, but the fates seem to be against her.The landscape of the novel changes with the mood of what's happening. The land itself almost seems to be a living person that he described.He uses vivid, beautifully described imagery to describe people and places in his novels. There are themes of theology (Hardy had internal conflicts with believing in God), virtue, the boundaries of love. He employs everything from Greek mythology to modern (or what was modern in his day) poetry.There are no illusions of a happily-ever-after in this story. This was simply a beautiful novel, a novel that portrays its female heroine as the strong woman she was. She could put more modern women heroines to shame."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place.

On the contrary, as soon as I had started to read it, I couln't put it down! This is a work of great depth and Hardy has an amazing way of expressing himself, one that really captures the imagination (like Dickens)! I heartily recommend this book for anyone, Victorian-lover or not.

I recommend, as she does, that the reader not try to empathize with the characters; it'll make you too angry. I wanted to reach into the book and strangle Angel a few times, for reasons that are obvious to anyone who has read the book.I must point out that one reviewer has stated incorrectly that Tess was &quot;raped.&quot; If she had been, the book would not have had the force it does. It would have just been another &quot;victim of society&quot; or &quot;victim of men&quot; book. Take a close look at Tess' confession to Angel on their wedding night.Think of this book not as an indictment of marriage and Victorian mores (although it certainly was meant to be, as &quot;Jude&quot; further develops), but rather look at it as the relationships of three people who are never quite able to understand themselves and their natures well enough to avoid disaster.

Her father, convinced he's the rightful heir of an extinct family of Norman nobles, the D'Urbervilles, is a shiftless layabout who drinks and lets his numerous children do his chores. The family starves quite pitifully until fate puts in the first of several appearances. Tess meets a rich young bravo who goes by the D'Urberville name and decides to merge his bloodline with that of Tess, no matter what she thinks about that.Alec D'Urberville is one of two men whose attentions cause Tess much heartache and make up the substance of the book. Actually, there are three such men if you count Hardy, which I pretty much do. Alec is a right cad and Angel Clare, the other man, manages the impressive feat of being much worse, but neither lays for Tess the snares Hardy does, of horrible coincidences, contrived reverses in character, and way too much tolerance for ill treatment. There's even a letter-swallowing carpet. Man, I hate when carpets do that!When Hardy isn't pounding poor Tess into the ground, he's doing the same to us, pointing out how Tess in her misery represents the nullity of our common existence. \\"She might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly - the thought of the world's concern at her situation - was founded on an illusion,\\" he writes. \\"She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a structure of sensations, to anyone but herself.\\"If only!Here's the rub. \\"Tess\\" is a pretty pleasing book to read if you manage to ignore or at least discount the plot. Hardy writes with great verve and knowledge about the world of his characters, fictional Wessex with its villages of hayricks and barn dances. At times it's like reading Wordsworth, and at others it's like reading Lovecraft. I don't know how else to describe a writer who can wax so lyrical and then shift into something darkly surreal and macabre without missing a beat. He was a master of description at the height of his powers in 1891 when he published this.\\"Tess\\" is also a deep book, with much Biblical allusion and symbolic foreshadowing matted into the subtext. Reading the novel with an online study guide helps bring out a rich harvest of Hardy's learned genius, as you can see the careful layering and connecting up he does throughout the book.Alas, it doesn't make the story itself any more digestible.Tess herself is hard not to care for, but she's frustratingly passive in a way that can not be blamed simply on the time and place where her story is set. She seems more of a piece with something Hardy was trying to say of the human condition, of suffering being one's lot in this vale of tears. You keep hoping things will turn around, but pretty soon you see the author has other ideas. Hardy pretty much wants her to suffer, so she does.Maybe in some imaginary alternative existence, I'll be treated to the scene of Hardy being called to some kind of literary court of law, answering for the misery he put me through here. I'll gladly waive my charges against him - only if they let me watch when it's Tess's turn to collect."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Ubervilles is sooo tragic! I can't even... So good, so romantic... so sad... so wonderful. Shakespeare's tragedies never EVER touched me like this! Promise me you'll read it! Just promise me!The most I can say in the way of analysis right now (and having just finished this story I probably shouldn't be writing this review with tears and the utter agony of human love and despair both streaming down my face) is that Tess is a classically tragic tale of what might have been but could never be. I hate to write anything so simple in the way of anyalyzing anything this vast, and there is no ONE LAYER or way of reading this story, but this to me is the overriding principle.That, at least, and the concept of what does it mean to be a pure woman/person? Clearly Tess was pure, even in light of all that had happened to her. What a fool Angel was to let such a treasure slip out of his hands, and what a hypocrite! I know I'm understanding this from an American, 21st century way of thinking, but come on, Angel?! Seriously!? You don't blame the victim for their crime, and YOU had done the same thing WILLINGLY! Blame yourself for bringing her to this end, you and the elitist group of fools you come from (author's note: I realize it's not very sound to be venting so much rage on a fictional character, especially one in a story particularly designed to make a social comment about the day in which it was written, but seriously, why didn't he just scoop her up in his arms and run away with her when he had the chance? Bad form, Angel! Bad form!)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I went into \\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" with full knowledge of the harsh fate waiting for Tess, but that knowledge still could not prepare me for how harrowing and painful that journey was for her, and the reader. The character of Tess is so moral, innocent, kind, and unselfish against the society that is anything but, that Hardy's message of fate and social hypocrisy reveals itself full force in the novel. Tess has a love for life and an optimism that takes the harshest and cruelest society to beat down, and that is heartbreaking to behold.I thought this was going to be a stuffy English novel, despite the fact I quite enjoy (most) Victorian novels I read. However, I discovered that Hardy's prose flows well and is even beautifully poetic. Some of the best lines come from Tess's mouth, showing that she is not only morally upright, but also smart and incredibly perceptive.Hardy has a great way with words; romantic scenes are intensely passionate, emotional letters drip with feeling, and narrations delve into the feelings and thoughts of the characters so that the reader can understand, pity, empathize and sympathize with them. Most surprising perhaps is Hardy's understanding of the female mind; I think he has developed Tess into a believable and realistic heroine, and he has many interesting things to say about the differences of the genders, especially during that time period.\\"Tess of the D'urbervilles\\" is a gorgeous yet heart-breaking novel. Not only does it entertain with its poetic prose and social themes, the novel also opens one's mind to the hypocrisy of the times; hypocrisies that even now may still appear in the thoughts and actions of people in this \\"modern\\" society."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I read Tess of the D'Ubervilles two years ago. I have read several of Hardy's novels and this is his best work. I recommend that everyone should read this novel.I am somewhat confused on some of the low ratings of this book and do not agree with the opinion of Tess. Tess is a strong woman who has weathered through some tough adversaries and situations. As with many books written in this time period, many women are weak, can not handle themselves and require a husband - not so with this novel.At the time this book was originally published there was much controversy and reviewers were very negative against Hardy (he stopped writing novels after bad reviews of Jude The Obscure). This is unfortunate since this novel teaches us many things about life and respecting people even after 105 years.Update:I have read most of Hardy's novels and still believe that Tess of the D'Ubervilles is his best work. I have since bought the Hardy complete poem edition by Palgrave and am looking forward to reading his poems (I like some poetry but not a total fan; I am sure I will his poems)."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The popularity of Hardy's Tess makes me wonder why the apparent context in which the book was written seems to have been lost. Twelve years before Hardy's Tess hit the shelf George MacDonald's Paul Faber: Surgeon received a less controversial if almost equally popular release. While the two books could hardly be more different it is interesting that the fundamental plot elements are identical. A careful comparison of the scene in both books immediately following the confession of the recently-married protagonist of her youthful indiscretion to her unforgiving husband will reveal a passage where Hardy essentially quotes from MacDonald--and then flatly contradicts him. MacDonald's Faber is a longer, more complex story--perhaps less accessible than Hardy's. Where Hardy finds despair, cynicism, and ultimately destruction, MacDonald mercifully provides forgiveness, hope, and evidence of the divine in humanity.Other reviewers have heartily recommended that you read Tess to discover how accurately great literature can portray life's struggles. If you liked the authenticity and poignancy of Tess but felt there must be another side of the story, please read Paul Faber."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later.

As her character developed she showed me what a fine line the Victorian woman lived --whether to profess her thoughts, will, love or to abide by society's wishes and be self-sacrificing and totally obedient to the man she loves. Without spoiling the ending, her last act was the crescendo of all of the small ways in which she held herself back. There were times that I pleaded with her to &quot;go to him&quot; or &quot;tell him&quot; but it would have been out of character for a woman of her day. Hardy kept us informed of the landscape, weather and all living things in Tess's environment, which I found breathtaking on many occasions. He painted the picture of his perfect woman. So perfect that he didn't want anyone to have her because he loved her himself. I enjoyed Tess very much."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"\\"I became acquainted with Thomas Hardy through another of his classic works, which lent to my curiosity on this one when the audio version was made available to me. It was an experience, to the say the least, hearing how the innocent life of this girl of late 19th century England played out. For no reason other than her own naivet&eacute; is she rendered with injustice and prejudicial attitudes of the day - Hardy's denouncement of his own country's false morals. In my view, all males of our current day and age should find this impressive work required reading, and then determine whether they are an Alec D'urberville or an Angel Clare. It seems we all fall into one category or the other.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"If there were more than five stars possible, this book would get about seven.

This one is a must-read, but be prepared to cry."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Please ignore the immature high-school student reviews and understand that this book is a masterpiece. Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental! This is one of the best books I have read and believe me, I have read a lot of the &quot;good&quot; books."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a book written in this type of literary style so I have to admit it took some getting used to. Once I got into it though I really enjoyed the story. There was a real sense of sympathy for Tess, a real sense of hatred for Alec, and a sense of &#34;what?&#34; with Angel that could not be denied. As the story was reaching its climax I found myself racing to the finish. The ending will leave you angry, sad, infuriated...Tess's life was so manipulated and in the end torn apart by family. Great story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Hardy cleverly divides this novel into \\"phases\\", like those of the moon, and each has its own atmosphere within the greater plot. It's a novel about the destruction of innocence with two of the most complex male characters in fiction; Alec, who seems like the archetypal pantomime villain but never abandons Tess, and Angel, the bad harp player who appears to be a perfect lover but who turns out to be a hypocrite of the highest order. The famous Stonehenge scene at the end is almost poetry, which is the way Hardy was heading in his career. It's impossible not to empathise with Tess, whom Hardy calls \\"a pure woman\\" in the part-title."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Great story. But so, so sad! It is one of those books that you love, but hate how sad the story is. You cannot help but feel for Tess as life seems against her at every turn."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book, while perhaps well written, is just so ridiculous and self-contradictory that it's maddening to read. While it's necessary to forgive him some annoying parts of his style as being a part of his age, one cannot overlook the horrible plot and characterization.Not one of the characters in the entire book is coherent or believable. He begins with a stereotype--the innocent country lass (Tess), the skeptical intellectual (Angel), the depraved rich dandy (Alec)--describing mainly their appearance and superficial thoughts, so that they never rise above the stereotype. Then, if they stereotype doesn't suit the plot, he'll simply have them act in complete contradiction of their previous shoddy characterization, without any explanation of how they might have changed. Angel's rejection of Tess, for example--he, the skeptical nonconformist who questions conventional social mores, suddenly repudiates Tess for being the victim of a rape, despite his own questionable conduct. I might expect that behavior from a conceited hypocrite, but not the all-around good guy that Hardy has made Angel out to be. And it's not like we've made a discovery here about Angel's real nature, because Hardy goes right on describing him the way he had before. Of course, he takes her back, which is perhaps believable, except that he has not a moment of hesitation when he finds out she murdered Alec. So when your wife tells you she was raped, you leave her, but when she kills someone, you help her to escape without even a second thought?Then there's Tess. She seems like a pretty resourceful and sensible girl right up to the point where Angel leaves her for a stupid reason and she spends the next five years or whatever pining for him. She writes him one scolding letter, and then regrets it. And even though she can't muster the courage to approach Angel's father, or tell Angel off, or rebuff the advance of Alec--although Hardy describes her as having \\"natural fearlessness\\" at one point--she can somehow stab Alec later.Alec, of course, is the one who first becomes a preacher because someone talks to him on the road, and then gives it up because Tess is just too darn beautiful. You'd think some more convincing would be needed for either conversion, but nope, Hardy can't spare any time for actual character development when he could describe Talbothays again.Finally, I can take an example from a minor character. At one point in the book Hardy describes Izz Huett, a milkmaid, as \\"by nature the sauciest and most caustic\\" of the milkmaids; a mere 20 pages later he describes her as \\"a girl of tact.\\" Did he read what he wrote before sending it to the publisher?Aside from the contradictions in every one of his major characters (and a lot of the minor ones too), there are also points in the book that are just plain ridiculous. I mean, Stonehenge? Come on. How cheesy can you get? Not to mention the fact that he sent sixteen cops after them so they could be surrounded in the morning. It's as if he put stuff into his book because he thought it would be cool. Same deal with Angel going to BRAZIL. Also, apparently Angel can pick berries with his whip. Hardy also tends to get carried away with his own writing. He once mentions the plains of Brazil (if by \\"plains\\" he meant \\"rain forest\\") and describes a cow's \\"large-veined udders.\\"Lastly, the book oozes prejudices about country folk and women--mostly to the effect that they're naive and ignorant. In fact, Hardy seems to share the prejudices of Angel Clare. In any case, this book is a lot of reading in return for all the reward of a trashy romance novel."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I'm a French student of English, in my third year at university. I have to read \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" for my British literature class and it's just terrible. The author spends so much time describing Tess' beauty, virtue, kindness and courage, that I wonder why her name is not Mary Sue. There is no character development : instead, we are told a hundred times that Tess' eye colour is somewhere between blue, violet, grey and black -- seriously, can you picture that ?Furthermore, the heroine's so-called \\"kindness\\" is nothing but stupid weakness in my opinion. Her love interest, Angel Clare -- who, for some obscure reason, is also loved by most of her dairymaid friends --, blames and rejects her for being raped, and yet she still worships him and behaves like his obedient slave, despite his cruelty to her. This is merely a ridiculous and unhealthy obsession, not a true love story.To my mind, the only likeable character is Alec D'Urberville. Although he is supposed to be the \\"villain\\", I find him rather funny and much less annoying than Tess and Angel. Too bad that Thomas Hardy did not choose Alec as the main character. The novel would have been more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"When i started reading the novel,i did't feel like droping it.I felt so touched that the herione of the novel could still carry on with life,and reconcile with Angel who is hypocritic about the religion he criticizes and yet practices when discovering the past of Tess who forgave him of his sin which could not be weighed with hers,but failed to do likewise."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"tom hrdy was a \\"wimp\\".

No more than anyone else, perhaps, but a decent few that i could get my hands on.I've never read Hardy, and though his style was different, it was not hard to follow. The flaws in his characters are realistic enough, but it is those flaws that made me dislike the book. Tess is a simpering simpleton who should be smarter than she is. Angel is a Devil, who is the most hypocritical, bigoted, delusional idiot that walked in the book. The evil man, Alec D'Urberville, was terrible, but his evils could be comparable to Angel's. And in the middle is the lost child Tess, who can't be counted on to have a milliliter of sense or perception concering people throughout the entire book. She worships Angel, and blames herself for her rape, because Angel blames her despite his insisting that he doesn't.The plot could have been better, the characters could have been likable, and for God's sake it could have been less repetitive.

I have been thinking about it ever since I finished it. Few novels have evoked so much emotion in me. Tess makes me feel sad, frustrated, and angry.Tess of the Durbervilles is the story of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of poor, alcoholic parents who learn that they are of a noble bloodline and send Tess off to work for her noble \\"cousin\\" Alec Durberville. While there, Alec rapes Tess and she has his illegitimate baby. This event ruins Tess's life. She is no longer pure, and virginal, and therefore brings shame upon her true love Angel Clare when her past is revealed.It is hard to believe, in this day and age, that Tess is shamed and ostracized because she was the victim of a horrible crime. Hardy's novel is a powerful statement on the questionable morality of Victorian society. Tess, who is a heroic, brave, caring, selfless woman, is not worthy of Angel because she is somehow impure due to the rape. Angel, who has lived with a woman out of wedlock and is clearly not a virgin himself, feels justified in punishing Tess when he learns of her past.The writing is beautiful, but the story tragic. It will stay with you a long time."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I love all of Hardy's books but this is my favorite thus far. The ending is definately not what I expected and I could not stop thinking about it for days afterward. It is a break from his earlier works in that things do not really turn out for the better in the end. In typical Hardy style, people and events in the main characters past come back to bite her in the behind at the worst moments. This story is like a powder keg which is gradually packed over time until the fuze is lit and everything explodes into a million pieces."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I think Thomas Hardy is an interesting mixture of romantic poet and social realist novelist although his dramas take place in primarily rural settings. The poetic strain in Hardy's temperament makes him romanticize some of the same things the romantic poets did. For instance few settings in his work are more powerfully evocative than a ruin. And his sense that we are at the mercy of both nature and our own emotions makes reading a Hardy novel a bit like reading romantic poetry. So if you like romantic poetry especially the bleaker of those poems you will like Hardy's novels. Tess was made into a great film by Roman Polanski in 1979(and another more recent film version appeared on A&amp;E) and it is hard for a Victorian novel to compete with that kind of entertainment but what the novel has that the movie versions do not is Hardy's descriptions of landscape. You may remember a scene from the (Polanski)movie when Tess is walking through a field and as beautiful as that scene was visually it is even more beautiful to read Hardy describe it poetically linking Tess to nature in a very sensuous prose passage. Hardy is not known for his optimism ( most romantics aren't after all so very optimistic) and both his prose and poetry seem to seek out the starkest surrondings and settings to offset and emphasize the fleeting nature of those rare moments of beauty. If you like spending time in the country this novel is a kind of hike back in time and into the countryside where men and women live out their days affected by forces they cannot altogether explain and that conspire in ways that do not lead down the rosiest of paths. Most of the men in this novel are weak, but Tess's strength which is perhaps linked to her heritage makes this an unusual and powerful story. She is perhaps the best bit of poetry Hardy ever came up with. She is certainly the strongest thing ever to appear in a Hardy landscape."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I will admit that I read this for an advanced high school English class last year, making me one of those notorious 'immature high school reviewers.' However, I'm an English major, and I try to give each book an equal chance and see how they fared in the end. Well, here is Tess:I'm a reader who minds terribly when realism is outweighed by drama and romance. It sounds terrible, I know, but I prefer realism, and become frustrated when there's too much drama and love in a book. 'Too much' is a matter of opinion, of course, but in my opinion, Tess contains too much. It begins to sound overly-Victorian. One bad, dramatic thing after another takes place, and each occurrence seems forced, as though Hardy pushed it onto the paper to further the development of another bad thing. You could say that this is called *plotting*, but it comes across to me as bad plotting.Remember, this is coming from a person who prefers Edith Wharton and John Dos Passos as their recreational reading. Drama and fiction are all okay in my book, but too much of anything is bad. Hardy needs more moderation, in my opinion. So to finish fairly, I'll say that Tess of the D'Urbervilles makes a great dramatic Victorian novel with a beautiful tragic message. However, readers like myself, who are frustrated by large amounts of romance,tragedy,and beauty, will agree that two stars is a perfect rating."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Much else has been said.

Her family sets about trying to better their situation by having Tess approach their distant relatives; unfortunately, this decision results in Tess meeting the devious Alec d'Uberville, who agrees to help Tess, with the intent of seducing her. Despite being the victim, Tess is the one who will pay over and over again.Hardy has created a genuine masterpiece. The characters are complex - even the seemingly simple Tess. The incredibly sad story is used to explore human nature and the ways in which people treat each other. I found myself highlighting passage after passage of the book and noting the fundamental human truths Hardy describes. I was particularly struck by a passage in which, after her seduction, Tess ponders, \\"The past was past; whatever it had been, it was no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over them.\\" She further muses, \\"To all mankind besides, [she] was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no more than a frequently passing thought.\\" How true, but unfortunately, Tess' past would never stop haunting her.When Tess meets the aptly names Angel Clare, she thinks that she has finally put the past behind her. Angel accepts her unquestioningly. Once again, though, fate intervenes and Tess is made to suffer for her past misdeeds, which are not really even misdeeds. At times, her victimhood is a bit much, and Tess appears weak, but her treatment is reflective of the sexual mores of the time, and Tess's willingness to endure mistreatment to protect her family and others is noble. The plot marches toward tragedy, with Tess managing to miss every opportunity for happiness. A truly devastating book.Note: This review is for the Kindle Duke Classics version. The text has fairly few noticeable errors aside from a few scattered misspellings. Occasionally, a paragraph has not been indented properly. However, these problems are minor and do not impinge much on the reader. The only major issue is that the Table of Contents is not linked, which is a hassle with such a long book. It is also decidedly no-frills -- no introduction, no appendix, bland cover."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I purchased the movie and wanted to read the book also.

Because of the bleeping Introduction, which gives everything away! Please!

I read a lot of books on my Kindle and am very happy with it, but there is something so very seductive and special about this hardover edition with the pretty sheaves of wheat (red, of course...that crops up a lot in this story!) and I love the little red satin bookmark that is included.

It reflects the lifestyle of the 19th century-- women didn't have many rights back then, men being superior in every aspect. Communication was not very fast and effective, increasing social and personal isolation.The main character, Tess, is a very credulous and naive daughter of a poor cottager. At the beginning of the book, the cottager learns that he is a descendent of Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles. The cottager instantly thinks of himself as a rich man because of the money his relatives have, and celebrates the great news by going to a bar to drink. When their dad doesn't come back from the bar, Tess and one of her many younger siblings go to get their dad from the bar with their family's horse, Prince. On their way to the bar Tess and her brother fall asleep and lead Prince to a near fence with sharp nails, causing Prince to stab himself on the chest with the nails and dies. Tess, feeling guilty, agrees to go to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles so that she can work to help the family. It turns out that the 'relatives' living there were just trying to build position for themselves and had bought the name\\"d'Ubervilles\\", a secret that no one knows until too late.While working at the D'Urberville Tess meets Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her endlessly until he gets what he wants. Tess goes back to her home village and learns she is pregnant, but soon loses the unwanted baby. Trying to make a new start, she goes to a farm where she makes a few friends and learns basic farm work. She falls in love with Angel, the son of a minister, who chose the peaceful farm life in hopes of running his own farm some day. It seemed like Angel did love Tess, but didn't want to really know her. Tess then gets into a self conflict where a part of her wants to tell Angel about her past, but the other part just hopes to keep it a secret. They get married, and that same night, Tess makes up her mind, thinking that Angel will accept her past if he really loves her because he had been in a similar situation before. But, unfortunately, Angel refuses to give her a chance and leaves to another country. This episode describes a traditional, but altogether hypocritical, male attitude towards females.The character development is realistic, Tess gets stronger and more mature as her life gets harder. At the beginning of the book, Tess was this a fragile and somewhat responsible girl who cried very easily and as the book ends, she shows her strong side where she can actually defend herself. In my opinion, she was a good daughter who cared about her family even though they used her as a source of money. Her parents, in contrast, are selfish, trying to earn money the easy way.As one reads this book, the impression emerges that Tess' love for Angel was greater than his love for her. Angel wasn't 'innocent' when he married Tess, yet he was disgusted by her past. If he hadn't left her, then she wouldn't have gone to Alec to help her family and she wouldn't have died a tragic death. Thus, this insensitive man was actually responsible for the tragedies of other innocent people. I believe that Tess' love for Angel was somehow 'greater' because even after Angel leaves her for months, she accepts him back and even kills someone to be with him. In this way, Hardy suggests that women are actually are actually more steadfast and strong in their love.Tess' death was unfair if we think in modern day terms. Alec had pursued her, ruining both her marriage and her entire life. The books describes how Alec and Tess get into a fight when Angel comes back for her. Tess killed Alec for both revenge and self defense, but British justice did not acknowledge that and executed her. Again, we have a criticism of social rules and practices which treated women unfairly.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is a tragic novel which will make readers feel gloomy, sad and upset for quite a while. It is definitely not the best read for summer, or in that case any other time of the year if the reader seeks pleasing entertainment.It will, however, make readers think deeply just how different the whole system of justice and society operated in the past and how much has changed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I'm not going to write a long, flowery review.

Without a doubt, this is the most probing and moving novel I have ever read in my entire life. It hit areas of my heart and mind as no other book ever has, especially in terms of being a woman. It was never required reading in any area of my schooling, even college. Yet as a former administrator, grade advisor, and mentor in a private school, I now realize that many of the students were required to read this book, but I never thought of reading it to discuss it with them; what a mistake. Had I known, this book would have been an invaluable tool for bringing out the horrors of the double standard.Every man, woman and child alive should read this book to find out the true sentiments of a woman who is brutalized sexually and mentally and shunned, not only by the man in question, but by the community, her family, the clergy, and ultimately, the man who claims to love her. How she deals with a \\"shame\\" that has been thrust upon her is crushing, and brings to mind that even in this 21st century, the double standard has not changed one iota, not even in the biggest of cities, regardless of what we see and hear in books, films and music. Go into any neighborhood, in any town, and in any city, and we see that this still exists. Tess of the d'Ubervilles walks among us even today, for she is still whispered about."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"A very good story once you get used to the old English language.

I spent the whole time rooting for the heroine and, if you've read the book, you know exactly how that turned out. Now to find a classic novel without a depressing ending."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Man... I thought that The Return of the Native was good...Tess of the d'Urbervilles by the Great Thomas Hardy was a very long novel for me. Hardy's scope and incredible projection of Wessex was very admirable and how he presents Tess as a person is very beautiful.The novel begins with Tess' father learning that his family, the Durbeyfields is descended from a long gone ancient regime, the d'Urbervilles. I really love how Hardy makes you feel like this is the ultimate cross for Tess and her family to bear. How Tess grows to hate this fact. After the Durbeyfield's horse is impaled, yes impaled, when Tess and her brother are trying to deliver something that her father is too ill (or too drunk) to deliver, Tess blames it all on herself and is sent to work on the manor that her parents think that her \\"cousin,\\" the cruel Alec d'Urberville resides in. A great Hardyan lustre of that element of the story is that Alec d'Urberville's father just bought that name after lookin it up in some book, so Tess falls into a trap of fate and is continually punished. Tess' whole life is told through the novel and is filled with very tragic scenes, so if you like feel good books, stay away from this one.This novel is full of beautiful and moving tragedy, incredible projection of Victorian rural life, and just about everything Hardy can give you in one novel.Definatley essential Victorian Literature, definatley essential Thomas Hardy, and without question one of the greatest novels ever written....Only a poet could've written such a beautiful novel..."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book is wonderful for many reasons and especially for its portrayal of Tess. It raises questions (still pertinent today) about women, reputation, and sexuality in society. Hardy was certainly ahead of his time in pointing out that we do as much harm to women with prudishness and double standards as we do with physical and sexual violence. Don't miss _Jude the Obscure_ and _The Mayor of Casterbridge_."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles,&quot; by Thomas Hardy, is a book about a young woman who struggles to find her place in society. When it is discovered that the low-class Durbeyfield family is in reality the d'Urbervilles, the last of a famous blood line that dates back hundreds of years, the mother sends her eldest daughter, Tess, to beg money from relations with the obvious desire that Tess wed the rich Mr. d'Urberville. Thus begins a tale of woe in which a wealthy man cruely mistreats a poor girl. Tess is taken advantage of by Mr. d'Urberville and leaves his house, returning home to have their child, who subsequently dies. Throughout the rest of this fascinating novel, Tess is tormented by guilt at the thought of her impurity and vows to never marry. She is tested when she meets Angel, the clever son of a priest, and falls in love with him. After days of pleading, Tess gives in to Angel and consents to marry him. Angel deserts Tess when he finds the innocent country girl he fell in love with is not so pure. This touching story depicts how difficult it was being a woman in the 1800s.There are many reasons to recommend &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles.&quot; It is a story one can easily relate to. If anyone has ever suffered prejudice, then he/she will want to read this book. The book is also thought-provoking. &quot;Tess&quot; is also interesting in that the author gives the point of view of all the characters in it, not simply that of Tess. This means that the reader gets a better understanding of the plot. Thomas Hardy writes in an eloquent and descriptive manner.&quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; does have perceived flaws. It has been described as rather verbose, but one finds that this is not the case, and that the details only add to the book. The plot is tragic, which might make it depressing to read. However, one finds that it is tragic in a beautiful and compelling sense, not in a sad sense. &quot;Tess of the D'Urbervilles&quot; is a book that will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I had been meaning to read Tess for years and finally did this past week. I was mainly disappointed. The book starts off well...but it seems that 2/3 or so of the way through, the author became rushed....and the story becomes so slapdash and contrived I could not believe in the situations and definitely could no longer believe in the characters.The second quarter of this book, when Tess is at the dairy farm, is the strongest part. Hardy slows down; we believe in the characters and most of the emotions, and there is some wisdom and beautiful writing to be found here.After this point, it is, sadly, all downhill... I kept throwing up my hands in disgust."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I don't think that Tess of the D'Urbervilles is to be considered a realistic portrayal of life. It is more like a Greek tragedy or Shakespearean tragedy. The characters are larger than life and the events of the book mythic in scale. Nevertheless, just like with, say, Macbeth I was drawn into the plot and actually found myself getting angry and upset about the turn of events. So I got my money's worth. Hardy definitely has cast this story very darkly. Tess is no mere innocent victim. And Alec is not so clearly just an evil villian. Nor is Angel an angel. The characters are complex and deep, and the reader ends up caring about them. That's why this book is a classic. See the A&amp;E adaptation in film for a fascinating and moving interpretation."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was required to read this book for AP English IV.One of the best books I've read for class all year.

Never again be whisked into this particular world so far removed from my own and yet so heart-wrenchingly close. Never again turn the pages of Tess of the D'Urbervilles with baited breath and a longing ache that realistically shouldn't stem from mere fiction.Phenomenal, this work of Thomas Hardy's is.Not since reading Jane Eyre have I been so totally immersed in the life of a character, so in tune with her sufferings and joys, so hopeful yet fearful for her future. Tess seems so real, sometimes pathetically so, but always wishfully so. Her story is a sad one, but it brings with it its own reward.I almost wish I could have stopped reading at a point before the ending, so I would be free to imagine my own perfect conclusion. Or better yet, so Tess could live on, could still have that elusive chance at fulfillment and lasting joy. But Mr. Hardy's ending is the best one, the most fitted to the rest of the book. Still, I was shocked. I think the ending just increases the tantalizingness of the book though.So anyway, this book deserves at least seven stars, but only five are given, so. . . read it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'urbervilles is truly one of the masterpieces of 19th century English literature. Thomas Hardy's writing is simply brilliant, and poignant.Thomas Hardy imagines a new way of being for British society. One that is not so hung up on narrow social conventions, one where people are rewarded for hard work and positive moral attributes.SPOILERS BELOW!Tess is supposed to be the embodiment of this new society as it comes into being, but runs into trouble at every step of the way in her development. Her parents do not work as hard as she does, she is cruelly seduced, her baby is cruelly denied a Christian burial, even her true love Angel Claire rejects her because of her past and the narrow social conventions he has been brought up with. And in the end, she dies, a Christ figure for Hardy's new society, with Angel and her sister \\"apostles.\\" The ending is even slightly ambiguous...What will Angel and Liza Lu do? Will they advance Hardy's new society?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy was written in 1891 and challenged the Victorian sensibilities of the time and to this day it offers much to the reader. It is a book which has intense atmosphere, character development, romance, an interesting storyline and yet still gives us much food for thought.At the start of the book our beautiful heroine Tess is a teenager of a poor family with a father who is an alcoholic. She is a young woman who always tries to do the best for her family which lands her in trouble. Tess is eventually raped and gives birth to an illegitimate child. That she remains a good person who still tries to do her best and is a heroine of a book was shocking at the time of publication.In many ways it is obvious that Tess' story is going to end tragically. Even while we root for Tess and grow to admire her courage and perseverance we are aware that it is against all odds. This then provokes interesting questions about how the story would appear in today's world and the moral questions involved in contemporary society.Growing up as a farm girl, I enjoyed all the interesting details about the various types of farming in the late 19th century England. I loved the descriptions of the walks and travels by coach across the rural countryside."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"'Tess' is a beautifully-written classic that kept my kindle dictionary busy. It is a story about how painful and unfair life can be, and especially to those who are by-nature the most loving, kind and sensitive. You will fall in love with 'Tessy' and wish only the very best for her. Be forewarned, however, that Hardy wrote very little of the 'best' you will wish for Tess into this story. As a result, you may want to delay reading this book until you feel 'up' for reading a very sad and tragic tale. That caveat aside, 'Tess' is an exceptional work of literature, and a book you aren't likely to forget.Caution: Amazon has posted an editorial review that gives far too much of this book away. If you plan to read 'Tess,' I don't recommend reading its editorial reviews."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I was looking for another edition of TESS and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the \\"average customer rating\\" was only three stars. So I'm taking a moment to correct the balance.TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES must be as close to a perfect novel as anyone has written in English. It is a genuine tragedy with a girl/woman as tragic hero. It is about life on earth in a way that transcends mere sociology. It has the grandeur of Milton but concerns itself with the lives of mortal beings on earth, as much with sex as with dirt, blood, milk, dung, animal and vegetative energies. It concerns itself with only essential things the way the Bible does. It is almost a dark rendering of the Beatitudes.The story is built with such care and such genius that every incident, every paragraph, reverberates throughout the whole structure. Surely Hardy had an angel on his shoulder when he conceived and composed this work. Yet it was considered so immoral in its time that he had to bowdlerize his own creation in order to get it published, at first. Victorian readers were not prepared for the truth of the lives of ordinary women, or for a great many truths about themselves that Hardy presents.The use of British history as a hall of mirrors and the jawdropping detail of the landscape of \\"Wessex\\" make it the Great English Novel in the way we sometimes refer to MOBY DICK as the Great American Novel, though the works don't otherwise bear comparison. Melville's great white whale is a far punier creation.Hardy's style is like no one else's. It is not snappy, as Dickens can be. It is not fluid and elegant, like George Eliot's. It can feel labored and awkward and more archaic than either. It has no journalistic flavor, but is painfully pure and deliberate and dense, echoing Homer or the language of the Old Testament rather than anything we think of as \\"modern.\\" Don't start with TESS but with FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD, another very beautiful book, where Hardy is at his loosest and wittiest. Once you have the key to his style, then pick up a good edition of TESS with notes, e.g. Penguin, so you get the full richness of all the literary allusions. Hardy's lowly shepherds and farmhands move and breathe in a very ancient literary atmosphere. The effect is not pretentious but timeless.There is wisdom, poetry and majesty here. Tess stumbling through the dark and taking her last rest at Stonehenge will send chills up your spine like no other reading experience. I wonder if anyone can know why there are novels, why we care about them, or what they are capable of, without reading this one."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best stories I've ever read. Its characters, especially Tess herself, are so alive and memorable that they stay in your mind long after you've finished the book. That being said, though, it's also not a novel for the casual reader. This book is so thought-provoking and, ultimately, heartbraking that it can't be easily forgotten, and will more than likely leave you with an overwhelming sadness for a long time afterward. I read a lot, and material with very different subject matters, so I'm not being melodramatic when I say that this book left me extremely choked up, and almost on the verge of tears. For a guy in his mid-20's who never gets emotional, I think that's saying quite a lot. It certainly left me with a lot of respect for the author. The reader comes to care so much about Tess, and agonize over the way her life turns out, that it becomes almost unbearable at times. For a fictional tale to have that effect on a person is quite incredible. Difficult or not, anyone who is interested in reading a brilliant and moving story that deserves to be called a classic should read Tess of the D'Urbervilles."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Recently, my brother and I were discussing the \\"poverty penalty,\\" the concept that the poor pay more for what they must buy because they have no bargaining power to invite competition, which drives down prices. This is obviously not a new phenomenon, because poor Tess Durbeyfield pays quite a poverty penalty through the course of Tess of the D'Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy.This is the first novel of Hardy's I have read, but I chose it after reading \\"What Jane Austen Ate and Charles Dickens Knew\\" by Daniel Pool, a fabulous book about 18th century daily life.Hardy's title, as quickly becomes evident, is tongue-in-cheek (he is author of my favorite title of a book, Jude the Obscure, which I haven't yet read) is ironic and mocking. Tess, the lovely and somewhat educated daughter of a cottager in Hardy's British district of Wessex, has the last name of Durbeyfield, but in the first pages of the book, her father, the ne'er-do-well, learns that he is descended from Norman aristocracy, the D'Urbervilles, and there aren't many of them left, except his clan, as the local reverend informs him. He instantly thinks himself very grand and takes it as an excuse to go carousing, which causes Tess and one of her many younger siblings to have to make an early morning journey with the horse for the family's means of making money. Sleeping on the journey, Tess wakes to find the horse impaled in a wreck and killed. Feeling guilty, she agrees to be sent as a poor relation to the Stoke-D'Urbervilles to seek assistance of some kind. (They are \\"new money\\" and have bought the name \\"D'Urberville\\" to build position for themselves, so they are actually no relation.)There she encounters Alec D'Urberville, who pursues her vigorously, though she repeatedly eschews his attentions. She takes a job for his mother, watching her fowl, but one evening, separated from her friends in the village on the way home from a Saturday night out in the village, Alec stops accepting no for an answer.Later she falls in mutual love with a gentleman (the son of a minister) who has rejected the pulpit himself in favor of learning the trade of dairy farming so that he may run his own farm some day. Angel Clare does fall in love with Tess, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to really know her, or want to... he thinks of her as a pure country maid, and has no idea about her past. When she tries to tell him, he shushes her, thinking he knows all about her. When she finally confides in him after the marriage, the results are disastrous and Tess is once again dealing with harsh reality.I won't recount the rest of the story, but it's clear that the bourgeois (Alec) and the gentry (Angel) have a great deal to do with the pain and hardship of Tess's life; they inflict the poverty penalty on her. The idea of the fluidity of the aristocracy in the 18th century -- Tess is descended from them, but has no rights thereof, Alec has taken the name due to his money, and Angel has rejected the career of his familial role in favor of farming whilst entertaining a very aristocratic (and inaccurate) view of the \\"peasantry\\" -- is prominent in the novel, with Tess's inability to care for herself and fulfill her perceived familial goals without resorting to asking for help from those who don't have her bloodline at all. The town of Kingsbere, where Tess's ancestors are said to be buried, figures somewhat in the novel, and one cannot help but think that this symbolizes their use to her as being just as dead as they are.There are some motifs of paganism in the book... Tess meets Angel for the first time at a May dance, a pagan rite, and she has another climactic plot moment at Stonehenge toward the end of the book. Angel himself seems to reject his father's Christian teachings, and the beliefs of Tess and her society are often deemed superstitious or quaint and encompassing of pagan belief systems. Tess often wishes to be free of her life of burdens, and who can blame her? She didn't cause the horse's death that plunged her into this chain of events, and yet she is punished and punished and punished.Hardy's writing is beautiful and engaging. The book, though long, seems to quickly move from event to event, and the author's descriptions are enlightening and complete. I really liked this book and look forward to reading more by Hardy."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"When Thomas Hardy first had \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" published in 1891, the controversy that surrounded it ensured for him financial security and status as one of the most popular authors of the time. The novel's scandal was concerned with the plot itself, in which an innocent young maid is seduced by an aristocratic cad, and pays for such an indiscretion with everything she holds dear in her life. In Hardy's journal (as recounted in Margaret Higonnet's introduction in this edition) he records that one of the Duchess of Abercorn's dinner parties ended in an argument between those who believed that Tess deserved her fate, and those that sympathized with her plight. However, by today's standards (in which premarital sex barely registers an eye-blink) one can't help but wonder if such a novel is relevant anymore.I'm going to argue, that yes, of course it is - if not simply to illustrate how lucky we are to no longer live in a world where a woman can be utterly destroyed through the hypocrisy of the society she lives in. However, there's considerably more to it than that, particularly as the remnants of this ideology remain to this day; and since one of the central themes of the novel is the negative effect of past traditions on the present, this bears keeping in mind.Tess Durbeyfield is a simple country lass, easily manipulated and with a limited education, but with a keen intelligence and insight into human nature. However, when her foolish father is casually told by the village minister that he is the offshoot of a once-noble family, Tess is thrown into her parent's ambition mechanizations. Made to leave her home and younger siblings, Tess begins work tending chickens at a relative's house whilst attempting to ward off the unwelcome attentions of her devious cousin Alec D'Uberville. However, her resolve slips one night when she is alone with Alec, lost and (as the text suggests) intoxicated, and he takes full advantage of her vulnerability.Having borne his child and lost it soon after (all without Alec's knowledge) Tess seeks employment elsewhere, and finds a sense of peace and security as a milkmaid in a neighboring village. That is, until she meets the parson's son Angel Clare, a very different kind of man from Alec D'Uberville. Falling in love, (along with every other girl on the farm!) Tess finds herself in a new moral crisis. Should she reveal her secret to Angel? Would he accept her if he knew? Her family (not to mention her common sense) warn her to keep her mouth shut, but can any relationship last if it is based on a lie? Shouldn't she have faith in Angel's testimonies of love to her?However, you've probably already guessed that the story doesn't have a happy ending, and this is a tragedy in the old grand tradition. When young Tess is seduced by a man her fate is sealed. She is a fallen woman, carrying the shame of her indiscretions throughout the rest of her life. However, the novel is remarkable because of Hardy's ability to find light amongst all the grimness. In the depths of Tess's drudgery and despair, we feel her moments of tranquility and appreciation of the beauty that surround her. Likewise, in moments of joy and peace, there is the underlying dread of the secret threatening to rare its ugly head. The emotions stirred in reading this novel are relentless - not to put anyone off from reading this novel, but I was in a constant state of agitation and discomfort in reading; that's how vivid the circumstances of the novel were. I mean that as a good thing of course; books these days are like movies - you sit, you watch, you more often than not feel nothing. But I was truly moved by \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" and her story; and I can't remember the last time I became so invested in a character and her happiness. Despite the pain it brought me in reading it, \\"Tess of the D'Ubervilles\\" was worth every agonizing word.In many ways this is a feminist novel, and although I would hate to put too modern a spin on it, it is very easy to see that Thomas Hardy's sympathies lie with Tess, writing in a letter: \\"I lost my heart to her as I went on with her history.\\" It is impossible not to feel a swell of indignation when Alec D'Uberville makes Tess swear not to tempt him anymore (as if his lust for her attractiveness is somehow *her* fault!) and a sense of bitter frustration at Angel Clare's inability to accept Tess's indiscretion, particularly when he himself is guilty of the same crime. When his lofty image of Tess as his pure \`child-bride' is taken from him, you can't help but feel he's doing it just as much out of injured pride than any sense of propriety.But this propriety is all-powerful in the novel; a heavy weight upon Tess that destroys her life. Hardy brings forth the idea that this is indeed a fallen world, but that it is so because of mankind's own structures of tradition and circumstance, rather than any divine ordination or original sin. To be free of some of them is a great release, though there are plenty that remain in this and other cultures around the world. The story is one of endurance; enduring the condemnation of others, the physical trials of manual labour, the suffering of a broken heart, the terror of encroaching death. We cannot control any of these aspects of our lives - all we can do is endure them, as Tess did."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I'm many years out of college and thought I should start reading some more of the classics. Previous favorites of mine have been The Sound and the Fury, Jane Eyre, and Pride and Prejudice. I saw Tess of the D'Urbervilles on my sister's bookshelf and for about a year I considered reading it. Finally, I picked it up and began. Wow! I read it in about three days. I never expected I would feel so much by reading this book. I cried when she baptized Sorrow herself. Her concerns that he be buried in the churchyard and her efforts to ensure he was were touching. I wanted to help Tess Durbeyfield. I thought she was a very complex character--she was sweet and unworldly but she wasn't actually stupid. And she was strong in many ways--for example, her family relied on Tess for so many things--eventually even their support. In fact, I hated her family for not working harder and making their own sacrifices. All the burden was on poor Tess. I also wanted to shake some sense into Angel. He really did wrong by Tess--although he eventually realizes this, it comes too late. The only thing I really did not care for was the sudden inclusion of a minor character (who we met earlier)into the end of the book and the implication that she would play an important role in the future of a major character. I barely knew this minor character and NOBODY could compare to Tess of the D'Urbervilles. If you are reading this to find a good book, ignore the negative reviews by high-school students and buy this book NOW. It's unforgettable."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"When I saw the depressing amount of 1-, 2-, and 3-star reviews for this novel, I had to wonder what had gotten into the general populace. Then I read the actual reviews, and realized something. They are reading this for pleasure, yes - but why in the world to people turn to a classic novel for a fast-paced, action-packed story? (Yes, I quote.)Tess's is a dark tale, a depressing tale, a tale with no perky moments to speak of (seeing as how we all know it'll get that much worse should anything good happen). The language is poetic and ethereal, with descriptions of incredible beauty that I would give anything to have written and an overtone of intense tragedy and ill-fated cruelty. The characters are all conflicted and in turmoil, oppressed by the moral standards of the day, and Tess is likeable, as opposed to Emily Bronte's Catherine Earnshaw, say. I would like to mention that I chose this book to write a ten-page analytical paper on, know it cover-to-cover, and know that it is SO much more meaningfull when one stops to take in the paragraphs that scream, \\"Pay attention to ME!!!\\" I would also mention that I am not a college professor. I read this as a high-school freshman, which goes to show that this isn't just a book for the elite.And in relation to all the readers who feel that Hardy is a bad author? I always believe that people who act as though they can write a classic far better than the author really ought to try their hand at writing a story that will survive the ages as well as Tess. Hardy writes in lyrical prose, in similar style to his poetry, and though I completely understand wanting to read \\"mind candy\\", I don't understand expecting books accepted as real literature to do the trick. Maybe try a trashy novel first, and read Tess to cleanse the palate.This is, ultimately, my favorite novel of all time. Naturally, I have many more to read, but of all those I have tried, I have never read another that so seamlessly combined luminous tragedy, heartwrending romance, and cruel fate in a novel as beautiful as it is painful."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"In a certain light, Thomas Hardy's \\"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\\" might be seen as a Cinderella story horribly disfigured by a tragic twist. When we first meet the heroine, Tess Durbeyfield, as a poor, hardworking farm girl who has to take care of her five younger siblings and fulfill the responsibilities abandoned by her inebriated father, she seems like a girl destined for greater things: a brilliant career in a more stimulating occupation, a blissful marriage to a wonderful man. But Hardy likes to illustrate fate's capacity for cruelty, and Tess is merely an innocent woman who is seemingly punished for her innocence.The name Durbeyfield is a vulgarization of d'Urberville, a family with a rich history descended from Norman knights and wealthy landowners, but various misfortunes have reduced the lineage to the commoners who presently inhabit the impoverished Durbeyfield household. (We learn later in the novel that the Durbeyfields are not the only local family to have suffered this appellative fall from grace.) Although the d'Urberville nobility is defunct, in the near past an enterprising businessman named Stoke sought to increase the prestige of his own family by appropriating a distinguished name from the county annals, and d'Urberville is the one he chose. Thus when Tess, to aid her family's finances after an unfortunate accident deprives them of their income, takes a job tending the fowl at the nearby d'Urberville estate, she mistakenly believes she is working for her relations.This ostensibly minor detail is really the basis of the irony which drives the novel. Had Mr. Stoke been honest and not assumed the name of the Durbeyfields' ancestors, Tess would not have been likely to meet the lecherous, skulking Alec d'Urberville, who rapes her after she rebuffs his attempted seduction and impregnates her with a baby that dies in infancy. Of course Hardy, evading the risk of censorship, is decorous enough to suggest in the subtlest manner possible that the rape happened rather than describe it explicitly, but Alec's immoral behavior is clearly implied.Mortified, heartbroken, Tess then goes to work as a milkmaid at a dairy farm where she and a young man named Angel Clare, the heartthrob of several of the farm girls, fall in love. Angel has defied his father, a vicar, by spurning a career in the clergy for agriculture and marriage with a middle class girl for Tess. He scoffs at his parents' snobbery, but after marrying Tess, he reveals a disturbing hypocrisy when she confesses to him the vicious treatment she had received from Alec and its consequences. Angel's reaction is far from the gentle sympathy one would expect from the magnanimous personality he projects; he is disgusted that she has been robbed of her purity and draws a strange parallel between her violation and the fall of her family's ancestral prestige. He rejects her, they separate, and once again she is mortified, heartbroken, and looking for a job.Tess is destined to rencounter both Angel and Alec before the end of the novel, and the changes to their characters not only advance the plot in unexpected ways but further emphasize Hardy's utilization of irony. The starkly contrasted images of the novel's penultimate scene at Stonehenge and the last scene, which takes place outside a prison where a black flag flies announcing an execution, raise the question of whether even Hardy knew when he started exactly how this somber story would end.The novel contains several recurring Hardy elements. Like most of his major work, it takes place in the southwestern part of England he calls Wessex, this time in the fertile Blackmoor Vale, and his evocation of the scenery sets the stage beautifully. Tess's co-workers at the dairy farm are a realistically cheerful lot and provide the continuum of humanity that such a story needs as a reprieve for its tragic mood. An interesting touch which shows that Hardy is not above recycling his own motifs is the similarity between the death of the Durbeyfield horse (a definite foreshadowing for Tess) and the tumbling sheep in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd,\\" in that both incidents cause their respective protagonists to take distant jobs with fateful results. The incentive to read Hardy lies in his ability to put language at the service of one of the greatest functions of literature: to express the deepest desires and emotions of mankind."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I see \\"Tess\\" as the story of how a beauty is wronged by evil and by arrogance.But oh, what a story. Hardy's novels read like poetry. Tess is so lovely, innocent and good, Alec so relentlessly hideous, and Angel so pathetically self-righteous, that I find the gradual destruction of Tess (with whom I empathize) at the hands of these two men, to be difficult to experience again, line by line!What a masterpiece of the human condition, and I'm told, of the female experience. Hardy's bitterly honest portrayal of the worst and best of human behavior is as powerful as any I've found in literature.When I need a Hardy fix and I don't want to be depressed, I turn to \\"Far From the Madding Crowd.\\""},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"(Warning: Tells Plot of the Story)Through many revisions and editions, Tess of the D'Urbervilles A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented By Thomas Hardy still holds readers captive over a hundred years later. Tess's plight though childhood innocence to womanly revenge is similar to other fairy tales and classic novels. It is said to be a love story for young girls or an adults' treasure of allusions and serious themes. Tess grows up fast, having to deal with the wrongs of mankind, her social class, a noble lineage, and the renewal of her true self. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a novel that can surpass the ages as a heartbreaking tale for any reader who believes in redemption and compassion for the all-encompassing heroine.In 19th Century Britain, Tess searches for a little pleasure out of her wronged life. Through many novels, Thomas Hardy has told the stories of characters and flaws. Hardy's insight to a woman's life is remarkable. He shows the injustices women have received and the stereotypes that follow women still today. Without knowing the narrator to be a man, it could easily have been a woman who told this very feminine tale. The book was very controversial at the time of its release in 1891. Parts were censored and seen as obscene because of it's sexual views. Hardy continually revised the story, changing the interpretations of the main characters. He did this through including information on some facts and removing statements on others. Alec D'Urberville could be seen in one edition as only the antagonist, not the villain he is in this version. His alterations lead to the 1912-13 edition that is usually the book available now.Hardy focuses on many themes throughout the book, mostly on the feminine role and social class. Tess Durbeyfield realizes her social struggle when she caused an accident to happen sending her family into financial need. With the recent discovery of their family's lineage to be that of the once very prominent D'Urbervilles, Tess is sent off to her wealthy relatives. The relatives in reality are not D'Urbervilles, only a family that had taken the name because questionable activity was attached to their old name. Alec D'Urberville realizes Tess's financial need and uses it against her to join him at his mother's estate. Gender roles are brought up when Joan Durbeyfield, Tess's mother, believes that \\"her face\\" (53) is her one advantage. Only D'Urbervilles advantage is greater. He holds the blackmail of economic need over Tess's head until he eventually takes advantage of her. \\"An immeasurable chasm was to divide our heroine's personality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from her mother's door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm\\" (74). The pregnant Tess, as an unmarried woman isolated from others, escapes home to have her baby. Tess tries her hand as a field worker where women \\"were the most interesting of this company of binders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she becomes part and parcel of outdoor nature\\" \\"A field-man is a personality afield; a field-woman is a portion of the field\\" (87-89). Roles are defined by gender again as women being earthly and beautiful, men having no goodness, and in the end the man still gets the better of the woman.Tess's baby dies, leaving her to start over at Talbothay's Dairy. Finding real love in Angel Care, he convinces Tess to marry him. She tries to tell him of her past only to have him refuse to hear her each time. After their wedding, Clare admits his previous sexual experience asking for forgiveness and receiving it. When Tess relates her story, he can no longer be with her, claiming that \\"forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another\\" (228) \\"the woman I have been loving is not you\\" (229). Men's double standards are shown. Clare leaves her for Brazil to decide if they could fix matters. During his long extended absence, Tess is reduced to farm labor. Her father dies and her family is evicted from their home. Her economic welfare falls again into Alec D'Urbervilles hands. His advantage persuades Tess to be his wife because her real husband was never coming back, according to D'Urberville.Clare came back to find his wife living with D'Urberville. Tess, in a moment of revelation, avenges the wrongs of D'Urberville by killing him. Clare and Tess have a few days of paradise together before she is taken away for D'Urbervilles murder. Tess understands that this is how it has to be. She will be able to die before Clare can despise her again. She dies a fulfilled woman, \\"'I am ready,' she said quietly\\" (396).Besides being a wonderful tale, Hardy's strength in writing merits the book to be an excellent read. Hardy achieves his goal of relating the story of an innocent girl whose life was simple before the villain D'Urberville comes into the story and nearly perfect after he is out of the story. Hardy portrayed his \\"Pure Woman\\" with brilliancy and faithfulness. Social class issues are displayed though Tess's country girl nature yet noble lineage. If her family had not been in economic problems, her tragic flaw would never have occurred. She could have lived as a farmer's wife and lived a simple life. The feminine stereotypes and generalizations are represented by the actions of others upon the poetic Tess.Hardy's background in poetry gives the novel a lyrical quality missing in the books of today's generation. Hardy alludes to several other works of art including Greek mythology, Shakespeare, fairy tales, and the Bible. He utilizes imagery as well. His uncanny imagery creates the entire world of Tess for the reader, down to the little window reflections upon a dress. The extremely detailed and well articulated descriptions can easily be seen in the readers mind. These literary elements are well used and fit the tale accordingly.Enjoyment would be received from Tess of the D'Urbervilles by those hopeless romantics who value depth to a story and appreciate the British setting. Gender roles and social class issues are blatantly raised with no subtly. Love story or social issue awareness, the beloved heroine, innocent, strong, loving, and pure will reach into one's heart and capture it forever in the world of fairy tales and happy endings."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Ok, this one is for all my friends at BHS.

Anyways, this is the sort of very sad pathetic story of a girl who falls head over heels in love with a cad. As we girls all know, that has probably happened to each of us.., and who in their right mind wants to be reminded of that? And the very sad pathetic thing is she will do absolutely ANYTHING to get back with him. It is very realistic, its her first love...

For a modern love story containing these themes, check out Sophie Simons'l'Amour, available on Kindle."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I read this novel immediately after viewing the PBS Masterpiece Classic Theatre version starring Gemma Arterton as Tess. As the production follows faithfully all the key plot of the story, it really helped me with the book. In lieu of this, read the Wikipedia entry which outlines the plot in depth.The book is wonderful for analysis and discussion. There are many questions that can be created. The book has a lot of symbolism and foreshadowing.For instance, after Angel Clare and Tess marry, Angel finally learns from Tess why she has hesitated for so long to marry him. He mentions once that the only way he can feel released from his difficulty with her past is if Alex D'Urberville was no longer alive. One wonders if this is a seed planted in Tess' subconscious. Technically, Tess had no real functional reason to murder Alex. He was no woman beater, Angel had finally reached the point he needed to be in in order to accept Tess again, etc.The very first scene of the book is the cornerstone that starts the sealing of Tess' destiny and fate and nothing she does or doesn't do from then on can stay her from this. Her father's learning of the real family name of D'Urberville and not Derbyfield leads her to meeting up with Alex, her rape/seduction, subsequent pregnancy, inability of initially being able to marry the love of her life (Angel Clare), Angel's initial inability to live with his new wife, Tess' murder of Alex and her ultimate fate by a hanging execution.To me, the whole of the book is greater than it's individual parts. That is it's ultimate greatness. One can criticize the hugely long section of Angel and Tess' courtship at Talbothays Dairy where Angel/Tess seem to go on endlessly coming together and falling apart as Tess struggles with whether Angel can accept her if she tells him all the details of her past. (And then the subsequent hugely long time it took Angel to come to see a way to have a full married life and future with Tess.) But I took this time to appreciate Hardy's writing style, the way he uses Nature as a character in and of itself, to learn the real and authentic \\"what it was like to live\\" in that time in England, etc.I don't feel inclined to pass a negative judgment on Tess. In many ways she was the most moral, strong, and contemplative of everyone. Alex attempted to turn good by becoming a traveling evangelist but couldn't keep up the pretense. Angel, who rejected the more obviously suited to his moral viewpoints (Mercy Chant) to choose his more emotionally compatible love, Tess, had to undergo a huge personal struggle to rise above his concerns over what society would think of them. Angel's concerns were such that he states that even if they traveled as far off as America or Australia, that they couldn't be really certain Tess' past wouldn't come to affect them and even said it could continue to affect even the lives of their children. I really felt that Angel had the weakest courage of all the various main characters.Tess, on the other hand, continuously makes tough choices in life. At times, she uses pride to keep her head up and at other times, leaves pride aside to choose paths she feels benefits her family, her ability to be a good friend, to support herself honestly and the like. For her, love should conquer all and she struggles valiantly to understand Angel's point of view.I definitely will be reading more of Hardy's novels."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The shipper sent an email immediately that they were on vacation so would be cancelling the order.

Hardy does indeed capture the English landscape fairly well into his somewhat lengthy, verbose paragraphs. But his plot (to be frank) stinks.The moment the reader meets Tess Durbeyfield he or she knows exactly what her fate will be. The book is a ridiculous web of intertwined coincidences which finally succeed not in giving the novel the air of a distinguished and accomplished work, but of a silly contrived plot line filled with poorly developed characters that could easily be crammed into 20 short pages. And the book might be all the better for it.The point is that after I read this book and labored through the hundreds of pages and looked up archaic English phrases and fluffy words that Hardy seemed to fill the pages with, I was struck at how much time I had wasted to learn so little, how disappointing it was to be forced to read so much obsequious symbolism and heinous happenstances.Don't read this book unless you have to.

I had no idea what I wanted, because she wouldn't allow me to read anything by Stephen King, and I had no other ideas for something worth reading. My friend suggested Tess of the D'bervilles, and so I took it from the school library.Unfortunately, I started reading it a week before I was supposed, and finished it the next day, and so I must choose another book to read for class.This is an excellent book that makes you think about what women had to go through a few hundred years ago. It makes you think about the complete lack of backbone shown in Tess untill the very end, when she finally realizes the injustices done to her were NOT her fault. You must remember that she had not been brought up to understand certain things, and could not have understood how to cope, or over come with problems that many women of her time had to face.The ending was excellent, and rather sad.If you enjoy learning about history, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book is tragic and wonderfully written. Hardy uses words to create a scene for you that creates the visual for you completely. I think that the sadest thing for me was to realize people did live like this, life really was that hard. As a 21st century woman I was outraged at the way that Tess was treated by men and by society. Who is the true bad guy, Alec or Angel? When we read it with our societies mores we perceive it one way, but if we were ken to the morals of that society how would we see it? Are they really dastards, or are they all just victims. I am not a scholar, I liked the story for being a good story.After reading the book I rented the A&amp;E movie. As I watched it, I realized how well the book translated into video, because I had already seen the exact same scenery in my mind. The only thing that surprised me was the bleakness of the trunip farm and Tesses horrible conditions. I couldn't imagine anything that awful.There are a lot of words, similar to DH Lawrence, but I wouldn't get rid of a one of them. If you come to this book as a great story and not as a classic novel, you will hold Tess to your heart and never forget her tragedies."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Tess. Many years ago, after completing a grueling mind-numbing week of exams in college I sat down to read this story, as a sort of reward for living through the previous five days. I have since read many of Hardy's novels, but Tess remains the dearest to me. Early on, in chapter 4, Tess is on a journey at night with her little brother Abraham and he is asking her if all the stars in the night sky are worlds similar to ours. She compares them to apples on a tree and concludes that most of them are &quot;splendid and sound - a few blighted&quot;. &quot;Which do we live on?&quot; asks Abraham. &quot;A blighted one,&quot; says Tess. Minutes later, their carriage crashes into some oncoming traffic... the family horse Prince is killed, and Tess is plunged through this incident into predicaments that will result in her complete undoing.Those who are familiar with Hardy will know of his fatalistic tendencies. His themes were not exactly &quot;jolly&quot;. And here, in the above incident he sets that ominous tone that is so omnipresent in his work. Tess is the story of an exceptionally gifted and beautiful peasant girl of decayed aristocratic stock who is betrayed by two men: one is the rich and sensuous Alec D'Urberville, the seducer of her body and for a while of her emotions; by him she has a child which dies in infancy. The other is the intellectual free-thinking son of a clergyman (Angel Clare), whom she loves with her whole being, and who abandons her when he hears, immediately after their marriage, of her earlier violation. Here is a picture of that Victorian double-standard that similarly condemned Hester Prynne in Hawthorne's &quot;The Scarlet Letter.&quot; Angel fully expects Tess to forgive his own past indiscretions (and she does), but he, in turn, will not forgive hers. More precisely, he flounders in his disillusionment, and cannot move from forgiveness to forgetness... as is obvious when he says to her in Chapter 35 &quot;O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case. You were one person; now you are another.&quot; The double-standard breaks our heart even as we read of it.And hearts are broken here. It is not until many years later that Angel realizes his error by pondering on the Biblical story of &quot;the wife of Uriah being made a queen&quot; (2 Sam.11:1-27). Realizing (a bit too late) that he had judged Tess by the deed rather than the will, he searches for the girl... only to find that the extreme poverty of her family has driven her back to the other man. So strong is Tess's love for Angel Clare, and so powerful her disgust at what Alec D'Urberville has forced her to become, that she kills Alec. Now husband and wife are re-united but on the run from the police, and they spend a few days of loving reconciliation before Tess is arrested, tried, sentenced to death for murder, and.... (read the book).Hardy considered this to be his finest novel, and claimed that Tess was the most deeply felt character he ever created. Originally published in 1891, it yet remains a timeless story of the power of love to overcome the most profound betrayal. Significant is Hardy's choice of the subtitle: &quot;A Pure Woman&quot;.&quot;...Poor wounded name! My bosom as a bed shall lodge thee.&quot; - Shakespeare -"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the best books I have ever set my eyes upon. I have tried to finish the book in one sitting but found out that I can't because there is just so many things to figure out in the story. No doubt, fate plays such an important role in the life of Tess Durbeyfield and it is due to her noble descent that spawns the events leading to her own demise. The ending of the story is somewhat disturbing. Should we feel happy that Angel fufiled Tess's wish or should we feel sad for Tess?"},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The great thing about Tess of the D'Urbervilles is the poetry and the depth of the main character.Tess is an extremely complex character and yet a very simple person. It is hard to explain her:Hardy seems totally in emphatuated with his character. She is a thing of beauty like a beautiful flower growing on the road side. The flower knows nothing of why it is or how it grows, and so Tess is naive of her existance and surroundings only driven by the knee-jerk of her emotion, egged on and commented on the romantic and love struck Hardy.Hardy makes a character , falls in love with her and then day-dreams about her. Guarding her innocence amd jealously defending it by - 1)making her so complex that no other character in the book can love ,know and understand her truely.2)She ends up tragic so no one else can have her. Thus destroying her and tearing himself away from his ideal.It is true he builds her up only to tear her down. Such a tragic figure makes the reader feel a lament amd deep sorrow for Tess having tried to fathom her whilst becoming enchanted by her.I found all of this made the book frustrating and it flawed the main character. It is a very difficult, long and hard book to read- which would have made the book very hard to write by anyone other than a very idealistic romantic poet. 4 stars because I am a romantic fool for Tess as well."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"There really isn't much I can add to what has already been said about this wonderful Thomas Hardy novel. One of the things that really struck me about Tess was the importance of setting and how Hardy relates Tess's emotional state to the setting in which she finds herself. The contrasting settings of Talbothays Dairy and Flintcomb-Ash seem to represent the opposing forces in Tess's own life.At Talbothays, the air is &quot;clear, bracing and ethereal,&quot; the river flows like the pure River of Life,&quot; and the atmosphere &quot;set up (Tess's) spirits wonderfully.&quot; For Tess, the valley where the dairy is located is akin to Paradise and she feels an emotional high while she is there.In the dairy, itself, the milkers form &quot;a little battalion of men and women,&quot; often &quot;singing songs to entice the cows to produce milk.&quot; Everyone works together to bring about a common goal, a common good. At Talbothays, Tess is able to escape the pressures and prejudices of Victorian England. She is at the peak of happiness in her life and falls in love and marries the intellectual and difficult Angel Clare.It is when her marriage to Angel fails, that Tess moves to the dreary and desolate Flintcomb-Ash. Flintcomb-Ash is in direct contrast to Talbothays. There is not a single &quot;green pasture,&quot; nor anything besides &quot;fallow and turnips everywhere&quot; at the &quot;starve-acre place.&quot; Here, Tess reaches a new emotional low and her heart is as empty and dark as the setting in which she finds herself. In contrast to the camaraderie at Talbothays, at Flintcomb-Ash, &quot;nobody come near (Tess)&quot; as she stands &quot;enshrouded in her uniform&quot; working &quot;hour after hour.&quot; The other workers at Flintcomb-Ash do not fare much better and most are kept busy in the fields in order to earn enough money to simply survive. There is no time for friendship in this place.Obviously, Hardy was a master at description and the use of setting to emphasize the emotional state of his characters, Tess in particular. Although this book is a masterpiece of sensual language, Tess is also a wonderful example of the use of contrasting settings to convey strong emotional states in a way that mere words alone never could. Tess is a book that should not be overlooked by anyone."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the &quot;heroine&quot; she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then.

In an attempt to create a social connection and to gain financial assistance for her family, she entreats the d'Urbervilles to acknowledge an ancient familial connection. Unfortunately, Alec d'Urberville is taken with Tess and rapes her. Her life is haunted by his sexual assault from that point forward. Eventually, Tess begins to recuperate and finds employment elsewhere as a dairymaid. Her days as a dairymaid are happy and peaceful until she falls in love with Angel Clare. She agonizes over telling him of her tainted past, and when she confesses the truth on her wedding night, Angel is repulsed over her past and her deception of waiting to tell him. Tess is parted from her true love and never fully recovers, even when he returns to her.Tess of the d'Urbervilles is more than a sad story. It pays homage to the type of unhealthy family atmospheres that many children are raised in. The death of the horse is a direct result of her father's drunkenness and irresponsibility, though Tess never realizes this. When her parents hear of her misfortune, her mother reprimands her for not seeking marriage to the very man who raped her. The story also explores the mental effects that sexual assault can have on a person. Tess experiences extreme guilt, depression and feelings of unworthiness - common feelings for victims of sexual assault. In the end, as she is continually subjected to Alec d'Urberville, she experiences insanity which results in extreme actions.This particular edition included an introduction and notes about the text which I found helpful. However, I thought the girl on the cover did not resemble the maiden of the book. The girl on the front is plain and unremarkable, whereas, Tess, according to the text, is remarkable.I can see why this book is considered a literary classic, but I can't say I enjoyed it. That being said, I think everyone should read this book once. Tess is a memorable character that one can not help being fascinated with."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This book was absolutely brilliant!

To the modern reader, this tale of love and morality may seem like kid stuff at first glance (they talk about more serious situations in my niece's junior high sex education class).Hardy's genius is in his incisive character portrayals and the depictions of the social and moral structure of 19th century England. Tess and her feelings and decisions stay with you long after the last page is finished. I kept wishing we had read this in college so that I could have argued with someone about the moral themes."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles plays out in Shakespearean tragedy-like fashion, but maybe there is more to the word tragic in the case of Tess, being that her problems are not self-inflicted, but more in line with blind fatalism. In fact, Hardy underscores the theme of injustice playing out in the common folk's lives, with Tess being the microcosm of ill-fated individuals. The book isn't an uplifting read, but who's to say that a tragic--or even downright depressing-- novel can't have power, essentialness, importance, and beauty. Some condemn this novel as being \\"boring and depressing\\", but I would argue that there is a beauty in Hardy's prose, as he such a power in its way of making Tess' story coming to life with poetic descriptions, and this adds such an element of pathos to passages depicting her fate. Despite her suffering and pitfalls, Tess is a tragic character you feel for by novel's end, and there's a sense that Hardy is sympathizing with his tragic heroine all along.When Tess' father learns of supposed relations with a family of nobility, this sets in motion a series of events which leads to Tess leaving her family to go work at the D'Urbervilles estate in hopes of getting in good with the family. Tess' foolish father sets the tone for the themes of poor calculations and mistiming repeated in the novel. As it turns out, Tess' family is not related to the D'Urbervilles (a fact which no one from the family realizes). Tess, while here, falls under the clutches of manipulative and superficial Alec D'Urberville. Returning home pregnant and somewhat disgraced, Tess experiences more setbacks when her baby, who she names Sorrow, falls sick and dies; she cannot even get a proper Christian burial for her baby. For the duration of the novel, Tess' existence is synonymous with an emotional rollercoaster. Just as she is mourning her loss, she then goes to another place to work, where she encounters Angel Claire, a man she saw previously at a dance. Slowly, the two begin to get to know each other and fall in love, although Tess, based on earlier experiences, is mostly resistant to the idea of marriage. Tess wants Angel to know about her earlier experiences, but has a difficulty bringing herself to tell him; finally, she attempts to leave a letter, but once again fate intervenes and Angel never sees the letter. After Angel wins her over, they decide to exchange their previous indiscretions after their marriage. However, as fate seems to plague Tess, Tess is more forgiving of Angel's previous affair with an older woman than his forgiving of her relations with Alec. He can't forgive her. There is a sadness experienced as Angel leaves Tess; perhaps we feel even more pity because we know that Angel, for all his goodness, is acting a bit too impulsive and rash, hypocritical at an important moment in Tess' life. While it is a sad scene, Hardy is able to evoke great power in this moment. Tess once again finds Alec and Angel later in the novel, and each character acts in line with their character, but, as others have alluded to, the stars just seemed to be against Tess, and she makes a foolish, hasty decision.Despite this range of pathos experienced, Tess of the D'Urbervilles is a powerful, poetic read, one that moves you. Hardy takes on a ride of emotions through Tess' life, and, she becomes a sort of martyr for the injustices in the world, a point that Hardy insinuates throughout. Hardy can capture the essence of detail one moment, and then invoke humanity the next. Sure, it's not a picnic reading Tess, and it is a bit emotionally draining by end, but this is a deep, emotional novel that works on many levels, one that has stood the test of time for a reason. Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one novel I'm glad is required reading."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"I know this is great literature, and I'm glad I finally read Tess of the D'Urbervilles, but I could not get past the fact that our plucky heroine Tess is a bit of a twit. While the injustices done to her may have reduced a lesser person to perpetual self-pity, Tess actually comes out the hero and pulls herself together, making a real life for her away from her family and her tormentor, Alec D'Urberville. It's only when she meets, falls in love, and marries Angel Clare that she begins acting the twit, the fool, and the loser. For some bizarre reason, she decides to be excruciatingly honest with her newly-wed husband (on their wedding night, no less), about her past trouble, involving apparently a rape, and her child born out of wedlock. I suppose it's hard for modern audiences to understand Angel's reaction (leaving her) when he realizes that she is not a virgin. Ah yes, the hypocrisy of Victorian culture. I understand that there's a huge sub-text going on in this novel about the social hypocrisy of the Victorian age, but it doesn't make sense that our formerly plucky Tess would now allow herself to fall to pieces.Great story, in all. The writing itself, however, is not great. Hardy's prose is really rambling, roundabout, and he just does not get to the point. Sure to wear out even the most patient modern reader. So, great literature, although Tess is a twit and the writing itself is rambling."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"The most depressing book in the English language. And yet, I think I was the only person in my high school English class that actually liked it. Does this mean I'm depressed? We'll leave that question for my analyst and just say I think I have a thing for melodramatic novels.Tess starts out a poor peasant girl with a drunk father and a stupid mother. After their only horse dies, they send her to their rich \\"relations\\" the D'Urbervilles, to beg for work. Her supposed cousin, Alec, rapes her and she has his child. The child dies in infancy and Tess leaves home to seek a new life and better work at a sunny dairy farm. At the dairy farm, she falls in love with a clergyman's son, Angel Clare and they get married. On their wedding night, he tells her he is not as virtuous as his name, that he went on a bender in London and slept with a prostitute. She says \\"That's great, because I'm not a virgin either - now forgive me.\\" And he's like, \\"Um, no. My hypocritical moral beliefs will not allow me to be with a woman who is 'impure'. Here's some money. I'm going to Brazil to be a farmer.\\"So he leaves her and she wanders the land again searching for work and a new life. She's doing back-breaking labor for little money on this awful farm when who should show up but...Alec D'Urberville, her rapist cousin. He's found Jesus -- until he sees Tess's face again, and then he goes back to smoking cigars and being a general d-bag. He tries to get her to marry him, so he can possess her legally. She says no multiple times, until her father dies, leaving her family with no home and no money. So her mother sells her into marriage with Alec (This is the point in the novel when you, the reader, start thinking that suicide would be a good option for Tess).Who should show up next, but Angel Clare! He's back from Brazil, having realized what a hypocrite he is. He finds Tess and begs her to be with him -- she tells him it's too late. After Angel leaves, Tess kills Alec with a bread knife. Then Tess runs after Angel, tells him what she's done and asks him to forgive her -- again. He's like \\"Whatever, we gotta get outta here. You're on the lam now.\\" So they run away and get as far as Stonehenge before the fuzz catch up with them, arrest Tess, then execute her for her crimes.

Hardy is an early modernist, raising the big questions, describing the loss of classical innocence and hinting at potential paths to solutions. But, he does not provide definitive answers. His work suggests that the time of certain answers is permanently gone, to be replaced by a difficult journey, at best.Man has a burning need for significance and meaning, but can find neither fully. Character is the most important thing, shining through all situations ... but it is partially shaped by fate, chance, history, family, society and the environment ... and while potentially noble, ultimately inadequate to fully address the challenges of life.The reader leaves the book exhausted from the journeys, the hopes and the many pursuits. The flow of life and history continues in spite of the heroine's choices. In the end we are left with a bittersweet memory of this life which Hardy personally inserts as narrator, \\"will never be forgotten by those who knew her\\".Perhaps this is the best current answer to the ultimate questions."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles may be Thomas Hardy's greatest novel and would certainly be almost anyone else's. A dark, sweepingly tragic vision, it is a masterpiece in nearly every area: characterization, plot, meaningful themes, prose, and more.Hardy is well-known for being depressing, and this may be his most depressing novel. The structure of his dark novels is greatly influenced by Greek tragedy, and this is probably his most purely tragic. Many have thought of him as taking a near-malevolent attitude toward characters like Tess, who indeed seems born only to suffer. The concatenation of dire circumstances engulfing her is truly stunning, and perhaps even more notable is the ceaseless way in which they flow together to wreak the greatest possible devastation. Hardy is famous - or infamous, depending on whom you ask - for complex plotting and melodramatic coincidence, and this has some of his most highly wrought examples. Tragedy of this extent requires a very deft hand to pull off well; it is all too easy to become hyperbolically implausible or even melodramatically corny. However, Tess is so well planned and finely executed that the events unfold not only with verisimilitude but almost with inevitability.This last is another distinct Hardy characteristic. He had long been an agnostic by, abandoning belief in a benevolent overseeing power - nay, in any force that took account of humanity at all. Added to this was a profound awareness of human insignificance and a consequent absence of conventional meaning. However, he wrote nearly throughout his artistic career about a concept that he eventually came to find very plausible - the Imminent Will, a blind force controlling the fate of humanity and perhaps all else. Hardy is also generally considered a naturalist - a writer depicting environment as a crucial, almost insurmountable force in shaping personality and destiny. Like all of his greatest fiction, Tess dramatizes this vividly, portraying characters unable to escape wretched circumstances and even more wretched fates. Such ideas held great sway with nineteenth century writers and thinkers but was almost entirely replaced by existentialism. Few will now agree with the shadowy forces underpinning the book's tragedy, but the dramatization is so well-done and stunning that it will at the very least provoke thought about important philosophical and theological issues - and of course bring admiration for Hardy's great artistry.As all this suggests, the novel is incredibly moving. One would be very hard-pressed to find a more pathos-drenched story, and Hardy runs us through a dark emotional gamut. Much of this has to do with the character of Tess, generally considered Hardy's best and seemingly his favorite. The subtitle calls her \\"A Pure Woman,\\" and so she is in a sense; an innocent, nave, and ignorant country girl of the kind no longer possible in the developed world, she is far closer - in spirit and otherwise - to people from civilization's first few thousand years than anyone from the last century or so. Hardy plays up her symbolic worth, making her a sort of Eve and giving her many pagan goddess elements. He is well-known for his heroines and generally for depictions of women far removed from Victorian stereotypes. Though not current feminist ideals, they stood out as strong individuals with real feelings and thoughts; Hardy's gender and sexuality views were well ahead of his time, greatly influencing his portrayals. Tess is his most famous, fully realized, and complex example. The most obvious sense in which she is pure is sexually and otherwise morally, but she is not the virginal domestic queen of most Victorian fiction. The pivotal scene in which she loses virginity is deliberately ambiguous, leaving it unclear if she is raped or seduced. Either way it is a sort of reverse Genesis story, as the pure woman is made impure - by Victorian standards - by a worldly, sensualistic man.Hardy uses this dramatic scene and its aftermath to boldly confront gender and sexuality issues that had always been central to his artistic concerns. He pushed the proverbial envelope in these areas from the start, often facing censorship and always struggling to get his point across in print. A few years before Tess he wrote a famous letter saying his goal was to destroy the doll in English fiction in order for England to have a fiction at all, and Tess was his bravest and most direct attempt. She is in many ways a simple village girl but is not unaware of her beauty, and Hardy was one of the very first modern writers to even acknowledge that women could experience sexuality. We must remember this was several years before Freud revolutionized this area and also keep in mind that this was a time when statues were covered and it was not socially permissible to even mentions legs or ankles. Women were idealized as non-sexual beings meant only for domesticity and with no thoughts beyond it. It is now near-impossible to appreciate just how daring the character was or adequately convey her impact. Hardy's depiction and the issues he uses her to discuss made him world famous - the talk of high society and casual conversation as well as the literary world. For example, in his autobiography, he recalls how a society hostess told him she seated guests according to whether or not they sympathized with Tess and then had them debate. The novel received many glowing reviews but also about as many condemning it as perversely immoral. Hard as it is to believe since it was positively pass&eacute; even a few decades later, many thought it nothing less than pornographic - and a shockingly bad influence to boot. Perhaps the greatest sign of how much things have changed is that Roman Polanski's faithful 1979 film version was rated PG in the UK.This was clear reactionary hyperbole from a society so repressive that it had become pathologically hypocritical. Tess was a long overdue wake-up call. Victorians were essentially scandalized by the idea - from a man! - that it might not be a woman's fault if she is raped or seduced. This would be laughable if it were not so sad, but their offense hardly ended here. The novel vividly portrays the plight of many women at the time, especially lower class ones. Far too many women unfortunately identified strongly with Tess' problems: unsought attention from higher-class men that may have been flattering but was above all confusing; pregnancy resulting from rape or seduction without a father to raise or even acknowledge the child; suffering at the hands of grossly unfair sexual double standards from prospective and actual husbands; and, perhaps worst of all, consequent ostracism not only from society but often even from family and friends. Hardy was astounded by how many women, including quite a few high society ones, wrote him saying they were in Tess' position or a very similar one and how much the book meant to them. All this shows how strikingly well the novel dramatized contemporary issues; it is in many ways a novelistic equivalent of Henrik Ibsen's contemporaneous \\"problem plays\\" dealing with current social problems.This was a large part of the reason for Tess' impact and success, but the book would not still be so widely read and appreciated if it were the only feature. As Hardy envisioned, time has proven him right and the reactionaries wrong; the violent outbursts are now seen as perversely fascinating and mildly amusing historical curiosities, but the book's themes shine at least as brightly as ever. Feminists have unsurprisingly long had great interest in Hardy and this novel particularly, which has many themes of note to them and numerous others. Sexuality and morality aside, Tess strikes a somewhat subtle but ringing chord for women's rights via its bleak depiction of their woefully low Victorian status. Hardy movingly and accurately shows how barren life was for women, especially intelligent ones; there was not only a dearth of intellectual stimulation but hardly any stimulation at all. Sexual politics are still hotly debated and may never be resolved, but hard as it may now be to believe, rural women at the time of the novel's setting were actually kept in such ignorance that it was possible for them to not be aware of seduction even as a concept. The novel shows the tragic consequences that could so easily result from this and associated complications. Perhaps more importantly, and even more movingly, the novel also shows the grinding poverty that many rural English women faced. Worse still, it starkly portrays the consequent necessity of earning money without training, help, or encouragement. Hardy sometimes goes into considerable detail to describe the farm labor that girls like Tess had to turn to, putting particular emphasis on then-new machinery. Some may find this somewhat boring, but the point is well taken, especially as the infernal imagery used to describe the machines is particularly emphatic and highly symbolic.This leads in to some of Tess' other themes, giving the novel relevance to many with no particular interest in women's issues. Rural poverty in general - a perennial Hardy theme - is on grim display, letting readers see just how much life has improved for farmers and other laborers in the last century plus. Hardy's work is also notable for showing what one critic calls \\"the ache of modernity,\\" and Tess possibly depicts it most painstakingly and memorably. It is important to remember that Hardy grew up in a world without automobiles, electricity, railroads, and many other modern conveniences that were beginning to appear when the novel was written. Tess shows how such innovations were slowly filtering into rural England, profoundly changing a society that had altered little since the Early Middle Ages. It is thus of significant historical and sociological interest.Relatedly, and as always with Hardy, place is of great importance. Perhaps no one equals him in depicting settings with such close detail and vividness that they become an integral part of the story; setting is never mere backdrop in Hardy. Tess is one of his Wessex novels depicting the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. We get a good idea of what Hardy country looked like and how its people lived. The landscape is not as important as in some Hardy novels, but we still get an unforgettable depiction of a bygone era.But the novel is great over and above all this; one can indeed love and appreciate it without knowing any of these factors. The engrossing and profoundly moving story is a large part of this, but Tess herself is at least as important. One of literature's most sympathetic characters, readers have found her irresistible from the start. It is often said that Hardy's depiction is so idealized that he almost seems to be in love with her - and there are indeed some interesting biographical stories behind the claim -, but beauty is only one of the factors making her memorable. Hardy describes her so minutely and reveals her inner thoughts with such breathtaking force that she seems truly alive in a way very few characters do. Labeling her \\"Pure\\" caused more controversy than any other element, and perhaps all will still not agree, but it would be very hard to find another character so much more sinned against than sinning. Some of her thoughts and actions may seem extreme - or, in our greatly changed society, perhaps absurdly nave -, but only the few who have suffered comparable sorrows can say what they would do in her situation. It would take a very hard heart indeed not to feel for Tess, and the strength of her characterization, along with gut-wrenching depiction of her downward spiral, continues to fascinate and move readers - and indeed viewers, as the novel has been filmed no less than seven times and also been adapted into numerous plays, operas, etc. - more than a century after she first became a sensation.Nor is she the only worthwhile character; Tess has perhaps Hardy's largest, most varied, and most interesting cast. Though set almost entirely in Wessex, we get a good cross section of humanity: Angel Clare, who is intelligent and sensitive but selfish; his father, who is a Christian in the truest sense and a rare example of Hardy depicting a minister positively; Alec D'Urberville, the kind of hedonistically and hypocritically evil man who habitually preyed on girls like Tess; Tess' father, an alcoholic and possibly insane deadbeat of the kind who may first seem harmless and even comical but who inadvertently lead many rural families to ruin; and Tess' mother, who though well-meaning, has a combination of harsh practicality and ignorance leading to near-Machiavellian scheming that often has unforeseen negative consequences. Characterization is not Hardy's acknowledged strength, but this proves that he was on par with the greatest writers here as well as elsewhere.Another of the book's biggest and most easily recognizable assets is incredible prose. Hardy was a poet at heart, and it shows. An autodidact, he has a distinct style with a strong self-taught air that can be hard for current readers to immediately grasp; his eccentric vocabulary, full of archaisms and \\"dictionary words,\\" and his heavy use of dialect can easily make his work seem stilted and older than it is. However, this is the apex of his prose as prose; its beauty and power are simply undeniable. Though a very dark novel, the writing often reaches heights of sublime beauty, and philosophical asides about humanity's insignificance, the absence of providence, fate's apparent malice, and social stigmas' drastic effects are immaculately phrased and stunningly forceful. The narration during Tess' lonely ride, the short segment with her son, and the final chapter is almost unmatched in literature, and the writing throughout is incredibly strong - so much so, indeed, that the book would be worth reading for it alone.In reality, of course, there are many other reasons. Elevated prose and other complexities may mean it is not the best Hardy introduction, and new readers would probably be better off with more accessible masterpieces like The Return of the Native or The Mayor of Casterbridge. Some who have read Tess first have also said they found it so depressing that they vowed never to read Hardy again, but its undeniable greatness forced nearly all to break the vow. Thus, whether you read Tess first or not, Hardy is a must read for any serious lover of literature, and Tess is at or near his considerable summit."},{"Title":"Tess of the D'Urbervilles: A pure woman (Harper's modern classics)","review":"There are many good things I could say about this novel: it is excellently written, the characters are vivid, the message is clear and important, the setting is richly textured and gives a detailed glimpse into the past, and it is never boring.Yet, one thing I cannot say is that it was a fun read. Even in the essay in the back of my copy of the novel, critic Irving Howe admits that, \\"The book begins to mobilize and direct large masses of tension which, until the last page, will make the reading of it an experience slow and grueling, a drain upon emotion.\\" There is such a ludicrous amount of tension and tragedy in this novel that reading it is a stressful experience. In a way, it reflects how *good* the author is, because he made me care so much about the characters that I wanted to throw the book against the wall when one of them did something stupid. Finally finishing the novel created a feeling of palpable relief.Despite how stressful it was for me to read this book, I still appreciate its many qualities.

With My T Shirt!","review":"Many T-shirt quilts are simply blocks of t-shirts cut into same-sized squares and arranged in rows. This is a fine approach if one has 9 to 15 or more t-shirts to use in a single quilt. The two authors have gone beyond that and created quilts where the block design is of equal importance to the t-shirt. Some quilts only have space for 5 t-shirts; others use more and most designs are theme-based, though the themes can certainly be adapted to the shirts one has on hand. The initial steps of the process, such as fusing stabilizer to the t-shirt fabric, are explained. The designs are clever and instructions are clear enough for intermediate quilters. I recommend this to people who are looking for creative alternatives to the simple grid for their t-shirt quilts.Addendum: I just finished a quilt from one of their patterns and found the sewing instructions to be incorrect. So...as in any quilting book, make sure you test out the instructions by doing one block first. Other than that, the quilt came out beautifully!"},{"Title":"You Did What??

It it, he brings the main characters of the Nazi regime into light and shows that without them, the Third Reich would not have been the way we see it today. Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goering, Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Martin Bormann, Ernst Roehm, Franz von Papen, Alfred Rosenberg, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Rudolf Hess, Albert Speer, Hans Frank, Baldur von Schirach, the Officer Corps of the Third Reich, Intellectuals and National Socialism, the role of women in Nazi Germany, and finally Rudolf Hoess. Occasionally, the book seems to be a little overwhelming, yet it keeps you interested and the author presents the facts in an interesting fashion. Fest brings to light the fact that each individual played a role in the workings of this regime and without them would never have been what it appears to be today. The author also seems to stress that it was Hitler himself who was the only ! unique individual in the face of Nazism. He was the only one who was intelligent and who saw and carried out what he wanted to be a greater German Reich. All the rest were all just a bunch of stupid, mindless men that blindly followed their Fuehrer in an attempt to hide themselves as failures in life and achieve their ultimate goal, which was power, even if it would mean becoming the pieces in a huge machine of destruction that the world had never seen in its history. Auschwitz kommandant Rudolf Hoess was responsible for the millions that perished in his camp, yet he later claimed that he &quot;also had a heart and was not evil.&quot; This statement alone is all the more terrifying because in a sense, it is the truth. I can practically guarantee that you will not be sorry for reading this book. Fest's portrait of National Socialism and Modern Totalitarianism is essential for anyone who is curious in the workings and men of this terrifying era in history."},{"Title":"The View from the Hill","review":"The View From the Hill was one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time.

The translators have carefully reviewed words which refer to men only, and, when appropriate, translated them to include all the faithful. For example, when the Apostle Paul addresses the &quot;brothers&quot;, the NRSV substitutes &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;brothers and sisters.&quot; They never tamper with masculine references to God. It is their contention that this slight modification actually makes their translation more accurate. For example, when St. Paul says, &quot;Brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant concerning the resurrection,&quot; this version reminds us that the sisters should also not be ignorant. The complete version with the Apocryphal / Deuterocanonical books contains the fullest collection of books received as sacred Scripture by any historical branch of the Christian Church. By including such difficult-to-find books as 3 Maccabees and Psalm 151, they have produced the only easily obtainable Bible for the whole Church."},{"Title":"The New Revised Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha","review":"I purchased ISBN:0195283600. This particular edition differs a bit from other reviews I've read--no portraits, etc.It's an Oxford, so if it were possible for me to have gotten an NRSV with the Apocrypha in genuine black leather from someone else, I'd have done it gladly. Oxford generally cuts corners in the Bible-making process.Because it will be a secondary Bible for me, I'm not terribly peeved about Jesus' words NOT being red, there being no concordance, and there being no dictionary of any kind. The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible.I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well.Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV!If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied."},{"Title":"The New Revised Standard Version Bible with Apocrypha","review":"It's hard to find superlatives enough to describe this edition. Everything about it is both useful and beautiful.A pocket Bible with the Apocrypha is rare enough to begin with, but--in addition to the usual Catholic Deuterocanonicals and Protestant Apocrypha--this little book manages to include everything in the Greek and Slavonic canons. It will fatten your pocket a little, but it's worth the extra bulk to have the extra books, especially if you're interested in the history of Christian thought.The binding makes pocket Bibles from American publishers look crude. The type, even in the footnotes, is remarkably legible. There are just enough helps in the back to be useful without bulking up the book unnecessarily.The Anglicized Edition is not substantially different from the American edition of the NRSV.

These are the people who sometimes do not even travel to Tokyo, much less Hawaii, S.F. or NYC!

But as a lot of college undergraduates, I swept the book aside and forgot about it.I recently uncovered it and figured why not give reading it a try.As soon as I turned the first page it became obvious that this would be a text I would not be putting down soon.Bruce Feiler paints a magnificent picture of the world he entered into as an American teacher of English in Japan. Sharing with us the laughs and lessons learned along the way.This offers an amazing story to those interested in traveling abroad as well as any person interested in another culture.Even those these exploits took place decades ago a truth remains the same, keep your mind open to the world and you can always learn something new about yourself."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"What are Japanese schools really like? That's a question I'm interested in. Turns out, according to Bruce Feiler, Japanese schools are overcrowded and overly focused on discipline and structure. Why are they so successful, then? They are successful in producing students who work well in overcrowded, disciplined and structured situations. Japanese schools are remarkably bad in producing creative and self-motivated students. As a librarian working in the public schools, I found this a fascinating book."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler's cultural \`adventure', teaching young students in Japan, starts out with a really good laugh as he gets his first lesson on customs; learning to bathe! Truly comedic, though the humor early on bothered me. And sure enough, I eventually learned why.As it happens to be, Learning to Bow is a deeply rooted custom that demands the \`utmost' respect, where humor interferes. I wasn't able to grasp the full understanding of what I was feeling until the near end of the book when the graduating children began practicing the bow to perfection. As Feiler too observes, learning to bow is \\"far more than a mere social greeting: it is the prime ingredient in the syntax of Japanese life.\\"Awareness increased, I truly enjoyed this book. Feiler does a fine job presenting a clear picture of his experiences; from the bath to the cast, to the detailed discipline students receive, to the iron watch of their mothers, and how the students received his visit. I did observe however, how similar the fundamental \`undercarriage' of Japanese values as it pertains to stressing a higher education, are to customs in America. True, the methods employed to teach children differ, but hovering pressures on stressing education and continuing on to college and beyond are similar. My favorite treats where I enjoyed the deepest laugh was coming by the question on naming the real estate company... \`Up River, was it!?!' Too funny. And without a shred of doubt it took a lot to get up off the floor after reading Sato and Ishikawa's expose on \`the way of love'. Absolutely a keepsake. The \`Team Teaching' plan I thought, too, was a nice touch-up. Just an overall very interesting read Learning to Bow is. The title speaks volumes!"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler takes us on an insightful and often humourous look at what it's like to teach English in a Japanese junion high school. He combines classic cultural research with his own personal experiences, giving the reader a good look inside a world that so many people both love and often misunderstand.It isn't just the Japanese school system that Feiler lets the reader explore in Learning to Bow. All aspects of Japanese culture are up for grabs, from dating to the proper way to eat lunch to fashion. He often makes comparisons between Japanese and American methods, drawing his own conclusions but still giving us a chance to form our own without his bias. While he may disagree with the benefits of some parts of Japanese culture, he doesn't say, for example, that those aspects are bad. Merely that he disagrees.I've read this book twice before, and still love it now as much as I did when I first opened the cover to page 1. Though Feiler's experiences recounted in the book take place in the late 80's, the words and story themselves have such a timeless feel that they could have been written yesterday.Most certainly, I'd recommend this book for anyone who's seriously interested in teaching in Japan (through the JET program, perhaps), or for those who are interested in another look into Japan's fascinating culture."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler gives a delightfully humorous and fascinating narration of his experience as an English teacher in a junior high in Japan with an often surprising inside look at the culture.

I had to keep in mind though, Japan has changed a lot since the author was a teacher in Japan."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler was one of the first JET English language teachers in Japan, and chronicles his experiences with his Japanese students, supervisors and colleagues with an observant eye towards Japanese society and culture. Bruce-san takes us along on his eye-opening hospital stay, on learning how to pick up Japanese girls at bars, on seasonal trips for fall viewings, skiing, and more.One obvious advantage in Bruce's camp was the fact that he already spoke Japanese and had previously lived in Japan, easing his transition. Although the portrait of Japanese society is somewhat dated (late '80s, much has transpired since then with the Japanese economy), his portrayal of a country at odds with its unique culture versus globalization, of the schools serving as parents and educators combined, and of the group, rather than the individual, as a unit captures the Japanese spirit. This was a delightful book in the vein of Will Ferguson's \\"Hokkaido Highway Blues\\" and Dave Barry's \\"Dave Barry Does Japan.\\" If you're considering teaching in Japan through the JET program, this is an excellent introduction to the Japanese school system and of the early JET program."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Fielder pens the story of his experience as an English Teacher in Japan. Similar to \\"You Gotta Have Wa\\", this book is more about the experiences of an outsider fitting in to Japan than the occupational hazards of teaching English. To use his own words, Fielder really does cut into the heart of Japan. Interspersed between stories of the challenges of the educational system are many deeper lessons. Included are an explanation of the importance of group harmony and identity, how co-workers balance formal working relationships with personal bonds, and how personal development differs between Japan and the West.Perhaps my only struggle was hearing how hard it was for the author to find a date in Japan. Japan is legendary for English teachers \\"punching above their weight\\" and finding girlfriend's well out of their league in the US. But perhaps the book would have lost it's tone and cultural insights if it degenerated into a story of how many girls the author picked up.The book has held up remarkably over the past 10 years. Despite the bursting of the Japanese bubble, the cultural lessons ring true today. I recommend the book to anyone interested in Japan, independent of occupation."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"The author, Feiler, took up a year long tenture in a Japanese secondary school to teach English. As such, most of the chapters in this book are concentrated on comparisons between the Japanese school system and its American counter part. The author did an excellent analysis on this subject matter, there were lots of insightful ideas within the chapters. The writing style of this book is crisp and clear, sparkled with touches of humors at various places. Overall, it's an excellent book to be used for cross-cultural research, as well as a fun and educational book to read about. The only slight complain I have regarding this book is that since the author had concentrated heavily on the subject matter of 'schools', therefore he had to left many of the other fanscinating aspects of the Japanese culture unmentioned. It's not an all-around cross-cultural book."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I lived in Japan for eight years with the millennium right in the middle and while it is true that Feiler describes a situation that has changed quite a lot, there is much more in the book that is still relevant and truthful. I find it kind of funny that a number of readers think Feiler is arrogant or that he has a superiority complex. I found just the opposite: he is very able to laugh at himself and the crazy situations that all foreigners find themselves in in new cultures, but he is also honest enough to share his nicknames and frustrated feelings that are a natural part of the first year in a new place. I also think his great appreciation for Japan shines through his narrative - he doesn't claim to be an expert; he claims to be an observer, and for someone who stayed for a year, I think he observed a great deal.I loved living in Japan very much. I encountered both the \\"Can you use chopsticks?\\" types of askers and other very engaging, eclectic and unique people, and I think Japan, like any culture, presents the usual share of close-minded and open-minded people. Feiler both loves and hates various aspects of life there, which -- and this is the final truth of living abroad -- is what happens to us when we are at home. After a period of time, we are able to see the individuals as Selves and not just as Cultural Others. He says this when he is saying good-bye to his junior high students: he tells of visiting a doll store, where he first thought the dolls all looked the same, but as he watched the artist work with them, he began to see the differences. He says that this is what he began to realize about them as students, and he asks them also to realize this about other foreign teachers who come to teach them in future years.For those who find the book boring or lacking feeling, let me tell you a story from Japan and you can judge. I had a very good friend in Japan and when we went to say good-bye after eight years, we were both crying in the train station as we bowed and said good-bye. We didn't hug and we didn't go on and on about how much we valued our friendship. But if you think there was no feeling, read more about \\"soto-mae\\" and \\"tata-mae\\".

The book includes many humorous episodes as well as studies in how to adapt to new surroundings and to people who have different behaviors from those of our own. The reader will develop a greater appreciation for the way in which the Japanese education system works at the levels described in the book and in how one must develop a thick skin and a great sense of humor in order to be accepted when traveling or working overseas. The characters in this book are real and are brought to life on paper quite effectively.

This book de-mythologizes the educational system and shows you not only its impressive strengths, but also its fatal flaws. I thought it had a very balanced approach. It would be great to read whenever you feel that the American educational system is being left in the dust. It will raise your spirits."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Into both the strengths and weakness of not only Japan's educational system, but its culture as a whole. We as Westerners have a tendency to perceive the Japanese as having a &quot;perfect&quot; society, but this book helps to expose its flaws. Yes, their economy, schools, etc, etc are (or at least often seem) superior to our own, but as Mr. Feiler points out rather repeatedly, is it worth the price of ultimate conformity they are asked to pay? While I certainly think we can learn many, many things from them, they can also learn much from us. I would rather come from the &quot;inferior&quot; American educational system than give up so many of my freedoms of personal expression.As an added bonus, Mr. Feiler's book is not only immensely informative, it is a fun read with lots of interesting nuggets of trivia about Japanese culture and history. And the way the chapters are broken down into very specific themes (they are even each introduced with a quote to help illuminate that chapter's theme) would make it an excellent choice to use in the classroom at the high school or college level, in segments or as a whole.Overall, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I was extremely put off by the disrespectful perspective the author used to describe the people that befriended him in a country where he was a guest. Instead of progressing to some enlightenment, the author's descriptions continued to be universally shallow and derisive. He showed a definite lack of understanding about the ancient culture that he encountered. His prejoritive names for families and coworkers were offensive to me, and I imagine would be highly unkind should they be read by the people who were kind to him and allowed him into their home and their lives.It should be noted that he did attempt to comprehend reasons for some behaviors and practices that seemed counter-productive to the students that he taught. In this way, he may have attempted to break down barriers. However, he reverted to describing people and events in detail to point out what appeared ridiculous to him.Ever hopeful that the author would arrive at some self-awareness and some respect for the culture that received him, I read the book to the end. Unfortunately, the author never changed in his attitude, continuing to prove that he learned little about himself in that year abroad.The result was that he provided the perfect reason why Americans are viewed as arrogant, uneducated and disrespectful of anyone except themselves..... The author truely revealed himself as the prototype \\"Ugly American\\".Don't waste your time. He never \\"Learned to Bow\\"."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"As an employee of a Japanese company I expecially enjoyed this insightful revelation of everyday life in small town Japan. The writing is very clear and fast paced. I could feel myself in his shoes much of the time and at several points laughed out loud. He has a strong entry to start the book that &quot;hooked&quot; me within 10 pages.I strongly reccommend this for anyone curious about the world and especially for anyone working with or for the Japanese. Great cultural insights are provided as well as a clear explanation of the mechanisms, style, strengths and weaknesses of their school system, parenting and home life"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I remember before I left for my first trip to Japan in 1996, reading about Feiler and his adventures in an Onsen hot springs. I remember his description of having to take of all his clothes and bathe in front of all these Japanese guys he just met. Any yet, during my trip in 1996 the same thing happened to me! I felt just like Feiler! The book is informative about Japanese culture and at the same time a great read. Its a must read if you plan to visit Japan...especially if you are a teacher."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Every gaijin (foreigner) who visits or lives in Japan is going to have a completely different experience, and thankfully, Feiler wrote his impressions down. My uncle gave me this book in hardback when it first came out in 1991 because Feiler is from his hometown of Savannah, Georgia. I'm glad to see it's still in print in paperback because it's a classic that anyone interested in Japanese culture should read.Feiler begins his book by bravely stating, \\"I dropped my pants and felt a rush of cool wind against my legs.\\" He's standing on a stone path in the cool of evening his first night out of Tokyo. Twelve sets of eyes peer curiously at him, whom we learn are his new co-workers in the school where he's teaching. Yes, this is quite a bit of culture shock. Whereas in the states, a new teacher might be taken to a luncheon, Feiler says, \\"As a newcomer in Japan, I would be welcomed into my office as I was welcomed into the world: with a bare body and a fresh bath.\\"The author's sense of humor is evident throughout the book, and he spices up a tremendous volume of research with his engaging narrative. Since he's encountering everything for the first time, he describes his reactions in a way that helps initiate readers into Japan's fascinating and unique culture.I found it amazing that Feiler could experience so much in one year. For example, he breaks his ankle and must visit a hospital, which makes one understand why studying the Japanese language before embarking can come in handy. (Feiler appears to be fluent; did he learn that at Yale?) He attends sports day, field trips, city and small-town events, a wedding, and of course, the climactic journey up Mt. Fuji.Feiler's trip up Mt. Fuji was my favorite part of the book, and something I longed to do when I visited the Tokyo area -- yet I traveled mid-peak by car instead of on foot. When the author finally makes it to the top, he describes his view for us armchair travelers: \\"Standing on an isolated spot atop this ancient volcano, far removed from the crowds of Tokyo...we popped open our bottle of imported champagne and beheld the sight that has inspired a nation since the gods of heaven first descended the bridge to the Land of the Central Plain: the caress of the Rising Sun.\\" (This ancient myth is explained in detail in the book.)If you're planning on going to teach or travel in Japan, Feiler's work is a must-read; for no other reason, it will whet your appetite for writing down your own experiences (yes, he must have carried a notebook everywhere he went!). But you definitely should read more recent literature written by other travelers, as well as by native Japanese. I also recommend a good basic Nihongo course, so you'll be able to navigate the train systems in case you journey outside of the major cities. Or if by chance you end up in the hospital with a broken something or other.--Reviewed by Heather Lynn Ivester"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"There were books written about Japan in 1891 that were better than this book was in 1991. There is no reason to read this book. I'll just give a brief example here.Chapter 9 is supposed to be about homeroom activities, but it opens by confounding the reader with pages of nonsense on the meaning of classrooms in Japan: \\"In every school across the country, students are assigned to a homeroom class, or kumi. The word kumi, which is rooted in the Japanese character for thread, was first used several hundred years ago to describe bands of samurai warriors attached to a feudal lord... The importance of the kumi as an educational tool, however, goes beyond this good-natured team spirit. The classroom that the students inhabited had been, in effect, leased to them by the school, in an arrangement not unlike the way a feudal lord lent land to a group of serfs.\\" Later, talking about kumi, he writes: \\"No one [had warned] me that the country still suffers from the legacy of a four-hundred-year-old feudal class system that was officially outlawed over a century ago.\\"This is pure fantasy. The word kumi is the Japanese word for \\"form\\", as in \\"fifth form, third year\\". All British schools use this system. Japan adopted it from the British and translated the vocabulary. The second sentence I quoted is not even justifiable by strained etymology but is purely an invention of the author's wild imagination, and the third is his bizarre and wrong conclusion. The entire book smacks of this sort of Orientalism. He even drops the wabi-sabi bomb. Don't read it."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I remember when this book came out, and was a must-read for any American doing business in Japan. I didn't read it then because I 'd spent time in Japan myself, had my own ideas about it, and had many Japanese friends (Japanese-born and working abroad) living here in the United States. I figured I had better things to do than read what I suspected were the gosh-gee musings of a southern-born Yale boy, fresh out of college. Well, I just read it recently because I happened to find it lying around here (my husband's purchase, way back when), and I have discovered that my suspicions were correct. Feiler writes with a poorly disguised superiority, in which the wry amusement and wonder he aims for come across as slightly cranky paternalism. This kind of book works only when the writer (generally one more mature and less stick-up-the-wazoo than Feiler), genuinely loves the people and culture he's writing about. Or, conversely, when he's honest about disliking the country and it's people and he has the writing chops to make such misanthropy funny. Feiler straddles here. Furthermore, his writing is immature and poorly edited. He actually misuses the two-dollar word \\"enamored\\", writing \\"enamored with\\" instead of \\"enamored of\\"! In such ways do I judge young writers. If you want to sound like a big ol' Yale man, use a stlylebook and dictionary. Or get a better editor.Don't bother with this over-hyped and outdated book."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler spent a year teaching English in a Japanese junior high school in Tochigi prefecture. His book contains both his observations on the Japanese school system and his own experiences as an American living in Japan for the first time. He also takes time to explain unfamiliar aspects of the culture, from Shinto religious practices to the evolution of the Japanese school lunch. This is a very appealing introduction to Japan from a young man who admires many aspects of Japanese culture but does not hesitate to criticize other aspects. There are some wonderful set pieces, such as his introduction to an onsen (hot spring) communal bath, his stay in a hospital, and his climb of Mt. Fuji. Feiler was in Japan in the late 80's, so some of his observations are, of course, dated, but that's hardly a good reason not to read this fine book. How could a memoir not be \\"dated\\" in the sense that it conveys a particular time and place? Feiler's strength as a writer is the blend of sharp observation and humor (including the self-deprecating kind) that he brings to his book. He depicts very well the sort of \\"lost in translation\\" moments that any traveler to Japan (or any other unfamiliar place) is bound to have. A further plus is the way he avoids the hushed, reverential tone found in some other accounts by travelers to Japan. This is a particularly useful book if you are planning a trip to Japan yourself."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"An unusual view of Japanese society. Seen not as usual through the eyes of a tourist, journalist, or other professional observer, but from the viewpoint of someone living there. Mr Fieler must not only learn a new job, but a new culture."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"As I made my way through Feiler's account, I was primarily amused by his humorous initial encounters with Japanese culture: the often awkward questions frequently posited him by his friends, coworkers, and students; the stark dissimilarities between the Japanese and the American-style classroom; the extent to which Feiler's foreign appearance and personality caused him to stand out amid an otherwise fairly uniform populace. In nearly every chapter, I found myself laughing out loud. As the book progressed, however, I became disturbed by the author's general exclusion of personal reflections on his experiences. For example, it remains ambiguous whether the author is interested in trying \\"nanpa\\"--a procedure in which strangers \\"pick up\\" on women in bars, discos, or similar environments, mostly popular among young Japanese men--out of a genuine desire to procure a Japanese girlfriend, or merely in demonstration of a detached cultural curiosity. He interjects almost no explicit discussions of his feelings or emotional reactions toward the many shocking, challenging, and even tragic events that he encounters throughout the narrative. As someone interested in going to Japan to teach English, and curious about the types of experiences had by Americans who have done so in the past, this particular quality of Feiler's narrative was a bit disappointing.By the end of the book, however, I came to the realization that the very inclusion of certain information in Feiler's memoir speaks volumes on the nature of the clash between Western and Japanese culture. The details that Feiler includes on the overbearingly autocratic leadership style of his school principle, the structure of a seventh-grade fieldtrip to Disneyland Tokyo, and the reaction of Japanese students toward his unorthodoxly American pedagogical style all attest to the impression that Feiler was deeply moved and challenged by his interactions with Eastern culture. And the laughter and tears that several of his anecdotes drew forth compel me to conclude that these passages were not written without emotional affectation.In my preparation to move overseas to teach and live among an unfamiliar society, I found this book deeply enlightening and encouraging. As previous experiences abroad have taught me, being a foreigner in a new country can be a direly lonely and often stressful experience. Feiler has given us an insightful and meaningful account of what Americans moving to Japan ought to expect from the culture clash, as well as detailed many interesting aspects of Japanese society that outsiders interested in the country might not otherwise consider. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on Japan and Japanese culture.I don't care how many books you have or have read about Japan your studies are not complete until you have read this book.Learning to Bow went into the REAL JAPAN with every day people, there customs, and there every day lifes.Step away from the books for tourist and find what the real Japan is like.I learned more from this one book than all my others and I have a lot."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This is such a great book! I loved reading it, slow at times but it gave me insight in what I was wanting to do with my life."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This is the best book I have read by or about foreigners living in Japan. The author has moved to Japan to teach English in a typical small town school. Quite a wide variety of situations and scenes in Japanese daily life are covered from an outsider's perspective. His interactions with the school's principal, district administrators, teachers, the students and their parents are well written in a descriptive and anecdotal way. Mr Feiler is not just a good storyteller but is a very insightful writer as well. I immediately reread the book and enjoyed the second reading even more than the first."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I lived in Japan and taught English in a small town Junior High School at about the same time Bruce Feiller was living the experience he relates in the book. It was so much fun to relive that time in my life through another person's eyes. The author's writing style is fluid, easy to read and very engaging, not to mention funny! You do not have to be a former english teacher in order to truly enjoy his experiences. Learning to Bow is light and enjoyable. This book gives the reader insight into a culture that can is full of contradictions that only make sense once you've experienced them first hand. A must read for anyone thinking of travelling to Japan especially if he/she will be teaching. For everyone else it will be a very enjoyable, light story of a young man's adventures in a very foreign country."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Learning to Bow: Inside the Heart of JapanTaking a break from all my fictional reading, I was handed a copy of 'Learning to Bow: Inside the Heart of Japan'. I know a few people that went to Japan to teach English. I think quite a few of us have considered this option in our early 20's; the glitz and glamour of going to another country and learning a new culture and escaping the pressures of youth.This story is a first person account of an individual that went over to Japan to teach English in a small Japanese town, and his learnings of Japanese culture. At first, I found the book interesting and enjoyed learning more about Japanese culture. By the middle of the book, though, I found his commentary redundant and slowing down. By the end of the book, I was flipping through pages, waiting for something new to be said.Since it's a quick read, I recommend it to anyone really interested in learning more about other cultures, in particular, Japanese culture from a gai-jin perspective."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This book is useful for anyone moving to Japan, either as part of the JET Programme or any other reason. After living in Japan for a few years (not on the JET Programme) I recognized a lot of truth to what Feiler had to say. This book also provided me with an inside look at and the pros and cons of the Japanese school system. Through my own experience, I honestly am amazed at the amount of pressure placed on students to do well in school in Japan. For the most part, the students' effort pays off when they are accepted into a great high school or college, regardless of the two-hour-one-way commute some of them endure. At the same time, however, I wish the school system in Japan encouraged students to be more creative and that the environment allowed them to learn more about the world around them. Despite that, though, the Japanese people make great students and are some of the nicest people you'll meet in your life. This book, through the author's experiences in Tochigi Prefecture, show this and more, all in an entertaining, well-written way. And if for that reason alone, this book is worth reading once for anyone interested in Japan."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Although Feiler paints a detailed, and often humorous picture of life in a Japanese public school, his picture is far too clean. He strikes me as being a bit like the foreign talents that work in Japan who have been neutured by Japanese society to make them more palletable to their xenophbic audience. I felt like the Ministry of Education had come through and ereased the negative comments before I could read them. So, in short: it is a well-written book, but should not be the final word on an outsider's perspective on the Japanese educational system."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This book by Bruce Feiler is not just about the Japanese educational system but about the Japanese themselves. While it does touch on how students and teachers work together, teen suicide and cram school, it also deals with the problems of racism, the way the Japanese balance their lives and their duties to society, and even a few chapters on Japanese dating and marriage. It is full of humor, insight and clear thinking. Mr. Feiler clearly but a lot of thought into his visit and is just as clear in explaining to us what he feels is the important and major issues that Japan has to deal with - not just then but now and in the future. A must for any library on Asia or Japan."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book, even if at times the author did seem a bit lofty. It was funny and gave a nice peek into some of the mannerisms in Japan. Though there were a few slow areas of the book, for the most part, it flowed nicely!"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"\\"I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . .\\" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"While it was maybe more relevant back when it was written there are a few things that have changed. Yes, Sano is now not what I would consider country-side. It is much more grown up, and even has an outlet mall! And Japan is no longer in the bubble-era, which means that excessive spending has been capped.However, most startling are the things that haven't changed in Japan. The education system has changed little. The main difference being that the students are more used to seeing a foreigner in their school as the JET program and other similar companies have been around for a number of years.I was also surprised at the author's often ethnocentric views. For someone who says he studied Japanese language (and one would assume at least a little of the culture from the language lessons), he seemed surprisingly ignorant about Japan. It is even more shocking since he says that he studied in Japan for 6 months. I can understand certain moments of disbelief - I still have them after being here for some time - but his lack of cultural understanding was unacceptable. What exactly did he learn in his Japanese classes? Or was he exaggerating his ability, like he exaggerated many other points in his book? The way in which he would just confront people, openly, rather than simply accepting the differences, or at least being less confrontational, was mind-boggling.It isn't a bad book, per se, but some of his claims are not substantiated which makes it hard to take him seriously at parts. When read along other accounts it helps to paint a picture of Japan, but it shouldn't be read on its own."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Stumbled across this recently and found it an agreeable and on-target accound of life in Japan, based on my own experience. Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) \\"teaching in Japan from the male perspective\\" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"_Learning to Bow_ is an engaging, very readable, incisive but affectionate memoir of an American teacher's sojourn in rural Japan. Especially hilarious is Feiler's account of preparations for a junior high school fieldtrip to Disneyland that included setting up chairs and practicing getting on and off the bus efficiently. (Japanese tour groups seem to me to spend a lot of time hovering around outside their busses.) Assembling for group photos at every stop is another activity I have noticed preoccupying Japanese tour groups in Hawai'i and California.. Japanese ritualism and indirect speech make more sense here than in, say, in James Kirkup's condscending memoirs . Feiler does not overklook Japanese ethnocentrism (not just we're best but we are so totally unique), nor does he recognize some of his own. Cho, a friend, tells Feiler: \\"Everybody says our students have to learn to live in a world that is larger than Japan. But, first, our teachers have to learn that such a world exists\\"The rural Japanese are continually astounded that an alien can speak Japanese, use chopsticks, and in some ways seems more traditionally Japanese than they are -- though such statements are probably more formulaic than Feiler notices. Nevertheless, he mostly deserves the tributes he receives for trying to understand and respect Japanese lifeways -- and for writing so engagingly about his experiences and feelings there.Along with Lydia Minatoya's _Talking to High Monks_ (only partly about Japan), and John Treat's _Great Mirror Shattered_, this is my favorite book of Americans recounting extended visits to Japan."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Exceptionally fine narrative"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Although written about experiences the author had about 18 years ago, this remains a useful and entertaining primer for those who are interested in Japanese education. Anyone who has been to Japan or worked as a teacher in Japanese schools will be able to relate to Feiler's predicaments as a novice to this complex culture and mindset. Feiler's research of the history and motivations behind Japan's educational system, as it related to his own situation in Sano's middle schools, is an excellent introduction to the topic. Of course, Japan has changed much since the period this book was written, but not that much that you won't smile at the similar circumstances you may have found yourself in at some point in Japan.The author takes a difficult route at times in balancing between a review of Japan's educational system and his own interactions with students and fellow teachers. Personally, I would rather have enjoyed reading more stories of his involvement with his students, but Feiler's purpose for this book was more than just a one-year travel diary. And in this regard he does a fine job. The only issue I had with the entire book was the cynical approach used in two chapters describing school graduation and a marriage ceremony. Using just Feiler's depictions, a reader could form quite an unfavorable view of these ceremonies when compared to their Western counterparts. Although many Japanese will not express outward emotion during such important occasions of their life cycles, their inward feelings can be just as strong as any Westerner and should not be judged any differently. But these are small distractions from what is overall a wonderful introduction to the challenging vocation of teaching English in Japan.It would be great to see a followup article or book by Feiler regarding this topic. Time and experience tend to add so much to one's view of the world, and Feiler certainly shows the literary skills here that would make such a retrospective work eminently worth reading. The only question might be whether the people of Sano would truly welcome Feiler back to write such a book, considering the criticism they and their educational system take in \\"Learning to Bow.\\" Yet somehow I'd be willing to wager that most Sano-ites would not be able to resist Feiler's Southern charm and sincerity anymore now than they could back in 1987."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I am an easy audience and for the first twenty pages or so, I was really set to enjoy this book.Then I found myself gradually more and more frustrated when Mr. Feiler would stop to explain how some event or peculiar classroom trend he experienced was obviously due to blah blah blah historical or cultural Japanese dynamic...for pages upon pages. If I wanted to study social complexities, I think I could read Reischauer or someone with ample expertise.He also maintains quite an attitude of American superiority over the absurd Japanese way of doing things. He seems to think himself immune to this, though, because he has learned Japanese. He even goes so far in one chapter to discuss his anxieties about the feasibility of engaging in intimate acts with a Japanese woman due to his highly developed gringo genitalia. He also seemed obsessed with the fact that he was taller than almost all Japanese people. If there is one thing you will learn in this book, it is that Bruce Feiler is 6'4&quot;. His light humility is hardly bevievable.Despite the vast network of superiority complexes seen in this specimen, this book is periodically entertaining. However,I think it is not worth your time,"},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"The primary strength of this book is the writing style. Unlike many books about Japanese culture, this book is funny and &quot;living.&quot; The book contains a series of anecdotes, each one focusing on a particular experience that Bruce S. Feiler had during his stay. The stories are written as first-person memoirs, and cover such broad topics as Hiroshima and Nagasaki to how to date a Japanese girl. The writing is clever and engaging.The only thing I felt this book was lacking was an update of some sort. Written about 11 years ago, &quot;Learning to Bow&quot; is about Japan during the &quot;bubble economy.&quot; Japan has gone through severe economic and societal changes since then, and I wonder how much of the information is still current. Surely, with the JET program in full swing for several decades now, the presence of foreigners is not such a surprise anymore. Also, the place of women has gone through some significant changes since this book was written.Still, anyone planning a long-term stay in Japan should read this book. It is fun, insightful and has great tips for climbing Mt. Fuji."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Bruce Feiler was one of the first participants on the JET program, a program sponsored by the Japanese government to bring foreign young people to Japan for the purposes of education and &quot;internationalization.&quot; While Feiler's experiences are a little unusual, in that he can already speak Japanese when he arrives and the events at his school are rather dramatic, overall his story reflects the life of a typical JET program participant. The culture shock, the unbending bureaucracy, the complex and often disaffected attitudes of students, the instant celebrity and lack of privacy that goes with it, are all symptoms that JETs experience. I read the book and often found myself nodding in agreement, having experience the same events and feelings myself. If you want to have an intimate look at the world of education in Japan today, Feiler's book is an excellent place to start. If you are thinking about joining the JET program, this book is a must, along with Importing Diversity."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as &quot;god's gift to English teaching&quot;. For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"If I hadnt actually lived in Japan i could see how i could mistake this thing for authoritive, but it amazes me that anyone who has lived out here more than a year could see this as much more than the bag of wind it is. With its pretentious title and lofty quotations of translated haikus, Feiler proves he knows how to make a good impression. The problem is, if you actually read it, you realize he isnt much good at doing anything else.At the time of writing this book, Feiler had been living out here a year as JET highschool teacher (though he doesnt actually admit to that in so many words- to hear him tell it, he was here on &quot;special invite from the japanese goverment&quot;, as if he was some kind of high-ranking diplomat). The title (&quot;Inside the heart of Japan&quot;) and chapter headings (&quot;Drinking alone in rural Japan&quot;, for example), suggest that by reading it you'll gain powerful, poetic realities about this mysterious country. But every chapter left me unsastisfied. He has a habit of starting chapters with an overwritten account of the kind of thing everyone does within a week of being here, and then, when its time to actually say anything, starts quoting press articles off the english language news services wire. If you comb the book carefully to seperate these rote repetitions of facts already freely available from what he actually writes himself, you'll be left with a very slim and trite account of japan indeed.Its a good thing for the author there are so few books of this type about Japan out there, because if people had more to compare it with they'd realize how bad it is. Anyone who came out here to teach english for a year and scanned the internet for newspaper articles to quote from for padding could have written this book."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"As one who logged a few years teaching in Japan around the same era, the subject matter certainly interests me, and this is an interesting study of Japanese culture and the experience of AETs as existed in the late 1980s.However, the book is a bit dated and I don't know how accurate of a portrayal it'd be for those interested in the Japan teaching experience of today. During the author's experience, the JET program was in its early years and gaijin in the classrooms was still a novelty. In the last 20 years or so, however, an entire generation has grown up accustomed to native english teachers and encounters with foreigners no longer prompt the level of surprise, ignorance, and curiosity portrayed by this author. Also, this book was written at the apex of Japan's bubble economy, and SO many of the attitudes, beliefs and opinions expressed in the book about Japan and its future are the product of that era, circumstances that have obviously changed dramatically in the years since the bubble burst.Also found parts to be exaggerated. As one example, the author repeatedly informs us of what a rural backwards hamlet he was assigned to, I believe at one point even alleging that most people in his town had never seen a foreigner before him. I found these descriptions dubious: in reality Tochigi contains about 2 million people, is located in the most populous region of Japan on the outskirts of the Kanto plain right next to Tokyo, and contains sites like Nikko that attract thousands of foreign tourists every year. It is hardly the inaka backwoods outpost depicted in this book.Also found it a bit odd the way the author seemed intent on avoiding mentioning that he was actually just a teacher in the JET Programme, which is well-known and imports thousands of new young english teachers every year to serve in public schools throughout Japan. Instead, he described his job in vaguely pretentious terms along the lines of \\"I was selected by Japan's Ministry of Education\\", as if to imply that he alone was some sort of specially selected ambassador.Nonetheles, despite having aired these pet peeves, I must admit that I still enjoyed the read because it brought me back to an earlier much enjoyed time in my life. I'd recommend the read to Japan \\"has beens\\" like myself, but not necessarily to those seeking an accurate portrayal of today's Japan teaching experience."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"I can understand how people who haven't lived in Japan could mistake this book as authoritive, but it amazes me that anyone who has lived out here more than a year could see this as much more than the bag of wind it is. With its pretentious title and lofty quotations of translated haikus, Feiler proves he knows how to make a good impression. The problem is, if you actually read it, you realize he isn't much good at doing much else as a writer.Stylistically, this book is an imitation of travel writer Pico Iyer's \\"The Lady and the Monk: Four Seasons in Kyoto\\", but while Feiler has the poetic trappings down, he doesn't have the insight into Japan to back it up.At the time of writing this book, Feiler had been living out here a year as JET highschool teacher (though he doesnt actually admit to that in so many words- to hear him tell it, he was here on \\"special invite from the Japanese goverment\\", as if he was some kind of high-ranking diplomat). The title (\\"Inside the heart of Japan\\") and chapter headings (\\"Drinking alone in rural Japan\\", for example), are great- they suggest that by reading it you'll gain powerful, poetic realities about this mysterious country. But every chapter left me unsastisfied. He has a habit of starting chapters with an overwritten account of the kind of thing everyone does within a week of being here (drinking in a Karaoke bar, bathing at an Onsen, etc), and then, when its time to actually say anything, starts quoting press articles off the english language news services wire, listing off statistics about how many hours kids study after school and so on. If you comb the book carefully to seperate these rote repetitions of facts already freely available from what he actually writes himself, you'll be left with a very slim and trite account of japan indeed.Its a good thing for the author there are so few books of this type about Japan out there, because if people had more to compare it with they'd realize how bad it is. Anyone who came out here to teach english for a year and scanned the internet for newspaper articles to quote from for padding could have written this book.If you want to know more about life in Japan, Try the book by Pico Iyer it was cribbed from, or better still, \\"Hitching Rides with the Buddha, by Will Ferguson. Not as flashy in style, but a lot more knowledgeable and heavier in substance."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Like many people in Japan this book was recommended to me but I didn't want to read it. A friend gave me a copy and eventually I read it.The author gets so many things wrong about Japan that I wonder if he really spoke as much Japanese as he suggests. I often found my self scoffing at his opinions and explanations. It seems this was the end of his Japanese experience as he has gone on to write books on other topics.He also strikes me as quite a loner, if this is the summary of his social interaction he must have had a lonely time, which on the JET Programme is not uncommon.However he has a very good writing style which makes up for a lot of his failures. I'd suggest reading it and enjoying his perspective but be wary of his explanations."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Feiler's book is entertaining at times and tiresome at others. The entertaining parts are the stories he tells about his experiences; however, his attempt to analyze Japan sound too much like a regurgitation of other books that purport to introduce Japanese culture.As others have pointed out, the information is quite dated and Japanese high schools have changed greatly. It suffers also from some rather curious translations, which mystify rather than clarify. I'm not sure I'd call shiso \\"mint\\" or edible chrysanthemum \\"a bright yellow daisy\\". Even more mysterious is how he manages to translate \\"higaisha\\" as \\"one who receives pressure\\" when the characters literally mean \\"receiving injury person\\". A much better translation is \\"victim\\", and in fact Japan's \\"victim consciousness\\" is an important theme in how they understand WWII. James Orr's book \\"Victim as Hero\\" explores this theme carefully.If you're interested in finding out about Japanese culture, read something by a trained anthropologist. If you're interested in someone's experiences in Japan in the late 1980s then parts of this book will serve you well."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"Many of the previous reviews have pointed out Mr Feller's haughty condescension but what really makes his book a drag is how breathtakingly boring it is. Naked with other men in a hot spring bath? Good gracious me! As another reviewer pointed out, anybody who comes to Japan will experience virtually everything in this book in the first week; what that other reviewer failed to mention is that nobody else will decide to write a tedious book about it all. Filled with shallow 'insights' and yawn-inducing 'adventures', Feller's book is a soporific account of a dull year as lived by a dull individual who managed, somehow, to con a publisher into releasing this dull book. The fact that it's still in print boggles the mind.If you're interested in a good read on Japan look for either of Alan Booth's books (Looking For The Lost & The Roads To Sata), John Morley's Pictures From The Water Trade, Will Ferguson's Hokkaido Highway Blues, or anything by Lafcadio Hearn. All of those authors deliver. Mr Feller's book might be useful for chronic insomniacs but everybody else should steer well clear."},{"Title":"Learning To Bow - Inside The Heart Of Japan","review":"This book is well-written and flows very well. However, some of the events in the book and the way that they are described are too &quot;black and white&quot; for my tastes. A good read, but if you are considering teaching or living in Japan, take this book with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Schooling As Violence","review":"One of the most direct, straightforward, research-based presentations of the shadow side of compulsory education, Harber, a professor of international education at the University of Birmingham, describes in global terms the ways in which schooling not only reproduces violence around the world, but actually naturalizes it and propels it. Because compulsory education is fundamentally authoritarian in nature, and the institution is arranged to control and survey those within it, formal education in many contexts (even dear old Britain) inculcates insensibility towards emotional and physical brutality, sexual abuse, racism and classism. Harber, a plain speaking, no nonsense academic with abundant experience in international education projects, offers a unique and compelling global perspective on the toxic effects of education on pupils. He takes on directly the ways in which almost all educational policy discourse begins with a false consensus--and perhaps a false consciousness--that universal formal education is always of positive humanist benefit in childrens' lives. Instead, after several chapters in which he traces the relationship between recent genocides in (the former) Yugoslavia or Rwanda to common school practices, or the incidence of corporal punishment in the classrooms of contemporary \\"developed\\" countries like the United States and Britian, Harber suggests pointedly, \\"It would be good if in the future politicians, academics and others concerned with educational policy always acknowledged in their speeches and their writing that schools do hard as well as good and that school-pupil violence exists.\\" His book is chock ablock with evidence that this is so, as uncomfortable as this for many. In an American context, where very few academics write bluntly and unapologetically about the harmful effects of education on the human mind and spirit, Harber's work is refreshingly unadorned and unembellished."},{"Title":"Guildbook: Sandmen (The Sandmen Sourcebook for Wraith: The Oblivion, Guildbook Two)","review":"If you enjoy with the Sandman histories, you're gonna love this book. In this book you can find a description of a lot of customes in the Dream. Many times in The Sandman i've heard about several customes, that i didn't knew it, and because of that i don't get what the history was about. If you have this problem, this is what are you looking for, or if you love The Sandman histories like I do, your are gonna love this book too."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"I have reviewed this book previously but am having a second bite because I am annoyed by the conduct of the previous reviewer. He claims, apparently trying to dam the dialogue, there is a phrase: &quot;As you known, Raargh Sergeant, we Wunderkzin ...&quot; No such phrase occurs in the book. A human says to a Kzin born on Wunderland &quot;We sometimes call you Wunderkzin ...&quot; I suggest that if the reviewer wishes to pick holes in the style of a particular story he quote the actual words he complains of and not something he has invented. I believe this is related to a thing called ethics, you know, like honesty and truthfulness.And all thes stories in the book are teriffic! Scream and Leap!"},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"This has one of the great Poul Anderson's last stories in it, which wopuld alone be a sufficient reason to buy it, plus one by Niven himself. The others are by tried-and-tested favourite Man-Kzin authors Paul Chafe and Hal Colebatch. Between them they add up to a fine portrait of the complex human-Kzin interaction after the Kzinti have to try to come to terms with the fact that they can lose wars.In Anderson's Pele, they must acknowledge human superiority in space-craft. But can they? Like most of Anderson's stories, has a strong science as well as human element.In Hal Colebatch's &quot;His Sergeant's Honour&quot;, the collection's strongest story, a battered old Kzin sergeant holds the last Kzin fort on Wunderland, a planet long occupied by the Kzinti but now re-conquered by humans, charged with guarding, among others, a human collaborator and a Royal kitten - Vaemar-Riit, last son of the great Chuut-Riit, who is destined to play a big part in &quot;Music-Box&quot; in Man-Kzin 10, &quot;The Wunder War,&quot; and, I hope, in adventures to come. He is too good a charater to waste.In the meantime, old Raargh-Sergeant must choose between death and dishonour. Or Has it become dishonourable to choose death in this strange new time of Monkey victories?Windows of the Soul, also set in post-occupation Alpha Centauri, is a rather dark detective story in the Raymond Chandler Tradition. Best not say too much for fear of revealing the plot.Larry Niven's &quot;Fly-by-Night&quot; is a follow-on from Hal Colebatch's &quot;Telepath's Dance&quot; in Man-Kzin VIII - what happened ot the dewscendents of the first rogue telepath when he turned against the Patriarchy and threw in his lot with Selina Guthlac and the humans of the &quot;Angel's Pencil&quot;?All these stories are taut, pacy and well-written. The Kzinti, or somne of them. show they are more than just dumb killing-machines and are capable of thoughtfulness."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"received the book in very quick order, Have not finish others getting to that numbers.

And newish author Paul Chafe, whose \\"Windows of the Soul\\" isthe best of the book, and the one that makes MK-IX worth looking for,even if you've already seen the Niven. \\"Windows\\" starts out as an ARMpolice-procedural on Tiamat station, after the brutal murder anddismemberment of Miranda Holtzman, a 19 year-old student engineer. ARMCaptain Joel Allson develops a hot romance during the investigation --which veers off into a disturbing political-terrorist operation, andfinishes with a truly nasty twist. Nice. Chafe's had a couple ofprevious (unmemorable) appearances (in MK-VII & VIII).The other two stories are a Poul Anderson novella (\\"Pele\\"), set asideafter a slow, dull start, and \\"His Sergeant's Honor\\" by Hal Colebatch,which reads like a novel outline. For a bad, dull novel: \\"As you know,Raargh-Sergeant, we Wunderkzin...\\" [note 1]Did I mention the Lurid Baen Cover...? It's Howling Time!Conclusion: one of the weaker of the Man-Kzin books, but the Chafe isfirst-rate entertainment.Happy reading!Pete TillmanNote 1) I see that the old saw \\"As you know, Bob...\\", used to lampoon lumpy exposition,may not be as widely known as I thought.So: this wasn't a real quote, folks, it was parody."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories.

The first and third volumes in the M-K Wars series both had Anderson stories, but this is not one of those. The story previously appeared in an sf magazine (ANALOG, I think) about a year ago, but it is one of the last stories that Anderson wrote before his untimely death. Having corrected that misinformation, I'll say that no book with grand masters Anderson and Niven on board should be missed. And newer writers Chafe and Colebatch are no slouches either."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"I've read every book in the Man-Kzin wars and they just keep getting better with each book. I finished this last book within a couple of days and loved the detail and longer refferences to the kzin side of the story. I've noticed with each book there has been less war and more cooperation between humans and the kzin but that is because most of the kzin are being killed off with each war and the remaining ones are learning to think before they leap.:) I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"All the Man-Kzin stories are teriffic and this does not disappoint. Taut action, real charcters and original ideas in all of them. Sad that the story Pele was one of the last by rhe late, great Poul Anderson. I would like to see more illustrations of the very exciting and often weird scense described - for example the confrontation between the old Kzin warrior Raargh and the human woman resistance fighter Jocelyn in the ruined sergeant's mess in His Sergeant's Honour and the desperate ploy of the kzin cub Vaemar to defuse the situation. More please, and soon!"},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"Fans of the great Poul Anderson should buy this because it contains almost his last story. Hal Colebatch's \\"His Sergeant's Honour\\" should actually come in book 10, after \\"The Corporal in the Caves\\" and before \\"Music Box.\\" It introduces the Royal Kzin kitten Vaemar, later Vaemar-Riit, and the (later) wicked collaborationist-turn-coat police Captain Jocelyn van der Straat, and explores the conflicting demands of honour on a battle-scarred old Kzin sergeant who must come to terms with the unfamiliar concept of \\"Surrender\\" and his duty to protect both Vaemar and a human collaborator.

Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors."},{"Title":"Man-Kzin Wars IX","review":"While this is another good member of the series it is not quite as thought provoking as others with less technical innovation and science than earlier books in the series.

Overall the book \\"looks and feels like something that has been lying in a vault, forgoten for centuries\\".This was all true of the original version, but is no longer true.

The \\"hand-written script\\" has been replaced with a standard computer calligraphy font that looks nice, but does not look hand-written at all. Finally, there is no longer a dried speciman of a Dragnette. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with the book when it arrived. I guess the publisher found they could not make money selling the original version.

She had been involved with Aiden's brother Billy years before his marriage to Clair Meehan, but there is a secret about Gina's son that threatens both of their families.Clair O'Malley is also one of the loops thrown in Aiden and Maddies relationship. She has been like a mother to Aiden's daughter Kelly and does not like the fact that Maddie is threating that relationship. Is also is not comforable when one perticular journalist comes to town looking for a scoop for the marriage between the descendents of two of the towns founding families because Clair had a relationship with him after leaving her husband.Aidens daughter Kelly also is a loop in Aiden and Maddie's relationship because the teenager is pregnant and does not know what to do."},{"Title":"Chances Are","review":"This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel."},{"Title":"Chances Are","review":"In Jersey Shore town Paradise Point Maddy Bainbridge and Aidan O'Malley are getting married. The twosome knows that they must also work extra hard to form a family unity that includes her five years old daughter Hannah and his seventeen years old daughter Gina. However, neither was prepared for the nuttiness of her family who are driving Maddy to think of eloping. All this lunacy is occurring in front of PBS as historical journalist Pete Lassiter is doing a series of shows on the town.However, Maddy learns a secret that Gina is hiding from her father. When she informs the teen that she must tell her father, Gina reacts by threatening to run off to New York to take care of business. Worried that the child will be all alone at a dark pivotal moment when she needs love and support, Maddy agrees to hide Gina's secret from her dad even though it costs her the trust of her beloved and potentially the relationship.CHANCES ARE overwhelmingly that Barbara Bretton's myriad of fans will appreciate this solid contemporary sequel to SHORE LIGHTS that continues the second chance at love story of two delightful protagonists. Gina's crisis is a fabulous subplot that strains the relationship of the lovebirds even as Maddy's family adds humor by sending the bride's blood pressure to the stratosphere with their demands and intercession on how the nuptials will play out.

It is a story of historical intrigue backed by tangible artifacts told in a fast paced, yet surprisingly soft and mystical light. I couldn't put it down.Some of the western hypnotized reviewers here obviously don't understand the profound knowledge that enriched the great ancient cultures. Its decline led to the horrendous Dark Ages where almost all learning was lost. But few ask why. Scholar and author, Peter Kingsley, ponders this question and shows us a bigger picture. He knows his history and esotericism like few others. In the spirit of the true Greek philosophers Kingsley poetically explains where rationality went wrong and subtly encourages the reader to consider a deeper meaning of life. It is no wonder hard cold rationalists feel their ego threatened by the revelations in this book.If you are myopic in your view of history, and believe myth and folklore are just silly stories, and that anything that came before us must be more primitive, then don't bother to read this book - you won't get it anyway. But if you are beginning to think with your heart as well as your mind, and dare to imagine a history, indeed a future, more beautiful than brain alone allows, then you will love this book. Like a sacred site, \\"Dark Places of Wisdom\\" not only conveys unspoken knowledge, it awakens a higher reality.Kudos to Kingsley!"},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This is a fairly short book, and can be read in one or two sittings. It is very easy to read, and sort of enjoyable. On the down side, this author spends too much time trying to vilify Plato and Aristotle, resorting to a very unlikely idea that they conspired to bury Parmenides' ideas, and/or make it look like Plato was his true heir, rather than Zeno. As other reviewers of this book have pointed out, they would have had no motive to do so. Since this book is so short and easy, what the author could have done is spend a lot more time supporting his ideas rather than just stating them as fact without convincing evidence. Or better yet, he could have chosen to just focus on the mystical importance of Parmenides' writings and just avoid the conspiracy theory and trying to rewrite history altogether. This is where I have the most sympathy for the author: I believe he may indeed understand Parmenides' writing from a mystical point of view, and in some ways this is why his writing style is passionate. For this reason I almost gave this book three stars; but I couldn't do this because this isn't the only book about the underworld initiation or \\"dying before you die\\"; and yet the author almost acts like it is or like he's discovered something nobody else has. If passionate and mystical, the author's style could also be described as lurid. He almost seems to act as if the discoveries are too amazing to be believed, narrating as if he's telling a children's story by continually using rhetorical questions like \\"And you know what they found next?\\". He suggests on one hand that people of european descent who are interested in the east are neglecting their own heritage, and then claims that we are indebted to the east and there is a conspiracy trying to cover that up. Actually, every book I've ever read on Greek Philosophy states that the Greeks took significant portions of their ideas from the east. At one point he mentions a memorial (constructed about 500 years after Parmenides was alive) of Parmenides which gives him a title that fits with his theory, yet when he points out that the face couldn't have been Parmenides' (on a statue of Parmenides) but it was a generic face, he overlooks that. In other words, he uses the evidence when it fits his theory, and excuses it when it doesn't. The people who constructed the memorial could have been mistaken about his title and it's implications since it was centuries after he lived. I think that if he focused on writing a book of mystical importance, rather than getting caught up trying to overthrow the establishment philosophers and rewrite history, he'd create something a lot better. He seems to forget that Plato also, was a mystic, and had received the underworld initiation. Even though universities focus mainly on Plato's secular writings, his mystical and esoteric writings are there. I still feel like I want to read this author's other books, if for no other reason than because they are kinda fun, and to write another critique."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I first read Kingsley's books almost 5 years ago. It was life-changing. Every time I re-read In the Dark Places of Wisdom, in particular, I'm taken back to that electric excitement, that freshness and wonder of tremendous discovery. It's true, what the other reviewers say, this book reads like a mystery novel, a whodunit. Awe and urgency come through on every page.In the Dark Places of Wisdom is not an easy read, but not for the reasons you might expect. I think it's because we, as a culture, are drowning in our own sensationalism. If you turn on the TV for half an hour, you'll see what's totally trivial and inane presented as momentous and earth-shattering. When we do finally encounter a real discovery, it can be extremely hard to accept. We're jaded. But that doesn't mean that great discoveries don't exist anymore. Kingsley's research is meticulous and impeccable. If you care to look, it will become harder and harder to escape his conclusions.And then, when you wrap your mind around what's in this book and see the implications, you'll find that it's anything but a light read. You will probably find it, as I did, both profoundly unnerving and utterly thrilling. It's such a surreal experience to discover that everything you've always taken for granted about your civilization is wrong. And it's nothing short of magical to find out that the truth is more beautiful, more alive, than you ever could have hoped or imagined. It's like seeing life for the first time. It's like walking into another world. Read this book. Your heart will thank you."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This book reads like a mystery story, or rather a story aboutmystery. It is based on solid academic scholarship, but is by no meanswritten in an academic style. Rather, it is a highly personal account of the author's discoveries about a famous Greek philosopher, Parmenides, and the philosopher's surprising secret. A philosopher whom thousands of years of academic scholarship and philosophy regarded as a dry logician, turns out to be the representative of an authentic Mediterranean tradition of mystical practice. Kingsley's writing takes on an almost religious intensity in places; he writes like a man with a vision, trying to awaken those who have suppressed or forgotten their own spiritual connections. DARK PLACES OF WISDOM is something that can transcend the seminars and the classrooms, reaching out to spiritual searchers who are sick of the banalities of our society and are questing for a more direct experience of the divine. According to Kingsley, this is how that quest, and that experience, was done back in the Sicilian colonies of ancient Greece, 2500 years ago. And that tradition that Kingsley discovers, has been hidden in the depths of our Western culture and consciousness ever since. If you want an adventure which is both intellectual AND mystical, try this book. END"},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Through In The Dark Places of Wisdom, Peter Kingsley covers the roots of the Western system of thought as revealed through the lives of Plato, Pythagoras and Parmeneides. Essentially, the Phoenicians brought eastern spiritual traditions with them when they fled the Persians. Through the methods of \`incubation', simply sitting quietly, these Greeks developed the most revelatory discoveries that we accredit to them.In our current rational systems we would instantly discredit anyone bringing \`laws from the gods delivered by dreams' but not so in Greek society. The rational faculties we have celebrated in those we attributed early rationality to are heavily misplaced, shaking the foundations of our own systems.Perhaps the most significant failure of current humanity is the inability to experience incubation in our daily lives due to strict schedules. This quiet meditation of the heart is a core aspect of all mystical schools and a severe afterthought in the blueprint for modern existence. Truthfully, philosophy isn't arguing about thoughts or existence, its is the love of wisdom. Mysticism has been relegated to the fringes of culture and the more it gravitates outward, the more we push it away because we have to fill the void with some new substitution. I won't list those substitutions because you know what they are. The ways we avoid the \`path to the underworld' undertaken by Parmeneides are numerous. Only by facing the depths of the human existence do we become human. By avoiding the dark side we come to fear it, it manifests as latent dissatisfaction, depression and terror.Sadly, many of us will \\"come to the point of our death and find ourselves still wanting the thousand substitutes we aren't able to have\\". Kingsley posits, \\"...because there's no knowledge left any more of how to find access to what's beyond our waking consciousness, we have to take anesthetics and drugs. And because there's no longer any understanding of powers greater than ourselves we're denied any meaning to our suffering. So we suffer as liabilities, die as statistics.\\" If that sounds familiar it is because he describes the way we observe the world around us. The promise of reviving methods of subconscious exploration like incubation has significant advantages.\\"Life for us has become an endless affair of trying to improve ourselves, achieving more and doing more, learning more, always needing to know more things. The process of learning and being taught has simply become a matter of being fed facts and information, receiving what we didn't have before, always being given something different from ourselves. That's what whatever we learn never touches us deeply enough; why we sense this the more we rush around trying to find substitutions for the void we feel inside. Everything pushes us outside ourselves, further away from the simplicity of our humanity. \\"Where does the knowledge for growth lie? Inside ourselves: \\"We already have everything we need. We just have to be shown what we have. This is why the greatest teachers are often utter nobodies. In some circumstances they might introduce you to a new system of knowledge or change your lifestyle - and yet that's not what their teaching is basically about. It's just a trick to keep your mind focused while the real work is being done somewhere else... we think that being practical means keeping busy, getting on with our lives, rushing from one distraction to another finding more and more substitutes for what we dimly sense.\\"As Parmeneides said, \`human beings wander along, knowing nothing'. What Kingsley effectively argues is that Parmeneides was referring to us. What I took from this book is that the reality before us must be valued for what it is, even if it undermines some of the notions we have about the past and our most intimate nature."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This book is about so much more than what it seems to be. I read this because it was in the bibliography of \\"The Apples of Apollo\\" by Ruck, Staples, and Heinrich. Don't think for a minute that the wisdom loved by Parmeneides is something you find just by sitting still in a cave. I would not have understood Kingsley's book at all had I not already read the other. I'm sure Kingsley knows exactly what he is doing."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Imagine taking a journey in time from the Greek origins of western civilization to the present and in doing so, uncovering the forgotten and discarded truths that give birth to that civilization.Peter Kingsley has taken such a journey in an archaeologicaly iconoclastic and original interpertation of recent evidence which links us to a spiritual tradition, a tradition that is at the very heart of our western civilization. What is so lamentable is how alien this tradition, now myth, has become to our modern way of life.What we call myth, according to the author, was actualy closer to fact in our ancient past and to accept what he says is to take a spiritual and intellectual leap of faith into the world of ancient Greece of mystics, gods and godesses, heroes, oracles and dreams.But to us, the antithesis of western reason and logic that this tradition supposedly engendered.I liked how the author lends relevance and immediacy to his views by persuasively arguing that we in the west have lost our way and that by embracing the ancient teachings that we have lost we can begin to heal, which is a major theme of the book. This is not a spiritual guide or any new age pap. It's simply a candle in the dark that shines our way and forces to see the evidence before our very eyes. Evidence which links us to our most human and spiritual of pasts.I found this book convincing purely on the raw Greek and other archaeological evidence presented and with text as guide it is hard not to draw the same conclusions as the author.The author: &quot;People who love the divine go around with holes in their hearts, and inside the hole is the universe. It's people like them that this book is about&quot;.I'm certainly not one of these people, and I'm not ready to take that leap of faith, but what this book has succeeded in doing, like a delphic oracle, is in sowing a seed.I found this book astonishing and I think it will appeal to people who give our ancestors (or all indeginous cultures) credit for much more wisdom than we posess and to people interested in the universal theme of the spiritual quest, especialy to readers of Joseph Campbell."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This is an odd and interesting book that has deepened my appreciation for Greek history. Basically, it explores the mystical orientation of many of Greece's greatest thinkers, including Pythagoras and Parmeneides. Most importantly, it shows that in their mystical orientation they were more than &quot;thinkers&quot;. Kingsley explores how Plato sought to change the direction of Greek thought by focussing more on rational thought, a turn away from the experiential spirituality of the earlier philosophers. He explores that experiental spiritual tradition which was &quot;mainstream&quot; prior to Plato's usurpation of it. Kingsley attributes Platonic philosophy's eclipse of this earlier and more deeply rooted tradition to Athenian military beligerence.In our understanding of the history of Greek thought, it sometimes appears that the early portion of that history involved oral myth and inspired poetry, while the latter portion is devoted to liberating man from the superstitions of the past, through rational thought. Kingsley shows us Greek thinkers who understood the value of myth and of exploring the depths of the psyche, for revelation, for healing, for finding wholeness and connection to a realm beyond death, the realm of &quot;heros&quot; who attain immortality through exploration of truth.We don't have a lot of written material attributed to Parmeneides or written about him from reliable witnesses. Therefore, much of this little book contains Kingsley's inspired interpretation and analysis of this limited amount of material, utilizing the considerably greater amount of information we have on the world in which Parmeneides and his peers lived.Some might not like this, but for me it was useful and meaningful that he brought this material to life for me, convincingly."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I found reading Peter Kingsley's \\"In the Dark Places of Wisdom\\" to be quite frustrating insofar as he writes a great deal without really saying much. The idea behind this book is that there was once great wisdom lost to us as a result of a \\"conspiracy\\" lasting for over two millennia and perpetrated by western philosophers since the time of Plato. The majority of this book is dedicated to Kingsley's attempts to sort the threads of this lost wisdom, as revealed in some recently found artifacts, back to its source in Parmenides' and Pythagorean philosophy before it was tampered with by the \\"conspirators\\" including Plato, Aristotle and many others who subverted and corrupted their message which originated in the east. This is all fine and well and at times interesting, but the whole of Parmenides Philosophy as expounded by Kingsley would fill no more than 4 or 5 pages out of the 255 written (I'm being generous here). The rest of the book is devoted to showing how Kingsley has divined the truth coupled with his rather pedantic approach to exposing all Philosophers since Plato as missing what he, and he alone, sees so clearly. Kingsley promises to show us the way back to the essential truths of Parmenides. However, the only practical implications I can draw from this book would be for me to \\"lie down in a cave for a few days, eschewing food and distractions of the modern world and \`incubate'\\". Thereby, in some mysterious way, I will find myself (if I really, really desire it) in the underworld in the company of the Goddess of Truth who will teach me wisdom and the means of filling the void in my inner being. Ah, it would be great if, as Kingsley implies, it were that simple. He ends this book by saying it is the first chapter of a long story so Kingsley may have something substantial in the future to say about Parmenides, the extant fragments of his writings, his philosophy and ecstatic techniques as a shaman and magician which he didn't accomplish this round."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This book simply floors me. Along with his scholarly tour de force Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic, Kingsley is proving himself to be the Wilamowitz, Rohde or Nietzsche of the start of the new millenium.

As a neo-pagan who is at home with greek religious traditions I am so pleased to find a writer who combines solid scholarship with a mystical appreciation of the material he writes about.

The fact is that what burns Mr. Kingsley is the easiness with which he states things. But that is not a new thing to meet with some authors. I would expect more responsible statements, on a firm basis, and not so lighthearted: ''...people at Athens invented the fiction of a united Greece'' or ''Many greek centers of culture preferred to side with the Persians rather with the Athenians. They considered them more civilized.'' p. 222. Well..., not from a professor of Simon Fraser University ! If you read Isokrates' &quot;Panegyrikos&quot; (Thucydides, et.al., also) you will know more than that. Some Greeks really partied the Persians, but the issue was quite political and definitely not cultural (By the way, have you read Chrestos Lazos' books on ancient Greek technology?). As for the domination of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy, cf. Marsilio Ficcino and the Scholastics' interpretation of them as responsible to that. Anyway, the book is nice to read for it presents some (well, not so) unknown aspects of the Underworld ''drwmena'' in the ancient Greek world.

I don't know how I ever made it through.It's disappointing that Kingsley fails to locate his work within the context of Ganzfeld parapsychology, or even of Sumer, the source culture of the ancients. I was amused to find that despite what he believes to be his breakthrough insights, he is ignored by other scholars.Nice try, Peter, but you owe us much better. Next time, at the very least, give us a useful table of contents, a readable list of references, and an index."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Peter Kingsley's books are frustrating because they strain and labor to argue against modern-era Philosophy, that prior to the Modern era, Philosophy was originally altered-state based... using cave incubation.Actually he only focuses on the most ancient Greek and Italy Philosophers (Pythagoras, Parmenides, Empedocles), similar to R. Gordon Wasson's limiting of Amanita use in Judeo-Christianity to the period prior to the writing of the Eden tree story on page 2 of the Bible.What's frustrating is that Kingsley doesn't equate or explicitly address that Philosophy was entheogen-based (though he writes amply on the wine-mixing krater as the passageway to the underworld), and that Philosophy remained entheogen-based throughout the entire period prior to the Modern era; he vaguely asserts, but with tremendous, labored fanfare, that the altered state was induced by meditative incubation in caves.The mountain rumbled!, and shook!, and parted! -- and out came a mouse."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I have little to add to either the praise or criticism of this book, as previous reviewers have done both in exhaustive depth. I will say that only one reviewer has mentioned what I thought was one of the more interesting parts of the work: the political backdrop against which the contested events occurred. Philosophy and mysticism do not occur in isolation, and the notion that one view defeats another simply because it is judged to be a 'better' argument is misguided at best. Philosophers are not set apart from society and the body politic, but act within and upon it. The account in this book of the activities of Zeno that lead to his eventual torture and execution are a case in point."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I love this book.

It is a very scholarly work that presents us with facts that have been hidden for far too long.You can agree or disagree, but that makes no difference. The evidence seems to stand for itself.

Because if you do, you will be surprised that the Light is not just UP there or floating around in some world of CHI, but the Light...the greatest Light might just be found in the \\"Darkness\\".I would suggest that you pay close attention to your body sensations as you read. When you read the book you will understand why I suggest that."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I have just read this wonderful book for the second time, and I anticipate moving into Peter's next, Reality. When I first read Dark Places some three years ago, I loved it then, too, but I became a bit nonplussed when I found the author's website with its plea for financial assistance. \\"Just another cult,\\" figured, and too bad because he truly is a great writer and thinker and perhaps even would-be reformer.I would love to hear more of his personal story. It does sound like he was kicked around a great deal in academia, just another bankrupt institution imho. But that's reading between the lines in Dark Places.Perhaps a great new network is forming that can protect the would-be initiate in these perilous times, the one who must travel from cult to cult (as it would be \\"understood\\" by the family and institutions he must leave behind). Perhaps mysticism can one day be taught in the public schools.I always wondered why Plato, Aristotle and Athens were considered so great when it all ended so soon in such a bloodbath. I thank Peter Kingsley for showing me a much greater reality behind and beneath that picture.Reason is a wonderful facility, the mind is a fantastic playground and workshop, but something much greater is needed. We are taking ourselves apart, individually and as a society, to put ourselves together again in a much healthier way, and Peter Kingsley is another great writer showing us the necessity.At one of the \\"esoteric\\" schools in which I studied, reason is given as but one of \\"ten qualities of mind.\\" The other nine are: memory, will, desire, emotion, intuition, creativity, curiosity, consciousness, and conscience. It's easy to see how different cultures and different schools have emphasized one or more of these qualities over the others. Academia, of course, has overemphasized reason. This emphasis has been necessary to lead mankind out from under the power of the church and kings, into the Renaissance and our present day political freedoms. Hopefully now we are ready for another giant step, though it will not occur without conflict."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Until I read this book, I thought philosophy was boring. I thought that there was no way for me to really understand the ancient Greeks. It seems like everything that I learned about them in school was dusty and tired. Their mythology was no more than a bunch of immortal clowns constantly creating scandals and dragging mortals intio their own grudges. It's hard to find anything spiritual about tales of adultery and malice.In this book I discovered that there is a lot lost in our narrow modern understanding of this mythology. Apollo is suddenly a dynamic character. He is the father of both science and mysticism. In his hands the two blend together as though they are one. He is also the representation of eternal youth and eternal life. I came away with a spiritual understanding and a much greater respect for the fore fathers of our medical practice and our society.You need this book."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Like other reviewers, I found Kingsley's style irritating and almost condescending, as though he were an explorer of great experience and wisdom trying to convey something of the sense of wonder to people who are not very capable of understanding specifics. However, he did hit upon one thing that is VERY important -- but I see no sign that he himself understood what it meant.Kingsley talks about the iatromantis guiding people lying in dark caves - and seems to think it has something to do with them preparing themselves for their eventual death. But I don't think it was that at all. When I read that I thought, \\"these people are doing what we did at the Monroe Institute - depriving the senses of input to make it easier to concentrate on inner images so that they could learn to experience and use unusual mental states at will.\\" I expect they went through specific exercises in those dark spaces, probably accompanied with some rhythmic background sound, as shamanism uses.Kingsley is perhaps too enmeshed in the academic mindset to realize that these people were having a real experience that we today can share. Of course my guess may be wrong, but it is part of the value of Kingsley's book that it gives rise to just such speculations.I give it a one for style and a 5 for content, so the result is a three."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"I'd give this book 5 stars for content, especially if, like me, you are interested in PreSoratic philosophy and in this era when mysticism and philosophy were joined at the hip - a far healthier situation than the secular schizophrenic \\"Exluded Middle\\".However on writing style, I'd have to go with 2 and a half stars as Kingsley grinds his axe on every page and is often over anxious to turn the account into a thriller. If it wasn't for the fact that he was an Honorary Professor, one might believe this work is nothing more than an attempt to pander to conspiracy theorist audiences. But he is obviously highly passionate about the topic and his credentials secure the knowledgable research that the book is based on."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"This book is wonderful when it comes to explaining the proem (that is, the introductory part) of Parmenides' poem. I always thought there might have been a strong religious component to Parmenides' thought. However, the book is considerably less valuable when it comes to relating the proem to the other two parts of the poem. What does the descent into Tartarus tell us about the Way of Truth? What does it tell us about Parmenides' claims that only one thing exists and that we cannot speak of what is not? Dr. Kingsley doesn't give us much to go on.Even worse is his account of the influence of Parmenides. This is partly taken, uncritically, from other scholars. He borrows the ridiculous view of Mitchell H. Miller, Jr., that Plato insulted Zeno in the dialogue called the Parmenides because he wanted himself rather than Zeno to be known as the rightful heir of Parmenides' ideas. Plato was too much of a philosopher to act in such a way. If he had a problem with Zeno's philosophy, he would have attacked it head on. Anyway, insulting Zeno was hardly sufficient for this purpose because PARMENIDES HAD ANOTHER STUDENT. Everyone knows that Melissus was also an heir to Parmenides' philosophy. If Plato wanted the world to think that he was the true heir to Parmenides, he was going to have to insult both Zeno and Melissus, which he didn't do.Dr. Kingsley is also mistaken about Plato having &quot;killed&quot; the broader concept of what a philosopher is supposed to be, which Parmenides accepted. According to Kingsley, Parmenides believed that a philosopher should be a sort of shaman (or an Iatromantis, to use the technical term), but because Plato killed this notion in his dialogue the Sophist, it is now difficult for us to understand this earlier concept of the philosopher. First, it seems strange that someone who wanted to show himself to be the true heir of a predecessor should be so anxious to kill one of the ideas of that predecessor. Second, the basic point that Plato attacked in the Sophist (beginning at 237a) was a statement made by Parmenides that Kingsley never mentions: &quot;Never shall this be proved, that things that are not are.&quot; This statement comes from Parmenides' Way of Truth (not the proem), and Plato focused exclusively on the Way of Truth when he &quot;killed&quot; Parmenides. He never bothered discussing the proem at all. Nor did he bother to discuss the concept of the philosopher as a shaman.Furthermore, people before Plato had just as effectively &quot;killed&quot; Parmenides. Take the sophist Protagoras, for example, who lived after Parmenides but before Plato. According to one ancient source, Protagoras wrote a book (now lost) containing a refutation of Parmenides. This was long before Plato had &quot;killed&quot; him in the Sophist. But not only did Protagoras refute Parmenides, he also became so famous that Parmenides was left in the dust. Anyone who reads Plato's dialogue the Protagoras should be able to see this. Worst of all, Protagoras was not an Iatromantis, anymore than Plato was; instead, he was a teacher of rhetoric. The way to become a lawgiver in ancient Greece was not only through being an Iatromantis; the best way was to be able to speak persuasively, and that is what Protagoras claimed to be able to teach. The fact is that Protagoras attracted hordes of young people, while we hear nothing similar in connection with Parmenides.Not only did Plato not &quot;kill&quot; Parmenides, if anything he RESCUED Parmenides from oblivion. Nowhere in his early dialogues did Plato pay the slightest bit of attention to Parmenides. Presumably, he ignored Parmenides because everyone else was ignoring him, too. In his middle dialogues, when he was supposedly steeped in Parmenidean thought, he mentioned him only twice (Symposium 178b and 195c). Neither mention contains any reference to Parmenides' metaphysics nor his cosmology; each is a reference to a genealogy of the gods. Even worse, in the Euthydemus, which is a dialogue written during the transition from the early to the middle periods, Plato seems to have thought of Parmenides as nothing but a sophist. (See 286c, particularly the phrase &quot;and others before them.&quot;) It wasn't until the late period that Plato suddenly began taking notice of Parmenides and speaking of him in glowing terms. Clearly, Plato had changed his mind about Parmenides, and it is because of that change of mind that we now know as much about Parmenides as we do."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"After so many positive reviews I was excited to get and read this book. I have to say I'm disappointed. Firstly, it feels like the tone and approach Kingsley uses is geared towards children or teenagers; it's strange. Frankly, I don't like his use of the English language, I find it stilted. I kept thinking--get to the point, man.He's trying to do a couple of things at once, so far as I could see: create a kind of suspense story with the discovery of some statues with inscriptions on it and also to lay out what Parmenides was &lt;really> saying. I wasn't interested in the first aim--and I could barely follow his \\"conclusions.\\" As far as the second, well... it doesn't sound all that different than what one can glean from the Upanishads or the Tao Te Ching or Chuang Tzu. But Kingsley posits it as the \\"missing key\\" in a sense.It is missing a glossary; and with a totally jumbled up \\"references\\" section it's very hard to know where he got his information. I appreciate his effort but I think he took himself a little too seriously."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"But i can't give it more than 3 stars. Why? first, as the reviewer below states, Peter Kingsley throws out an awful lot of assumptions without any backup. No guided footnotes, no back story, just a jumble at the back of the book for people to sift through. Combined with his sensationalist style a-la The Davinci Code (not sure which came first), it's awful and insulting. Perhaps because of this style, he ends up wasting our time as he thinks things through for himself in parts without just giving us the information to think through ourselves - as if we're incapable of doing so...i really wonder how he can be a university professor since he talks to us like we're in high school. He does this while also telling us how great it is that the ancient Greeks did no such thing - they wrote simply but with deep meaning, and let the reader figure it out (i guess he's not as clever as they were? or does he think we aren't?) Oh, right -- throughout the book he explains that scholars are stupid and only he and a few others really understand how to explain what's going on! Yes, that's why!But even with all that, i was getting into this book in spite of myself, as he brought out a lot of interesting facts about the Phocaeans and Parmeneides. But when he literally pulled this one out of his a**--he said that some scholars actually believe the harmony of the spheres heard by Pythagoras was the sound of a snake hiss--i had to just laugh. Now, it's true that a large portion of people don't actually hear overtones, but there are many of us who do - and you don't mistake the sound for a hissing snake. Furthermore, to say such a thing totally dismisses all of Pythagoras's teachings about harmony and the overtone series, which wouldn't exist if all that were the case. But saying they sounded like \\"pipes\\" as Parmeneides and Pythagoras in fact did would be a better bet. I guess Peter likes to take what those dumb scholars said if they fit his own agenda. Indeed, Peter Kingsley apparently dismisses the actual word for pipes USED by the ancients, to bring hissing snakes into his theories. To twist something so simple around like that just made me lose respect for him. Sorry Peter. I wanted to like you because it's obvious you're a great student of this stuff, but you owe us a little more than that.In the end, what we learn that is so important is actually nothing new - that the great philosophers, mathematicians, etc. in ancient Greece were mystics, and that Plato shut the door on that. Well, that has been an acknowleged fact for a long long time. The sad thing is, that this book has some interesting information about the mysticism practiced. But it's couched in paragraphs and paragraphs of an angry tone about how there's a conspiracy (yes he uses that word) to keep people from knowing it. Too bad - but i guess it's because, if you take all the unnecessary stuff out, it would've been a much thinner book."},{"Title":"In the Dark Places of Wisdom","review":"Kingsley's main point, if he has one, seems to be that logical reasoning is an inadequate instrument for grasping the metaphysical ambiguities of the world.His book applies that thesis with admirable consistency: it meanders all over the place, presents rumor and legend as fact, vastly over-states the importance of Parmenides for Platonic and later philosophy, and suggests that a conspiracy of scholars has kept all this information secret for millennia.Not that his ideas are completely without merit: Logic and language do have their limitations in describing reality. Parmenides was a significant pre-Socratic philosopher, even if not to the extent that Kingsley claims. And despite their avowed devotion to free inquiry, scholars are often hostile or indifferent to unconventional ideas.However, it seems to me that Kingsley has taken about two pages' worth of content and padded it out into a book. The writing is entertaining but the content is light and fluffy (which might be Kingsley's intention, if he meant to write a light popular book).\\"In the Dark Places of Wisdom\\" is like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" applied to pre-Socratic philosophers.

There aren't any more General Aviation accidents here than other parts of the country and there's nothing particularly stunning about this one so there's little reason to remember it. A man and the family dog in a single engine Grumman Traveler flying into the Cape to link up with his wife and son at their vacation home. Because I remember this accident, live nearby in Brewster, and it speaks to something of keen interest to me, my perception of the book may be quite colored and thus this &quot;five-star&quot; review. Nevertheless Phaedra Hise has written a compelling story that will be of interest to a much broader audience than GA pilots and people who live on the Cape.The challenges associated with flying to and from the Cape are all to do with weather, specifically fog and haze. That means &quot;instrument flight rules&quot; and talking about flying as different from &quot;visual flight rules&quot; as night is from day. Besides the personal tragedy to the Sinzheimer family, the thrust of Hise's book is that once a pilot has lost visual reference to the horizon things very quickly begin to unwind. It takes a sharp pilot to sort out the conflict between what his senses say - &quot;i'm turning&quot; - and what the instruments read - wings are level. PILOT ERROR is too innocuous a description for the multitude of things (mostly bad) that are taking place in such situations. Sometimes the various instruments seem to be contradicting each other and you must fight the panic that comes when your mind screams that it needs a visual reference in order to understand.Hise could have used a famous case that everyone would have remembered in order to get across her message that instrument flight rules are a critical skill for any GA pilot. The struggle with understanding what his instruments were telling him was the same for John F Kennedy Jr when he was flying through haze on the way to Martha's Vineyard in 1999. Using his flight would have meant focusing on him rather than where the real story is - five small instrument dials, that GA pilots must be absolutely familiar with - lest we become an accident statistic or the subject of a powerfully descriptive and very well written book."},{"Title":"Pilot Error: Anatomy of a Plane Crash","review":"In Pilot Error, Phaedra Hise masterfully recreates on the page the lone-pilot crash of Ron Sinzheimer, en route to Cape Cod from Albany on a cloud-bound Friday night. A pilot herself and a deft writer, Hise spins a taught story of the bad weather, bad luck, hubris and random events that ensnared the star lawyer in his tragic flight. At the same time she informs readers on the roles of the many professionals who make America's air traffic as remarkably safe as it is. Hise has created a moving and enlightening vignette that avoids melodrama even in the gut-wrenching scenes where Sinzheimer's wife, Marsha, slowly comes to grips with the fact that her husband is not coming home. The book ultimately makes his fate more than just another forgotten human tragedy. Hise should be commended. At the same time, Pilot Error is a read you put down only when you need to take a deep breath and whisper to yourself, \\"There but for the grace of God . . . .\\" After reading this book, those of us who ride behind the cockpit will never take our crew or air traffic controllers for granted again."},{"Title":"Pilot Error: Anatomy of a Plane Crash","review":"The author did a superb job in researching and documenting all the events leading up to this crash. However, as an instrument rated pilot familiar with the Provincetown approaches and similar small planes, it is apparent to me that Phaedra missed the root cause of this accident. Without revealing what Phaedra believes happened, I believe that she has overlooked the simplest explanation of all, which is that Sinzheimer never used his VOR-ILS instruments to fly the ILS-7 Provincetown approach, but instead used his much newer GPS (with moving map display) to fly an illegal \\"pilot improvised approach\\". I say this because the simplest explanation for why the primary VOR was not found tuned to the ILS-7 approach frequency is that he had never set it to that frequency in the first place. The GPS would not provide glideslope (vertical) guidance, so his logical work-around was to drop down to 100 feet and skim along the water inbound to the airport. Provincetown was a tempting spot to try this because it sits at an elevation of 8 feet above sea level and there aren't any tall obstructions anywhere near by. The problem with this technique (besides being illegal) is that flying at 100' above the water in poor visibility is very tricky. Under these weather conditions, there wouldn't be any visual references outside the cockpit with which to control the plane visually until he was less than a mile from the airport. Alternatively, flying on instruments at 100 feet above the water is theoretically possible, but I would not want to bet my life on my ability to do it. It appears to me that this is exactly what Sinzheimer did. Read the book and see what you think."},{"Title":"Pilot Error: Anatomy of a Plane Crash","review":"Pretty good book. The author really did a lot of research with the people who were personally involved with the accident. She also did a good job by not writing the book as a lengthend NTSB report but rather the whole process the FAA, Coast Guard, and NTSB have in place to react to a downed airplane. She gave a lot of background information also and sometimes even too much. I really didn't get why she would write about the Mayflower or the history of the Coast Guard but it was her book to write, not mine."},{"Title":"Pilot Error: Anatomy of a Plane Crash","review":"I read this book and concluded that I am angry at myself for having read it. Pilots like to read about accidents hoping to study a case and avoid the same mistakes. After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: \\"you are now all dumber after hearing this story\\". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal."},{"Title":"The Plug-in Drug: Television, Children, and the Family; Revised Edition","review":"This book is about the effects of television on children and families.The use of television starts innocently enough.Too often TV is used as a child minder so that parents can get some peace and quiet: to prepare meals, so that Mom and Dad can sleep in at week-ends, etc.But dangers lurk in this innocent scenario.Before long, the kids are hooked on watching, and parents are hooked on a device for having the kids out of the way.Marie Winn aptly calls TV a drug.Many parents are aware of the dilemma, but often they are and the kids too hooked to break the habit.Winn explores the process of this addiction and the harm done to vibrant human living.For example, excessive TV viewing hampers the personal and social development of the child, so some mothers get a job to escape from their maladjusted kids!Winn offers helpful advice to families trying to cope with TV.She gives examples of the benefits families have experienced when they went without TV, such as increased family interaction, more creative and satisfying activities,doing various things that had been put of, and so on.Marie Winn gives many examples from family life which add great interest to this thoughtful and helpful book."},{"Title":"The Plug-in Drug: Television, Children, and the Family; Revised Edition","review":"I was most struck with the information about what happens to us physically when we watch television.

Since I've read this book I haven't allowed my son to watch any TV at all. I must admit that it's nearly impossible. TV is so pervasive in our everyday lives that it's hard to avoid when you're out in public or at someone else's house. It's hard to do it even at my own home (my spouse won't read the book and won't listen to the arguments).

For in spite of the fact that parents seek to escape their children because they have brought them up to be difficult to live with.\\" Page 201-202 With this paragraph, Ms. Winn makes a fascinating conclusion - women are leaving the workplace because their children are disagreeable because they watch too much TV?

The author's greatest strength is not in forming unique opinions about the subject but rather in bringing together a vast number of sources to show an America completely different than what we've been lead to believe.The book just isn't about lost cities but also generally weird stuff throughout Central and North America. There is evidence of Asian contact with Central American cultures, pterodactyls in Arizona, Vikings in Oklahoma, Irish monks running all over the place, and those are the more believable stories. Atlantis or a gold city always seems to be around the corner, Jesus may have visited the New World, a master race is controlling the world from underground, the Egyptians had a colony in the Grand Canyon, and of course the government is covering all this up.The book does have its problems. The editing is horrible. The narrative that strings the author's travels together is wooden and painful to read. Each chapter stands by itself, but this means that some background material is repeated, often word for word. Overall these are minor issues.The book doesn't provide any answers but it does make a choice perfectly clear. You can either accept the traditional view that people wandered across a land bridge in Siberia to colonize the Americas and stayed relatively isolated and unadvanced until Europeans showed up in 1492 and wiped them out. Or you can read this book and see if there is evidence out there that suggests otherwise."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"This was the first Childress book that I had ever read.

Childress's Lost City series has been one of the most interesting collection of books I have read in a long time, however, I really don't know how accurate many of his theories are. Even many minor statements he makes, such as &quot;Native Americans can not grow facial hair&quot; are fallacies, I know an abundance of Native Americans, and they're facial hair rivals that of Che and Fidel. So when a guy gets facts as simple as these garbled, how much credibility can he possibly have when he starts rambling on about &quot;Smithsoniangate&quot;, and &quot;living dinosaurs&quot;.I find these possibilites as intriuguing as the next guy, but exactly where is his proof. He cites some archival information from an Arizona newspaper as proof that in the Grand Canyon in the early 1900's researchers found a cave full of Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Egyptian artifacts, and the Smithsonian museum came in and barricaded the area to this day(sort of like Raiders of the Lost Ark). And he uses oral history as proof that there are living Pteradactyls in the forests of Arizona. Perhaps Childress is correct in these assertions, and the US gov't is suppressing evidence of his relatively outlandish claims, then again, perhaps he's just trying to exploit the gullibility of the American public. But judging from his appearances on various talk shows, my guess is that he honestly believes that the gov't is suppressing information on the esoteric subjects he discusses in his books, of course this doesn't neccessarily mean that he's correct in these claims. I suppose that Childress's writings are extremely interesting, whether they are complete fabrications or are truisms. Reading this book certainly won't make you a better person, but it will force you to question what the author is claiming(that the US gov't is involved in clandestine activities of a paranormal nature, and that there are living prehistoric creatures), and will almost definitely force you to ponder what the US gov't plans to accomplish by suppressing ancient history(from my perspective they recieve no incentive by suppressing info that would link the Egyptians with North America). If you have a relatively large amount of time on your hands, I would definitely recommend this book, it makes you question the &quot;accepted&quot; history of the North American continent, but it also frustrates the reader with the lack of viable evidence to support his outrageous suggestions."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Much of this book is pleasant escape reading, and some of the things discussed are intriguing, such as tunnel systems associated with some ruins. The book was spoiled for me, however, when I came to chapters dealing with things I knew of firsthand. One major Northwest petroglyph site is placed in the wrong state. There are just enough wrongo facts to make me wonder how many others masquerade as reality in the text. I will reread the book in the future and enjoy the mysteries of past cultures south of the border, while keeping a salt block handy for the rest of it. His books certainly hold true to the basic instructions for finding lost cities - ask the locals. Few lost cities are truly lost to those who live in the area. They're just forgotten. Enjoy this as a tale told by a traveler, and a collection of some of the more interesting legends of American mystery archaeology. I don't really think there are Egyptian treasures in the Grand Canyon, but I would be delighted if they were real. The same holds true for the treasure-laden tunnels of Death Valley..."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the &quot;Lost Cities&quot; series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself &quot;a rogue archeologist&quot;: someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"This book is very interesting and thought provoking. I enjoyed reading it.Rather than a book that explains what places you can visit, how to get there and what to see when you go- this is more of a journal of the authors travels. In here he tells you what he sees, what he thinks and the things he learns.The author covers a wide range of thoughts from pteradactyles still living to Asians visiting Mexico to Romans in Arizona.I rated this a four instead of a five for two reasons. At times the writing seems stiff and it makes it hard to wade through some sections of this book. Also, the proofreading leads a lot to be desired. Words are left out, typos and spelling errors are plenty. Enough to be a distraction at times.Otherwise, it's an interesting book and well worth reading.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Having not only read the book but also having checked out a number of acknowledged sites within the continental United States, I most happily recommend this bokk to anyone interested in the field of archaeology. It is refreshing to note that the author is not taken in by every story that he hears but neither does he pass them off without some form of &quot;seasoned&quot; comment. Even though it is filled with personal comments and banter, it must be remembered that this is a &quot;traveling narrative&quot; and a good one at that. As I said previously, I have personally visited a number of the sites in this book and have found the author's discriptions to be exact and his references to be valid. If you are ever in Cuba, N.M. stop by and see Bill Fortini, area archaeologist for the Gallina area of the Santa Fe National Forest and ask him to show you the &quot;towers&quot; mentioned on pages 366-369 of the book. They really are there!"},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I was sorely disappointed. This book looks like it was printed in a home officer before the days of capable desktop publishing. I just don't understand how such an interesting topic could be reduced to such a terrible book, but it is. Main problems with the book: It reads like a random, unedited and self-indulgent roam of the author. It is replete with grammatical errors, misspelled words and simply stupid sentences. I just don't care whether the author enjoyed a particular meal (described in excruciatingly boring detail) so much as I care about the title topic, and the book seems replete with a self-centeredness that only Childress' mother will appreciate. &quot;I wore a white cotton shirt from Patagonia made with organic cotton grown in the upper Hullaga Valley of SOuth AMerica. It was getting dirty by now, so I stopped in a convenience store to buy some washing power. I was surprised to find that they carried &quot;Tide&quot; in Guatemala, but I was relieved. I loved that shirt, you see.&quot; Give me a break. Who cares? I want Lost Cities, not a juvenile's diary of his camping trip. Look for other books on this very interesting subject."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Childress opened my eyes to a new world of suppressed/lost discoveries in archeology. Given some of the examples in the book, current dogma deserves as much scrutiny as the &quot;underdog&quot; theories of ancient civilizations. However, Childress gets personal in his travel dialogue and some of the ancient civilization subjects are just briefly mentioned. But overall, it was very interesting."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior &quot;giant&quot; races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I thought I was a student of the esoteric but David Hatcher Childress makes me realize I am still only an alcolyte. History is a mystery and you can believe it because I told you so, just like your highschool history professor. This book will take you on the grand tour of North America and reveal some of the mystery that historians attempt to hide from us in their ivory towers. If you want to expand your mind without taking a lot of mind altering drugs try reading Mr. Chilress' Lost City books. He must have spent a lot of time in the underground book stores prior to his travels. That might be why he decided to hit the road in the first place, to find out for himself. Could America once have been a land of giants, or do pterydactyls still carry off unsuspecting travelers, or are there hidden books with knowledge from the ancients? Maybe, and maybe after reading this book, you will want to take a road trip and find out for yourself.Speak, Hear, and Believe"},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"There are two ways to read Childress. If you want to live in a button-down, straight laced world of academic archeologists, then every time Childress asks a question, just answer (to yourself) No! Then go about with your boring life.But if you want to live a little wild, to peel back the layers & pierce the veil, then answer (again, to yourself) Yes! to every one of his questions. Should you do that, you will have a gay old time figuring out how the world all fits together!Honestly, DHC's speculations are full of BS, but it sure is fun suspending your disbelief & reading these books. Someone mentioned that DHC really seems like a great guy, and you get that sense reading this book. Sounds like he would be a really cool guy to travel & chat with. His travel writing is straighforward, but exciting.Unfortunately, the book is full of typos & poorly done photographs. After reading 5+ of the Lost Cities series, I don't even notice anymore, but it will bug some beginners."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I enjoy Childress' books mainly because he comes across as very honest, although he engages in too much speculation to be taken at face value. Overall I find his books a very engaging read, and the speculative aspect, though often unscientific, is very entertaining. Moreover, the amazing amount of study and travel he has done brings a certain amount of credibility to his work."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Reading through I noticed many editing errors, but they do not take away from the integrity or readableness of this book. A wonderful piece of literature and should be read by children in school. Would be a lot better than the works they are reading now. Might actually get them to think instead of just accepting what is already printed as truth."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"This was a very thought provoking book. The author himself has, been too many of the places described in the book, which adds a sincere element of realism to the story. This book is a \\"must read\\" if you are interested in ancient ruins and pyramids, but it is one book you will need to exercise a little personal judgment. The author is lacking in credibility and doesn't spend a great deal of time on details. This book could have easily been cut up into four separate books and the author could have spent a little more time researching the various regions discussed.I also found it very frustrating that the author didn't appear to make a better effort to explore some of the more mysterious areas talked about in the book. Portions of the Grand Canyon are supposedly restricted and contain mysterious magnetic fields that cause compasses to be offset. I am surprised that there hasn't been more attempts to access this area and that the government has not allowed research in this area. When researching the underwater ruins in the Great Lake, the author couldn't hold his breath very long so he had to surface. Given the importance of this research, another dive might have been nice to read about.I was convinced after reading this book that there have been many attempts over the years to discredit and hide evidence that is contradictory to the theory of Creation and Evolution. The author noted some 900 tablets that were supposedly discovered in a Mexican temple, but cannot be found.The pyramids in the U.S. are interesting as well, but I have since learned that the majority of the pyramids in the U.S. were made by ancient Indian cultures. The credit for these pyramids has been explored (although the author fails to mention this,) but it appears to be prejudice that has not allowed the Indians to receive the credit for their structures. It appears that the ancient Indians were much more advanced than the Indians that have existed in the last 300 years, which is also shown in their art prior to the discovery of maze. Like our own culture, the Indians suffered from over abundance, which led to the breakdown of their interdependent family units and their art. The evidence for this can be seen in the tooth decay, which occurred almost simultaneously with the loss of detailed artifacts buried in the pyramids.I also have to mention that the literary quality of this book is weak. The author could have spent a little more time editing. There were plenty of missing words and typos, which didn't help the credibility of the book. Otherwise, this book is well worth reading and is a good break from the more serious books out there. There is plenty of drama and lots of loose theories. If Indiana Jones were to write a book, it would probably read a lot like this book...Enjoy."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Regrettably I did not review this book thoroughly before buying it. If you believe flying dinosuars still exist in Texas, Jews settled thousands of years ago in Florida and Van Daniken is a scientist then this book ought to be right down your alley. The book is written with a rambling style similar to the apparently mindless wandering of the author. He speculates about things that are far beyond the borders of reason into worlds as mystical as the religions of those he portrays.Spinkled among this piffle is a series of semi-sound observations...just enough to lead you to think the author has some expertise on the subject. Far from it. Each sites origin is distorted beyond any recognition by the most casual but serious archeologist. Hoax articles in papers are given equal consideration to any evidence, no matter that much of that evidence is sparse. The most perplexing mysteries are left with some speculative conjecture and absolutely no support for it. A tale told by an idiot and full of sound and fury but signifying nothing.It is all bunkum and a waste of my money."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"The Lost Cities series by David Hatcher Childress has proven for me to be probably the most entertaining, thoroughly informative, and thought provoking series of books I have ever read and have also served as an invaluable road map for my own travels around the world in search of ancient mysteries. I have traveled, so far, to several locations in Egypt, Malta, Europe, Asia, Central and South America and each time I have used his books to plan my route and have taken whichever one I needed for the journey as a guide. I bought the whole series long ago and they are generally beat to hell if not falling apart at this point and I wouldn't have them any other way. Reading this series made me make up my mind that I could never be satisfied being a spectator of the debate, but the only way to truly know these mysteries was to be a participant and see them for myself. At the very least this series should inspire you to get out there, live your life as a traveler and not a tourist and go see these places for yourself. Save the money, do it cheap, whatever you have to do, but don't let the opportunity to actually go there pass you by in this life.Equal parts detective story, travel guide, diary, history book, and compendium of esoteric knowledge; what makes these books so unique, among other things, is that Childress takes the reader with him through every step of the journey -cold beers, missed trains, broken legs, chance encounters, stolen wallets, one night stands in far away places, wishing you could stay but knowing you can't. All the while on the trail of an ever growing mystery with every answer leaving only more questions spurring you on to the next stop wondering what will happen next. One thing I always respected about Childress in these books, which some may not get the point, is that while at times he does present off-beat esoteric ideas about lost civilizations, it is done so not to promote any particular idea, but rather to give a greater context of the history of the literature of the last few hundred years concerning lost civilizations in the hope that something worthwhile might be gleaned from even the most outlandish or dated of source. To him it is a journey and to his credit does little to leave any stone unturned. But also unique to Childress compared with other writers of the genre is that other than the obvious general idea that there is much more to the story of history than we know, he rarely takes a definitive stance on any pet theory, but rather presents the information with more of a sense of wonder and openness and is really not trying to sell the reader on anything either way other than the necessity to keep an open mind. All just interesting to know and he leaves the reader to think of it what they will which is refreshing.All and all very interesting and entertaining and I highly recommend getting the whole series. The Lost Cities series are true classics of the genre and should be a front and center addition to any alternative researchers library and as a whole are an unparalleled source of of information about many megalithic sites and discoveries you will be hard pressed to find anywhere else. Hopefully they will inspire you as they did me."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.I thought he did a great job of including the known facts along with the legends and hearsay. It is refreshing to hear the &quot;other side of the debate&quot; concerning the continent's archeology by some one who's enthusiam for the subject prevades the book and succeeded in infecting me with a desire to see these sites for myself.It was a bit long winded in trivia at times but that was easy to skim through.Beware those afflicted by the prevailing myopic dogma, this book will only irritate you and raise your ire."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"wish that he would show more in the field and less in the classroom,,and stay with the book, which is top level in my book...james.........."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"This book is amazing!

For one that Childress missed -- and for an important link to ancient navigational cultures -- see Atlantis in America."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I was looking forward to an entertaining account of eccentric archaeological theories, but was unprepared for this disorganized 586-page ramble through North America, from Costa Rica to Canada. The author visits numerous prehistoric sites that (to him, anyway) challenge the current academic orthodoxy. The book is more ego trip than road trip, however, as the author writes in pointless mind-numbing detail of how he travels, where he stays, what he eats, and long verbatim conversations he has with chance acquaintances over beers. In the hands of a better writer this might be interesting, but although Childress is an intrepid traveler, he is only a poor-to-middling writer. The book screams for a stern editor to trim the self-indulgent detail down to something readable, and to improve some of his awkward writing. I must confess that I couldn't read the whole thing: the author bored me unmercifully in his slow progress through Guatemala, so I thumbed forward to the chapters on the US.Childress styles himself a \\"maverick archaeologist\\" (p.9), but it is not clear from this book that he has any right, by either education or work experience, to the title archaeologist. He has clearly read much on alternative prehistories which claim extensive pre-Columbian contacts between North America and outside cultures, both real (Egyptian, Roman, Chinese) and imagined (Atlantis and Lemuria). He has also read some of the orthodox counter-arguments (p.439), such as Stephen Williams' excellentFantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory, but he dismisses them as the work of fuddy-duddy academics. To Childress, academic archaeology is essentially a conspiracy to suppress new ideas. Had he spent any time among academics, however, Childress might have learned that the only way for an academic to make a name for himself is exactly to have new ideas and challenge the status quo.Along the way, Childress indiscriminately embraces every tall tale (pterodactyls in present-day Texas and Arizona, Mothman in West Virginia), odd phenomenon (Bermuda Triangle and tourist \\"mystery spots\\") and newspaper hoax (19th century reporters were prone to make up fantastic stories on slow news days; Mark Twain first made his name writing such tongue-in-cheek lies). The book might have been useful as a starting-point for Fortean tourism, but it does not even include an index, so I can only give it two stars."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I received this book as a birthday present last month from a friend who has read a number of Childress's books. As we share an interest in anthropology and have visited some of the sites in New Mexico mentioned in this book, she thought I would enjoy it. And I did! This book is part travelogue, part archaeology text, and part collection of legends, folktales, and any odd theories he comes across. The mix makes for interesting reading. Childress is intelligent and well-informed but quirky as well. His observations on people he meets and life in the places he visits are at times insightful, funny, and strange.The only warning I'd give is that the books published by Adventures Unlimited tend to be poorly edited so don't be surprised to find some spelling and grammar errors present. Still, these errors didn't detract from my enjoyment of \\"Lost Cities of North and Central America.\\"This isn't a serious academic text, but it's quite informative, an excellent read, and lots of fun!"},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Of course, the reason others won't tell you those stories may be because the stories are patently false. I was looking for a book that would be a good read after \\"Collapse\\" -- something that would tell me about fallen civilizations. This isn't that book -- at least not from a rigorous, scientific approach. The author, for example, asserts that pterodactyls live in today's Arizona.The author believes that traditional academics are dismissing the truth because it doesn't fit in with their preconceived notions. The only reason I didn't rate this book lower is that it is clearly a great source for others who feel the same way. The rest of us, however, need to look elsewhere for scientifically grounded speculation into North American prehistory."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"Childress opened my eyes to a new world of suppressed/lost discoveries in archeology.

Just junk."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I didn't know what to expect from adventurer Childress. Some of his books range from merely odd to the bizarre. Lost Cities, however, was a compendium of lost worlds in North America. He attempts to novelize his book a bit through relating is travels, generally I skimmed these parts. He's not really out there doing any real research, in fact he's mostly recounting or quoting what others have written elsewhere and puts it together for one book. Many of his books are like this, so if you want books that distill whole topics into one volume, Childress is your man. And there's a lot of interesting material here from lost cities in the Grand Canyon to mysterious \\"dinosaur\\" birds.Perhaps the weakness of the book is that he doesn't examine these finds very deeply, but I don't think he intends to verify or disapprove, but to collect and report. And sometimes he will show some lack of research. For example, once in awhile I'd catch some ridcoulous comment, like p. 355 where he implies the Church plunged Europe into the Dark Ages. Maybe it wasn't meant that way, in any case, many historians are now discarding the idea of \\"Dark Ages.\\" After all, the renaissance didn't pop out of no where. SeeThe Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success.Also, his theology is a bit weak, claiming Jesus surviving the crucifixion is a \\"credible\\" (p. 247) possibility. Reading a bit too many conspiracy books I see? Let's see, he was tortured and nailed to a cross and stabbed, and it's \\"credible\\" that he survived? Childress claims a dead person wouldn't bleed if stabbed. Actually, John 19:34's \\"sudden flow of blood and water\\" is a clear evidence that Jesus was dead. Modern medicine knows this as the pericardial and pleural effusions surrounding the heart and lungs. This fluid collects as the result of hypovolemic shock and was released when the spear pierced the heart and/or lungs. Who in the ancient world would survive a stab in the heart and lungs? SeeThe Case for Christ: A Journalist's Personal Investigation of the Evidence for Jesusfor more.But I didn't read this for theology. I'm still hoping for the day that North American archaeology is taken more seriously. If you want to help, subscribe toAmerican Archaeology(which includes an Archaeology Conservancy membership).In any case, I've been enjoying the Lost Cities series. While many of these sites would be interesting to visit, these books allow armchair exploring. They allow scholars to study forbidden topics. If nothing else, through this series, Childress has created an encyclopedia set of lost cites, vanished peoples and forgotton history."},{"Title":"Lost Cities of North & Central America (Lost Cities Series)","review":"I could not put the book down, until I had consumed over half the material.

Maybe the line between literature and music is blurring (thanks to Dylan, Bob that is). Where is the excitement of adventure that leaps off the pages of these books stirring an energy to do something now, to seek, to find, to discover!!I would have every 14-20 year-old in America read Dharma Bums (and Electric Kool Aid Acid Test)... it's up to YOU to put some adventure in YOUR LIFE...

Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it.

A man who spent many years traversing the country back and forth, living virtually hand to mouth most of the time...sleeping under the stars, practicing yoga in the woods on a winter's night...there isn't much in his works to not set afire the heart of a drifter.Though this novel has a lesser 'landscape' than On The Road, Dharma Bums is every bit as much of a journey for the author. At a time when one of his close friends had influenced his interest in Buddhism, Kerouac criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to California. While home, he wanders to the woods time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, and stays on through the cold months.Eventually, the thought of his friends and free-wheeling existence in California draw him back, where he finds some changes to the people he left there, but ever the chameleon, Ray Smith (Kerouac) assimilates himself back into the hive of Beats he holds dear.Kerouac's writings especially appeal to the 'adventurer boy' I left behind when adulthood called. Though some might call Kerouac's existence rootless and irresponsible...there is something magnetic (to me) about the way he lived, at least how it is detailed in his body of autobiographical literature. And though I know his own personal demons are only partially displayed in his books....I still want to be Jack Kerouac when I grow up.Dharma Bums is highly recommended as either an introduction or a continuation of reading this exceptional author."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I had been told for months on end by a Lit professor that I should pick up \\"On the Road\\".

I began to read...and read...and read. What I found was pure Beat genius, a zest for life, and an inward desire in myself to say \\"Screw it,\\" and hike the Smokies. Kerouac, with his brilliantly crafted observations, dialogue, and imagery, brings us into a universe of windy freedom and presents the world as an answer to the problems that it itself causes.If there are any problems with this novel, I'm certain that some people will get bored with some of the beautifully written, yet tedious, description and imagery.

This book tells his story about a chance meeting with a Zen buddhist called Japhy Ryder who Kerouac respected deeply, he talks of his travels on freight trains along the coast and trips hiking up mountains, in essence he thought too much and the more he thought the more constrained he felt.His best line in the book was &quot;I spent a whole year being celibate in the belief that lust was the direct cause of birth which was the direct source of suffering and pain&quot;Its a good book, hard to understand in parts if your not American but it was interesting and witty."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I don't usually appreciate rambling, hundred-word sentences, but somehow that works in Dharma Bums. The free-wheeling sentence structure is dense with description of the land Ray Smith traverses, parties, wine-drinking, poetry-reciting sessions, and how all that ties in with his particular brand of Buddhism. I was never sure where they were going to go next. The payoff for me was near the end, where he heads up to Washington state, ultimately arriving at his fire lookout on remote Desolation Peak in the North Cascades. That's not far from my house, and though much has changed since the '50s, a lot of his description of the trip from Seattle up to the mountain still rings true today. So that's my favorite part of the book, but the whole thing was enjoyable for me. Just don't look for a plot to drive this thing."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"A few years ago I read On the Road and was surprised to find that I largely hated it. Kerouac ably described the travelling spirit, but there seemed little else to recommend: Depth was low while self-indulgence reigned high, the best friend that Jack idolized seemed to me a complete tool, and the writing style itself was dullingly plain and hideously unexpurgated. Even before I learned about the legendary \\"scroll\\" that Jack created so that he wouldn't be slowed down by anything so brief as changing a sheet of paper, it had become apparent to me that the novel was composed with an approach to words that eschewed any premeditation or craft. I found I couldn't agree more with Truman Capote's famous dismissal of \\"That's not writing, that's typing.\\"But I was determined to give Kerouac another chance, and I'm pleased to say that The Dharma Bums is a significant improvement; impressively, Jack actually appears to have made an effort at writing this time out! His fondness for run-on sentences and a disregard for punctuation can still annoy, and his portmanteau words or jury-rigged phrases may not always succeed, but the very fact that he's even attempting them here makes the reading experience a far more tolerable one.Just as importantly, the characters' interest in Zen Buddhism, and their persistent attempts to find meaning in life (even in their stated refusal of definitions and meanings) gives the thrust of the novel a more weighted tone than the empty self-indulgence seen in On the Road; true, there's an enduring sense of pretentiousness as we watch these two middle-class white dudes debate the nature of their philosophies, but even that's somewhat redeemed by a moment when the main character realizes that himself. It's a rare moment of perspective, but it does occur.That said, the novel still dragged on and on and on, and could have been far more enjoyable as a novella half its length. While I'm glad to see that Kerouac was able to grow as a writer after On the Road, I don't think I'll ever have a need to again sample his writings after this."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I first read this tale in the 60s when I was a young teenager. Then it was daring and exciting, and its eastern philosophy was fascinating and new. It's a bit old hat now, but you get that when 50-something years go by. It's still pretty fresh in its writing, and the glimpses into the author's developing alcoholism (which finally killed him) are poignant."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This book was great!!! Being that I am from Washington state, this book was a real easy read, not only that, the descriptions of the pacific northwest were well written. After I finished this book, I proceeded to take a trip up to Mt. Rainier and spent three days hiking, camping and just enjoying all that this nature and the world has to offer. Do yourself a favor, if you feel bogged down by the stresses of modern fast paced life...pick up this book and just get away for a while."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I had to read this book for a political theory class in college, and it is really a great book for mostly anyone. If you're looking for a serious plot or storyline, you wont find it in this book. What you will find, is a well written narrative of a period of American history that is forgotten to many. Its a book that will leave a peacefull feeling with you, and will also make you think about whats really important in life. Kerouac makes you want to pack up and see the country. I read On the Road after this, and actually liked The Dharma Bums better. If you like travel, nature, poetry, or American history, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The joy and sadness of life is just that. After reading the Dharma Bums I decided I would go hiking and meditate alone for the millineum. Anyone who has ever pondered life, religion, lonliness or love would understand Jack's struggles. He lays out his feelings on all these subjects with the brutal honesty that only our hero can. The sadness is that he tried to replace his zealous nature with Zen, but his wanderings had just begun. Great therapy for the Budding Buddhist or the Born-again Beat."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"In \\"The Dharma Bums\\", Kerouac has written another great book about the search for truth and meaning throughout the American countryside. The story is narrated by Ray Smith and is effectively Kerouac telling his own story. Smith and his friend Japhy are wanderers (or bums) in search of the True Meaning or Dharma. The trip covers one year of travels in the life of Smith. His frantic narrative style seems to be fueled by his frequent poorboys of cheap red wine as well as his sheer excitement to be in pursuit of the truth. The story starts in Berkeley, California and visits the Californian desert, Mexico, North Carolina, Seattle and finally ends at Desolation peak in the North Cascades of Washington state. All of these places are reached by hopping on trains, hitchhiking or shelling out a few cents for a bus ride. Interspersed within the descriptions of travel and characters are Zen musings such as \\"It's all different appearances of the same thing\\" as well as meditation on different ideals and places. Kerouac never lets the story slow down and regardless of how accurate the Buddhist ideals are, the rambling, jangly story is quite a ride."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"In no other novel does an author so well depict the emotional charge while hiking. Kerouac hits the nail on the head: Desolation is beautiful! If you find it difficult to understand Kerouac, try trekking solo in the wilderness for a few days. He is Walt Whitman's apprentice.Kerouac is Bhudda. Every word he scribbles is greatness."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"In The Dharma Bums, Jack Kerouac continues his enthralling series of autobiographical fictions that he referred to as the Legend of Duluoz. His altar egos have several different names, such as Sal Paradise (On the Road), and in this novel, Ray Smith. Through Ray Smith, Kerouac tells of a chapter in his life that, even more than On The Road, displays his passion for living and idealistic approach to life, as well as to Buddhism. Ray Smith is not a hardcore Zen Buddhist, but an optimist who embraces the very best of Zen Buddhism, as well as Tibetan Buddhism and even Christianity. The novel does not consist of plot, but rather a series of entertaining vignettes and scraps of story that form a beautiful mosaic by novel's end. With sometimes raw, sometimes stunningly beautiful language, Kerouac transports the reader to the peak of the Matterhorn, across the country from California to North Carolina on a hitchhiking odyssey, to the beat poetry scene in San Francisco, to the ultimate destination, Desolation Peak, where Ray Smith truly finds himself. Within the novel is a cornucopia of interesting, colorful characters that do not leave the memory easily. The Dharma Bums is a book not to be read, but to be inhaled, drunk, savored and treasured."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack brilliantly follows his heart and captures the attention of his reader. In Dharma Bums, his wanderings to Desolation Peak invite us all to share in his spirit of freedom and joyous revolt. This book, along with others, has a special place within me. Dharma Bums takes me away from myself. Jack was one cool cat."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Dharma Bums represents Jack Kerouac's best work (better even than On The Road). For anybody who has ever wondered what it's like to be truly on the outside, this is the book. I've read it four times, named my snake after Jaffy, and will alway recomend it to whomeever needs a good read"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"One can talk about the importance of On the Road to the American mythos, of the deep, struggling pain and depression of Big Sur, or of the rambling cant of San Francisco Blues; but, simply put, this Jack's most beautiful, elegant, eloquent novel. The book that's the closest to his poet's soul. Read all his other works first and then compare -- you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Dharma Bums is Jack Kerouac at his height of spirituality and utter happiness. This book, with a plot more enticing than On the Road but no less heartfelt, encourages readers to expand their own views of self and the universe while enjoying Kerouac's own interpretations of life and his coming Buddahood."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"As a Californian, frequenter of the Sierra Nevadas, as well as a college student who obsesses over fine American Literature, I found this work to be perhaps the most well written piece of beat fiction i've read. Contrary to popular belief, I feel this is a much more mature and insightful piece than &quot;On the Road&quot; (not to take anything from the brilliance of Kerouac's breakthrough work) and should be held in reverence by literature and philosophy enthusiasts across the globe. Japhy Ryder's Buddha representation, as well as Kerouac's struggle to incorporate his new discovery of traditional buddhism with his original Catholic upbringing are representative of the Western Frontier of Eastern Thought, which is becoming more popular even today, thanks to the likes of Jack Kerouac. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This was a truly astounding book. I have read &quot;On the Road,&quot; and consider this to be the better one. Its beautiful, almost mythical descriptions of the California mountains gave me vivid pictures I will never forget, and the Buddhist philosophies Kerouac talks about really opened my eyes. This is a profound book that I consider one of the top five I have ever read. It's characters are intriguing, the journey is freedom itself, and it hits you in your soul."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Perspective's of america,the west and a spiritual journey of sorts.

His novels provide a brilliant witness-lens of manifold perspective. The freshness of his expression, the early sallies into nascent american buddhism, and his disilllusioned, bemused and cynical observance of the turmoil and rebellion of midcentury culture are immutable and altogether without peer. Anyone interested in counterculture or our culture in general is recommended to this finest of Kerouac's titles."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The sense of nature Kerouac captured in this book is an important message in this work-shop-consume world. And he conveys so much appetite for life! I especially enjoyed the Gary Snyder character: &quot;The closer you get to real matter...(rocks, mountains, etc.) the more spiritual the world is.&quot; I&quot;M READING IT AGAIN!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"To avoid the modern cliche of idolizing Kerouac and other writers and musicians, many whose lives are primarily concerned with the abuse of alchohol and drugs, Kerouac is truly and literary genius, and &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; exemplifies this. Kerouac was all the things that were rebellious before rebellion became a dormant term, as it is today. Kerouac and &quot;Japhy Rider&quot; take you on a hike into the mountains that could inspire any soul to leave their materialsitic belongings behind for the life of a &quot;Dharma Bum.&quot"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Great follow up to \\"On The Road.\\" Changes your perspective on ideas that you never thought would change.

The have very few possessions which they kepe is small shacks or in backpacks, and spend their time discovering nature and the dharma in this world.Kerouac's writing style varies - in certain parts it seems like pure fiction (describes parties, characters' interactions with family, etc.), at some points it seems very philisophical (i learned a bunch about Buddhism), and at some points it is just very descriptive (i live in NYC, and it made me miss nature.)There were a few parts that were &quot;wordy,&quot; but overall this book reads quickly and is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"A man who named and best described a generation of which he was a key member, this is another high point in his outstanding literary career.

It's a perfect fit for any fan of life."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Although this isn't the greatest book written by Kerouac, it is easily my favorite he has written. There are many weak moments and contradictions by the characters (Kerouac) but the passion in the pages is hard to deny. He really means everything he writes and believes he is trying to become a better person. All told, it is a fun, romantic trip; this is something that is lacking in today's cynicism."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is timeless and inspiring. i buy it for many people who think Kerouac is just &#34;On the Road&#34; ."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I would recommend this book to all my friends jack kerouac's descriptive in depth descriptions of living on the road are as close as you can get to real adventure in the modern day. smoke rocks and gang bang"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums has the Jack Kerouac style that On the road carried, but is faster paced than the authors most famous work. The themes are drastically different also, On the Road being a sensualist's dream, and Dharma Bums being the down to earth maturity that came from years of living on the road. Nature is a key factor in the book, its no Walden but the way Kerouac intertwines nature, Buddhism and the American dream is a very entertaining read. I would recommend this book over On the Road simply because it is shorter and blends a variety of things that are uncommonly seen together. The only difficulty was having to look up a few terms in regard to the eastern religions, but even that doesn't detract from the flow of the book. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked On the Road, and if you haven't read any Kerouac, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This book offers the reader an escape from the traditional framework of what is belived, by society, to be the fundamentals of happiness.

In this book he takes you along the journey of a free spirit allowing you to experiece the true joys in life. He offers the reader a voyage back to the basic pleasures that seem to have been lost in the transformation to a civilized society.

This book, published in 1958, is about Kerouac's journeys into mountains around California in 1955 and is about his friendship with poet Gary Snyder. Jack Kerouac's Buddhism is featured in this great book and how he struggles with the religion and tries to find enlightenment. That's all I know about this book except that it is one of Kerouac's best. Hell, even the sample from Amazon was great when Kerouac met Gary Snyder on a car on a train and they share wine. Ah...wine. the sweet, sweet drink of Bacchus."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Anyone who has any respect for nature, the Dharma, life, or philosophy will gain from this book.

Instead, all I got after slogging through nearly eighty pages of Kerouac's rambling and grammatically nightmarish prose, was a headache and the gnawing sensation that I'd been conned.In all honesty, I don't \\"get\\" it. Why all the fuss? While I understand the historical significance of Kerouac and this book (along with \\"On The Road\\") to the counter-culture \\"Beat\\" movement of the fifties, it simply didn't connect.The snippets of \\"Zen\\" wisdom were very rudimentary and the plot was non-existent. But it was the meandering writing style that made this book an absolutely miserable experience for me.Perhaps when this book was first published it was a revolutionary piece of literature. Maybe it inspired a whole generation of repressed \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" Americans to hop a boxcar and explore the world while exploring their own identities.

Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of &quot;On The Road&quot; seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in &quot;On The Road.&quot;This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best.

I tried. I wanted to. But...I don't see what the big deal is. My suspicion is, as I hinted above in my jerky little title, people hail this book because they think it makes them somehow elite and cool to proclaim a kinship to it. I think that's the key to the \\"popularity\\" of a lot of art, a lot of music, a lot of literature extolled by subcultures within the masses. They are bolstered by an illusion of affinity for what they secretly do not embrace. In the case of this book, at times Kerouac's prose was lovely and at other times it rambled until I had no idea what he was going on about. The concept of The Dharma Bums is exciting and if even a fraction of those who claim this novel awakened something spiritual inside them are being honest, then I respect its impact on them, but...I didn't connect with the Beat vocabulary, with the story here, or the fact that since it's probably as much invention as autobiography, it validly inspires aspirations of real life imitation.

In many ways I enjoy this book even better than 'On the Road.' It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers.

That dharmy-boy Jack shore can smith them words. They bounce and spin, leap and unfurl in a cacophony of tremulous abandon in your mind's ear.The pleasure in reading Kerouac is that he is such a remarkably good, wonderful person and he is so joyous and full of zealotry and surprise. And he loves everyone, unconditionally. But there is not a hint of treacle; it is all vividly authentic but awash in kindness.THE DHARMA BUMS was written in the late 50s, and was a quick follow up to Kerouac's ground-breaking best-seller ON THE ROAD. Both are less experimental than others of Kerouac's works, but are jaunty displays of Kerouac's famed spontaneous prose.As with most of Kerouac's work, the novel is written in first person and closely follows events in Kerouac's life, with the identities of his real-life beat friends disguised by pseudonyms (at the insistence of his publisher).The book begins in southern California in 1955 with Ray Smith [Jack] struggling to hop a fast train to San Francisco. He arrives in The City after overcoming some difficulties and meeting a good-hearted hobo. Once in the city, there is a quick chapter--not calling much attention to itself--about Ray's attendance at a poetry reading, which is noteworthy in that it is a fictionalized account of the most famous poetry reading of all time: when Allan Ginsberg first read &quot;Howl.&quot; [In the novel the poet is named Alvah Goodbook and his poem is titled &quot;Wail.&quot;]Quickly, though, Ray [and the reader] meets the central character of the book, Japhy Ryder. [It is fun to know that Japhy is based on the Pulitzer-winning poet Gary Snyder and the project Japhy/Gary is up to at the beginning of the novel is to draft the first Chinese-to-English translation of Han Shan's &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot; Shan's epic poem is the inspiration of the current best-selling novel of the same name, set during the Civil War.] Ryder is the ultimate, ebullient frees!pirit who whisks Ray off on an adventure, a climb up the Matterhorn (a peak just outside the current-day borders of Yosemite National Monument). At all times, Japhy and Ray engage in happy dharma banter, swapping tales and lessons learned. And back at Japhy's shack of a home there are orgies, jazz and meditation, exceptionally tasty plates of beans and bottles of cheap ruby-red port.The book continues with fascinating similar events, all written in a lusty, swashbuckling style, full of dharma and comradery. At the novel's conclusion, a final mountain is climbed--both figuratively and literally--and the experience left me fully satisfied.Unlike almost all other novels, DHARMA BUMS and others of Kerouac's tales are not driven by a careful, classic plotline. There is no achy tragedy that you read your way into the heart of and then hope for a nifty, surprising conclusion. The book barrels forward from the lust-for-life of its characters and the supreme genius of Kerouac at his craft of threading words."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This book was the most inspirational work I have ever read.

Eventually, he winds up in California and meets up with Japhy Ryder who he imitates to a T, letting you know full-well that Ray Smith has no mind of his own. They meet other Buddhists, drink wine, talk about Buddhist stuff like the Diamond Sutra, Bhoddisatvas and Bhikkhus, past Buddhas, and they write a lot of haiku poems. All the while, the narrator is constantly bombarding the reader with his strange Buddhist revelations he comes to while praying like \\"everything is empty but awake\\", or \\"rocks are space and space is illusion\\". It gets old fast.Ray Smith reminds me of a less-cool Dude from \\"The Big Lebowski\\".You won't find any fascinating stories that Sal Paradise (\\"On the Road\\") had of meeting new people wherever he went, jazz clubs and drinking too much, the drugs, the sexual encounters of the women he entertained... nothing."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"If you are interested in Beat literature, American lit, the 50s or the American experience in general, by all means read this book. You'll learn a little about all of the above and be entertained by a talented, exciting writer.

I would even recommend \\"Dharma Bums\\" over the Kerouac Reader or other beat anthologies.I'm always the first to admit that my perceptions of books are colored by the context of my life when I read it. I first read \\"Dharma Bums\\" when I was in college in Boulder, Colorado, I was an apathetic academic but had a budding interest in Buddhism and was sitting in for sunrise meditation with a Zen group at a Buddhist temple. I didn't own a car, rode my bike everywhere, hiked, rock climbed, and indulged in other beat-like habits. Still, I think I started all of Kerouac's books somewhere along the line, some multiple times, and \\"Dharma Bums\\" was the only one I finished.Having just now reread it, it continues to stand apart from his other works. Kerouac's writing is always interesting to me but it is hard to move forward sometimes without a story arch. When reading Big Sur, for example, in which he writes as elegantly as possible about descending into the madness of alcohol psychosis, I find it hard to maintain my momentum.\\"Dharma Bums\\" represents a time, a naive time in retrospect perhaps, but a fun exciting time when the beats were young, full of energy and enthusiasm, and really believed they were on to something cosmic. Over the course of this book we see Kerouac's Buddhism deepen. In fact, more than deepen, it matured and softened, evolving from austere and ascetic into something much more philosophical. More Zen, less dogmatic, not necessarily in conflict with indulgence and gratification. And things are happening in the book, there are elements of plot in the narrators travels and adventures. They climb a mountain as a spiritual practice, and, after struggling with paralyzing fear, Kerouac learns the great lesson \\"you can't fall off a mountain.\\" There is the suicide of Rosie, a manic psychotic he was entrusted to baby-sit. There is various other traveling, hitchhiking, and meditating adventures, and the book wraps up with enchanting nature prose, written during solitary days as a wilderness fire lookout.I had to check this out of the library to reread it, (see my listmania, \\"Books I wish weren't packed away at my in-laws\\"). My interest in Zen was sparked by this book initially and re-reading it drove me right back to the mat."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Man, I don't know where to start. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \\"Wail\\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \\"Howl\\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic.While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"As Kerouac notes in the introductory chapter, he met Gary Snyder, a.k.a. Japhy Ryder in 1955, just before Snyder went off to Japan to immerse himself in Zen Buddhism. What follows is a free-wheeling account of their time together in perhaps Kerouac's most appealling and certainly most postive book. Dharma Bums is a celebration of American Buddhism, which was budding in San Francisco at the time, with a number of Beat poets reading their haikus and free-verse poems at the Six Gallery in San Francisco. Once again, Kerouac revels in changing names, but among the many prominent faces presented in this autobiographical novel are Allen Ginsberg, Kenneth Rexroth and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Snyder was the rising star, a Buddhist scholar and translator of books of Japanese and Chinese poetry while studying at Berkley. Snyder, like Kerouac, had working class roots and the two hit it off from the start, exulting in each other's state of being.Kerouac devotes Dharma Bums to Snyder in the same way he did On the Road to Neal Cassady. It was one of Kerouac's more happy times, as he was heavy into Buddhism, and sought out Snyder as a soulmate and mentor. Kerouac sets the stage wonderfully, coming across a hobo reading from St. Theresa on a train bound for LA, coming back from Mexico. He then hops the \\"Zipper\\" up to San Francisco, which whirled along at 80 miles an hour on the California coastline. Kerouac hangs out at Ginsberg's cabin in the Berkley hills, but it is Snyder's spartan cabin that draws his attention. Snyder had already chosen to live the life of an aesthete, giving up most of his worldly possessions, except for his famous rucksack and orange crates of books, mostly of poetry. Kerouac captures some wonderful moments as they all gathered around drinking wine and engaging in yab yum with a girl who went by the name of Princess.The heart of the story revolves around Jack's and Gary's hike to the Matterhorn in the Sierra Nevada, in which the two form a strong bond that propells Kerouac on other adventures, including a summer at Desolation Peak in the northern Cascades that would become the subject of his next book, Desolation Angels. Kerouac's writing shines in this book, as he is able to maintain such an ecstatic high throughout the narrative, almost seeming to touch the sky. Of course, having such a positive person like Gary Snyder to wrap the book around gave Kerouac the impelling force he needed, as on his own Kerouac often sank into melancholy and despair, which characterized his later years. One marvels at the free and easy nature of this pair as they search out their respective enlightenment, drawing on nature and their sense of the eternal cosmos.One doesn't have to be well versed in Buddhism to appreciate this book, although allusions and references are many and may confuse some readers. Just let yourself go and enjoy the free flow of the narrative, which is Kerouac at his best."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Having heard me praise this book countless times, my wife finally read it for herself. Her response? \\"You know, I was expecting some stereotype of \`cool' Beatniks, trying to be so hip and detached. But that's just some popular media image. The people in this book are exuberant, thoughtful, even spiritual!\\" That sums it up as well as anything. Forget the glib idea of alterna-cultural one-upmanship that passes for a Beat attitude these days - \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is about nave exuberance, anything-but-ironic soul-searching, an eager exploration of life's sorrows and joys, and the sheer, exhilarating, wondrous zest of being alive and aware in an endlessly fresh world. If reading this clear mountain stream of a book doesn't make you want to change your life and your way of looking at life, then you're just hopelessly blind to something precious! Life is so much more than the neatly packaged, pre-imagined commercial that society would love to sell you, and \\"The Dharma Bums\\" will gladly show you one possible way of finding your true path."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"My review is not focused on the content of The Dharma Bums as much as the production of the book itself. Let it be known this is one of my favorite books of all time and I consider it Kerouac's best. My issue is with the publisher, Penguin, who has simply revamped its \\"Penguin Classic\\" edition with Ann Douglas's intro to make a Hardcover. Yes, Douglas's intro is excellent, but the only difference with this new Hardcover 50th Anniversary Edition is that is has 2 or 3 pages of a letter in which Henry Miller writes about The Dharma Bums. For me who is a bibliofile. I don't want a cheap quality cardboard book. I used to work for an Univ. Press and know about production options. Penquin basically chose the cheapest. Every single copy in 3 bookstores were banged up. You might say this isn't the publisher's fault, but it is because they didn't make a quality product that could stand even being stacked on a shelf, imagine opening it and reading it. People who want a 50th Anniversary edition want something special because it has a special meaning to them, if not buy the paperback. So I guess that's what I suggest. The Penguin Classic edition has new artwork, quality paper and the same intro, without the high price. I wish Penguin would follow Knopf's example and do beautiful books like those in their Everyman's Library Series."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"DHARMA BUMS came out a year after ON THE ROAD. While the latter is the beat manifesto celebrating the peripatetic lifestyle, BUMS focuses on the beat romance with Buddhist enlightenment and the building of an inner life. ON THE ROAD was an instant, memorable success, and while BUMS no doubt fed a desire for more of the same, it stands apart, its own satisfying work of art, its own way of sending telegraphs from the heart of the beat movement. Many of the episodes are based on actual events and experiences that were still fresh memories as the book was written.Ray Smith is the first person narrator of DHARMA BUMS, a look alike for Jack Kerouac. For most of the book, he slyly puts Japhy Ryder at the center of attention. Ryder is a stand-in for poet Gary Snyder who survives, who as a young man in his twenties was already a natural leader. Surrounding them are other familiar figures from the era, including Alvah Goldbook (translates to Allen Ginsberg). They all write poetry and love jazz, women, and a casual lifestyle. They seek spiritual enlightenment. They delight in trolling for clothes in the Good Will and Army and Navy stores, they savor the simplest meal over a campfire. They are the Dharma Bums, rejecting the paralyzed emptiness they ascribe to middle class life.I really like this book. The prose is clear and concrete, even when sorting through abstract notions. It is often funny. Kerouac had extraordinary insight into individual nuances and desires, and plays them into the tension of the journey and the sorting out. He had a gift for seeing how outsiders might perceive him and his crowd and how history might come to interpret the present he was portraying. Though he is legendarily perceived as a spontaneous artist, there is extraordinary control and shape imposed on these pages. Only twice does he momentarily break his world: once, in my edition, he slips and refers to Japhy as Gary, and another time, slipping out of the immediacy of the action, he pays a compliment to a simple meal on the road, noting that even as a lionized young writer in New York, he had not had a better meal in an upscale restaurant. Those curious nanoseconds can be forgiven, however. This book is a joy."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I cannot write enough words to describe how wonderful this book is. I could write a book about its greatness, its mind-numbing beauty, its special place in the pantheon of great human achievements. Jack Kerouac was a shooting star, a dharma bum in the truest sense of the word. This man has a style and fluidity to his writing that is otherworldly, and yet so magically human. He synthesizes poetry and prose in a way that not many have ever approached. His writing is lyrics to his life, my life, your life. He can express the human condition better than anyone I have ever encountered. In the Dharma Bums, he tells about his adventures with Japhy Ryder (Gary Snyder), a man who lived his life the way that Kerouac wrote. Spontaneous, beautiful and pure. This is a book with power, that has changed many peoples lives, including mine, and has the power to influence so many more. Buy five copies of this book and loan them out to your friends and strangers. Kerouac's dream of a rucksack revolution is one of the most beautiful ideas that I have ever known, and this book is the starting point for that inevitable revolution. So get this book and get started. Hit the road and things will never be the same. peace."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"'The Dharma Bums' is a tale of social dropouts in California who search for Buddhist enlightenment and truth (dharma) amid wine, sex, hitchhiking and mountain scenery. It's a good introduction to Kerouac - shorter, lighter and more accessible than On the Road, which is a more epic but also has some monotonous bits.If religious certainties turn you off, you might tire of dharma-bum narrator Ray's Buddhist slogans and the dogmatic Zen views of Japhy, Ray's buddy. But though Kerouac portrays Buddhism as liberating, he also laughs a lot at kooky piety. At some points - like Ray's 'banana sermon' - religion becomes either profound or hilarious, or both.Ray tries to reach nirvana by convincing himself the world's an illusion, which makes it ironic that the best bits in this novel are poetic descriptions of mountains and travel. The final lonely mountain-top vigil - based on Kerouac's experience as a fire lookout, described in Lonesome Traveller - is a tour de force. Kerouac's prose flair allows him to string 10 adjectives in front of a noun, a heinous crime in modern writing fashion, and get away with it.Kerouac balances Ray and Japhy's Buddhist belief that the world is illusory against the earthbound views of world-weary poet Alvah Goldbook, a thinly veiled Allen Ginsberg. Alvah's quest to soak up his surroundings rather than transcend them puts him closer to the philosophy of On the Road, in which the travelling bums reach a jubilant but sad-hearted state of raw appreciation of their phsyical world.Through the Ray-Japhy-Alvah triangle and all the minor characters, 'The Dharma Bums' gives various answers to Kerouac's big question in this and other books: how to lead a free existence in a conformist careerist consumerist society. Fifty years later, the question's got more vital. Youthful rebellion and boheme are just marketing motifs for soft drinks, CDs and snowboards now, but Kerouac shows you it's possible to be authentically free - if you have the guts."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Following the success of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \\"The Subterraneans\\" and \\"Tristessa.\\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac responded with \\"The Dharma Bums\\" which was published late in 1958. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole. The book was critiqued by Allen Ginsberg and others close to Kerouac as a \\"travelogue\\" and as over-sentimentalized. But with the exception of \\"On the Road\\", \\"The Dharma Bums\\" remains Kerouac's most widely read work. I had the opportunity to reread \\"The Dharma Bums\\" and came away from the book deeply moved.As are all of Kerouac's novels, \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is autobiographical. It is based upon Kerouac's life between 1956--1957 -- before \\"On the Road\\" appeared and made Kerouac famous. The book focuses upon the relationship between Kerouac, who in the book is called Ray Smith and his friend, the poet Gary Snyder, called Japhy Ryder, ten years Kerouac's junior. Kerouac died in 1969, while Snyder is still alive and a highly regarded poet. Allen Ginsberg (Alvah Goldbrook) and Neal Cassady (Cody Pomeray), among others, also are characters in the book. Most of the book is set in San Francisco and its environs, but there are scenes of Kerouac's restless and extensive travelling by hitchiking, walking, jumping freight trains, and taking buses, as he visits Mexico, and his mother's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the course of the book.The strenght of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" lies in its scenes of spiritual seriousness and meditation. During the period described in the book, Kerouac had become greatly interested in Buddhism. He describes himself as a \\"bhikku\\" -- a Buddhist monk -- and had been celibate for a year when the book begins. I have been studying Buddhism myself for many years, and it is easy to underestimate Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism. As with many authors, he was wiser in his writing that he was in his life. There is a sense of the sadness and changeable character of existence and of the value of compassion for all beings that comes through eloquently in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" Smith and Ryder have many discussions about Buddhism -- at various levels of seriousness -- during the course of the novel. Ryder tends to use Buddhism to be critical of and alienated from American society and its excessive materialism and devotion to frivolity such as television. Smith has the broader vision and sees compassion and understanding as a necessary part of the lives of everyone. Smith tends to be more meditative and quiet in his Buddhist practice -- he spends a great deal of time in the book sitting and \\"doing nothing\\" while Ryder is generally active and on the go, hiking, chopping wood, studying, or womanizing. At the end of the book, he leaves for an extended trip to Japan. (He and Kerouac would never see each other again.)\\"The Dharma Bums\\" offers a picture of a portion of American Buddhism during the 1950s. It also offers a portrayal of what has been called the \\"rucksack revolution\\" as Smith and Ryder take to the outdoors, and, in a lengthy and famous section of the book, climb the \\"Matterhorn\\" in California's Sierra Mountains. In the final chapters of the book, Kerouac spends eight isolated weeks on Desolation Peak in the Cascades as a fire watchman. He comes back yearning for human company.Sexuality plays an important role in the book, against the backdrop of what is described as the repressed 1950's, as young girls are drawn to Ryder and he willingly shares them with an initially reluctant Smith. The book includes scenes of wild parties tinged, for Smith, with sadness, in which people of both sexes dance naked, get physically involved, and drink heavily. Near the end of the book, Ryder offers Smith a prophetic warning the alcoholism which would shortly thereafter ruin Kerouac's life.\\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a fundamentally American book and it is full of love for the places of America, for the opportunity it offers for spiritual exploration, and for its people. Kerouac's compassion was hard earned. In his introduction to a later book, \\"The Lonesome Traveller\\" heaptly described his books as involving the \\"preachment of universal kindness, which hysterial critics have failed to notice beneath frenetic activity of my true-story novels about the 'beat' generation. -- Am actually not 'beat' but strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic.\\" I found a feeling of spirituality, of love of life in the face of vicissitudes, and of America in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" The work was indeed a popularization. But Kerouac's vision may ultimately have been broad.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Westerners tend to have under-adjusted encounters with Buddhism, because they are usually attached to the \`idea' of their being detached-- a fallacy because Buddhism asserts the \`end of self' altogether. Thus, it is difficult to write about Buddhism in a western context, especially in a first person narrative, which is what Kerouac rather successfully has done. Kerouac is self-aware of this dynamic and creates two characters (Ray and Japhy) who start off traveling together, but become more adverse as their philosophies clash. Japhy becomes deeply attached, almost smug, to his spiritual evolution, while the more modest Ray continues the search for self, without the stringent belief system of his former companion. Readers may find it a tad convenient that Kerouac appropriate himself as the closer to truth Ray. Whatever the case, the polarity is an affective device.Similar to On The Road, Kerouac writes with ease and eloquence, and at times, profound insights. Some of the more predictable scenes in the book feature hippy parties, road trips, and drug use, for which the author is famous. However, the book is just as full of sweet, quirky, and new ideas on Zen Buddhism that are slipped in between the sentences, along with a dozen or so lovely haikus. The crucial redeeming quality with this book is that Ray doesn't become too heady or obsessed with his philosophical inclinations. He simply goes about his way, making light comments about things without becoming the author's mouthpiece, an unfortunate aspect of many books.From Oregon, California, Ohio, and the Carolinas (to name a few), Ray ends up home with his family, a failure in the context of the bohemian life he strived for. It is at this unlikely place he undergoes an experience that perhaps is as close and earnest as one can ever get to a selfless experience.Kerourac manages to write a book about truth and God without being pedantic or self-righteous. Ray is humble and friendly, so readers are not intimidated, rather, they are that much more eager to join the quest. This is a warm, hope filled, and youthful novel written by an author who embodies the search in all of us."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The book starts off well with Kerouac meeting a young student of Zen Buddhism called Japhy Ryder and the two decide to climb the Matterhorn. I've been out to the Sierras myself and enjoyed the descriptions of the scenery, it reminded me of my time up there, sleeping in the forest, waking up in my sleeping bag covered in snow. It's really beautiful writing, and the story (a rarity for Kerouac, having a story) rushes forwards. There's also a nice buildup with Kerouac hopping freights, sleeping on beaches under the stars, etc. It's what makes Kerouac the writer he is. Kerouac, Ryder and Ginsberg have some nice back and forths debating poetry. Ginsberg's cynicism of Buddhism makes for an interesting and funny debate.After the Matterhorn episode though, around page 80, the story is basically told. Kerouac has no idea how to progress the remaining 100 pages. I guess the point of the book was to talk about Buddhism but I never felt Kerouac was a serious student of it. Buddhism promotes abstinence of sex, drugs, drinking, all of which Kerouac partakes of frequently. He's like a lot of people I know who are into Buddhism - they take the parts they like and pretend they're the real thing. They're not, and neither is Kerouac.Unfortunately, Kerouac's writing becomes even more meandering as he rambles on with pseudo-profound writing. Here's an actual quote which he thinks is enlightening: \\"Form is emptiness and emptiness is form and we're here forever in one form or another which is empty\\". See what I mean? And this goes on for 100 pages!\\"On the Road\\" wasn't as revelatory to me as it was to some of my friends. It was disjointed, a bit annoying, not nearly as clever or interesting as it thought it was and ultimately quite boring. 10 years later, I decide to give him another try with \\"Dharma Bums\\" and initially I thought it was going to be great. What happened was that Kerouac's enthusiasm and naivety got in the way of the writing.It would be too easy to type down passages from the book that shows how shallow the book's attempts at mysticism are or how Kerouac's writing makes him sound like a wide eyed innocent and inexperienced 13 year old from the country setting foot in the city for the first time. Suffice it to say, if you didn't like \\"On the Road\\" you won't like this. Nor will you if you are a student of Buddhism. If you like Kerouac or are 15 years old, you'll probably get a kick out of this.I should mention the highlight of this edition was Jason's drawings. The front and back have brilliant drawings and he includes two comic strips on the inside flaps that are just great. Look up Jason's graphic novels, he is one of the best cartoonists around."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Liked this more than On the Road. Has a completely different feel. One of my favorite reads."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer. It made me want to live my life without shackles, free like Kerouac's character Japhy (Gary Snyder), climbing mountains and writing poetry. It captures the Boho 50's era like no other, especially in the Bay Area. Finally, it inspired me to learn more about Buddhism and eventually spend a year in a Buddhist monastery.

This one, three times. Women deserve better in Kerouac, but hey, it's the fifties. Poor Jack fell apart in the sixties. Anyway, Bums has all the famous people thinly disguised. Gary Snyder, who is so smart he still lives and is a real Buddhist, not a fake like most of us. Ginsberg is there, Alvah Goldbook for God's sake, having sex with women. It is another road trip, back and forth across what was fast becoming the wasteland we know with pockets of natural beauty wonderfully described. You get a fairly linear narrative but the jazzy rythms intrude, the man was a frustrated musician. Maybe he should have taken more psychedelics and left the booze alone. Booze is too much of a sacrament in Bums, we know there are better things to use as sacraments. Of course, most Buddhists avoid alcohol, except some crazy Zen masters who did as they pleased, no rules please. What Jack describes in the book is still his vision of what he hoped for, but knew would not happen. It probably killed him, but the book, in a very nice yet inexpensive edition is a trip to read, and perchance to dream..."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"First, let me say that I have read Dharma Bums several times and, of course, found something new and wonderful in each reading. It is, quite simply, a classic American novel, and I feel that the previous two reviews (five stars, naturally) sum up the book's contents, its spiritual impulse, and finally, its dramatic impact on American letters better than I could here.What I would like to add, then, is that THIS SPECIFIC EDITION (the Penguin Classics Deluxe) is, by far and away, the best out there. In my mind, it is a collector's item, a kind of retro masterwork, and featuring the outstanding if not enigmatic illustrations by the artist known simply as Jason. To be sure: the drawing of Jack Kerouac and Gary Snyder (Japhy Ryder) sitting by the fire high in the mountains, immersed in the moment, is simply a gem.Finally, if you find this book to your liking, I think you should march right out (metaphorically speaking, I guess, since we are all on-line) and purchase John Suiter's stunning Poets on the Peaks, which is a large, well-designed photo and bio work about Snyder, Kerouac, Philip Whalen and their time spent as fire look outs on Desolation Peak - trust me, the photos in this coffee table book are utterly fascinating."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Following the success of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \\"The Subterraneans\\" and \\"Tristessa.\\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac responded with \\"The Dharma Bums\\" which was published late in 1958. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole.

One of the treasures of American literature, this warm and happy novel is filled with the joy and sadness that Kerouac saw in the world.A novel of this type has the unique ability to capture the living heart of a person, putting it down on the page for us all to discover. Fortunately Kerouac was an unusually kind and warm hearted man, and his strange foolhardy goodness illuminates the pages of this book like a warm glowing candle flame.The main character of the novel is Kerouac himself, but the hero is based on the character of the poet Gary Snyder. One of the wisest of the beats, Snyder has shown us all how to live through his series of fine books. To me, Snyder is a more worthy hero than Neal Cassidy, the character whom Kerouac praises in his most famous book, On the Road.It is not entirely clear why Kerouac chose to fictionalize the characters in his book, calling his hero Japhy Ryder rather than Gary Snyder. One of the most touching moments of the book comes when Kerouac, describing the time when came back to the west coast after visiting his mother, accidentally slips out of character and says that it is \\"Gary\\" who greeted him in the little shack in Marin County.In this book, and in later years, Snyder would have one complaint about Kerouac: he drank too much. This book perfectly captures Kerouac's wonderful spirit, putting it down on the page where it will not be forgotten for many, many years. But there is also a kind eulogistic sadness that hovers over this book. It is hard to understand how such a beautiful spirit would be so quickly snuffed out by an indulgence in alcohol.A huge amount of ink has been spilled denigrating the beats in general, Kerouac whenever possible, and this book in particular. It is extremely ironic to read it now, all these years later, and find it is still so vividly alive, while Kerouac's critics and the books they praised are now usually either hopelessly outdated or entirely forgotten. It is true that Kerouac can at times write like an angel, and can steadily write with intense vividness, and occasionally write complete nonsense. But of course Kerouac knew when he was being silly. He was clearly and perhaps admirably lost in the materialism of 1950's America, but he was no fool.Yet it is not Kerouac's prose that matters, but his amazing, intensely alive spirit. He was rapturously in love with the world and the people in it. Like Melville and Whitman, he had perfect pitch when it came to defining the casual, irreverent style that embodies the best in the American spirit. He is a modern day Ishmael, wandering the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, a refugee from the compulsive materialism of the American Ahabs who crave power so they can wreak their twisted and doomed revenge on their imagined enemies.At the heart of the book lies a meditation on Mahayana Buddhism and the emptiness of this world. Kerouac, who was full of words, sings the praises of the soundless void. And in that emptiness, he finds the compassion which forms the wellsprings of life. That compassion, and Kerouac's intense ode to the joy of living, are found on every page of this sad, beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac's natural audience was the young. I read him whenI was fourteen and able to see just a tiny part of the world.What he did for me and for my generation was to suggesta universe that was different in its ultimate orientationto what was good.All of a sudden, the simple, the obvious, the severely plainand widely available pleasures were valued. Mountains, beaches,box cars. Not only that, but his heroes were Buddhist-Japanese,Chinese and Indian and his world-view was from a meditation mat.We barely noticed his speed-crazed prose or the almost completelack of a plot.Reading Kerouac was like hanging out with a magical friend whocut away the cords that tied us to conventional American lifein the fifties and sixties. Indeed, you could say that the sixties,for many of us, began with this book.The Dharma Bums is fifty years old now. The young areimprisoned in different ways today and the boxcarbodhisattvas seem irrelevant. Perhaps they are.I don'timagine that my daughter and her friends dream ofspending a summer alone in a firetower or reading poetryin a smoky coffee house.And yet this was the book that set their parents free,started a revolution that made their world.--Lynn Hoffman, author of THE NEW SHORT COURSE IN WINE andthe forthcoming novel bang BANG from Kunati Books.ISBN9781601640005"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac's \\"Dharma Bums\\" extends his recurring theme of one man's quest to find true freedom of mind and soul. Equally colorful characters are scattered throughout, just as in \\"On the Road.\\" I suspect that every reader of Kerouac comes away from the experience with a slightly different outlook on life. In my opinion, very few books ever accomplish this feat and Kerouac seems to do it with each and every work."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Kerouac and his friends were a part of a group of individuals who were known in the early 1950's as \\"The Beat Generation.\\" They were the precursors of the hippies of the 1960's. As expounded in Kerouac's wonderfully expressive and liberating book, the beats loved to write and to recite poetry, drink wine, laze around, hike and camp in the woods, sleep under the stars with their rucksacks nearby, and go rock climbing. Many of the beats road the rails (as celebrated by Woody Guthrie in the 1930's) or would hitchhike to get to their destinations. Ray Smith, the hero and narrator of _Dharma Bums_, does all of these things; he even criss-crosses the country by thumbing rides. Like many of his comrades Ray is a practicing Buddhist. He integrates Buddhism and meditation into all aspects of his life, whether in his relationships with people or in seeking a oneness with nature. Ray shares in many of these activities with his best friend, Japhy, who recommends to Ray that he seek a summer job as watcher (preventer of forest fires) with the U.S. Forest Service. Following Japhy's advice, Ray finds work at Desolation Peak in the Great Pacific Northwest. It is there that Ray, tasting of the elemental forces of nature, recognizes that \\"The vision of the freedom of eternity was mine forever.\\" Like Ray's unique experience, _Dharma Bums_ is a revelation."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"A somewhat sad story...The protagonist, a dis-spirited, wistful, melancholy soul, who's &quot;haddit&quot; with middleclass, American society (who hasn't) and - with constant refills of his huge, bottomless wine goblet - hits the Highroad, full of Zen, Buddha, etc...I was just waiting for this guys liver to simply explode from his body...Reminded me a bit of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; (odd), &quot;Into the Wild&quot;, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and, in a more odd way, Hongo's &quot;Volcano&quot;...This theme of restlessness, discontent, (self?) dissatisfaction...And never quite finding a Home.

I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"THE DHARMA BUMS is Kerouac's mostly autobiographical 1958 follow-up to the iconic ON THE ROAD. And, truth be known, THE DHARMA BUMS, though less known, is a far better tale than its predecessor, which embraced a rough and gritty depravity as the Beat metier.In THE DHARMA BUMS, Ray Smith (Kerouac) sets out for California where he meets Japhy Ryder (the poet Gary Snyder), who introduces him to the essences of Zen Buddhism, as well as the core of what was to become the counterculture of the 1960s.Kerouac's gentle, wide-eyed amazement at the spiritual world he has entered is manifest on every page. Whether in a North Frisco crash pad or in the Sierras, Kerouac moves through a joyous universe full of light, color, and sheer new-ness. His ability to share his inner visions on these pages marks him as a truly talented writer. THE DHARMA BUMS is a happy book. Even Kerouac's occasional bouts with alcohol and depression do not detract from the experience, they merely underscore the happiness and the heights to be found in Zen spiritual practice.There's a lot to like about this book, and I really do. For anyone who cares to make the journey, THE DHARMA BUMS is a great (if unfocused) primer on Zen that needs to be read for the simple pleasure of it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is yet another compelling novel by Jack Kerouac, but unlike his more famous semi-autiobiographical novel &quot;On The Road&quot;, this one captures more of Kerouac's spiritual and ascetic side and does so within the context of Buddhist muses and the more worldy aspects of existence.In On The Road, Kerouac (or Sal) is a youthful wanderer seeking experience by hitchhiking across the U.S. and stopping to explore the wilderness of various cities. In Dharma Bums the wilderness he explores is the desolate mountains of California. At the beginning he sets ouf with his friend Japhy, and some other climber named Morley, to take on the precarious task of hiking a mountain called Matterhorn, and later Ray spends almost two months in solitude as a fire lookout on a mountain he calls &quot;Desolation.&quot;While at times I became peeved at Kerouac's (or Ray's) somewhat childish Buddhist ramblings, I began to realize that it was this unfettered exuberance with life that is utterly lacking in the seriousness of our business oriented society with its somber goal to mechanize human life.We hear very little of Neal Cassady (Cody in this book), who was the maniacal force that hurled On The Road along, with the exception of the scene in which Ray watches Cody's girlfriend Rosie who later commits suicide the morning after Ray tells her, in response to her paranoid rambling, &quot;But you're getting these silly convictions and conceptions out of nowhere, don't you realize all this life is just a dream? Why don't you just relax and enjoy God? God is you, you fool!&quot; Unfortunately I'm not too sure his consolation mitigated her paranoia about reality but you can't blame Ray's sincere attempt to help. The sytle of this novel is less plot and more sensory perceptions, which are captured in Kerouac's magnificant prosaic style.Oh, one more thing. The book opens with Jack hopping out of a freight &quot;somewhere near Camarillo,&quot; which is the city I live in. I think that's one of the many reasons why I am drawn to his novels. He lived and experienced America more than most of the American citizens who claim that Kerouac was a dissident while it was his dissidence that really proved how much he loved and felt for the U.S."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read &quot;On The Road&quot;, &quot;The Town and The City&quot;, and just before this one, &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long ! This one was much more fun to read and I could not put it down. If you really like Jack you should also check out James Baldwin and Norman Mailer."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"In California in the 60's the hippie culture was just beginning to take form, and at the forefront of that was Jack Kerouac and his entourage of friends, the original beatniks. During this phase of Jack's life he was becoming very spiritual, as were his friends around them. This resulted in an outstandingly beautiful outlook on life and they live the exact life they want to. Drinking and partying and going on adventures throughout California.Jack Kerouac was one of the most brilliant minds of his generation and here in Dharma Bums he brings you right in for the ride. Offering hilarious stories about him and his friends, this book shows Jack as he is just stepping into his prime.While On the Road tells the tale of Neal Cassady and Jack, the focus in Dharma Bums is directly on Jack. In particular it is focus on his spiritual awakening and development. Although, I must say, he doesn't become the most holy person in the world, he does acquire quite the spectacular outlook on life. Here he invites you into that wonderful mind of his and lets you ride with him.His writing style here is flawless and provides a fine illustration of his life. Dharma Bums will have you laughing out loud at the outrageous antics of Jack and his friends, then it will have you thinking deeply about the truths of life. This short little book is a literary masterpiece and is well worth the read. Enjoy Jack at his finest."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Words fly by and what is left? Empty glory, impressions of that and there, but this, glorious empty this is here."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I loved \\"On The Road\\" but this is the book that I recommend if someone wants to read only one Jack Kerouac novel. What made the reading of this book extra special for me was that while I was reading about Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder and Henry Morley climbing a California mountain, I was camped out 12,000 feet up on a California mountain on a very cold, early spring night reading this book in my sleeping bag inside my tent by lamplight. It was glorious because I could really imagine I was on that mountain with Ray and Japhy. The one slight quibble I've also had with the story is when Ray has the questionable insight that \\"you can't fall off a mountain\\". Oh yes you can; people die from it every year.\\"On The Road\\" will soon be released as a movie,and I hope it's a big success so that someone decides to make \\"Dharma Bums\\" into a film."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums, considered by many an American classic, is a rambling account of a young man finding himself during the 1950s. A well written story describing an era when hitchhiking and riding the rails were common and relatively safe for young men seeking to find themselves. Ray wanders in and around the west cost of the US and into Mexico, drifting from one meaningless adventure to another. The characters he encounters and befriends are sterotypes of that time in American history when the Beat Generation was \\"doing their thing.\\" Drugs, alcohol, casual sexual encounters, were all part of one big party while considering the Zen of Life, Buddism, and truth. The foolishness, and at times the insight, experienced by those leaving home and stepping into the bigger world are universal."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I didn't much care for &quot;On The Road&quot; after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great &quot;Beat Writer&quot; was nothing but hype, but after reading &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times.

It follows Ray Smith (Jack) and Jahy Rider (Gary Snyder) on a buddhist romp through the mountains of the west coast. Contemplating their religions and beliefs and coming to beautiful realisations about the world (&quot;You can't fall off a mountain&quot;), they create the rucksack revolution. A beautiful insight into thought and poetry. A must for anyone who wants to learn to think or expand their mind."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I was not alive during the time of the Beat Generation, so my experience is limited to brief summaries in history textbooks and to the literature to come out of this time. Kerouac's book is fascinating; it's thought-provoking and beautiful. The scenes atop Desolation Peak are enough to seize the reader with a desire to go out, to leave whatever is holding him or her back, and to experience nature and oneself in a new way."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"A very good book. It gives the reader a real feeling for the beats, what they stood for and so on. One of the best things about this book for me was the fact that I can see myself in japhy or rays shoe's. I love the northwest, and have hiked around desolation peak, so it was cool to read about it. Not having been alive when the beats were around, it was good to see that people of my parents generation thought like I do. I reccomended dahrma bums to some of my friends. Both of them were like, &quot;Why?&quot; They totally didn't get it at all. Possibly that's an indication of the intelligence level of the people I hang out with, but oh well."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Only Kerouac could capture any moment in his absolute awe. His never-stopping living loving yeah-yeah words invoke images and feelings like no other author. Read this book. Live this book."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"In &quot;On the Road,&quot; there were several points during which Kerouac's unusual way of wording things inspired a certain feeling of contentment or sorrow in me, but in &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; I really lived those feelings. His descriptions of the scenes and events in this book really capture the moment and preserve it for we unfortunate people who weren't there. I found &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; much more enjoyable reading than &quot;On the Road;&quot; it doesn't go on pointlessly in quite the same way. There's a clearer focus, on the religious, introspective side of Kerouac's attitudes, and the storyline lets us know exactly what it was like to be a Dharma bum."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums is one of the best books I have ever read on Zen Buddhism and traditional Buddhism. While following the guidelines of an interesting and fun story, Kerouac teaches the many fundamental principles of Buddhism. A+ book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I would be lying if a said that this book did not change my life. I thought that &quot;On the Road&quot; was amazing, but &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; is by far his best. Kerouac seems to be much more settled in his religious and philosophical views in this novel. His main pal, Japhy, is one of the most inspirational charaters in all of American literature. Though first time readers of Jack should probably start with &quot;On the Road&quot;, &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; is a must read for any Beat Generation fan."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac's most interesting work especially if you're interested in the beginnings of American Buddhism. Chronicles a time where the author and Gary Synder traveled together. Not great literature, but interesting from a historical perspective."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"DHARMA BUMS is Sal the next morning. The screaming mad party, heaven-reached and bottle-drained, rests in peace and the sun is here. Time to reassess. Time to repent. That is how this book reached me. Read on the heels of ON THE ROAD, BUMS is the next logical step in that journey. He still enjoys a party, still makes love to wine, but instead of ending in wild sweats, it approaches nirvana. He abstains from women, communes with the mountains, and is definitely on his way to shedding his skin of the world. His cohort this time around is not Dean, but right good Bhikku, Japhy. Together they hike the trails of Buddhahood.I enjoyed this book, but felt disconnected from the main character, the way a designated driver feels removed from the drunken group. He is on a path, to which I cannot wholly relate. The inner monologue passages are not as user-friendly due to their Buddhist nature (or \\"Buddha Nature\\") as those in ROAD. However, it is still a very engaging read that ends, like ROAD, in a euphoric afterglow. Desolation Peak is the new Mexico. Fog replaces bums, and silence, the exhausted laughter of done mad men."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective. Lots of meditation, soul searching and existential ruminations about life, truth, and nature. My only regret is that I didn't choose the book format, as it was hard to keep up with all the philosophical ramblings while listening in the car."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Alright, lets be honest for a moment: Kerouac does repeat himself - that is a fact. But what he also does is make us readers feel as though its the first time we've heard it. Thats a sign of a good writer. He's my favorite writer, and this is one of his best works. Its all about his getting involved in Buddhist philosophy, mainly because of the protagonist of this book, Japhy Ryder (Gary Snyder). The book is intimate, witty, and at times hilariously bizarre. Its not just good, its great. Its a must-have for your library. But dont just put it on the shelf, dammit, read it!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Many a time an author decides a novel, should refelct one's life. And we see that Kerouac contains this belief. &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; was a beautiful description of Kerouac's interaction with Gary Snyder, one of the great Beat poets located in San Francisco. This book, not only amazed people about with it's writing, but launched an entire idea of American Buhdism. Many say that On the Road is Jack's best book, but my opinion is that On the Road is a pop version of Dharma Bums. But that is my educated opinion, my personal opinion is that I love this book. Kerouac has been a large influence on my life. As a child my mother and cousin would read me poetry and novels from the beat generation, naturally the older I got the more I started to appreciate the writing. But through it all Dharma Bums is still my favorite (W/ Cassidy's letters to Jack a close second). I recommend this book whole heartly to any individual who truly loves literture, too often this generation gets written off as a bunch of drunks, but Hemmingway and Lost gen members are remembered as a group of talented writers, they had a couple in their day. So give these writers a chance, and start with this book."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I didn't get much out of it. It was a nice diversion from everyday life but I kept looking for the point Kerouac was trying to make and it escaped me. I've been reading a lot of hiker, mostly Appalachian Trail, narratives and thought this would be a nice expansion of the group. I went in with little knowledge and no preconceptions about Kerouac and came away with little appreciation of his work. I'm still going to read On The Road and might revisit this review if the mood strikes me. I suppose the lack of structure is a product of his writing style but I was disappointed in how the story just ended. Again, maybe I was looking for more than he was prepared to reveal. Maybe I'm just too set in my ways. Maybe I did get the point and just don't realize it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"It changed my life. It made me laugh, cry, and think. Just read it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is an incoherent book by the self-absorbed author/voice of beat. Ironically, in attempting to die to self the beatnik ultimately implodes into isolation. How ego-driven can one be but to ignore reality in the name of embracing it? You cannot separate the spritual thin ice in which Kerouc lives from his novels."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This was a must read during my solo hiking trips. A exploration into the minds of two Dharma Bums with different takes on their Buddhism lifestyles. Really enjoyed getting into their minds and following the main character, Ray, develop into his own being, confident in his thoughts and place in the world. Great strong ending.Definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with &quot;sez I.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book.

Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs???

Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Kerovac's The Dharma Bums was reveiwed...as \\"Kerovac living his dream as a zen lunatic and rucksack wanderer on the fabled golden shores of west coAast America\\" I, however,think the book was poorly detailed and jumped from ideas much too quickly.The story was structured as a blog or diary of two wandering bums who basically lived the life of poverty and \\"mooching\\" off other people who were their 'friends'. Kerovac's 'friends' were people who were met at poetry 'slams'. They do nothing outside of drinking, reading poetry, mooching off of people and having sex. Any bum off the street could have submitted a journal to a publishing company and it would have the same affect on the reader.I would not reccomend this book to anyone. It was random rambling about nothing. If you like books that tell and interesting story and have charachters you can connect in a personal way to, then The Dharma Bums is not for you.

I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer.

Ifliked On the Road I highly recommend this book for itis a classic.Further Reading:The Subterraneans, Big Sur"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Some of the general points made below have been used in other reviews of books and materials by and about Jack Kerouac.\\"As I have explained in another entry in this space in a DVD review of the film documentary \\"The Life And Times Of Allen Ginsberg\\", recently I have been in a \\"beat\\" generation literary frame of mind. I think it helps to set the mood for commenting on one of Jack Kerouac's major works, \\"The Dharma Bums\\", a novel that explores his and his \`beat\\" companions fascination, at least part time fascination, with the Buddhist lifestyle and philosophy in his well known spontaneous writing method at a time when he was trying to keep body and soul together, that it all started last summer when I happened to be in Lowell, Massachusetts on some personal business. Although I have had more than a few old time connections with that now worn out mill town I had not been there for some time. While walking in the downtown area I found myself crossing a small park adjacent to the site of a well-known mill museum and restored textile factory space. Needless to say, at least for any reader with a sense of literary history, at that park I found some very interesting memorial stones inscribed with excerpts from a number of Kerouac's better known works dedicated to Lowell's \`bad boy', the \\"king of the 1950s beat writers\\".And, just as naturally, when one thinks of Kerouac then, \\"On The Road\\", his classic modern physical and literary \`search' for the meaning of America for his generation which came of age in post-World War II , readily comes to mind. No so well known, however, is the fact that that famous youthful novel was merely part of a much grander project, an essentially autobiographical exposition by Kerouac in many volumes starting from his birth in 1922, to chart and vividly describe his relationship to the events, great and small, of his times. Those volumes bear the general title \\"The Legend Of Duluoz\\". That is why we today, in the year of the forty anniversary of Kerouac's death, are under the sign of his book of essays \\"The Dharma Bums\\".In a sense, as Kerouac himself often admitted, his fascination with Buddhism was something of an extension of his Gallic-etched Catholicism. That makes sense in that both religious expressions are filled with ritual and intense mystery. Thus, when Jack went west in the mid1950s to San Francisco and hooked up with the likes of poet Gary Snyder who was already a serious student of that religion/philosophical outlook it was natural that the restless Kerouac and the others would be attracted to this form of life, although it probably was, in the end, far too rigorous for Kerouac with his many earthy appetites. Nevertheless, this book presents that lifestyle and the youthful search for fulfillment that this searching represented in a very positive light and proved to be helpful to him in getting through some rough patches. Allen Ginsberg, a very close Kerouac friend at the time, became, for a while, a devotee of more substance and notoriety. However, and here we get back to the political realities, when the deal went down that religious philosophy could not hold up against the harsh political choices of the late 1960s when things got very \\"hot\\" in America, and the world."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books.

The casual reader delights in reading about Kerouac and Snyder climbing the Matterhorn; the same holds true for Teh Kerouac/ Cassady relationship in On the Road. Still I think that the underlying truths of this book, which lie dormant to the casual reader, greatly outshine the aciton.Kerouac's prose aims to draw the reader away from the worldly cycle of Work-Consume-Work-Consume and so on. He aims to show us a different path, one for the people who meditate and defy social convention, not simply for the sake of defiance, but for the sake of self-enlightenment.The long-haired, tea smoking, judge killing, terrorist supporting outsiders of today, so villified by the present and past governments, find in Kerouac much overlooked philosophy a separate peace, one away from the wired up fast paced world of dead technology. When Kerouac goes on his long beautiful tangents about children singing a ditty of their own imagination, it's like being eight years old again and having ice cream and cookies in the kitchen and laughing about the nonsense that happened at school that day. Kerouac reminds us that we do not live in a world enclosed by the suggested rule of society, that we are each our own to create and experience what we will for ourselves.TTFNDr. Gonzo"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"To those of you who have only read &quot;On theRoad&quot;, you need to read this book.

It's even better for those who feel all of these things simultaneously. Kerouac writes with a terse honesty and gives the reader so many opportunities to apply meaning to our own lives. He helps us to question our own role not in society, but in the search for ourselves.This book is a little less dark than most of his other books, and it contains some of his best ideas. The protagonist uses another character, Japhy, to explore ideas of Buddhism (Japhy's zen versus his own version). This is never done in an academic way, but rather in the spirit of the book itself: a free, wandering exploration which does not seek overall resolution.Kerouac seems to write as he lives: without too much worry and always with a song in his heart. At one point Japhy becomes concerned about the protagonist (obviously a Kerouac alter-ego) because he is drinking so much. The pathos here is magnified when we know the biography of Kerouac's life.This is a must read for people who live in the Northwest. His description of their mountain-climbing is excellent.

The ideas at times make the characters depressed, and at other times, they're at peace with these ideas. I think it is this type of examination, of the different stances towards &quot;the void,&quot; which is the real topic of the book--and this is as important a topic as there is.Also, I worried about an abrupt ending to the book as I read it, but found the last paragraph to be my favorite of all.

Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums was published in 1958, a year after Kerouac's more famous novel, On the Road. I read them both in the 1960's and remember his free-flowing writing style and his general enthusiasm but with On the Road I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. It may have been a seminal work but being original doesn't necessarily mean it is engaging. Lacking confidence, I assumed it was my fault. I read it again in the mid 1980's and, with confidence, understood less \\"what all the fuss was about.\\" I recalled that I had liked The Dharma Bums better--way back then--but I couldn't remember why. So after forty some years, I revisited it.The Dharma Bums is less about the Beat generation (as in On the Road) and more about a couple young men, Ray and Japhy, in search of Truth through Zen Buddhism. This was based on the real-life Kerouac and pal poet Gary Snyder, who apparently had a large influence on Kerouac's Buddhist journey. There is a lot more praying, meditation, and celibacy going on here than wild living, although Ray did like his port wine. I found Kerouac's zest for life innocent and life affirming, his striving for understanding of the world similar to other men's striving. He was thirty-six at the time but he sounded younger and wiser.The essence of the book is told in one paragraph, well into the book: \\"[S]ee the whole thing is a world of rucksack wanderers, Dharma Bums refusing to subscribe to the general demand that they consume production and therefore have to work for the privilege of consuming all that crap they didn't really want anyway such as refrigerators, TV sets, cars, at least new fancy cars, certain hair oils and deodorants and general junk you finally always see a week later in the garbage anyway, all of them imprisoned in a system of work, produce, consume, work, produce, consume, I see a vision of a great rucksack revolution thousands or even millions of young Americans wandering around with rucksacks, going up to mountains to pray, making children laugh and old men glad, making young girls happy and old girls happier, all of \`em Zen Lunatics who go about writing poems that happen to appear in their heads for no reason and also being kind and also by strange unexpected acts keep giving visions of eternal freedom to everybody and to all living creatures....\\" One might accuse Kerouac of being a prophet back in 1958; or lacking a divine source, at least a soothsayer, predicting the Hippy movement and \\"flower children.\\"I enjoyed the great hike into the Sierras, the descriptions of Marin County, the name dropping of locations--North Beach, Oakland and Berkeley--the trips for skid row coffee, shopping at Goodwill and the Salvation Army, hopping trains, hitchhiking home to North Carolina for Christmas, living lean in comfortable shacks, and the summer of self-discovery on fire watch at Desolation Peak in Washington. I particularly liked reading the bit about the cheap bus ride from smoggy LA to Riverside, with its fresh clean air! \\"I was exulted to see a beautiful dry river bottom with white sand and just a trickle river in the middle as we rolled over the bridge into Riverside.\\" He camped among the thickets, \\"a kind of bamboo,\\" on the river bottom in a nice open spot \\"except for the roar of trucks on the river bridge.\\" In the 1960's, this had no meaning to me. But I now know the bridge because I lived in Riverside, CA for twenty-five years. It's on Mission Inn Blvd. and it's the same place where the homeless camp today.Kerouac floats between sadness, \\"Are we fallen angels who didn't want to believe that nothing is nothing and so were born to lose our loved ones and dear friends one by one and finally our own life, to see it proved?\\"--to moments of humorous joy--\\"But let the mind beware, that though the flesh be bugged, the circumstances of existence are pretty glorious.\\"I now know why I liked this book all those years ago. I read it at a time when being a hobo was an option, when riding a freight train was a considered choice, when the song lyric \\"I've got plenty of nothin and nothin's plenty for me,\\" from Porgy and Bess, held an attraction. I had a romanticized notion that happiness was to be found in a vow of poverty and adventurous exploration, mixing my Jack London, Hemmingway and Robert Rurak with the Beat writers. My \\"Desolation Peak\\" experience was in 1963, a summer at 9000 feet, in Fish Lake Utah, spending my nights in my sleeping bag on a cot in a rustic old lodge, my days doing the work of common men, my free time fishing, exploring, messing with the Mormon girls, and killing jackrabbits. At the end of the summer, I hitchhiked to LA with a change of underwear plus four cans of Coors beer rolled up in my sleeping bag then hitched all the back to Ohio arriving two days before the beginning of my senior year in college. It was the most difficult semester of my prosaic college life. I didn't want to be there. I wanted to climb mountains, sail the oceans, see the world, witness nature at its wildest, experience the freedom of unlimited options. A sense of responsibility and a cute cheerleader helped me change my mind--the cheerleader more than the sense of responsibility. (I had also concluded that I liked girls who shaved their legs and smelled good. One might suggest that this was a sign of intelligence. I know it had nothing to do with intelligence).Accusing Kerouac of naivety would be a valid criticism of his thinking. The world wasn't (and isn't) ready to \\"wake up\\" as he suggests, but I admire his optimism: \\"You and I ain't out to bust anybody's skull, or cut someone's throat in an economic way, we've dedicated ourselves to prayer for all sentient beings and when we're strong enough we'll really be able to do it, too, like the old saints. Who knows, the world might wake up and burst out into a beautiful flower of Dharma everywhere.\\" I recently read a definition of the pursuit of happiness from Charles Colson. (What? You've got to be kidding! Chuck Colson and Jack Kerouac in the same paragraph?) Colson said it was \\"the freedom to make our best efforts toward a virtuous life.\\" Kerouac may have been misguided, self-destructive and a sleazeball of the highest order--I don't really know--but in this book, he sounded like an eager man in the pursuit of happiness. His final plea at the end of the book is poignant: \\"God, I love you...Take care of us all, one way or the other.\\""},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is the first Kerouac book i ever read. I've read it twice, once when i was 17, and once when i was 19. It's a beautifully poetic look at Jack's life (he calls himself Ray Smith in this one) while he was riding the rails, hitching, hiking and camping across the southern United States and Mexico. This book, along with On the Road, is one of Kerouac's more fantastical works. Though he always tends to focus on both the good and the bad of his journeys, Dharma Bums does carry an underlying current that Jack was able to achieve some kind of Zen Buddhist enlightenment at this time in his life. In that sense, there is less bad to dwell on, and life seems to work itself out more than it does in some of his more real, raw books. A great Kerouac read, and a great introduction to his style."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"When I came into correspondence with one of America's top short story writers, I shipped him a copy of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" as a thank you gift for answering some of my questions. I did this not only because its rough-cut pages make the book a wonder to handle, but because I think it's imperative for any devotee of American literature to read.Jack Kerouac envisioned that his many books would ultimately form a self-contained, complete volume which all linked together, an autobiography he entitled the \\"Duluoz Legend.\\"He writes, \\"The whole thing forms one enormous comedy, seen through they eyes of poor Ti Jean (me), otherwise known as Jack Duluoz, the world of raging action and folly and also of gentle sweetness seen through the keyhole of his eye.\\"Kerouac's more frequently read \\"On the Road\\" showcases his innovation of spontaneous prose through a frenetic story that glorifies what is arguably immoral rebellious behavior. \\"The Dharma Bums,\\" set about seven years later, again utilizes his madcap writing style, but in a way much more accessible to the reader than many of his other works. For how they snub conventional grammar and syntax, \\"The Subterraneans,\\" \\"Big Sur,\\" and \\"Satori in Paris\\" are dizzying.\\"The Dharma Bums,\\" however, expands into a commentary on Zen Buddhism through a sort of travelogue that chronicles Kerouac's meditations and wanderings through nature. It's a modernist adaptation of the works of the roaming poets of ancient Japan, most notable among them Matsuo Basho. Here Kerouac effortlessly glides past the preconceived notions of what form literature is supposed to take, and in so doing, with his melodic prosody, he renders a reading experience that is vivid and transcendent."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books.

A Life of the Buddha\\" together with an early novel,\\"The Hippos were boiled in their Tanks\\", written with William Burroughs. With the 50th anniversary of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" Kerouac's most popular novel after \\"On the Road\\", this new commemorative hardback edition of the text has been issued with a short letter written in 1958 by novelist Henry Miller to the publisher in praise of Kerouac's book and a previously published essay introducing the novel by Ann Douglas. The book is attractive and, here on Amazon, reasonably priced. Many paperback editions of this work are available and the Library of America's collection, which includes \\"The Dharma Bums\\" may by the best choice of all. Nevertheless, this volume is a good choice for those readers who love this book or for the lover of Kerouac on your holiday list. The remainder of this review consists of my review on Amazon, with modifications, of an earlier edition of \\"The Dharma Bums\\".Following the success of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \\"The Subterraneans\\" and \\"Tristessa.\\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac responded with \\"The Dharma Bums\\" which was published late in 1958. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole. With the exception of \\"On the Road\\", \\"The Dharma Bums\\" remains Kerouac's most widely read work. I had the opportunity to reread \\"The Dharma Bums\\" and came away from the book deeply moved.As are all of Kerouac's novels, \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is autobiographical. It is based upon Kerouac's life between 1956--1957 -- before \\"On the Road\\" appeared and made Kerouac famous. The book focuses upon the relationship between Kerouac, who in the book is called Ray Smith and his friend, the poet Gary Snyder, called Japhy Ryder, ten years Kerouac's junior. Kerouac died in 1969, while Snyder is still alive and a highly regarded poet. Allen Ginsberg (Alvah Goldbrook) and Neal Cassady (Cody Pomeray), among others, also are characters in the book. Most of the book is set in San Francisco and its environs, but there are scenes of Kerouac's restless and extensive travelling by hitchiking, walking, jumping freight trains, and taking buses, as he visits Mexico, and his mother's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the course of the book.The strength of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" lies in its scenes of spiritual seriousness and meditation. During the period described in the book, Kerouac had become greatly interested in Buddhism. He describes himself as a \\"bhikku\\" -- a Buddhist monk -- and had been celibate for a year when the book begins. It is easy to underestimate Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism. As with many authors, he was wiser in his writing that he was in his life. There is a sense of the sadness and changeable character of existence and of the value of compassion for all beings that comes through eloquently in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" Smith and Ryder have many discussions about Buddhism -- at various levels of seriousness -- during the course of the novel. Ryder tends to use Buddhism to be critical of and alienated from American society and its excessive materialism and devotion to frivolity such as television. Smith has the broader vision and sees compassion and understanding as a necessary part of the lives of everyone. Smith tends to be more meditative and quiet in his Buddhist practice -- he spends a great deal of time in the book sitting and \\"doing nothing\\" while Ryder is generally active and on the go, hiking, chopping wood, studying, or womanizing. At the end of the book, he leaves for an extended trip to Japan. (He and Kerouac would never see each other again.)\\"The Dharma Bums\\" offers a picture of a portion of American Buddhism during the 1950s. It also offers a portrayal of what has been called the \\"rucksack revolution\\" as Smith and Ryder take to the outdoors. in In a lengthy and famous section of the book, they climb the \\"Matterhorn\\" in California's Sierra Mountains. In the final chapters of the book, Kerouac spends eight isolated weeks on Desolation Peak in the Cascades as a fire watchman. In an ending reminiscent of the ending of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac writes:\\"Now comes the sadness of coming back to cities and I'e grown two months older and there's all that humanity of bars and burlesque shows and gritty love, all upsidedown in the void, God bless them, but Japhy you and me forever we know, 'O ever youthful, O ever weeping'. Down on the lake rosy reflection of celestial vapor appeared, and I said 'God, I love you\\" and looked up to the sky and really meant it. 'I have fallen in love with you God. Take care of us all, one way or the other.\\"For all his love of Buddhism, Kerouac remained a theist. He came back from his experience on Desolation Peak, he tells the reader, yearning for human company.Sexuality plays an important role in \\"The Dharma Bums\\", against the backdrop of what is described as the repressed 1950's, as young girls are drawn to Ryder and he willingly shares them with an initially reluctant Smith. The book includes scenes of wild parties tinged, for Smith, with sadness, in which people of both sexes dance naked, get physically involved, and drink heavily. Near the end of the book, Ryder offers Smith a prophetic warning the alcoholism which would shortly thereafter ruin Kerouac's life.\\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a fundamentally American book and it is full of love for the places of America, for the opportunity it offers for spiritual exploration, and for its people. Kerouac's compassion was hard earned. In his introduction to a later book, \\"The Lonesome Traveller\\" he aptly described his books as involving the \\"preachment of universal kindness, which hysterial critics have failed to notice beneath frenetic activity of my true-story novels about the 'beat' generation. -- Am actually not 'beat' but strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic.\\" I found a feeling of spirituality, of love of life in the face of vicissitudes, and of America in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" The work was indeed a popularization. But Kerouac's vision may ultimately have been broad.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Can't say that this really grabs me like On The Road did. I feel less like in on the action and comings and goings of the people mentioned in the novel. Admittedly this may have to do with the fact that I actually read On The Road before I purchased the audio book and I only read part of The Dharma Bums, before getting the audio book. The person who narrates the audio book seems bored and listless."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I've read criticism of this book that I found just did not hold water. Most who don't care for it complain that there is a shadow of commercialism hanging over it because after the success of ON THE ROAD, his publisher asked specifically for something \\"like ON THE ROAD\\" and so he delivered THE DHARMA BUMS. As if this single fact (even if true, which I somehow doubt) has any bearing on the quality of the writing or the success of how Kerouac expressed the ideas within the work.To me, it is one of the most successful of Kerouac's novels. The writing is extremely powerful and seems to echo after you put the book away. I also find it to be the most transporting of his books--there is a feeling of almost being in some of the places he describes. In this way, as far as place, it's more effective than his more well-known and widely admired pieces.This novel means a lot to me. It never fails to inspire me, and I often take a copy along when I go backpacking into a National Park or wilderness area."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums is a semi-autobiographical novel covering the lives of two exuberant Zen wanderers seeking illumination across America.

Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums was a masterpiece to the Beat Generation but its messages of self-discovery and personal growth are universal to all people.During Kerouac's youth he experienced the plight of the lower-mid class firsthand in Lowell, Massachusetts. This roused his discontent for American society and interest in counterculture. Later, Kerouac joined the Navy but was insubordinate and honorably discharged. This would frame his resentment for forms of authority and instituted rules. He met Lucien Carr, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady who together composed the underground Beat Movement. The Beats can be described as weary groups of people who encouraged freedom of expression and creativity. The Beats ideals were present in all of Kerouac's work. He published numerous books but his two most famous works On the Road and The Dharma Bums would garner him national recognition. After 1961 Kerouac lived with his mother, no longer wrote, and died from years of alcoholism.The Dharma Bums has a straightforward semi-autobiographical plot. The story is of two inquisitive men Ray Smith(Jack Kerouac) and Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder) who \\"turn the wheel of the True Meaning, or Dharma, and gain merit for themselves as future Buddhas(Awakeners) and as future Heroes of Paradise\\"(5). They search for the truth of Zen. Then, Protagonist Ray Smith \\"followed the whole gang of howling poets to the reading at Gallery Six\\"(13). This event is recorded in Kerouac's life. This influential gathering of writers caused him to pursue writing. Next, Smith, Ryder, and Morley climb the Matterhorn Peak in California where the \\"trail had a kind of immortal look to it\\"(61). The novel ends with Smith's expedition to Desolation Peak where he lives isolated from people. These events are based Kerouac's life when he was hired to be a fire lookout for the U.S. Forest Service and was alone for 63 days. Overall, Kerouac emphasizes observations and images instead of climactic plot events.Kerouac achieves multiple purposes. First and foremost, it spurs human reflection. Ray Smith says \\"I promised myself that I would begin a new life\\"(77). Though this is a lofty idea the novel accomplishes the goal of having readers at least question or examine their current existence. Smith also confesses \\"the world ain't so bad, when you got Japhies\\"(71). This reinforces the possibility of transcendence and optimism. The auto-biographical fiction successfully brought reality and unreality together. The novel also elicits strong emotions and the writing is energetic. The book unified the Beat Generation and brought later counterculture movements of the 60's together.Kerouac's novel suggests many broad ideas. First, I think evidence in the book shows that people today should live more simply. Japhy highlights this point by being \\"brought up in a log cabin deep in the woods...an axman, farmer, interested in animals and Indian lore...with idealistic tendencies\\"(9). Through this I think that American society's negative standards of materialism, greed, and brutishness are exposed. A simpler spiritual life and personal-inquiry lead to higher truths and levels of humanity. Bohemian ideas are also presented. The \\"howling poets\\"(13) and healthy orgies\\"(34) promote the freedom of aesthetics and expression. The overarching idea is that as long as people take initiative anything in life is possible.The book does have small flaws. Due to Ray Smith's first person narration many of the characters true psychology is unclear. There was little background information. One change that may have strengthened the book as a whole would have been the insight of surrounding people outside the Zen Lunatics. The final imperfection was the general assumption that the allusions to Buddhism would be understood, more depth in these areas were needed.Kerouac's command of language and tone impact the overall read. Kerouac developed his own language called \\"spontaneous prose\\". Kerouac writes \\"My breath was coming out in steams. I rolled over to my other ribs and slept more: my dreams were pure cold dreams like ice water, happy dreams, no nightmares\\"(77). His rhythmic language method can not be understated. He improvises and breathes in his writing. The point is to have uninterrupted thoughts which gets the closest to the human consciousness. At the same time, the prose and poetry are intermixed. He experiments mainly with imagery and alliteration as Smith says \\"I crashed through bright brittle thickets and came out sweating and stomped ankle deep in streams\\"(121). The tone can be considered upbeat as their journeys are fast-paced and changing. Also, the mood of tranquility is present throughout as the characters are in an \\"emotional wilderness\\"(45). Constant references to Nature, prayer, and meditation produce this serene tone.Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums covers multiple terrains. Kerouac's background and simple plot frame the proper context for the book. The book had few flaws and Kerouac commanded his use of language and tone. The novel's message of soul-searching and personal transformation make it relevant to all groups of people. Jack Kerouac is a hero to the Beats or people feeling weary and bogged down by American society. His messages ring clear for anyone willing to listen."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums, by Jack Kerouac, follows Ray Smith, a character based on Kerouac himself, through an amazing physical and spiritual journey. In the story, Smith meets Japhy Ryder, an eccentric mountaineer who is fascinated by Eastern literature and religion. Japhy inspires Smith to begin his career as a meditating, rucksack-wielding \`Zen Lunatic'. Smith is led to a deeper understanding of his Buddhist faith through scaling mountains, sleeping in silent deserts, and meditating for hours on end deep in the woods. He travels all over the United States, meeting innumerable different characters as he goes and learning more and more about the truths of existence itself.What shines through in The Dharma Bums isn't so much the plot of the story, but the way in which the story is told. Jack Kerouac has a knack for making the ordinary seem extraordinary, and impressing upon the reader how something seemingly mundane could impact him in a profound way. The narrative has a wide-eyed romance about it, making every experience Ray Smith has seem new and fresh. People, places, and events in the book are described with a prose that is practically poetry, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. In reading The Dharma Bums, I wasn't concerned as much with what happened as I was with how it happened.The Dharma Bums isn't a book that everyone would enjoy. Some would find it pointless or long-winded, or difficult to read. For someone who likes a lot of description and feeling in a book, however, I strongly recommend it. This book is also a necessity for any enthusiast of Beat literature, and even those interested in Buddhism would appreciate it as a serious philosophical work. To anyone else, The Dharma Bums is bound to add inspiration, excitement, and a new perspective to any open mind."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This book absolutely changed my life--had to get my car repaired one day, picked it up on a whim--read the whole thing in one sitting at a mechanics shop drinking coffee swill--they all thought I was crazy because and let out guffaws of disbelief every now and then and have to get up and walk out the door and pace, lost in thought---Everybody I've ever met who's read Keruoac read &quot;On The Road&quot; first--that IS NOT the book you read first by Kerouac--&quot;Dharma Bums&quot; IS--Why? Dharma Bums style is much more straightforward and concise--whereas &quot;on the road&quot; is much more rambling in nature--you get bored with it sometimes--Dharma Bums travels along at a good clip and is Jack at his most life-celebratory--Kerouac is in this big mess of a life just like everybody else and he knows it--realizes that everybody &quot;steps to their own drummer&quot; and doesn't hold that against anyone--he was concerned with freedom and living life (at least in his early life)--he isn't trying to be a guru--he just tells it like he sees it--and, almost in spite of himself, what he sees is this slice of the beautifully rich infinity that surrounds us"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"When I reread this book after so many years I found myself wondering if we were ever really like this. The innocence, the lack of pretention, the sincerity - it is so totally alien from what this society has become. Sure Jack Kerouac had his problems with booze and relationships, but at his core there was somehow this absolutely blinding glare of innocent purity. Here was a man whose primary concerns were always the meaning of life, the nature of god, the suffering of innocents, whether he was boozing it up in a bar, hopping a freight, or hold up in a look-out cabin on top of a mountain. Jack Kerouac was a true poet in a world were poetry was in abysmal decline both before and after. Jack Kerouac's life was a spontaneous living poem- the dionysian poem of the living holy fool.This is my favorite of all Kerouac's novels. I've had people comment about how I must have patterned a huge part of my early life on this book. I remember thinking so too, except all my wandering and wondering took place before I even heard of Jack or his books...."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is a free-spirited energetic, descriptive, tale that was written just before the emerging 60s culture began to evolve and gain mainstream attention and followings. Kerouac lived and did what he wanted in this story (and mostly in his life.) His description of Berkeley and the folks he encountered was interesting, and is full of youth, freedom, and the desire to experience. This is a different read than &quot;On The Road,&quot; in the way it flows. His train hops up the west coast, jaunt to North Carolina, and the hike with Japhy, can make one ruminate. &quot;Raymond Smith&quot; was searching for some meaning to life in this book. This piece was written by Kerouac when he still had energy and life left in him. I'd like to know a lot more about Gary Snyder, who is the character Japhy Ryder in the book. I believe he's still alive. The Dhamra Bums goes on everyone's shelf, with the Road, after you've read The Road. Let it lure you to the Rucksack Revolution."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"On the Road, Kerouac's other acknowledged masterpiece, was east coast, new york feel and about squeezing every ounce of sense, touch, smell and experience out of life. This is his west coast, buddhist, pre-hippie mirror of that more famous book. Suffused with eastern thought, nature and trends that were to overtake america a decade later, this book is every bit the equal of On the Road."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"It is not polished, but the rough gems are in there.If I were to distill my impressions of The Dharma Bums into a single sentence, that would be it.As On the Road was an ode to Kerouac's friendship with Neal Cassady, The Dharma Bums is an ode to his friendship with Gary Snyder.For all his talk of bhikkus, Bodhisattvas and visions, what struck me as most authentically Buddhist was Kerouac's sensitivity to the ever-passing moment, his desire to look deeply into moments that may seem insignificant and reveal the beauty, joy and peace in such simple occurrences. And with what relish he describes his meals, travels, fleeting meetings with other people, animals, and nature!On the other hand, I found Kerouac's interpretation of Buddhism to be rather misguided at times. A bhikku is one who commits himself to monastic discipline -- in stark contrast to Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder, who were often chasing after pleasures of the flesh.No, it is not polished, but I would prefer to focus on what I appreciated about this book: his admiration for others, his dynamic descriptions of mountain climbing, his wonderful anecdotes about food and eating (he truly had a knack for making an austere meal sound divine). So much gratitude and love of simple things, so much childlike wonder."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Published in 1958, this book is a fascinating preview of the 1960's. LikeOn the Road (Penguin Great Books of the 20th Century)it is based on Kerouac's adventures in the late 1940's and early 1950's as he and his buddies helped create the counter-culture, migrating cross-country between bases in Greenwich Village and San Francisco. They hop freights as hobos (the end of that era). They talk endlessly about Buddhist concepts (thus Dharma). Kerouac is credited with inventing the phrase \\"beat generation\\" but his group disowned it when the press turned it into the pejorative \\"beatnik,\\" precursor of flower children and hippies. So, Jack and his buddies hang out in San Francisco, partying and backpacking. A good part of the book is an excellent stand-alone backpacking story. You can always spot Jack at the party: he's the guy chugging from jug of cheap wine, a precursor to his death from alcoholism in 1967. This is a great story but there is an annoying \\"Oh gosh! Golly gee\\" aspect to the writing as if Jack were the world's biggest Eagle Scout, gone bad with the booze and the girls.To me it's fascinating to see this work as a precursor to the cultural revolution of the 1960's. Here in the late 1940's and early 1950's we have: haiku; Zen vs. materialism; criticism of suburban TV zombie families; revolt against the suburban lifestyle; hot tubs; love of nature and backpacking: buying your clothes at Goodwill; yogurt; free love; taking all your clothes off at parties (still hasn't quite caught on); cooking with mesquite; hibachis (remember those?), and, of course, jeans and guitars. Hard drugs weren't in yet, at least in Kerouac's crowd."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The book is a fabulous adventure on the pre-hippy, vagabond Buddha trail. However, it is one man's literary achievement. The author died from drinking too much booze for too long. So it's best to treat the book as a wonderful read, and not a guide on how to live."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Keroauc's 1959 novel THE DHARMA BUMS is a lightly fictionalized account of the author's friendship with the poet Gary Snyder among an underground literary scene fascinated with Buddhism.In the mid-Fifties, the nomadic writer Ray Smith comes to San Francisco and meets the Buddhist hipster Japhy Ryder. Their backgrounds could not be more different, as Smith is an alcoholic, urban East Coast figure while Ryder grew up in the forests of the Northwest and finds his highs in nature. Ryder introduces Smith to mountain climbing and wilderness survival, a more rigorous study of Buddhism than just a few pithy tropes, and a sexual openness that looks forward to the late 1960s. As much as Smith appreciates Ryder's example, he is reluctant to adopt more from Buddhism than what he can reconcile with his deep (albeit troubled) Catholicism, and his alcoholism persists through the novel in a poignant way.The novel is written in Kerouac's characteristic \\"spontaneous prose\\", a rambling, somewhat zany way of storytelling that eschews cautious rewriting or editing. I must admit I don't care much for Kerouac's style. Furthermore, the dramatic flow of the book isn't particularly compelling until the last ten pages or so, where Smith takes Ryder's advice and spends a summer in mountain solitude as a fire lookout in Washington.For me the book's interest lies in its documentation of a certain Zeitgeist. The Beats had become mad about Buddhism, but with decades of hindsight, one can see how -- as much as they filled their conversations with koans and exhortations to mindfullness -- most of them greatly misunderstood various schools of Buddhism. As a more or less full-time hitchhiker, I enjoyed Kerouac's detailed accounts of 1950s hitchhiking and train hopping, and you can still glean practical advice from the book that is useful today."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"After rereading this book as an adult I think I truly get it this time - Kerouac wrote this book about Gary Snyder (named Japhy Ryder here) and he learns a great deal from him. He tries to follow in his path, and he does to a certain extent, but the partying and the booze are his downfall.I read that after this book, years later, when Snyder returned from the monastery in Japan, Kerouac chose not to meet with him again \\"I'd be ashamed to confront . . . Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and dontgiveashit. I'm not a Buddhist any more.\\"Sad ending for Jack. I think he realized this and hints at it throughout the novel.Also, I think that if Jack were around today he'd definitely be an REI member - he was really into his gear, especially his rucksack."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Known as one of Kerouac's crown jewels, The Dharma Bums is a part self-biographical story about Ray Smith, a wandering, alcoholic, Buddhist poet who travels the USA looking for, well, whatever it is wandering, alcoholic, Buddhist poets look for when they travel around in search of something; enlightenment, solitude, experience, peace. For someone like myself, who is well traveled, interested in spiritual practice, and at the same time a budding writer, this book was inspirational in many aspects, giving me the push to explore writing in various forms, and to try to break out of the box when it comes to thinking and experience.Some of his paragraphs stretch the boundaries of traditional sentence structure for sure--but they still work.\\"Then suddenly everything was just like jazz: it happened in one insane second or so: I looked up and saw Japhy running down the mountain in huge twenty-foot leaps, running, leaping, landing with a great drive of his booted heels, bouncing five feet or so, running, then taking another long crazy yelling yodelaying sail down the sides of the world and in that flash I realized it's impossible to fall off mountains you fool and with a yodel of my own I suddenly got up and began running down the mountain after him doing exactly the same huge leaps, the same fantastic runs and jumps, and in the space of about five minutes I'd guess Japhy Ryder and I (in my sneakers, driving the heels of my sneakers right into sand, rock, boulders, I didn't care any more I was so anxious to get down out of there) came leaping and yelling like mountain goats or I'd say like Chinese lunatics of a thousand years ago, enough to raise the hair on the head of the meditating Morley by the lake, who said he looked up and saw us flying down and couldn't believe it.\\"Yup, that's one sentence. The stream of consciousness style for which Kerouac would be known for is exemplified in examples like this one in The Dharma Bums, and that style is a good counterpart to the Buddhist meditation he was beginning to be involved in; being, observing, flowing, not controlling, letting what will happen, happen. This style of writing, and the entire story for that matter, is about freedom and spontaneity.I must say I felt tinges of sadness and reverie as I read; his descriptions of the San Francisco Bay area, the California coast (where I happened to live for some time, also as a young Buddhist), coupled with the adventurous spirit of his spiritual comrades made me long for the fog and windswept trees of the California coast and a time of life filled with little care or responsibilities beyond spiritual matters. But such is the Buddhist teaching of life and impermanence; nothing lasts. Alas, that time may be gone for me, but the endless pursuit for spiritual meaning continues in my life, and that spirit also lives on in the pages of The Dharma Bums."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Most peaceful book I have ever read. Language you could fall in love with:\\"I staggered up the hill, greeted by birds, and looked at all the huddled sleeping figures on the floor. Who were all these strange ghosts rooted to the silly little adventures of earth with me? And who was I?\\"\\"When I went back in the moonlight to my same old tree stump the world was like a dream, like a phantom, like a bubble, like a shadow, like a vanishing dew, like a lightning's flash.\\"As you read it, you feel that you have learned what the protagonist has learned, that you can see what he sees... you become him, just simply serene."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac may be best known for On The Road, but this is by far my favorite of his books. Looking back, it has probably been the most influential book on my life. The story is just so honest and original and beautiful, it confirmed my desire to be a writer when I read it as a sophomore in high school. But not just a writer. It made me want to live my life without shackles, free like Kerouac's character Japhy (Gary Snyder), climbing mountains and writing poetry. It captures the Boho 50's era like no other, especially in the Bay Area. Finally, it inspired me to learn more about Buddhism and eventually spend a year in a Buddhist monastery. I've never met someone who has read The Dharma Bums and hasn't loved it. It's one of the best books of the 20th century.By Jaimal Yogis, author ofSaltwater Buddha"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This commemorative edition does not add much to the new Penguin Classic with cover art by \\"Jason\\" except a two-page letter by Henry Miller to the publisher. While representative of the New York-transplant-to-hip Northern California milieu that he shared with the Beats, readers may opt for the paperback instead. While a handsome hardcover, the paper appears no more or less durable than the paperback. A lesson in impermanence that the book's contents may well repeat?Just before \\"On the Road\\" brought him the success he craved, Kerouac wrote this account of the \\"Zen Lunatics\\" and Gary Snyder's prediction of a \\"rucksack revolution.\\" This is my first Beat book; in middle age I admit lingering distrust of their sometimes condescending attitude towards the rest of us.That being said, this novelization may make the young feel vigorous and the mature wistful. Hearing \\"Japhy Ryder\\" gush about bulgar and yabyum, green tea and trail mix, baked bread and paisley shawls, Goodwill and hi-fi jazz before the massive commodification of counterculture filters the innocence of these early free spirits from Eisenhower's decade into a muted sepia. It's instructive, as Ann Douglas notes in her introduction, that \\"Ray\\" as Kerouac strives towards a greater sympathy than Snyder-as-Japhy expresses with the \\"straights\\" who must, after all, fund the hikes and the naps of the Beats. There's a sense of slumming, by these two students wanting to imitate a \\"bhikku,\\" a dharma bum. Japhy in real life's Reed-Indiana-Berkeley, Ray's author a scholarship-dropout from Columbia, allied with other privileged folks from the Ivy League and NYC bohemia. I don't know why, but there's an aura of play-acting and noblesse-oblige irritating me about their admirable but somehow smug quest. Blame it on Berkeley?Ray appears, to his eternal credit, aware at least of the contradiction between a Zen lunatic lording his insight over the unenlightened crew-cut and bee-hived masses and his own self struggling, who down on his luck has to go back to North Carolina to live off his kinfolk. Some of the best moments in this book come when Ray tells of his tramps by train and hitchhiking.Apropos, this book was written in ten days and nights at his mother's place in Florida. As his fictional self, Ray ponders the contradiction between the San Francisco party scene of dissolute intellectuals and his family, unable to comprehend Ray's notions and his lazy habits. \\"And I thought of Japhy as I stood there in the cold yard looking at {his mother as she does the dishes]: 'Why is he so mad about white tiled sinks and \\"kitchen machinery\\" he calls it? People have good hearts whether or not they live like Dharma Bums. Compassion is the heart of Buddhism.\\" (100)Yet, the Beats' stance against conformity did inspire generations towards more righteous behavior, along with a lot of excess on that road to wisdom. It's noteworthy that the narrator opens by admitting that while he was once more devout before he met Ryder, now he's \\"a little tired and cynical.\\" (2) Ray seems already to have studied the dharma largely on his own and passed through the initial, somewhat superior stage, and now feels it's a lot of \\"lip service.\\" Still, meeting Japhy, Ray perks up.The centerpiece of the narrative, the climb of the Matterhorn, makes one compare that Sierra peak to the manufactured scale mold towering in smaller form above the then-new Disneyland further south in California. The impression of a still largely rural state, even around the Bay Area, leaves a sense of loss for those who live in the state now. The Beats and then hippies, no less than Cold War defense industries, transformed California into a busier, tawdrier, and uglier place, with dreamers and schemers lured by the rhapsodies in Kerouac and Snyder and their mates.Unable to stay in the South with his family, inarticulate in sharing with them his understanding of Buddhist dharma, Ray goes back after bumming it along the Mexican border just as he left, back west to work as a Cascadia fire-warden at Desolation Peak's lookout. There, as the story ends, he finds his expected peace. \\"I made raspberry Jello the color of rubies in the setting sun.\\" (183) The interim return to California, full of parties in Marin, as with the previous woozy bashes in San Francisco, does drag the momentum down for long stretches of this short book. The contrasts between boho decadence and natural purity may be intentional, but the wobbly, hungover funk does hobble the pace. The comparisons between energy and dissipation do, on the other hand, underscore the lesson of impermanence, even of happy times, and the necessity for self-discipline.Japhy reminds Ray of the change coming when more people join their refusal to conform. \\"East'll meet West anyway. Think what a great world revolution will take place when East meets West finally, and it'll be guys like us that can start the thing. Think of millions of guys all over the world with rucksacks on their backs tramping around the back country and hitchhiking and bringing the word down to everybody.\\" (155)Kerouac here's still young enough-- even if nearly a decade past Snyder-- to hope. \\"Something will come of it in the Milky Way of eternity stretching in front of all our phantom misunderstandings, friends. I felt like telling Japhy everything I thought but I knew it didn't matter and moreover he knew it anyway and silence is the golden mountain.\\" (53) This typical passage captures the tone of the novel-as-memoir. Based as Douglas notes on smart predecessors like Thomas Wolfe, Melville, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, and C&eacute;line, Kerouac sought an admirable purity in his style. It may be difficult for us half-a-century later, jaded, to hear its freshness, but its sincerity lingers in moments such as when he tells us of the moon on water as they descended the mountain on a dark night. \\"Everything up there had smelled of ice and snow and heartless spine rock. Here there was the smell of sun-heated wood, sunny dust resting in the moonlight, lake mud, flowers, straw, all those good things of the earth.\\" (68-69) This may not be the more manic Kerouac that made him famous, but it may give today's uneasy riders a more lasting lesson in the legacy he left us.(P.S. Also see my 2010 reviews of his notebooks, \\"Some of the Dharma,\\" and the original scroll of \\"On the Road\\". Keroauc's \\"Wake Up!

A great book!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Rereading the Dharma Bums after probably a ten-year hiatus, I am struck by how foreign the beatniks seem to us today and how that impression must have been magnified tenfold for the Leave It To Beaver folks whom we are told ran the country back in the fifties. Then again Ray, Kerouac's protagonist, hitchhiked back and forth across America and found a surprising degree of tolerance if not admiration from the people stopping to give him a ride. Maybe that's just the nature of people on the move or maybe America wasn't really 100% homogenous like the beats and the flower children who followed them claimed.It would do \\"the kids today\\" good to read this book. I'll wager at least half of them won't get past the poetic language with which Kerouac writes his alleged prose. For the texting generation, Kerouac might as well be Shakespeare. A quick read fails to fully appreciate the music in his words. Slow down and enjoy.For those willing to embrace this new language, a world governed by thought, belief, emotion, experience, appreciation for nature and attention to basic human needs is unveiled; a world plunked down in the midst of the newborn consumer-driven American society governed by brands, advertising, the lure of \\"convenience,\\" and the first hesitant salvos of pop culture. Kerouac's characters are as well-versed in Buddhism as the Middle America folks they meet are fluent in Christianity. For an introduction to American Zen Buddhism as it emerged in the beat culture of the fifties and early sixties, read Alan Watt's The Way of ZenThe Way of Zenand then read The Dharma Bums, looking up and studying every reference to Buddhism you don't understand. It's on my list of things to do, along with hiking to Desolation Peak. If you ever listened to the Doors and didn't understand why Jim Morrison sang \\"the West is the best,\\" read The Dharma Bums and then Steinbeck's Cannery RowCannery Row: (Centennial Edition), and you'll begin to see, if not agree. It wouldn't have broken my heart if the last half of the book had been devoted to Ray's two months on Desolation Peak instead of just the last ten pages, but his adventures hitch-hiking, sitting in his family's woods, sleeping beneath the stars and eucalyptus trees, and riding the rails on the Midnight Ghost are worth every page devoted to them.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his youthful days as an ebullient Zen Buddhist and rucksack hitchhiker in the 60's. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in a shack in Berkley, CA with his good friend Alvah Goldbook. Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the wilderness of Central California where they recite poetry, drink wine, meditate, make haikus about every natural object, while trying to find themselves and seek the true meaning of life as beatniks. Ray Smith also criss-crosses the country again, home for the holidays, and then back to Berkeley. While at home he wanders through forest time and again, to center himself with nature and his surroundings, meditating there through the cold months like a real Buddhist Monk.I was surely impressed by this book. I even jotted down many meaningful Buddhist passages and quotes that Kerouac mentioned in the novel This work of literature by Kerouac is less \\"experimental\\" in literary terms compared to something like \\"Satori in Paris\\" by Kerouac. For those of you who have not had any past experience with Kerouac's writing style this will not be of any difficulty. The language is simple, the prose is right to the point, and there is hardly a bit of surrealism. Many of the sections are quite humorous because of the quirkiness and new ideas on Buddhism that are slipped in between the sentences, along with predictable scenes of the beatnik life hood (drug use and slang). Ray Smith purely goes about making light comments about life without being the author's speaker. This is a positive and heart fulfilling youthful adventure that displays immense compassion."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is probably one of the best samplers of the religious beliefs and lifestyle experimentation as practiced by the Beats. This so-called novel is actually another one of Kerouac's mini-autobiographies, in which he is calling himself Ray Smith. His good friend Japhy Ryder in the story is based on Kerouac's real-life cohort Gary Snyder. Rather repetitively, Ray, Japhy, and their fellow slackers spend much of the story getting drunk and discussing the very elementary Beat religion, which was merely a fractured collection of misunderstood Buddhism, counter-cultural irony, and a little under-utilized anarchism. Sure it was a weak &quot;religion&quot; but here it is for all to dig. We also learn a lot about how to live the unconventional life of a drifter, which may still be possible in a few isolated corners of America. The end of the story is a very impressive treatise on communing with nature and is the true treasure of this book, though it reveals a strange obsession with Gary/Japhy. This installment of Kerouac's philosophy isn't quite mind-blowing, but it can still be an enlightening read in this day and age.

The story is about two young men as they set out in search of truth. They are Ray Smith and Japhy Ryder (Jack Kerouac &amp; Gary Snyder). These two meet up in San Francisco, California at Berkeley. They attend a bohemian party and poetry jamming (The Gallery Six Reading). This was the beat generation of the 50s &amp; 60s.Japhy Ryder liked reading Zen books such as Diamond Sutra and also works by D.T.Suzuki. He was seeking his Bodhisattvas in everyone he met. Japhy would often quote Buddha: (\\"All life is suffering&quot;.)Their goal was to climb Desolation Peak. The solitude was their Satori. Dharma Bums is a great story of adventurer.

It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The middle is good when he talks about hitchin rides with big goofy Texans and then sittin in the woods in the middle of the night meditatin with the dogs in North Carolina.The other stuff is good, but I didn't finish the book because it's also a little stupid. Ray writes like a little kid would about a great baseball player he wishes he could become. Japhy teaches him about Han Shan, about women who take their clothes off when he asks them to and about scaling big mountains. I think if I saw Japhy comin toward me on his bicycle, I'd turn and run as fast as I could back to my room and lock the door. I don't think he's in his right mind a lot of the time, so taking precautions would be good.If Ray is so enlightened, why does he have to drink wine all the time and sleep in a bag? Oh well, he's a good writer, even a great writer sometimes, but I think I could write a better book. First, I'd organize it better and check my grammar better. Then, some of the phrases Ray uses sound real good, but don't really make sense you know. And I don't know why he puts his and Japhy's haiku poems in the story when Han Shan's are so much better. I think they both should stop reading Chinese books for awhile and do their homework.I'd buy the book though and make all of my friends read it. Then, I think I'd go to China or New Jersey and roam around for the rest of my life eatin pork an beans out of the can and tryin not to pee on anybody's campfire.Mr. Kerouac has a very good sense of humor I think and would like to love people more if he could (if they'd let him, maybe) and I'm sorry that he had to die so young and sad and all.

Many people's first introduction to Kerouac is On The Road. While I love On The Road, I've read pretty much all of Kerouac's novels, and I have to say that The Dharma Bums is my favorite.Indeed, I loved the book enough to write a companion reader for it (The Beat Handbook: 100 Days of Kerouactions), so right up front I have a bias and thought you should know about that.In at least one of his letters (Jack Kerouac: Selected Letters: Volume 2), Kerouac himself acknowledged that The Dharma Bums was 'really bettern ON THE ROAD' (p. 99). So, if you don't take my word for it, maybe you will take the author's and make this your first foray into beat literature. I don't think you'll regret it."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Man, I don't know where to start. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year.Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature.Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \\"Wail\\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \\"Howl\\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic.While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"If you found \\"On The Road\\" left you desperate for more of Kerouac's energetic prose, then this is perhaps the best next step. It is a lot more reflective, and this, combined with Kerouac's trademarked humble narrator allows real engagment with a book that deals with something worth writing about. It deals with mountain climbing, outdoor parties, groovy beat people and all the other unattainable, idealistic Kerouac things, but this is laced with fragments of Bhuddism, in the attitudes of the characters, their reflection in the freedom of the mountain experience, and the general escapism that provides so much of Bhuddism's popular appeal - it a sort of diet \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainance\\". It's really good - I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It's also less \\"experimental\\" in literary terms, meaning here Kerouac is simply conveying a story without trying to re-invent the wheel. In many ways, this is a good introduction to Kerouac. The language is simple; it's also technically a much simpler novel than say \\"The Subterraneans\\" or \\"Dr. Sax,\\" even \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac is not pushing the envelope of invention, here. But with all that I must say it's a wonderful book; it's also (dare I say) Kerouac's most \\"innocent\\" and sweetest book. There's a disarming earnestness and youthfulness at play in \\"Dharma Bums,\\" which reminds of a recent Amazon pick I enjoyed \\"The Losers Club\\" by Richard Perez. In any event, don't miss this great book!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I first met Kerouac in the early 70s, when I was finishing my sentence in college. He inspired me to actually go on the road and hitch hike across the country several times (something I would no longer recommend). I learned about America through Jack. Dharma Bums taught me that there was another side to thought and life than the ones I had been living. While he himself was self destructive, I have incorporated many of his philosophies thorughout my lfe, and continue to search for truth and beauty, even while amid lies and ugliness. Trying to explain Dharma Bums and its philosophies to my teenage daughter is a trip. She just looks at me as though I'd lost my mind, which I no doubt did years ago when I first ran in to the stories of Kerouac. It's sad to think that the ideas and lifestyles he enshrines are dying out, if not dead all ready. Anyone looking for a boost into the beat world, or an explanation for what made it so &quot;in&quot; 50 years ago would best be advised to read Dharma Bums, and On The Road. Nuff said."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Just before \\"On the Road\\" brought him the success he craved, Kerouac wrote this account of the \\"Zen Lunatics\\" and Gary Snyder's prediction of a \\"rucksack revolution.\\" This is my first Beat book; in middle age I admit lingering distrust of their sometimes condescending attitude towards the rest of us.That being said, this novelization may make the young feel vigorous and the mature wistful. Hearing \\"Japhy Ryder\\" gush about bulgar and yabyum, green tea and trail mix, baked bread and paisley shawls, Goodwill and hi-fi jazz before the massive commodification of counterculture filters the innocence of these early free spirits from Eisenhower's decade into a muted sepia. It's instructive, as Ann Douglas notes in her introduction, that \\"Ray\\" as Kerouac strives towards a greater sympathy than Snyder-as-Japhy expresses with the \\"straights\\" who must, after all, fund the hikes and the naps of the Beats. There's a sense of slumming, by these two students wanting to imitate a \\"bhikku,\\" a dharma bum. Japhy in real life's Reed-Indiana-Berkeley, Ray's author a scholarship-dropout from Columbia, allied with other privileged folks from the Ivy League and NYC bohemia. I don't know why, but there's an aura of play-acting and noblesse-oblige irritating me about their admirable but somehow smug quest. Blame it on Berkeley?Ray appears, to his eternal credit, aware at least of the contradiction between a Zen lunatic lording his insight over the unenlightened crew-cut and bee-hived masses and his own self struggling, who down on his luck has to go back to North Carolina to live off his kinfolk. Some of the best moments in this book come when Ray tells of his tramps by train and hitchhiking.Apropos, this book was written in ten days and nights at his mother's place in Florida. As his fictional self, Ray ponders the contradiction between the San Francisco party scene of dissolute intellectuals and his family, unable to comprehend Ray's notions and his lazy habits. \\"And I thought of Japhy as I stood there in the cold yard looking at {his mother as she does the dishes]: 'Why is he so mad about white tiled sinks and \\"kitchen machinery\\" he calls it? People have good hearts whether or not they live like Dharma Bums. Compassion is the heart of Buddhism.\\" (100)Yet, the Beats' stance against conformity did inspire generations towards more righteous behavior, along with a lot of excess on that road to wisdom. It's noteworthy that the narrator opens by admitting that while he was once more devout before he met Ryder, now he's \\"a little tired and cynical.\\" (2) Ray seems already to have studied the dharma largely on his own and passed through the initial, somewhat superior stage, and now feels it's a lot of \\"lip service.\\" Still, meeting Japhy, Ray perks up.The centerpiece of the narrative, the climb of the Matterhorn, makes one compare that Sierra peak to the manufactured scale mold towering in smaller form above the then-new Disneyland further south in California. The impression of a still largely rural state, even around the Bay Area, leaves a sense of loss for those who live in the state now. The Beats and then hippies, no less than Cold War defense industries, transformed California into a busier, tawdrier, and uglier place, with dreamers and schemers lured by the rhapsodies in Kerouac and Snyder and their mates.Unable to stay in the South with his family, inarticulate in sharing with them his understanding of Buddhist dharma, Ray goes back after bumming it along the Mexican border just as he left, back west to work as a Cascadia fire-warden at Desolation Peak's lookout. There, as the story ends, he finds his expected peace. \\"I made raspberry Jello the color of rubies in the setting sun.\\" (183) The interim return to California, full of parties in Marin, as with the previous woozy bashes in San Francisco, does drag the momentum down for long stretches of this short book. The contrasts between boho decadence and natural purity may be intentional, but the wobbly, hungover funk does hobble the pace. The comparisons between energy and dissipation do, on the other hand, underscore the lesson of impermanence, even of happy times, and the necessity for self-discipline.Japhy reminds Ray of the change coming when more people join their refusal to conform. \\"East'll meet West anyway. Think what a great world revolution will take place when East meets West finally, and it'll be guys like us that can start the thing. Think of millions of guys all over the world with rucksacks on their backs tramping around the back country and hitchhiking and bringing the word down to everybody.\\" (155)Kerouac here's still young enough-- even if nearly a decade past Snyder-- to hope. \\"Something will come of it in the Milky Way of eternity stretching in front of all our phantom misunderstandings, friends. I felt like telling Japhy everything I thought but I knew it didn't matter and moreover he knew it anyway and silence is the golden mountain.\\" (53) This typical passage captures the tone of the novel-as-memoir. Based as Douglas notes on smart predecessors like Thomas Wolfe, Melville, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, and C&eacute;line, Kerouac sought an admirable purity in his style. It may be difficult for us half-a-century later, jaded, to hear its freshness, but its sincerity lingers in moments such as when he tells us of the moon on water as they descended the mountain on a dark night. \\"Everything up there had smelled of ice and snow and heartless spine rock. Here there was the smell of sun-heated wood, sunny dust resting in the moonlight, lake mud, flowers, straw, all those good things of the earth.\\" (68-69) This may not be the more manic Kerouac that made him famous, but it may give today's uneasy riders a more lasting lesson in the legacy he left us.(P.S. Also see my review of \\"Wake Up! A Life of the Buddha,\\" written by Kerouac in 1955, published in 2008.)"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"A few decades down the road from its publication, Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums seems positively prophetic. The book tells of Kerouac's adventures with his Beat-Generation bohemian cohorts in '50s America, and we can see how they and other hipsters of the time paved the way for the social and cultural revolutions of the following decades.Originally published in 1958, the book covers events in Kerouac's life between September '55 and August '56. At the time, he had a rucksuck full of much praised yet still unpublished writings, and was soon to ride the whirlwind of fame that would be generated by the publication of On The Road. He was also trying to follow the path of Buddhism while shaking the demons of melancholy and booze, at a time when cocktails were served at business lunches and few in America had ever heard of \\"Zen,\\" let alone the Dalai Lama.There's not much to the plot: Ray Smith (standing in for Kerouac) visits his pals Japhy Ryder (poet Gary Snyder) and Alvah Goldbrook (poet Allen Ginsberg) in Berkeley, bounds up Matterhorn Peak with Ryder, explores Buddhism, attends a now-legendary San Francisco poetry reading (at the Six Gallery), and generally tries to find new kicks and follow his bliss.As it describes Ray's wanderings, The Dharma Bums is full of optimism and melancholy, and romantic in its own unique way: Goethe meets Han Shan in the land of Eisenhower. It is one of the alcoholic writer's last stabs at breaking through his sadness, trying to step through a door into a new life. He is close to succeeding but for the wine and his unshakable brooding and impracticality. The book swings between \\"wild, yelling, wailing, stomping\\" around with lusty excited optimistic talk and \\"all is emptiness anyway\\" sighs and renunciations. Unfortunately, it is a document of a personal transformation not completed and a last happy season before the storm. In real life, Snyder took off to study in Japan and Kerouac lost his steadying influence, and fame and success would drive the already shy writer further into his bottle.The Dharma Bums has great descriptions of places, attitudes, and people, including a marvelous portrait of the charismatic poet Snyder. The writing has a casual tone, yet is vivid and focused, and startling in its forecasting of cultural things to come. Kerouac was way ahead of his time with his evocation of Buddhism-in-action in '50s tract-home America. And he articulates the discontent of Americans unhappy with their country's prevailing zeitgeist. The character Japhy says, \\"You know when I was a little kid in Oregon I didn't feel that I was an American at all, with all that suburban ideal and sex repression and general dreary newspaper gray censorship of all our real human values.\\"We feel the groundswell of the coming decade: of hippies, sexual liberation, the environmental movement, the Green Party, and college students backpacking through Europe or their own mountains. Japhy adds, \\"I see a vision of a great rucksack revolution, thousands or even millions of young Americans wandering around with rucksacks, going up to the mountains to pray, making children laugh and old men glad, young girls happy and old girls happier....Ray, by God, later on in our future life we can have a fine free-wheeling tribe in these California hills, get girls and have dozens of radiant enlightened brats, live like Indians in hogans and eat berries and buds...East'll meet West anyway.\\"It worked out that way for Gary Snyder (who went off to live in the Sierra Nevada foothills and has had a long career as an accomplished poet, naturalist and professor). It wasn't the path for Kerouac after all, yet his visions, wanderings and electric prose in The Dharma Bums, On The Road and other books have inspired millions of readers all over the world."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"I enjoyed this novel. It seems very much a story of ideas rather than a conventional story with a plot. While I'd heard of this book, it was interesting to finally read 47 years after publication. The description of wilderness and hiking was exceptionally well done. I found some of the Buddhist levels confusing because they were unfamiliar to me. But I appreciated the idea of \\"emptiness.\\" To have a way of observing life and appreciating its beauty as well as its pain creates a context from which experience can be treasured for its cosmic connectedness, even as it zooms by for we humans with a lightning-fast pace. I was unaware that part of the novel was set in North Carolina. It added immediacy for me to the story. I could readily relate to the pine forests of our lovely state and Ray's family's attitudes. The two main characters of Ray & Japhy were interesting foils. Ray's search seemed to bring him satisfaction. Japhy's exit to Japan left the ending chapters on Desolation Mountain with Ray's solitary search more reflections than a traditional conclusion of a plot. The book breezes by with fewer than 200 pages and immerses you totally in a non-materialistic value system which was a refreshing place to visit. Happy trails!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"This is the book that lured me into the world of kerouac. I had previously read &quot;On the Road,&quot; which was excellent, but I feel no match for &quot;the Dharma Bums.&quot; This book changed my life. It changed the way that i thought. Kerouac introduces the reader to his experiences and beliefs through his novels; they are mostly semi-autobiographical. Before this novel consumed me, i had no notion of Buddhism. In retrospect this has been the single most influential thing that I have been exposed to. This book is just a starting point for a Kerouac fan. I recommend that you follow this book with Kerouac's &quot;Desolation Angels.&quot; Simple, and yet so satisfying literature. I have not really encountered any other writers who are so beloved, so beautiful and poetic in few and simple jazz talk and random amusing European literary name dropping. Pick this one up, maybe it will change your life too!"},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Kerouac is now the book that should be in the hands of all the youth that want to have an orientation on life.

Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; soars as high as &quot;Big Sur&quot; dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"While &quot;On the Road&quot; remains the quintessential Kerouac, &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; at times reaches even loftier heights of spontaneous prose brilliance. Simply put, this book is kicking. It sometimes explodes with lyrical fireworks; other times it slinkily floats with the ease of cool jazz. A must-read for Beatniks who've discovered Jacky's brilliance, or those just looking for a little literary buzz."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Many fans of Kerouac adore On the Road, but feel that it's missing something. On the Road lacks a certain sensitivity and does not give enough credit to the potential of human interaction.

This novel stirred up some very powerful emotions inside of me such as living life how I want to live it, not how everybody else wants me to live it (Up to this point in my life I am not sure I have been doing that).

Beautiful nievity and un-understood wisdom. For anyone on a path of couriosity and truth. For more on Zen try looking up Robert Pirsig."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Keroauc's 1959 novel THE DHARMA BUMS is a lightly fictionalized account of the author's friendship with the poet Gary Snyder among an underground literary scene fascinated with Buddhism.In the mid-Fifties, the nomadic writer Ray Smith comes to San Francisco and meets the Buddhist hipster Japhy Ryder. Their backgrounds could not be more different, as Smith is an alcoholic, urban East Coast figure while Ryder grew up in the forests of the Northwest and finds his highs in nature. Ryder introduces Smith to mountain climbing and wilderness survival, a more rigorous study of Buddhism than just a few pithy tropes, and a sexual openness that looks forward to the late 1960s. As much as Smith appreciates Ryder's example, he is reluctant to adopt more from Buddhism than what he can reconcile with his deep (albeit troubled) Catholicism, and his alcoholism persists through the novel in a poignant way.The novel is written in Kerouac's characteristic \\"spontaneous prose\\", a rambling, somewhat zany way of storytelling that eschews cautious rewriting or editing. I must admit I don't care much for Kerouac's style. Furthermore, the dramatic flow of the book isn't particularly compelling until the last ten pages or so, where Smith takes Ryder's advice and spends a summer in mountain solitude as a fire lookout in Washington.For me the book's interest lies in its documentation of a certain Zeitgeist. The Beats had become mad about Buddhism, but with decades of hindsight, one can see how -- as much as they filled their conversations with koans and exhortations to mindfullness -- most of them greatly misunderstood various schools of Buddhism. As a more or less full-time hitchhiker, I enjoyed Kerouac's detailed accounts of 1950s hitchhiking and train hopping, and you can still glean practical advice from the book that is useful today."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac ***1/2Both uplifting and boring. Kerouac's Dharma Bums was always one of his novels that depending on my current state I either like it or was bored. Reading this on a plane ride to Los Angeles, California it left me cold.As always the book feels positive and is writing with excellent style, passion, and literary craftsmanship. It is inspiring and refreshing to read a piece about someone in search of bettering their spirituality while still being able to not pass judgement on others.That is all great, but honestly this lags. The extent of detail placed on minor things that really don't effect the plot by any stretch create boring passages. This is the only Kerouac that ever bored me and it bores me to no extent.While he wrote from his own experiences it seems to me that he sometimes became lost in something that was really only interesting to him at the time. As honest and heartfelt as that is that doesn't make it any more entertaining."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"Jack Kerouac is one of those artists, musicians, or writers who I get really into for a while, then don't occupy my time with their works, but always come back to them at some point. I read On the Road around 6-7 years ago and afterward quickly read Big Sur and Visions of Girard. Over the past few years though, I thought maybe I had grown out of him. So when my Dad recently gave me a City Lights gift certificate for Christmas, I made a mental note that I'd like to see if I still liked Jack Kerouac or not. I found a neat copy of The Dharma Bums that I had never seen before, so I grabbed it.Dharma Bums is my favorite Kerouac book so far. As with On the Road, I found his writing to be very evocative; scenery, places, but especially the people Jack comes across in his adventures really come to life. As with his other works, Kerouac calls refers to himself by another name, and in The Dharma Bums he is known as Ray Snyder. The other protagonist is Zen poet Gary Snyder, or Japhy Ryder as he is known here. Dharma Bums starts off \\"Ray\\" and \\"Japhy\\" and friends hanging out in the Bay Area, and recounts the now-legendary night Allen Ginsburg first recited \\"Howl\\" during the heyday of the \\"San Francisco Renaissance.\\" He also briefly goes over an odd sort of orgy at Japhy's Berkeley house, where all Ray felt comfortable doing was licking some girl's elbows and arms. I have to admit I had just come home from a happy hour when I read the first 30 pages, so that part is kind of fuzzy in my memory.Following this, the book recalls their trip up the Matterhorn, a large mountain in California's Sierra Nevada mountain range. This was the highlight of the book for me. I felt like I was right there with Ray, Japhy, and their friend Morley who forgot to bring a sleeping bag for the freezing trek, but insisted on bringing an air mattress for him to sleep on. One thing about Kerouac's book is that you can really tell he loves the company of his friends and people he meets on the road. I can't ever recall reading a bad thing about anyone in any of his books. I think a large part of the reason I like reading his books so much is that I appreciate his sincere joy he finds from people and nature. Others might call it navet&eacute;, but bullocks to them.Following the Matterhorn expedition, Ray leaves to visit his Mom in North Carolina. He hops trains, takes the bus, and hitchhikes across the country. There's the guy from Ohio he meets near the Mexican border, and the fun they have when they make an excursion across the border. In North Carolina one gets the sense that Ray isn't appreciated by his family that much. He tries to explain Buddhism and they laugh him off. I couldn't help but feel bad for him. His mom seems nice, but she is never really developed that well.Every day he went into the woods to meditate and cavort with the animals. I think that's probably what I would be doing too.After his return to CA, he is about to take a summer job as a fire lookout in Washington State's Desolation Peak, on Japhy's recommendation. Likewise, Japhy is about to head to Japan to live at a Buddhist monastery. Being Ray and Japhy however, you know there has to be some serious partying before they leave. They are staying in Corte Madera, and there are wild parties every night, usually involving copious amounts of alcohol and people dancing naked. Japhy and Ray sneak out a few days before Japhy is scheduled to leave, and go on a final trek through Marin County wilderness. Japhy leaves and everyone is sad.The final part of TDB is Ray making his way up to Washington. The strangers he meets are usually nice, with the exception of the Oregon cowboy who purposely runs over Ray's hat on the road. He briefly covers his time as a fire lookout, but I'm sure Desolation Angels goes into much more detail. That will be the next Kerouac book I read. There are a lot of Buddhist themes, prayers, and sayings throughout the book (hence the title.) While that might turn some readers off, I enjoyed it. Buddhism is something that has interested me for quite some time. It's sad that Jack didn't find what he was looking for. The bottle turned out to be his salvation - and demise."},{"Title":"The Dharma Bums","review":"The operative word from the title is \\"bums\\".

All that has come before will come again. Whenever we think we've uncovered something new about ourselves or the world, all we need do is look to history to set us straight.Ken Bazyn, editorial director of the Religious Book Club, offers an insightful look at history in The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring. In this readable, yet intricate work, he gives us a literary, religious and philosophical perspective on the seven &quot;perennial&quot; or &quot;root-sins&quot;: pride, envy, anger, avarice (greed), lust, gluttony and sloth (apathy). While the very idea of sin has fallen out of fashion--as pointed out to me by a colleague who once remarked that &quot;sin is a Western concept&quot;--we see it in action every day.Bazyn masterfully examines how writers, theologians and philosophers viewed each perennial sin and its \\"offspring\\" or variation. Each of the seven is at the root of all others. For example, murder is not listed as one of the seven because it is not a root-sin; it may arise from anger or avarice or envy or all seven.As an English major, I appreciated Bazyn's liberal use of literary examples to illustrate the recurring theme. He states at the outset that literature &quot;has a pleasing indirectness that catches us unawares&quot; and that stories help us to &quot;flesh out abstract principles and imprint them on our memories.&quot; Just as Jesus Christ's parables reflected what was in men's hearts, stories can hold up a mirror that reflects our own nature.From such literary characters as Jay Gatsby, Bartleby the Scrivener, Dr. Jekyll, and a host of Biblical figures, Bazyn shows how each perennial sin manifests itself in their tortured lives. He quotes such men as Nietzsche, Kant, St. Augustine and C.S. Lewis, and refers to historical events such as the French Revolution and the Vietnam War to build an overarching theme of how human fallacies plague us all. While Bazyn's book is an excellent study of history and literature, I found myself relishing passages of his own original thoughts and wished he'd used more of a balance in technique.The Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring makes reference to many forgotten stories once read in high school and college, ones that gave us metaphors to &quot;help us cope with life's complexities and contradictions,&quot; Bazyn writes. Public school educators in America would be wise to return to the study of great literature and Western culture. In the twenty-first century, moral relativism has all but eroded the concept of sin. Some redefine it; others deny it. Ken Bazyn reiterates throughout his book that sin is a deep-rooted, unchanging, universal and permanent condition of man. We would do well to call it what it is.King Solomon tells us that no one on earth is free from sin. What, then, is our hope? &quot;Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.&quot; A perennial solution to a perennial problem.2003 La Shawn BarberOriginally published on Townhall.com."},{"Title":"Seven Perennial Sins and Their Offspring","review":"A very well written and insightful book. Bazyn uses an impressive number of examples from the Bible, other sacred texts, and literature, to make his points. Because of this, the book might seem overwhelming to someone who is not well-read. On the other hand, Bazyn's writing is accessible and easy to understand. The book offers good and practical advice for living a better life.

Each woman has a complete biography that includes the films she was in, the magazines she appeared in, and any other relevant media in which one might be interested. The author has even gone to the trouble of letting you know who was still alive at the time of printing which is something I always wonder about when I'm reading up on famous faces of the past.

The book is very beautiful and quite informative."},{"Title":"Va Va Voom!: Bombshells, Pin-Ups, Sexpots and Glamour Girls","review":"Being 41 years old now, I missed the majority of these women when they were in their heyday.

Nice reference book with detailed biographies. I recommend this highly. It's a classy and well done."},{"Title":"Va Va Voom!: Bombshells, Pin-Ups, Sexpots and Glamour Girls","review":"Few have covered the era of the pin-up as interestingly as Steve Sullivan. Thisbook puts a history and personality behind some of the classic glamour girls of the50s and 60s. He covers everyone from movie bombshells, to pin-up models, to theburlesque performers. Each featured woman has an in-depth biography as well asa sizeable list of their film and pictorial career. The women with the largest amountof ink devoted to them are Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page and Jayne Mansfield. Otherwomen featured in this book include Mamie Van Doren (the cover girl), JulieNewmar, Bunny Yeager, Sophia Loren, Tempest Storm, Lil St. Cyr and BrigitteBardot.The Jayne Mansfield chapter:First of all this is a good introduction to Jayne for the new Jayne fan. Despite littleinaccuracies such as the wrong birthday, the misspelling of Jayne's middle name(it's JaYne not Jane, I have a copy of her birth certificate) and confusion around thetype of bathing suit(s) she wore to the Underwater! premiere, this is a decentbiography. Where we seem to get off track in the bio, as well as the bios of themany other women in the book, is that the author becomes annoying andredundant when trying to decipher 'why' Jayne or the subject was famous. Thebook is also rather self righteous with it's findings of supposed surveys ofinternational cinema and glamour girl fans. Indeed, this is something thewriter--Mr. Sullivan seems to be partly obsessed with is surveys. He runs severalYAHOO! groups where he does nothing but run surveys of famous women.Supposedly he is compiling information for another book. We'll see. But back toTHIS book, written by an obviously straight man, we are forced to sit throughparagraphs and paragraphs of ink concentrating on Jayne's breast size incomparison to the sizes of other female stars. It gets boring and at times, almostgoes off track. I suppose we had the Martha Saxton women's lib fodder in herbook, and 20 years later we have Steve Sullivan's T&A; fodder. Those are my maincomplaints about the Jayne chapter. Otherwise, it IS a decent biography on Jayneby a straight male fan who truly seems to 'get' her. The Jayne chapter IS filled witha delight--some rare quotes. The author must have done some extensive researchbecause they are at times new to even me! There is a particularly extensiveoverview of Jayne's early modeling years. Jayne's early years can be confusingand the author does a good job of time and placing things. There is a filmographyincluded and some great shots of the glamazon Jayne, with the focus being on the50s. All in all...pretty good Jayne bio and a treat for fans of all bombshells."},{"Title":"Va Va Voom!: Bombshells, Pin-Ups, Sexpots and Glamour Girls","review":"Well written, fun to read and great pictures.

All the greats are in here."},{"Title":"Va Va Voom!: Bombshells, Pin-Ups, Sexpots and Glamour Girls","review":"Like the internet (and long before it) VaVaVa Voom is one of the main catalyst for the explosive and lucrative pin up and burlesque revival. By collating all the great all natural beauties (no fake boobs and tans here) and including wonderful interviews, Sullivan kicked off a phenomenon. The book has never been remotely equalled in any form. May be hard on some to realize that women were once this perfectly hourglass and naturally 'buxotic' as we see so many masculine and skinny types today as \\"glamour Queens\\" and worse, tons of pathetic imitators of many of these greats especially Bettie Page. (Sorry, Dita Von Teese's narrow hips and schnieds just don't cut it....)

Excellent photos accompinied by informative biographies of each of these women. For those who remember the thrill of seeing a scantily clad and partially nude woman, this is such a book. The book stands out the most by describing how many of these women struggled to do well in their profession, whether trying to be taken seriously in Hollywood, spending their own money on costumes and props for their acts, and how in some cases they are disregarded by the powers that be after a certian age. Well written and very informative.I found the most fascinating subjects to be Lili St. Cyr, Jayne Mansfield, and Tempest Storm. The way they presented themselves and were confident with their own identity, and not feigning indignity about how they were viewed by their fans. These women were truly feminine, and pioneering about the nature of their sexuality during times that supressed such open displays of a sexual nature. Most important, many of these women had fun with their perceptions as sex symbols of their day and made the most of them without the \\"diva\\" antics and nonsense displayed in the entertainment industry nowadays."},{"Title":"Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed)","review":"Here is the thing - I am giving this book a high score (4) since it contains unique and fun content related to network infrastructure attacks and defenses, which I have not seen anywhere else. In my view, the good stuff justifies such score, although I suspect that some other reviewers will sledgehammer the book for having too much of routine material covered in other previous books, including the venerable Hacking Exposed.While I had a general idea of how providers mitigate DDoS attacks, I did not know the specifics of unicast reverse-path forwarding method, described in the book. Similarly, I picked up a lot of material of setting up sinkholes for dropping traffic (and, more specifically, how they are better than ACLs in many cases).From other topics, I liked their coverage on the evolution of DMZ from simple designs of years past to current security zone design.The book also presents a lot of up-to-date material, such as the coverage of security information management (SIM), vulnerability management and recent security standards, such as CVSS. It doesn't go into details in some places where I'd wanted it to, but still is interesting to read.On the other hand, some chapters are disappointing and seem to be in the book for it to appear \\"comprehensive\\". Forensics chapter is one of those (it is also mistakenly called \\"Exploiting Forensics\\", while no exploitation is taking place)I recommend the book for most people, from beginners to advanced, since the former will enjoy the breadth of coverage while the latter will likely benefit from the network infrastructure protection (and devastation, of course!) tips. In addition, defense checklists in the end of each chapter are useful for those who do not have time to go and study the material in-depth. The book is slightly biased towards the defense side, with good coverage of the attacking side as well.Dr Anton Chuvakin, GCIA, GCIH, GCFA is a recognized security expert and book author.

I worked with Brett Watson at a prior place of employment, and I can attest to the fact that he really knows his trade. In the first part of this book, they go into networking and security probably deeper than any other book I've had the opportunity to review. To get the most out of the material, it helps to be firmly grounded in networking technology. If you're not a network administrator or if you're just starting out, you'll probably struggle to keep up. Parts 2 and 3 are also valuable sections. Part 2 continues the in-depth analysis of how best to protect your network from attack, along with software recommendations to implement your security plans. And if you aren't already using a formal methodology to continuously review your network security, Part 3 will help you set up the necessary framework to implement a solid security review. Part 4 probably is the weakest part of the book, in that most of the material is available from multiple other sources, and doesn't necessarily fit into the \\"extreme exploits\\" flavor of the rest of the book. It's good information, to be sure... Just not all that unique or special if you've read more than one other security book.One feature at the end of each chapter stood out and works well... It's a \\"Checklist for Developing Defenses\\" along with a recommended reading list. Using the checklist allows you to make sure you understood what each chapter was getting at, as well as giving you a roadmap for implementing security in the particular area that was just discussed. And if a particular chapter was really applicable to your organization, the follow-up reading can help you get even deeper into the material. Good practical technique for helping the reader move from theory to application...If you have the basics of network security down, it's time to pick up a copy of this book. While you may have to work at understanding the material, it will pay off in a system network that is much more secure than most..."},{"Title":"Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed)","review":"I read Extreme Exploits because the content looked intriguing and I am familiar with applications written by lead author Victor Oppleman. The back cover states the book is \\"packed with never-before-published advanced security techniques,\\" but I disagree with that assessment. While I found all of the content helpful, between 1/3 and 1/2 of it is probably available in older books -- including several by publisher McGraw-Hill/Osborne. Nevertheless, I find the strength of the network infrastructure security sections powerful enough to recommend Extreme Exploits.I found Extreme Exploit's most innovative material in chapter 1 (Internet Infrastructure), 2 (ISP Security Practices), 4 (Reliable Connectivity), 8 (Email Gateways, Filtering, and Redundancy), 10 (Sinkholes and Backscatter, and 14 (Performing the Assessment, Part 1). These chapters introduced projects like RADB, IRRd, INOC-DBA (a VoIP \\"hotline\\" for ISPs), the Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (an anti-spam system), and Hashcash (to consume CPU cycles and frustrate spammers). Subjects like questions to ask ISPs, ways to multi-home, and using anycast to improve redundancy were also welcome. A comment that spammers are using people who register with porn sites to pass CAPTCHA tests really surprised me! Ch 10's coverage of ISP sinkholes was clear, and I learned about triggered blackhole routing. Advice on checking publicly announced routes was cool, especially the reference to the author's Pwhois system.Although the vulnerability and patch management information in ch 12 was fairly routine, I also liked the author's mention of recent industry projects like the NIAC vulnerability lifecycle and Common Vulnerability and Scoring System.Other chapters mainly covered topics found in other books, like Hacking Exposed, Gray Hat Hacking, or Hardening Network Security (all Osborne titles). Most of the book contains sound advice, but I must disagree with several assertions made in ch 7 (Intrusion Detection and Prevention). These include the \\"rejection\\" of the value of passive detection (p 116), the \\"logical transition\\" where detection and prevention converges into firewalls (p 116), the idea that intrusion prevention systems are \\"less prone to insertion and evasion attacks\\" (p 120), and \\"signature-based IDS normally do not have an understanding of the underlying protocol that they are examining and simply perform byte-by-byte pattern matching\\" (p 121).Almost all of the vulnerability assessment material could have been cut, aside from the BGP query and network infrastructure advice in ch 14. The misnamed \\"exploiting digital forensics\\" chapter (16) tempts the reader into thinking it will cover anti-forensics, but really it's an overview of network-, host-, and memory forensics in 26 pages. An excerpt from p 332 summarizes the problem with the chapter: \\"At this point, you might be asking, what do I do with the data?\\" Still, ch 16 deserves an honorable mention for describing multiple tools with which I was not familiar or had only passing familiarity. These included Foremost by Jesse Kornblum and Kris Kendall, Disktype, and Memdump.In terms of structure, I liked the fact that every chapter concluded with a \\"checklist for developing defenses\\" summarizing important points in an actionable format. The writing is always clear, and the diagrams are excellent. Many of the network infrastructure suggestions are supported by command-line syntax and examples, consistent with Osborne's Hacking Exposed style.Overall, I think most everyone will learn something by reading Extreme Exploits. Those with a decent amount of experience or who have read books already mentioned might find some of the book repetitive. Despite this, I learned a lot about network infrastructure and I look forward to reading Victor's upcoming book on \\"Carrier Class Network Security.\\""},{"Title":"Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed)","review":"The book has two major sections: (a) configuration and maintenance practices, and (b) techniques for vulnerability assessment. The breadth of coverage of many modern techniques and terminology is very good; they go in-depth on a few topics here and there.The basic assumption of section (a) is that you're trying to defend against unknown/unfixable threats. This is basically the current (2001-2005-) school of thought on security and leads to default-deny policies. This book has lots of good information on how to implement default-deny. The book convinced me that it's much more difficult than a default-deny firewall rule.The book has many contributing authors; this probably contributes to its strength.Many books are focused on ISPs, or on enterprises (read: \\"windows clients and servers with a firewall\\"), or on software developers, or VoIP carriers. This book has some good material for all of those types.It's written from a Unix perspective. It does have some coverage of analyzing threats to Windows-based systems, but you'll get the most value from the book as an analyst/administrator if you use some sort of Unix. They have a BSD bias.The authors also have an bias towards open-source software.But it's not perfectly integrated, and the organization isn't ideal everywhere. For example, there are two sections of the book that discuss buffer overflows, apparently contributed by two different authors.The index is only minimal; it only covers one of the sections on stack overflows. Bad indexes are a common problem in technical books from some publishers."},{"Title":"Extreme Exploits: Advanced Defenses Against Hardcore Hacks (Hacking Exposed)","review":"First I must admit that I know and have worked with several of the authors of this book. I was given an autographed copy of the book late last year, however seeing as the book was published in 2005 I didn't think there would be much along the lines of useable information seeing as many of the security threats and vulnerabilities have evolved quite a bit since then. However, as I started reading the book I quickly realized much of the information was still relevant today as it was several years ago. The chapters on ISP Security Practices and Securing the Domain Name System had very good coverage of many of the techniques used throughout Service Provider networks to secure their network and DNS infrastructure.I particularly enjoyed reading the sections on using egress packet filters to restrict data leaks from within an organization - a particular problem today with the prevalance of Internet Worms and other Malware which often attempt to communicate back to their centralized Command & Control (C&C;) hosts. The chapter on 'Sinkholes and Backscatter' has very good coverage on a wide variety of topics such as using Darknets and Honeynets to monitor malicious traffic and other nasties emanating throughout your network, as well as using techniques such as Triggered Blackhole Routing to propagate filters quickly and dynamically to drop DDoS and other malevolent traffic.I would have to disagree with Dr. Anton Chuvakin that the chapters on Digital Forensics were disappointing. Personally, I learned quite a bit from these chapters and came away from reading them with a whole arsenal of new tools to use with which I can perform my own digital forensics on compromised systems. The coverage of Foremost, memdump, and some of the advanced digital forensic tools was top notch.All in all, I would say this is still a good book for anyone involved in Network Security. Much of the information covered is still relevant in today's networks. If the authors attempt to release a second edition I would suggest coverage of adapting Triggered Blackhole techniques to be used in more modern DDoS Mitigation scenarios. Additionally, discussion of new techniques used for Malware C&C; and coverage of Fast-flux and Double-flux techniques used by the attackers to create more robust and reliable networks would be welcomed."},{"Title":"Victorian Gothic Designs (International Design Library)","review":"There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are \\"blurry\\" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style."},{"Title":"Victorian Gothic Designs (International Design Library)","review":"Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects."},{"Title":"Lorna Doone;: A romance of Exmoor,","review":"I remember This was a book I had to read for school when I was 11 or so. Usually that meant I was made to read something I really didn't want to. But with this book I found I couldn't stop reading it. I was only suppose to read a chapter at a time but I finished right off. It is at it's core a romantic tale, and being a young boy at the time I would never have picked something described as such. But it goes beyond just a regular romance novel. The story is captivating and the ending will grab you like very few books do."},{"Title":"Lorna Doone;: A romance of Exmoor,","review":"As my title states, this is a classic love story of old England, between a rich young woman, who has been kidnapped as a child by the ruthless Doones, heritage forgotten, and a young farmer, John Ridd, who is as brave as he is good, though perhaps foolish to stand up to the Doones, for the young woman in who's heritage they are planning to cash in on through marrying her to Carver Doone, the most ruthless of them all, who has no intention of letting her get away."},{"Title":"Lorna Doone;: A romance of Exmoor,","review":"When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year.

I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Scary Stories, a book for enthusiastic young readers. A book ofstories collected by Alvin Schwartz. These &quot;Scary Stories&quot;range from classics and myths to newer stories such as &quot;The Hook&quot;.

They sure were scary but not enough to completely get rid of them! I will never buy this version.

The awesome book Scary Stories by Alvin Schwartz. Alvin Schwartz is the scariest author alive, from my point of view. This book is a top 10 rating because the author uses such descriptive words that I had chills running down my spine. Scary Stories is so good that I read it two times just to get every little detail out of all the stories. You should read this book because the stories are so descriptive. Some of them I wouldn&iexcl;t read at night.My example of the theme is the story The Thing. The theme of this story is based on two boys that see a man with dark, ripped, muddy clothes on, in aturnip field. The boys go up to see if it really is a man and &iexcl;K you&iexcl;re going to have to read it to find out the rest.The characters in the story are Ted Martin, Sam Miller, and The Thing. Ted and Sam were good friends. Ted&iexcl;s personality is a mama&iexcl;s boy personality. Sam is the kind of kid that will do anything. It doesn&iexcl;t say much about The Things personality so ill tell you what he looks like. The thing has sunk in eyes, yellow square teeth, rotting flesh, and black pants with black suspenders and a white shirt.The setting is mostly in two places. One is on a fence by a post office. The other setting is in Ted&iexcl;s house hiding and the worst part is that it&iexcl;s dark out and everything gets scarier when it&iexcl;s dark out. Well I think it dose.The story ends by&iexcl;K I don&iexcl;t know you will have to read the story. You have to read this book it is a bone chiller. Remember it&iexcl;s by Alvin Schwartz and it&iexcl;s called Scary Stories. Read it it&iexcl;s a series."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"At the library, I checked out the first book on tape and I loved it!! So then I bought the book and I loved it!!!! I took away one star because the stories wern't the best, but great nontheless! My favorites in this collection are the white wolf, Me Tie Dough-ty walker!, Alligators, A New Horse, The White Satin Evening Gown and High Beams. I think Alvin Schwartz is a talented author and Stephen Gammel is a very talented artist. His drawings honestly should be in a museum. I have read many scary books like these and the writing is horrible and the drawings are too. But Schwartz's style of writing and Gammel's style of illustrations really capture the eeriness of folklore.Bottom line:these books are worth a looksee if you haven't read them yet. Great book, great series!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is a book with some really scary stories. When I started reading this book I could not put it down. I especially liked the story about the Haunted House because it was scary. When I was reading this story I actually felt a chill going down my back. Some of the stories in this book weren't very scary though. Some of the stories are alike. But altogetherthis book was pretty good. Some of the stories are really funny like the Big Toe. This book is filled with short scary stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes or enjoys scary stories. I even recommend this book to people who don't enjoy scary stories very much because this book will make you like scary stories."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This book was so incredibly scary. It could've been just me being scared easily, but they should change the name of tis book to \\"Stories to Scare th Crap out of Kids\\"Seriously."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Scary Story Series4 star ratingThe scary story series by Alvin Schwartz are extreme books that keep you on the edge of your seat. Each book from the series contain many spooky tales that will make you shiver. One of the books from the series is called, \\"Scary Story's to tell in the dark.\\" If you enjoy being frightened or anxious, you should read this book, but if you get scared easily, you may not want to read it. Many of the stories in this book include the dead, blood, noises, and other scary things that may frighten kids under five or sensitive people who get scared greatly. So mainly, you just have to choose to read it based on who you are as a person. If you do like these type of stories, this book is good for halloween parties, camping, sleep-overs, or just for fun when you feel like reading. I really enjoyed this book, you will to."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"PLEASE READ!This collection of folklore is absolutely wonderful. Alvin Schwartz writes in a style that is both easy to read and has a lasting effect that tells the story in a unique way for readers of all ages.But...I am VERY disappointed in the artwork. I have the original copies that were printed in the early 90's with illustrations by Steven Gammell. If you wish to see a some examples of his works, here are some links:[...]I'm not knocking Brett Helquist; his style is well suited for \\"Series of Unfortunate Events\\" but not Alvin Schwartz' \\"Scary Stories\\" collection. Some reviewers wrote that this collection was not scary at all; I beg to differ....The reason the stories are scary is because of the ART! There's the overused saying, \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\" ... that sums up Steven Gammell. I first read these books in third grade and they stuck with me ever since, simply because of the terribly gruesome and disturbing imagery. The stories by themselves are uninteresting and honestly, Brett Helquist's illustrations do not give this book series justice whatsoever!!I also realize that the older copies that have Steven Gammell's illustrations are hard to find here on Amazon. This saddens me... If you happen to find the originals, PLEASE buy them. You won't regret it.See for yourself. You make the judgement call."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive.

Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Because I remember loving and being absolutely terrified at these books when I was a kid, I recently purchased all 3 and just received them today. To my horror (and not in a good way) I found that they've published them with a DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATOR! With all due respect to Mr. Helmquist (the new guy) and certainly to Mr. Schwartz (the original author), these books were made for me by the art of Stephen Gammell. I'm sure they did this because so many parents tried to get the books banned in their day because of the ghastly drawings, but this is really a tragedy.

The pictures are the best Iv'e seen, really, I'm not exaggerating. The way he makes those weird web-like things around the edge of some of the objects make it a lot better for some reason. And the pictures alone would scare the crap out of me. I'm older now, but still, I'm afraid of a few of the pictures. Like the one in &quot;The White Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;One Sunday Morning&quot;, Oh Susannah!&quot;, and &quot;The Red Spot&quot;. I could name more but that would be too much typing. Everytime I look at those pictures I get a chill that stays there till I either cover the picture up, turn the page, or close the book. And the stories are great, all of them are great. My favorites are &quot;The Bed By the Window&quot;, &quot;Something was Wrong&quot;, &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Middle&quot;, and a few others.

Though I did not get the chill I used to, the stories are still excellent! Stephen Gammells illustations are down right eerie, and thats good, for they bring out the true horror in some tales. As a child, I was scared to death of the picture of the skeleton in &quot;The Haunted House&quot;, the scariest thing that ever entered my innocent lil mind LOL. My favorite stories are: &quot;Me-ti-do-tee-Walker&quot;, &quot;Wait til Martin Comes&quot;, &quot;Harold&quot;, and &quot;The Attic&quot;, but I love all of them, &quot;Wait til Martin comes&quot; being my personal favorite.

Although the original is scariest in my opinion, ALL are definitely well worth owning. The book, when I purchased it, had a specified age group suggested for its readers, ages 9 and up. If you feel your child is THAT brave at 9, more power to them. At 10, the stories gave me nightmares, unless I had looked at the illustrations before going to bed.

The 29 macabre stories, poems, and songs are a great introduction to the Horror genre for young readers that will have them literally screaming for more! The incredibly dark and startling illustrations by Stephen Gammell are just as, if not more memorable than the stories themselves. Especially for &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;The Haunted House&quot;, &quot;Wait Till Martin Comes&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost With the Bloody Fingers&quot;.

Together, they evoke the true inner fears of the dark and the world we hope doesn't really exist."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"First off, let me state that I am so glad I am in far into college now. Luckily, I was in 4th grade at the right time I bought this from one of those Scholastic order sheets (remember those?), almost ten years ago before special interest groups got on the &quot;ban everything we deem offensive or intelligent to children&quot; bandwagon.Anyways, I recently found this book in a box of old books and, looking through it, it was just as chilling to the spine now as it was around 8 or so years ago when I was a wee lad. Of course, now I'm 19 and the stories seem sort of not so scary, but that's just my picky-eating with dark literature (being more accustomed to Lovecraft and more sophisticated horror and all that).However, the charcoal drawings are what make this book what it is. Stephen Gammell (does he have an online gallery or a book full of illustrations like this? i'm soon checking!) has done an excellent job at creating immensly subtly-disturbing visuals with his illustration skills that seems to amplify the effect of the otherwise cheesy (but still fun) bonfire horror stories.If the stories don't scare the bejesus out of you, the ghostly apparitions and deformed nightmarish landscapes portrayed within the illustrations will definately make you want to buy several halogen lamps and keep them turned on at night with perhaps a garlic necklace around you when you go to sleep.If I recall, the scariest illustration was a full-page charcoal drawing next to a story called &quot;Oh, Suzannah!&quot;, almost like something weird going on in a parallel supernatural dimension from some mental patient's hallucinatory nightmare.Either way, this book has redeeming qualities for both folk/urban literature enthusiasts as well as dark-fantasy-art enthusiasts. I heavily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"OMG!!! I forgot all about Scary Stories to tell in the Dark! I can't believe that this book is as old as I am!

For young preteens and younger, this will give pleasurable shivers and creepies, and plenty of nightmares. Gives children a reason to read. I've noticed that even young adults enjoy this book; though it is in easy kiddie writing, it is very enjoyable and entertaining. ... i love the pictures.

However, for the more senitive child, it can be very disturbing. A teacher read some of the stories to my 4th grader's class months ago and he is still having trouble sleeping. The pictures are what has bothered him the most. He can't seem to get them off his mind. So, be selective about with whom you share this book.

These are the best collection out there once you are past the \\"easy reader\\" scary stories.

Do note that many stories are very scary/morbid and if your child is easily frightened, wait till they are older."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This is my first experience with Schwartz and the Scary Stories trilogy and I wasn't really sure what to expect as I actually picked this up as part of my reading list off of the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books (from 1990-2000). In some small way, I can see how this book (and the two others) get challenged by parents...there are some gross, gruesome, frightening, and creepy stories in this book...but (you knew it was coming...right) really, what's here, for the most part is pretty tame. For kids 8-12, this might be their first introduction to what (for most older children, adolescents and adults) are pretty standard, traditional campfire stories and urban legends. Further, they are the tamest and least embellished versions I think I've ever seen, so there is little actual gore. Probably the most frightening thing in this book are the illustrations...they are done in a style that is truly evocative of the theme...this is something that I really enjoyed about the book. Each illustration makes you squirm a bit, but then you look back and find yourself looking even more closely to pick out the details of each barely there illustration!There are 29 stores covered in this book, all drawn (as the title indicates) from American Folklore (even some of the more contemporary ones like the hook and high beams), so it's a nice wide swath of scary folklore cut from the cloth of the American oral storytelling. In the first part of the book nearly every tale is by necessity one that should be told out loud around a campfire (as they require screaming, jumping at, or grabbing someone to \\"get them\\" at the end of the story). As the book progresses, more and more of the tales stand alone as reading material...but really each is just a bare-bones minimum of the story without any embellishments and are probably best enjoyed orally (also around a campfire or in a dark room with candles or flashlights) and embellished...having a group of kids take one story each and memorize it and tell it to the group would be a wonderful activity that Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark would lend itself to quite well!Overall, Scary Stores to Tell in the Dark is a fine introduction to the oral tradition of folklore and urban legend. This book would make a fine addition to the library of anyone who regularly deals with kids in groups (particularly outdoors, like boy or girl scouts) and/or for group story telling...this book would provide a wonderful jumping off point for kids to learn a legend, folktale or urban legend well enough to tell out loud without reading and to encourage embellishment or discuss other versions (activity for older kids who are more familiar with the stories given and the many variations that are around). I give it four stars, as the text itself is rather uninspiring as a cover to cover, stand alone read...the illustrations are what saves it from getting three stars and as I said above, it's best use is as an introduction to folklore and/or as a way to increase one's repertoire of stores to frighten children with in those times and places where campfires, candlelight and flashlights rule the darkness!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I bought the paperback \\"boxed set\\" -- I guess it is an 'omnibus' edition -- to add to my story-telling repertoire - my kids and the cub scouts seem to like to hear ghost or scary stories sometimes. Most of them follow the standard formulary. I like the author / collector's notes / bibliography - very helpful as I like to know the origin of the story. It is also very interesting that the same story / theme can be found in many variations from different sources / countries.What I own may be a different version than what is advertised here."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This book would be a great book when your at a sleep over with your friends telling these stories in the dark this book has been divided categories of each stories.

I couldn't sleep after reading it, (complements of Stephen Gammell's illustrations) and immediatly bought the whole series.My favorite story out of the whole series is \\"Harold\\" in Scary Stories 3; I won't ruin the story for you, lets just say you'll never look at a scarecrow the same way again.Also, the notes in the back of the books on the origin of the stories is often as interesting as the stories themselves, as you often get some slight variations.My advice to any horror fan would be to buy this series, no matter your age, I think you'll enjoy them."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Been almost a lifetime since I last even remember the books, but I saw that name and it was so familiar, I had to return and buy all three volumes.The memories were sweet, and chilling.Even after all these years, the illustrations and stpories themselves continue to plague me, from The Wendigo to Cold as Clay.I now share with all my friends the tales that every person who reads them always finds themselves lost in the story, and the disconcerting artwork.If you were to own one collection of scary stories, this is the one. A catalogue of all the best known, and least known tales, and each book never ceases to get better and better with each time you read them.To Quote \\"Shadow of the Vampire\\"I think we have it."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away.

They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations \\"less scary\\". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"First off, I must say that I used to read these books when I was younger (even though I'm still a kid). And the stories in this book are the original great stories, but the ILLUSTRATIONS the best part of the original version, have been CHANGED. That really sucks because the new pictures are so watered down they aren't scary anymore. The new title should be Not Scary Stories to Tell in the dark."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.

Some stories are funny, such as ''The Viper'' (I've come to vipe your vindows) and ''The Ghost With Bloody Fingers'' (cool it dude, get a band-aid) while others are genuinely spooky, like ''The Guests'' and ''Cold as Clay''. The book was clearly intended for reading out loud, many stories even have tips for the reader, such as when to raise and lower your voice. Stephen Gammell's pictures are mysterious and darkly beautiful. I highly recommend this book for those looking for a spooky read aloud."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's \\"Scary Stories For Stormy Nights\\"!

In one of the stories, The Girl who Stood on the Grave, the plot is a girl was given a dollar to prove that if you stand on a grave, then the person who's grave it was wouldn't grab you and pull you under. She was to stick a knife in the grave so her friends know she was there. She put the knife through the grave, and tried to get away, but she that she was being held back, and she died of fright. The setting is at a graveyard at night. The conflict is that the girl tried to prove the fact that if you stand on a grave at night, then the person under it will pull you in wrong. It wasn't resolved, but the girl died of fright because she thought she was being pulled under, when she had just put the knfe through her dress on accident."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This book is the best book ive read in my entire life.

I don't know about recommending this book to youngsters because it does have some very eerie illusions and spooky tales in it. However, as an 18 year old reviewer, this book rocks! It really does come in handy at sleep overs, camps, and on Halloween nights. It gives me the chills even after all these years and I can't get enough of it. I would recommend this book to younger teenagers and adults who like this sort of thing. It's cool! And what else can I say? The title of the book says it all: SCARY STORIES TO TELL IN THE DARK."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This, along with the other two books in the series, is a classic. Alvin Schwartz's tales are so simple yet so deviously scary, and Gammell's dark, surreal illustrations greatly enhance them. Actually, some of the illustrations are midly disturbing...(what IS that thing coming up the stairs in &quot;The Voice&quot;?) Once you've read at least a couple of them, you'll start to realize just how scary the world is...(for instance, &quot;The Girl who Stood on a Grave&quot;, &quot;The Red Spot&quot;, and &quot;No Thanks&quot;). So give them a try...you won't be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I am 23 years old, and was introduced to this fine series of books a little over ten years ago. Although my personal favourite is &quot;More Scary Stories...&quot;, still, I cannot discredit this fine work. The scares in this book will linger well upon first reading, and are chillingly simplistic. From tales of revenge, love and humour, this collection is the perfect gift for any child OVER the age of ten (due to some impressively graphic material). As for the book's impressionist illustrations, this book along with the sequels, deserves praise and accolades for its ominous depictions of evil, courtesy of Stephen Gammel. It astounds me how craftily he mutates the ordinary into something far more sinister (refer to his gruesome portrayal of a wedding dress for proof). To sum: a children horror masterpiece."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"When I was in elementary school, in the years between 1993 and 1995, when I was in grades 3-5, you were a loser if you hadn't read these books. Every single person I knew loved them and they were among my favorites. They were, that is, until my best friend came over to spend the night one night at the end of the fifth grade. She took one look at one of Stephen Gammell's gloriously horrific illustrations and threw the book down in disgust. She was scared to death and after about 5 minutes, I was as well. We shoved them under the couch cushions and had to watch 'The Flintstones' to calm down. I never looked back at them after that and sold them at our garage sale the next year to the neighbor-boy across the street. I didn't think of them again until mid-September of this year. I saw one of them at a used bookstore but didn't buy it because it was in horrible condition. I regret getting rid of these wonderful books and will be spending some time buying them back. I recommend them to anyone on the face of this earth. I can almost guarantee that you will love them."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"i give this book 5 stars because it is scary ot tell in the dark no wonder thay say that on the book cover!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and i give this book 5 stars because there is alot of stories to tell in the book and you can read them again and again thats why i am giving this book 5 stars!!!!!!!! you should read it its scary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sincerley lorie waterist."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"i love that book it my forvite and ilove your books alot and thank you for ever thing"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!!

It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"The first book I read out of the three in the series was \\"More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,\\" but this is my favorite one by far. No other scary story book(s) alive will EVER compete with this one and its two other sequels. Like almost everyone has said, it's not so much the stories that make this one and it's counterparts scary, it's the damn illustrations! Now let me tell you, Alvin Schwartz does do a very good job of putting stories of old folklore together with a couple of his own stories that he made up himself, but without the help of Stephen Gammel I highly doubt this book (and the other ones) would be so popular. These books are definitely not for the little ones, well maybe they would be if you don't show them the illustrations because there's a VERY good chance they will have nightmares. I swear though if I could draw and paint like Gammel does I would be a happy man, that's for sure! Anyhoo, let me get to the part of where I tell you why this book is my favorite. Not only does it have the best stories in it (in my opinion anyways) but out of the entire series this one has the most unbelieveably nightmarish drawings. \\"The Thing\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"The Haunted House\\" are VERY good examples! \\"The Thing\\"'s illustration is pretty scary but while reading \\"The Haunted House,\\" I have to put a piece of paper over the illustration to cover it up while reading the story itself, it's that bad trust me. Overall, while I wish very badly that Alvin and Stephen would collaborate again to make more of these books (and I don't think they will, tis very sad) I am glad I have all three of these books, they are well worth the price. However I very rarely read them anymore, it's not like I'm tired of them or anything it's cuz they're too damn scary! I just read all of them yesterday and I predict it's gonna be another 3 years or so before I read them again. That being said, if you don't buy all 3 of these books ..., plain and simple."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I read these books (all three of them) when I was in third grade. They were so popular at my school, the library had 4 copies of each book, and you still had to put your name on a waiting list. The first time i read them, I was totally freaked out (Steven Gammell's illustrations added imensly to the horror that Schwartz weaved), I remember not sleeping well the first night after I read them. Its now 8 years later (I'm a senior in high school) and I had completly forgotten that they existed. I stumbled upon them when I was searching for Stephen King (I've always been a fan of the horror genre) and ordered all three of them. If you're into fokelore and scary stories, these three books (Scary Stories, More Scary Stories and Scary Stories 3) are all must-haves in your collection. Enjoy, they're WICKED &lt;pun intended&gt; good :)"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Ever since I was very young, I adored ghost stories and when I was in first grade my father used to take me to the local library every Wendsday night. The librarian knew I was fond of scary books, and recommended we check this book out and read it.The instant we got home, I begged my father to read the book to me. He agreed, and read the whole thing. It scared me a little, but I loved the stories in this book very much. The illustrations are beautiful, despite being very gloomy- like something Tim Burton would draw. The best stories in this book are the following:THE GUESTS: A newlywed couple get a late start, and end up renting a room in the house of an elderly couple. The next morning they leave and go out to breakfast. There they discover that their hosts had died in a fire years before...HIGH BEAMS: A high-school girl finds out a murderer is lurking in her backseat.THE HAUNTED HOUSE: A priest goes to put a ghost to rest, only to discover the truth behind the ghosts' tragic tale...I would say that children ages 7-12 should read this. Any younger can become scared by the stories, and illustrations. But if younger children are mature enough, they can handle this book. BUY IT!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"First of all, at 14 years old, I have never been the most courageous of all, especially when it comes to ghost stories and psychological fear, the fear that lurks in your head; I have ALWAYS possessed that peculiar human craving to be scared out of my wits by a good ghost story, but like the human I am, have more often than not chickened out before getting to the \\"punchline\\" of the tale.One day in 5th grade, that craving devoured my hesitation and, like a magnet, I was drawn to pick up \\"Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark\\" from my teacher's bookshelf, a book that I had never heard of until then. But oh, it has remained tatooed to my memory since that cold winter day in 5th grade.Yes, I know it sounds pretty wussy-ish to be so creeped out by a storybook (especially now that I'm 14), and maybe that's just me, but that is how undeniably weird an experience it was to read that book. And my judgement of the book is not by any means negative; I commend the author for the outstandingly professional story-telling method with which he has compiled these already-chilling urban myths. None of the stories I remember were flat-out, in-your face, machete-slashing gore fests, but on the contrary were subtle enough to let my imagination soar, and the imagination is really what can drive you insane. Mr. Schwartz handled that part masterfully, no questions asked.But (and I say this with a chuckle for those who have yet to open this book), if Alvin Schwartz's storytelling doesn't whet your ghostly appetite, the illustrations by Mr. Stephen Gammell will gorge you. They, without a shadow of a doubt, are what gripped me and forced me to continue reading, just because of how bizzarely shocking they are. I remember extremely clearly sitting in my desk, in the center of the classroom, 23 cheerful kids all around me, and a teacher sitting at the front desk--and I still shivered the entire time. I remember having to fold the book back while reading \\"The Thing\\" so as not to stare at that horrible, smiling corpse staring back at me. And I remember to this day jumping startled when I turned the page to view the menacing two-page illustration for \\"The White Wolf.\\" Even a humorous, light-hearted joke/story like \\"The Viper\\" made me shift in my seat a little simply because of the bizarre gothic-theme picture next to it. It is quite obvious that these stark, ghostly black n white drawings were a labor of love for Mr. Gammell, and I can picture him giggling devilishly as he imagined his viewers' reactions. Believe me folks, if the stories don't do it for ya, these darn pictures will assuredly hit the spot dead center.As I have stated, although this book did indeed make me a little bit more quiet for a few days following its reading, my opinion is not negative, obviously, or it wouldn't have recieved 5 stars; I relished this book, and still relish it. It is quite a masterpiece in its genre, and I applaud the writer and illustrator for compiling such a chiller. It's one of those books that'll make you want to leave the light on when you go to bed, or not go to bed at all with the possibility of encountering nightmares. It really plays on the imagination of the human being, and fully alerts and engages that imagination, in such a way that the only words I can think of to describe it are \\"pretty darn creepy\\".Very highly reccomended to anyone who has that craving for a good ol' fashioned shiver, and I'm sure it would prove itself undoubtedly worthy especially during events such as sleepovers and camp-outs. This is the psychological stuff that makes Freddy and Jason look like Billy and Mandy."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This is the greatest collection of scary stories for kids and pre teens ever. I have collected many scary stories books through out my childhood and this is the only one whos storys have actually stuck with me and the only ones i can remember. Every book in the series , this one , more scary storys to tell in the dark and scary stories 3 are all good. The storys were so creepy i can still remember them to this day and i have recently got the other scary stories books so i can see if they were as good as i remember and they are. I first got this book when i was about 10 years old and lost it over the years then i re ordered a copy and the stories still have same effect and value as i remember. They have great illustrations and even some songs in a couple of the books. I used to stay up at night and read this with my friend and we would read the stories to eachother , i was so excited cause the book was so good and most of the stories gave me chills and i was not one to scare easy. For 6 bucks this is well worth it and the memories and storys will last forever."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I don't know where to begin, these books have been such a huge part of my life! I remember discovering these when i was in 3rd grade, in 1993. I was truly obsessed, when friends would come over I would just read, read, read out loud to them, some of them scared to death by the stories, others mesmerized by the awesome illustrations (thank you steven gammell!) I still talk about them till this day (im a junior in high school) its been 8 years and I have still not forgotten these books. Alot of the stories live on in my mind, &quot;The big toe,&quot; or &quot;Bloody Fingers&quot; (COOL IT MAN, GET A BANDAID!) ahhaha I lovem! I recommend this book to every living soul on the face of this planet, go out and buy all three! (More scary s's is the best, i think) I LOVE THESE BOOKS!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the \\"super creepy\\" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I purchased this book as one that I fondly remembered from childhood. I don't know for certain how many times my brother and I checked this out from the public library, but it was a lot. The stories in it are fun and the artwork is fantastic. As a matter of fact, even though I remember most of the stories from reading them before, it's the artwork that lodged this book into my head so firmly. Although all black and white, the images are spooky and gruesome. Exactly what an impressionable pre-teen needs to be sufficiently creeped out!The stories themselves are usually 1 to 2 pages each and are still fun. While they wouldn't scare the bejeepers out of me today, I can see why I was drawn to them as a child. The last section of stories is also fun as they are in the same line as the spooky tales, but are intended to be humorous and silly.All in all this is a fun book for kids of all ages and I really was glad that I went ahead and purchased one of my childhood favorites."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I chose this book because I think its one of the best books I've read because it's funny and scary. The author's name is Alvin Schwartz. He has written Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and Scary Stories: 3 More Tales to Chill You're Bones. I've read each of them at least three times. I think you should read this book and hopefully you'll like it as much as I do. It has a lot of short and scary stories. It is one of those books you never get bored of.by Alexandra"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these \\"Scary Stories\\" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Beware, any of you who have fond memories of this book from when you were a child. Most of you remember sitting down in some darkened corner of the library, daring yourself to turn the page and see what horrors awaited you. Most of you peeked a little at the illustrations through your fingers and felt that rush of meeting your worst nightmare.To this day, the truly special part of Schwartz's \\"Scary Stories\\" series has not been the tales, but the wonderful, horrifying illustrations by Gammell. Schwartz's collection, while he put obvious effort into retelling these stories for a children's audience, cannot by themselves evoke a feeling of dread or horror. If anything, they are comic horror, often ending in a punchline. If anything, the stories are a good introduction for black humor for children. But this is not what makes a classic.This means that the reason this book has survived and been wildly popular for so many years is probably not its stories, but something else. As many reviews have pointed out, that something is those Gammell illustrations. The rotting corpses. The shambling undead. Even the smiling, friendly \\"viper,\\" who is actually pretty benign in the story, but has something... sinister nonetheless. Gammell's illustrations are so horrifying, that when I read this as a child, I could not help but imagine them... animated and moving around. In my nightmares. The best nightmares that make you love that feeling of being scared.But, as everyone knows, the only reason people have nostalgia is because they want to see something new. N0obody passes anything down to their kids, because the new versions are always better. Fond memories are made even better by completely replacing them with something more modern.EXCEPT THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT. I hunt down the same editions of Sweet Valley High and Nancy Drew that I remember from when I was a kid. I treasure the old bindings on my mother's passed-down copies of Winnie-The-Pooh with the Shephard illustrations, as I am sure those who grew up with the Disney Pooh have transferred that love to their children. So why on earth would a publisher change these wonderful illustrations for ones that, while technically very good, fit more in line with the budget-Victorian-horror craze of \\"show everything exactly as it is happening in one scene, and leave nothing to the imagination, and don't make it gross or anything\\"? Even worse, why would they change something so iconic about the childhood horror experience in the 1980s and then continue to call it a \\"classic\\"? And why would they change these illustrations when children are even more eager for strong visuals than they were in my time? I cannot imagine a single logical line of reasoning for this decision.You're better off hunting down used copies with the Gammell illustrations. These new illustrations take all of the impact out of the stories too, and this book as it now stands will not inspire a love of the macabre in any child. Now, it's utterly forgettable like any other dusty book of tall tales on the library shelf, and that makes me sad. Scary Stories dared children to confront the emotion of fear itself. Had it been left alone and simply reissued, today it would be a wonderful antidote to widespread coddling and the sterility of so much of modern children's publishing (Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket being two wonderful exceptions)."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"It's great to see this in print again, but I was aghast when I opened it to find the original Stephen Gammel illustrations missing. Most of my friends read these books as children, and we all remembered the delightfully creepy illustrations long after we had forgotten the stories themselves. Gammel's artwork often broke the fourth wall and put the reader right into the story, so that YOU were walking down a lonely road beside a shadowing figure, and the skeletal haunt was coming straight at YOU. Brett Helquist is an excellent artist, and his drawings are nice, but they are simply ordinary illustrations. This new edition of Scary Stories is just that, ordinary. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark is no longer an iconic book that will always, always be checked out of the school library and remembered for decades by every young reader. It will no longer lead to a lifelong appreciation for certain genres of artwork. It's just a regular book of ghost stories that can easily forgotten as soon as the last page is turned."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Stephen Gammell's amazing and terrifying art --the most memorable part of this series-- has been stripped and replaced with generic art by Brett Helquist in this edition."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else. The new artwork is generic Harry Potter-esque and has none of the unadulterated creepiness the original one had. Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Replacing Stephen Gammell's wonderful artwork is blasphemy to this iconic and nostalgic series of books. Anyone who read these books as a child knows that, even though the stories are great, the artwork is what kept you up at night. I know that soccer moms who believe that their children are porcelain statues that must not be harmed might not realize this, but being scared is NOT a bad a thing.Without Gammell's amazing artwork, these collections of stories are useless. It's the same as reading 'The Cat and the Hat' with different illustrations. It's just doesn't work. That being said, Helquist (the illustrator of these copies) is still a great artist, but he has nothing on Gammell's thirty years of impact on children and adults alike.Please, if you are new to these books, do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this version. Please search for the original copies and purchase them. Anyone who purchases these copies is just falling into the horrible sell-out of the publishing company. If there's any hope at all, the original copies will be reprinted once again alongside of these. If not, I really feel sorry for future generations."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I used to love these books as a child, they were creepy and surreal and most of that was due to the illustrations by Stephen Gammell. I can picture some of the drawings and they are STILL creepy. WHY mess with perfection? It was a perfect one-two punch of story and picture, and now they look pretty generic. Not NEARLY macabre enough.

Do you believe in ghosts and do you like hunting? Well then next time you go hunting watch out for the Wendigo. He'll call your name and you'll start going crazy and then he gets you! Do you like visiting haunted houses? Well next time don't go to one with a chimney and don't go with your dog because Me Tie Doughty walker will get you and your dog will die of fright.

This report was by Marco, Tyler, and Justin."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Forget Alvin Schwartz!!! The stories in these books are merely collected from folklore. They're nothing but old campfire tales. They are told in a very basic format that didn't invoke any feelings of fear in my little 12 year old mind back in good old '92. Hey, I even think there was some sort of appendix in the back that provided more real-world explainations of some of the stories or where the old folklore came from. H.P. Lovecraft said that the greatest fear is fear of the unknown. I'll say that the stories alone would have given these books maybe three stars. It's the pictures. They are so beautifully crafted and surreal. You can't quite make out the details, yet at the same time, everything that is rotten or dilapidated stands out right away. I have never seen the style anywhere else, not in any art book, not in any museum, not in any history book, nothing!!! Stephen Gammell is truly an artist. I don't care about all those artists that slap a bunch of shapes together and then give it some fancy name. So the style's original, but TRUE art is what envokes real EMOTIONS in us, whether it's music, movies, or pictures. Music is often celebrated for its technical complexity. Well that is worthless if I don't FEEL anything when I listen!! It's the same with these pictures. I could look at Picasso all day and not feel a thing, but all I have to do is pick up one of these three books without even reading the stories and I already know great art when I see it. Contained within these volumns is a world where the eyeless, skinless dead emerge from the night-mist half-rotten with long hair flying. Even the living people in these pictures look diseased. Even now, the pictures in these books make me afraid to be alone. Never in my life have I experienced such gripping trepidation. Have you ever SMELLED fear? It's like old copper. Bow down to the all-powerful Stephen Gammell. Actually, I will say that there are some stories that do scare me without the aid of the pictures. There is one in the first book about heads falling down the chimney. You hear a voice approaching in the woods, and then down it comes. The Window in the second book has gotten me afraid of dark windows at night, and the picture to that one? Oh boy, weeeeeee!!!!!!! All in all, get this book for the sheer art contained therein. Warning though: 9 years old is too young. The pictures present a problem, because since they are in a book written for children, they could be classified as child-abuse."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I first read these books when they were originally published, in 1986, when I was 13. The stories are mostly folklore, which I was familiar with, but the pictures added a new, grisly dimension of horror. I recently dug the books out of storage, and at 25, I still find them incredibly creepy! I think perhaps the age range is a bit low--the drawings are quite graphic in their depiction of rotting corpses and strange, amorphous beings floting through the night--but still, they are wonderful little books for a budding horror enthusiast like I was! I think, however, they'll be packed away until my 20 month old girl is about 14 years old...."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's.

I wouldn't, but reading about it is fun. If you are a enthusiastic reader you might never get a chance to put it down. This book is full of fantasy and legends that have been passed down for years, but some of them are from recent times. A haunt, a man that is killed by a white wolf, and a priest in a church full of living dead. My personal favorite story is The Window.

Then later in the night the creature returns and closer, Megan wants to run but is afraid it will break in before she could escape. She goes back to sleep again.

Then a butcher says he will help get rid of the sheep even though he has retired from hunting. I will not tell you any more of the story, you will just have to read it.

This story has an alternate ending. 2.) \\"The Walk\\" - two men walking down the same road at night fear each other. 3.) \\"What Do You Come For?\\" - a lonely old woman wishes for company. 4.) \\"Me Tie Dough-ty Walker!\\" - a boy and his singing dog spend the night in a haunted house. (I really didn't understand this one.) 5.) A poem about \\"A Man Who Live in Leeds\\". \\"Some say this rhyme doesn't mean anything\\"--and they're right. 6.) \\"Old Woman All Skin and Bone\\" - a song with music notes about an old woman, a preacher, and the topic of death. 7.) \\"The Thing\\" - two friends are approached by a skeleton being, which results in one of their deaths a short time later. 8.) \\"Cold As Clay\\" - a farmer tries to keep his daughter away from her boyfriend, yet they can't be separated, even by death. This has a good creepy ending and is one of my favorite stories in this book. 9.) \\"The White Wolf\\" - a prosperous wolf hunter searches for an elusive white wolf. 10.) \\"The Haunted House\\" - a preacher tries to put a young woman's ghost to rest by seeking her killer. 11.) \\"The Guests\\" - a husband and wife spend the night in a house that doesn't exist. 12.) \\"The Hearse Song\\" - a [upset] song (with music notes) about the process of decomposition (\\"the worms crawl in, the worms crawl out\\"). 13.) \\"The Girl Who Stood On a Grave\\" - as a bet, a young girl must find a grave to stand on and then place a knife in the earth--only she never leaves the graveyard. 14.) \\"A New Horse\\" - a witch turns a farm hand into a horse, except her spell backfires on her in the end. 15.) \\"Alligators\\" - a woman fears her husband and two sons are turning into alligators. 16.) \\"Room For One More\\" - a man is approached by a stranger who drives a hearse. 17.) \\"The Wendigo\\" - a hunter and his Indian guide travel into the woods, but only one survives the fatal trip. 18.) \\"The Dead Man's Brains\\" - this one is not a story, so much as an idea for Halloween: use various ingredients (such as a peeled tomato and grapes, cooked spaghetti noodles, etc.) to represent a dead man's body parts. 19.) \\"May I Carry Your Basket?\\" - a young boy offers to carry an old woman's basket, unaware of what's inside. 20.) \\"The Hook\\" - a popular tale of a prison escapee with a hook for a hand and a young couple out on a date. 21.) \\"The White Satin Evening Gown\\" - a young woman attends her last formal dance when she rents a beautiful dress with a deadly past. 22.) \\"High Beams\\" - another popular story; this one is about a young woman who is tailgated by an erratic driver. 23.) \\"The Babysitter\\" - a baby-sitter receives several anonymous phone calls from a killer in the upstairs room of the house. 24.) \\"The Viper\\" - similar to the previous story, a widow receives a few phone calls from a man with a speech impediment. 25.) \\"The Attic\\" - a man searches for his dog in the attic of his house. 26.) \\"The Slithery-Dee\\" - a short poem about a sea creature that eats everyone but \\"me\\". 27.) \\"Aaron Kelly's Bones\\" - a dead man returns from the grave, ruining his wife's chance at marrying again. 28.) \\"Wait till Martin Comes\\" - a man seeks shelter in a house that is occupied by a couple of suspicious cats. 29.) \\"The Ghost With the Bloody Fingers\\" - a funny finale about a musician, a ghost, and some much-needed Band-Aids.There's not a lot of conflict or plot in some of these stories, but most of them serve their purpose: to [upset] out and scare kids (age 9 and up). Although the stories alone aren't entirely terrifying, the creepy, dripping illustrations by Stephen Gammell do the trick. \\"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\\" is ideal to be told in a group, but these stories are fine to be read alone, but preferably in the dark.

Ahhh but to describe the illustrations.Ever seen the silent German Expressionist film Nosferatu?If so you know that it is scarier than any vampire flick now.He has a Demonic rodent look.It gave you the feeling of being in a nightmare.Being in a world which you have no control.Well that is the effect of these illustrations.If Salvador Dali and Max Ernst ever were to see these books they would love them.The illustrations are all black and white.Many leering and decaying corpses.Everything distorted by mist amorphous shapes which you can make slight details on emerging from the fog.I remember the illustration to one of the stories called &quot;Oh Susanna&quot;,I have not seen anything like it.It is worthy of an art gallery.It creates feelings of dizzines and a transcendent euphoria if you were to sit and stare at it.Utterly horrible yet you are hypnotized as it strikes you with its venom.As I said if you are a fan of late German Expressionism or Surrealism you will cherish this book.Is it suitable for kids?Yes older ones and ones that can handle this sort of thing.Regardless of that you need not be a kid to enjoy this....

But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book.

One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children. After over 3 decades, it would be so sad to see Gammell's version just disappear..."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I just found out about the tragedy that has befallen these books. The artistic castration they've suffered is appalling. I mean, the new art is good by itself, (I absolutely loved this artist's illustrations in A Series of Unfortunate Events) but it isn't scary, and when compared with the old art, it's downright embarrassing. An insult to both artists.A while ago I lost the three battered \\"Scary Story\\" books that had kept me and my family and all my friends entertained and frightened on so many different occasions during my childhood. I was always planning to buy them again, especially when I had a kid of my own. But I won't be buying these books for my kid in their current state. Not out of any kind of protest, but just because they are no longer good enough to buy. The stories are all pretty good, but I was a scary story geek when I was a kid, so I know of a lot of other books with better ones. It was the pictures that go along WITH the stories that made these tales frightening, enhancing the words and changing the things that enter your imagination when you read them, until a mildly unsettling tale took on the inexplicably terrifying quality of a nightmare in your mind. And that's exactly what we want, isn't it? That's the reason we buy a book called \\"Scary Stories\\"!!"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"The new illustrations are a complete disaster. The stories in Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark are fine. What made the book great were the illustrations. These new ones are a disaster and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I'm only giving it a two (instead of a one) because they didn't change Alvin Schwartz's original stories, as far as I know, but I don't think those stories are nearly as effective with these new downright cute, Harry Potter-esque illustrations. All I can say is I'm glad I still have my original copies for my daughter to read when she's old enough in a few years, even if they're very well-worn from countless trips in backpacks and sleepover bags.These books were defining elements of my childhood and most of my friends' as well. I think the first time I stayed up past midnight was because I was scared a bloody head would fall down the chimney, or an animated scarecrow would flay me and dry my hide on the roof, or the Wendigo would snatch me up in the air and roast me. So many people today think keeping children in some protective bubble until they're eighteen is in their best interests, that exposure to anything challenging, scary, or containing peanuts will scar them for life and produce a generation of soulless sociopaths. What these people forget is that when you're a kid being scared is FUN. Reading The Attic, or the Man Who Lived in Leeds, by flashlight, and pouncing on your nearest friend to scream AHHHHHH at the end was half the fun of slumber parties. Not to mention that as artwork, Gammell's illustrations were like Kathe Kollwitz meets Hieronymous Bosch meets James Ensor, in other words high octane nightmare fuel par excellence. By keeping them from future generations you're depriving them of exquisitely drawn artwork that affects you on a visceral level like little else can."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"The originals that I actually came to purchase are what I will be looking for. I don't know who at Harper Collins thought up this travesty, but fire them. Fire them now, because they've done enough damage.As the images now clearly show these DO NOT have the original Steve Gammel illustrations. I was hoping that Cracked was once again lying to me when it mentioned these reprints, but like something Gammel created these are but a twisted shadow of the thing they were once supposed to be...too bad they lack the originality of his creations.Seriously Harper Collins. I wanted to get a copy of the ones I originally read because when I have kids if they don't have night terrors as a result of these books I will have deprived them of one of the greatest parts of childhood- true and genuine fear. These books are why I answered Nicklodeons question with a resounding yes and you have destroyed it.Forget the whole ChickFillA business, THIS is why I will avoid doing business with you at all cost."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I was very disappointed to discover that the copies, (I ordered the \\"scary\\" trilogy)while described as being illustrated by Stephen Gammell, were actually the updated versions with watered-down artwork by another artist.

You need to change your description to include the correct illustrator."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"I love these books.

These are stories - macabre and scary, with some scary songs and some funny tales thrown in - that are, as the title says \\"collected from American folklore.\\" These stories put me on a path of studying folklore in my spare time that continues today, and I really came to appreciate folktales and American lore as a result of reading these.A word of caution, however - while these books are a lot of fun, I remember being very, very scared by some of them, and that is no exaggeration. I urge you to use your discretion. However, this is still a great book, and recommended to be read a loud."},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Okay, I had all three books when I was a kid. The original ones look like their worth some money so I'll be kicking myself in the back later. If these new ones stay true to the stories from the 90's editions, then you need to buy all three of them for your kids.

By chance, I decided to travel down memory lane and pick up the boxed set of my favorite scary story collections as a child. Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique! For whatever spineless reason, the publisher decided to replace the original ghastly pictures with tame and watered-down versions. Sure, the stories are the same...but the artwork just doesn't fit. It is blasphemy to mess with such perfection. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VERSION BY PURCHASING IT! Instead, hunt down the originals and buy them.

That being said, if you are not 12 and under, you might find some of the stories rather bland-- especially if you're a serious horror fan.Anyway, this book is great for campfire/sleepover/Halloween party-type settings. They're pretty short, but still quite enjoyable. My father read these books to my siblings and I as children during the month of October, and they scared the crap out of us.The illustrations....weird, scary, freaky stuff. Bottom line. In my opinion, the pictures are even scarier than the actual stories. I'm 26 now, and some of them still creep me out to this very day. So, if you're intending to read these stories aloud, then make sure that you show the pictures to add to the scare factor.Overall, I still enjoy this collection of stories.

I thought it would have been scarier maybe if the author had elaborated more on the stories, and gave more details to the envirement and atmosphere of the story. Every story in the book ends very abruptly, and it doesn't send any chill up my spine. i'll give you an example, one story ends &quot;the next day they were found dead&quot; thats it.. I give this book 4 stars because i liked it so much when i was a kid, but when you're an adult, you should expect more in a book. Most of the stories here can be read in less than 3 minutes, ( i remember it taking me more than a half hour when i was 7) and they aren't very satisfying. If you're a parent, buy the book for your kids, sometimes its good to be scared, kids have better imaginations than adults, and this book is great just for them. by the way, the drawings are sick, and maybe thats why this book is banned from many schoools, i doubt its the stories.awaiken@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark","review":"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark didn't really have much of a plot, since it is a collection of short stories.

She was to stick a knife in the grave so her friends know she was there. She put the knife through the grave, and tried to get away, but she that she was being held back, and she died of fright.

So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something.

The distinction between explicit learning (test-oriented lecture, textbooks, research, video, and discussion) and implicit learning (dance, theater, physical education, recess, aerobics, energizers, sports, and simple games) is useful. This book makes a strong case for implicit learning. Those who are familiar with Jensen's work can expect a good, up-to-date grounding in brain functioning and the scientific basis of various practices. Most readers will find the book an informative, readable resource. Numerous drawings and charts facilitate the understanding. &quot;65 all-time best activators&quot; have been selected.

On my book cover there is a full and detailed image of Kal Kr&uacute;h, the terrible creature in the story.As I'm in the process of translating this into an audio drama, I shoudl say some things. Merrit comes from a far earlier age, closer to HG Wells, for instance, than Asimov, and this is rather apparent in the voice of the dialogue. It comes a litle too fast in the book to begin with, though there is a way of making the material slightly re-ordered in time to fit modern tastes. Far, far better is his descriptive imagery, and here Merrit easily equals any of the contemporary fantasy authors. Given that he could probably not afford the long drawn out creative proces per book as such, he could no doubt have drawn even larger illustrations of his post 1st world war world of unexplored paradises and mysteries. We probably have enough, though. In this book, Leif, a young adventurer with an Indian companion, goes north after a family dispute to hunt for a while. Finds some strange geography and a confrontation with a single bizarre incident from his own past, something he only dreams about. Read on if you can get the book. Contact me if you can't. I'll be announcing the release of the audio drama in a year or two,"},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"After taking a brief respite--in the hardboiled yet outre crime thriller &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot;--from the tales of adventurous fantasy at which he so excelled, Abraham Merritt returned in fine form with &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; (1932). In this terrific novel, Merritt revisits many of the themes and uses many of the ingredients that made his first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; such an impressive success. Like that early work, &quot;Dwellers&quot; features a lost civilization (of the type grandfathered by the great H. Rider Haggard), battling priestesses, civil wars, and otherdimensional creatures (in the earlier book, a light creature; in &quot;Dwellers,&quot; an octopuslike nasty named Khalk'ru that dissolves whatever life-form it touches). In this marvelous fantasy, we meet Leif Langdon, who is hiking through the foothills of the Endicott Mountains in northern Alaska with his Native American buddy. Years before, Leif had witnessed an arcane religious ritual in Mongolia, and been told by the Uighur tribesmen there that he was a descendant of Dwayanu, an ancient Mongolian king. Leif and his buddy discover a hidden valley covered by a freak Alaskan mirage, and meet the golden-skinned pygmy peoples and the Mongolian descendants that reside therein. Before long, in an instance of extreme atavism, Dwayanu takes over Leif's mind and personality, and aids him in his upcoming trials. Leif must eventually encounter a civil war between the valley's inhabitants; the storming of the fugitive city of Sirk; the charms of a witch woman with the most appropriate name of Lur; giant leeches; AND the aforementioned Khalk'ru. The book is just brimming with marvelous imagination and endless wonder, and the reader will never guess what outrageous incidents will pop up next. Merritt was truly at the top of his form with &quot;Dwellers,&quot; and threw in great detail to keep the whole conceit afloat. There are amusing side characters, interesting species of flora and fauna, some historical and metaphysical speculations, and bits of unusual anthropology. The tale proceeds with great drive and purpose, and concludes most satisfactorily, indeed. &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's excellent overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and I can well understand why. It is a tale that Haggard himself may well have enjoyed, and if you knew me, you'd know that this is high praise, indeed! Seek this book out, by all means; it's a winner!"},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"Simply put, this book is what other writer strive to achieve. It has a little of everything: Fantasy, Adventure, Exploration, Mythology, Romance, and Scientific Theory of the day. Fascinating exploration of what is really in the unused 90% of the mind."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"Well, this is one of those &quot;walk out of the world and into someplace very different&quot; novels, put into an exploration of exotic (to the 1920's person) locals.It ought to be a classic of the Genre, but it seems that nobody reads it and nobody publishes it either. A shame. I'm NOT going to say much, except to beware the monstrous Dwanyu."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"This is surely one of the finest fantasy/lost race novels ever written. Back in 1969 during a parade I ran into a boy of 14 in the crowd and we somehow got on the subject of Merritt. He was an enthusiastic fan and told me that his friends shared the same tastes. He said that there was a paperback bookstore near his school where the kids hung out, and that was the place to find Merritt books. It would appear that in the 42 years since then, this fondness of boys for Merritt has somehow evaporated completely. It is their loss! The style of this book is taut, sparse, no-nonsense. Merritt comes right to the point. The action never lets up. There are two different endings to this novel, one forced on Merritt by his editor, and one by Merritt himself. I read the 1962 paperback and fear that this has the editor's ending, but in any case I liked it. I have no idea what the alternate ending is like. This title was included in Moorcock's list of the 100 best fantasy novels, and it deserves to be there. People whose idea of literature is realistic novels would find this book silly, childish and low-brow, a pulp thriller for teenagers. Well, they are partly right, but those of us who go for this sort of thing must consider this a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"This book employes many of the themes one would expect from a pulp adventure story, particularly one written in the 1930's: exotic locations, treachous villains, wicked cults, bizarre civilizations and two mysteriously seductive heroines - one a Madonna-type the other a witch queen. The hero, Lief Langdon, is handsome, athletic, intelligent and fully versed in survival skills. Regrettable he has a split personality; sometimes he is the reincarnation of the ancient cult leader Dwayanu and sometimes the fearless soldier of fortune Lief. Complicating matters is that Dwayanu has the unfortunate ability to conjure from another dimension a kraken-like being called Khalk're that has a taste for human sacrifice.Lief/Dwayanu is summoned to the land of the Mirage and becomes a troublesome focus point in the conflict of two totally different cultures; one of warrior women led by an exotic witch and the other a race pygmies and their revered human queen. Somehow the author has Lief/Dwayanu become the lover of both ladies!On the surface this story has all the elements of a lurid, dated piece of hackwork. Rest assured Abraham Merritt[1884-1943] was no hack. He was intelligent and knowledgeable of his subject matter but did not neglect the desires of his audience. Certainly this book was written as an entertainment and a grand one it is.Merritt, through the use of introspective asides, ruminates on the issues of scientific explanations for apparent occult manifestations, a familiar theme if your have read any of his other novels particularly \\"The Moon Pool\\".This novel was first published in 1932 and last reprinted in paperback in 1991. It is regrettable that Merritt's novels has not been re-printed and re-popularized like those from Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft. Fortunately there have been numerous editions of Merritt's novels and many copies are available for sale on Amazon."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the mirage (Murder mystery monthly)","review":"Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right.

Uralic and Altaic series, v. 54)","review":"I borrowed this book to learn the rudiments of the Estonian language to prepare for a trip to Estonia. This is a college textbook, and it is very thorough. Each unit divided into (1) basic sentences in Estonian (with English translations), (2) notes on grammar, (3) exercises with answers, and (4) conversations. The back of the textbook has an excellent glossary (dictionary). In the preface, the author says &quot;[T]he availability of a native speaker of Estonian for covering the material....would be especially important at the initial stage of study, for going over the pronunciation exercises and the first units.&quot; For self-study, this book is rough going. There are no maps of Estonia, no photos, and no charts or tables; the book consists of only typewritten pages. There are also no accompanying cassettes for practice. The glossary in the back of the book lists the Estonian words with the English translation. A suggested improvement: have a second section where the English words are listed with Estonian translations (a &quot;reverse-glossary&quot;).

This author has met the challenge of voice - the people of Water Street sound just like themselves. Their speech and their inner dialogue ease into the reader's head and heart, and stick there.Reasons to read this book:1. The dialogue. As a white person, I felt privileged to read the generous language of black culture, which this African American author uses with verve. Ms. Wilkinson lets me and readers like me in on the secrets of another culture and language, and it's exciting.2. The drama between outer and inner lives. The author's skilled hand paints the particular customs and habits of the interwoven outer lives of the people of Water Street at the same time she reveals to readers the particular secrets, griefs, traumas, and hopes of these compelling characters. The result is fresh, a combination of solid description of what anyone could see by looking and juicy surprises that lie beneath the mostly benificent surfaces of both people and place.3. The complex, believable men. The author paints women with accuracy and insight - but we expect this of an accomplished woman writer. The bonus here is the men. The men in this book are like most men you and I know. They aren't voracious womanizers; they aren't child abandoners; they are humans. They think about their lives, they want to do well, they make mistakes, they work, grieve, and try to fix problems. Ms. Wilkinson's male characters live multi-dimensional lives, and she takes us straight into their ways of seeing their actions, mistakes, and hopes. This is healthy and so unlike the stereotyped, lightly sketched male types that fill much contemporary literature (and the news) that it is reason enough to read this book.4. The authenticity of the few individual relationships between white and black characters. This book presents an honest picture of the \\"outliers\\" in both races who try, at times, to vault over race-based barriers to be humans together. We should put this book in a time capsule from 2002; it shows us as we are right now, after outright racial segregation has been illegal for decades, but before black and white Americans have made the changes we must make to live equitably and easily together, with mutual respect and appreciation.5. The universality of the characters' lives, problems, and experiences. Like all good tales, these particular stories of mostly African American people on Water Street in a small Kentucky town tell us much about our own humanity, no matter how different we think we are from the characters. The stories reassure us, challenge us, and, thanks to the author's great gift for gentle revelation, teach us who we are and who we can become."},{"Title":"MITTEE A GROVE OF FEVER TREE..","review":"Oops! Crystal's done it again! Weaving in and out of the lives of everyday people,letting their pain, happiness and fears be heard! Ms. Wilkinson opens the front door and walks you right up to the kitchen table and flows thru the stories like setting you down to a good old southern feast. She tales a story in the same class as Gayle Jones and Toni Cade Bambara! Her characters make you laugh and cry all within the quick turn on a page. This book is a must have for every reader who likes a 'down-home' good tale. Water Street is a true testament to the constant evolution of her natural craft. Her hard work has paid off. This shows that she is comming full-circle as a woman and a writer!! I am proud to add this to my collection of great African American fiction."},{"Title":"MITTEE A GROVE OF FEVER TREE..","review":"Crystal Wilkinson's Water Street is an engaging novel thattransports the reader to a middle-class neighborhood in small town Stanford, Kentucky, USA. The residents are hardworking, law-abiding citizens who go to work, church, pay their taxes, and raise their families to the best of their abilities. In the opening passages of the book, the author mentions that every person has two stories to tell: one story by day and the other by night which is kept near the heart for safekeeping. Wilkinson allows the reader to experience both stories through the carefully crafted monologues and short narratives.The novel opens with the manic-depressant Yolanda in the midst of a meeting with her psychiatrist. In her session, the reader is casually introduced to a few Water Street residents: her best friend, Mona whom she idolizes; her brother, KiKi, her husband, Junior; and a host of other characters who influenced her in childhood and adulthood. The beauty of the novel is the reader will learn more about Mona, Kiki, Junior, Sandy, Maxine, et al in subsequent chapters via a series of soliquies or third person accounts. Through the selected medium, the reader observes how they tackle a host of issues such as interracial relationships, marital problems, quests for love, divorce, absentee parents, etc.Because it is a small town and all the residents live on Water Street, the stories are interconnected and the same characters are often mentioned in one or more stories. So for example, we hear about Mona, the best friend from Yolanda; Mona, my little sister's best friend that I slept with from Kiki; Mona in her own eyes, etc. We get up close and personal viewpoints from mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, daughters, sons, neighbors and friends. One particular noteworthy item is that the author's skill in writing from the male perspective is equally compelling as from the female's. In &quot;The Girl of My Dreams: Kiki&quot;, we find Kevin/Kiki calling off the wedding after the rehearsal dinner, but not for the reasons one may think because of the title of the story. We also experience other male viewpoints in the coming of age stories &quot;Water Street, 1979: Junior&quot;, &quot;Between Men&quot;, and a principled man in search of love in &quot;An Ordinary Man: Reverend Townsend.&quot;The dialogue is mature, the writing is great, and the stories are painfully honest. These are not eccentric or malevolent characters, in fact, they are so down-to-earth that they seem real, almost like ordinary folk instead of fictional protagonists. Just as with non-fictional beings, the harsh realities of life strikes Water Street as with any other street and the imperfections, vulnerabilities,pain, and joy of the characters are expertly revealed. Water Street's messages are universal and timeless: the same people with the same issues can be found in the inner cities as well as the rural landscapes in any decade. This is a great second novel byCrystal Wilkinson; I must add her debut novel, Blackberries,Blackberries to my list of books to check out this year.PhyllisAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"MITTEE A GROVE OF FEVER TREE..","review":"Water Street is a collection of short stories that revolve around small town life. The inhabitants of Water Street each have a tale and they share their experiences with us throughout this book. The characters are so lifelike and their experiences so real, you feel at home and as though you know each of them individually. Dealing with topics such as love and loss, the stories are full of emotions. They had me laughing one minute, crying the next. This book is a testament to small communities and the people that live within them. Crystal Wilkinson has done a superb job with this novel. I cannot wait to read more from this author.Reviewed by Latoya Carter-QawiyyThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"MITTEE A GROVE OF FEVER TREE..","review":"These stories fill the senses like mouthfuls of home-cooked food, each just the right amount of swallow. Her characters are well-drawn and appear in the eye long after the last word is read, and the interweaving of the caharcters' lives send you back to other stories for a second read, a better understanding, that you didn't get the first time.

Focusing her short stories on fictional inhabitants of Water Street creates a novel-like feel in the character studies exploring the interconnectedness of the characters of Water Street. Wilkinson's stories examine human experience without being preachy. Wilkinson again demonstrates the challenges and joys of the human experience through her exquisite use of vernacular, description, setting and character."},{"Title":"MITTEE A GROVE OF FEVER TREE..","review":"I read &quot;Water Street'' in one sitting.

I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"The author of this book, Dennis William Hauck, is a practicing alchemist versed in both Eastern and Western techniques of alchemy and widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the ancient art and the benefits it offers contemporary practitioners. Now, in Sorcerer's Stone, the first basic primer on the subject, he makes alchemy's secrets and powers accessible to everyone with the desire to experience physical, mental, and spiritual transformation. By providing clear explanations, moving meditations, and hands-on experiments making tinctures and elixirs, this beautifully illustrated guide passes on the knowledge and creative energy of alchemy's magnificent discipline-sending a golden arc of learning from thousands of years in the past into your life today.Hauck present a fascinating history of alchemy - from the ancient Emerald Tablet to modern quantum chemistry - and elaborates on its arcane principles in an intimate, conversational way that anyone can understand. His portrayals of individual alchemists (like Flamel, Fulcanelli, and Isaac Newton) bring them alive and show how they built on each other's work through an \\"Underground River\\" of secret knowledge passed down through the ages.Moreover, Hauck makes clear that alchemy is a means of personal transformation that enables you to meet your highest potential as a human being. Although the alchemists spoke in terms of vessels, furnaces, and chemicals, they were really talking about changes taking place in their own inner nature. They worked with the archetypal energies of metals to change their own \\"temperament\\" from lead to gold - to rejuvenate their bodies, integrate their personalities, and perfect the very essence of their souls. The bizarre drawings and cryptic writings of the alchemists refer to specific operations that work on all levels of body, mind, and spirit. Today, enlightened physicians and healers are demonstrating that alchemical methods can protect and rejuvenate the body and even heal brain and spinal cord injuries.Complete with alchemical engravings from the Middle Ages as well as insightful charts and diagrams, this illuminating handbook will teach aspiring alchemists the true art of transformation. Chapters: What Is Alchemy? | The Golden Thread That Runs Through Time | The Principles of Alchemy | The Kitchen Alchemist: Making Tinctures and Elixirs | The Ladder of the Planets | Saturn's Child: The Base Metal Lead | Jupiter's Rule: The Courtly Metal Tin | Mars' Challenge: The Angry Metal Iron | Venus' Embrace: The Loving Metal Copper | Mercury's Magic: The Living Metal Mercury | The Moon's Reflection: The Lunar Metal Silver | The Sun's Brilliance: The Solar Metal Gold | The Operations of Alchemy | Personal Purification | Becoming an Alchemist. The book includes an extensive glossary and resource guide."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"Many people are aware of alchemy as a precursor to modern lab chemistry, but less know of the alchemists' spiritual goals. Hauck's introduction to modern alchemy stresses this philosophy of personal transformation, where the practitioner's \\"leaden\\" personality is transmuted into the \\"gold\\" of an enlightened spirit. Hauck starts out with a chapter on how modern practitioner's view alchemy then moves on to a summary of the history and myths. The bulk of the book is devoted to applications. He gives a detailed discussion of the symbolism of the metals and planets, which includes a meditations and a few lab exercises. He ends by describing the chemical operations and how they correspond to spiritual, psychological, and physical changes that accompany spiritual development, again with exercises.For the most part, Hauck does an excellent job descrbing the symbols and operations clearly for someone new to the subject. I liked how he includes examples of some of the wonderful old alchemical illustrations and carefuIly explains the symbolism in them. I also greatly liked his breif aside on how the film version of 2001: A Space Oddessy as modern alchemical symbolism. I mostly read the book for intellectual curiousity, and did not try the lab experiments myself, but I imagine that one would need a little more information or experience to successfully perform them than is offered in the book. Hauck also has the somewhat annoying tendency of occult authors to mix fact, legend and speculation together with little differentiation and less citation. Overall, however, I found it an understandable and interesting read for insights into what a modern alchemist believes and practices."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"\\"Sorcerer's Stone - A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy\\" by Dennis William Hauck is a really nice book. It has something for everyone who is interested in alchemy and ties it all together. There is history, philosophy, theory, practical laboratory work for the novice, and psychological and inner exercises as well. Well written, illustrated, indexed, and with a very handy and detailed glossary, I recommend Hauck's \\"Sorcerer's Stone\\" to anyone interested in alchemy. You will be glad you read it, and re-read it again. On a personal level I have shared several lengthy emails with the author, and have spoken to several of his students (via the Flamel College with which he is affiliated), and everyone had kind and generous words to say about him. This alone says volumes."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"There is no one better suited to brew a beginners guide together than Dennis. His background, research, travels, lectures and other books are all proof of his knowledge in alchemy. What makes him perfect for such subject matter is that Dennis is an alchemists first and an author second."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"I bought this beginner's guide because, obviously, I'm a beginner. So I need to be able to trust what the author is teaching me. Unfortunately, I can't.Hauck's premise is that parallels can be drawn between alchemy and contemporary science. I don't know alchemy, but I found many sloppy references on the science track, and that makes me wonder if he's playing fast and loose with alchemy too.For a small example, in his discussion of gold, he notes that it's used to protect \\"intersteller probes.\\" Sounds plausible, except that humans have launched no intersteller probes; could this be some kind of metaphor, or is it just a mistake?One example of a larger failure is his chapter on Saturn, in which he ascribes its characteristics to the fact that it's a failed sun: that, if only it had more mass, it would have succeeded in becoming a sun. That's true, but it's true of all the planets; in fact, Jupiter is more massive, and thus closer to being a sun. Why did Saturn derive its personality from this, but not the other planets? I feel in this example he has twisted contemporary science to suit the ancient attributions of alchemy.As a beginner, I can't evaluate his presentation of the alchemy track, but his careless writing on the science side leaves me dissatisfied."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"This is an excellent beginner primer to Western Alchemy and its tenets. The author does a good job of presenting and explaining the symbolism of Western Alchemy, and the relationship of the planetary and elemental energies to alchemy. More importantly, he emphasizes the importance of doing internal work and explains how Western Alchemy can be used for internal work. This is an excellent starter book for anyone who wants to learn about the fundamental basics of alchemy."},{"Title":"Sorcerer's Stone: A Beginner's Guide to Alchemy","review":"I wa svery happy with the author's style of writing in this book.

Among others, I think this book is important especially in that it raises the question of reality per se. Documentary has always been marginal not only in discourse but also in cinema industry, under the poor understanding of reality. I think Nichols's notion of &quot;reflexivity&quot; is a key concept itself in understanding documentary, which also provides a good alternative reading regarding what is documentary or not. I think this book will give you a great deal of food for thought, when you have ever contemplated what is real and when we become to question about what we are seeing, not only in films but also in real life."},{"Title":"Representing Reality: Issues and Concepts in Documentary","review":"This attempt at discussing documentary film is fraught with difficulties for the reader.

You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like &quot;situatedness,&quot; &quot;hyperrationality,&quot; &quot;reconceptualization,&quot; &quot;polyvocality,&quot; &quot;relationality,&quot; &quot;talismanic&quot;(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: &quot;juxtaposition.&quot; Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge.

All three books teach life lessons while presenting a fun adventure. The Mixed-up files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler is an excellent story about two children who decide to run away from home and hide in a museum. The story can be read a chapter a night. It keeps the children interested and allows them see museums in a whole new light. My second favorite book in the collection is The Rats of Nimth. The book is so realistic and compelling, you forget the main characters are rodents. Finally, M.C. Higgens the Great.The main character is quirky, fun and has so many adventures! Truly, excellent stories to read aloud to your children or as a gift."},{"Title":"A Collection Of 3 Newbery Medal Winners: \\"M.C Higgins, the Great\\", \\"Mrs.Frisby and the Rats of NIMH\\", and \\"From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Higgins the Great&quot; which I thought was more for boys. I didn't read this one though so I don't know what it's about except for the first five pages.For all your parents out there my Mom liked &quot;From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Although a brief biography of each poet was given, I longed to have more context. In many instances, although the poems were written by men, the narrators used a woman's voice, and this was not clear to me when I read the poems on my own.I realize that translation of poetry is especially difficult, but I thought that many of the poems sounded stilted and could have been improved if a native English speaker had collaborated with the poems translated by Korean speakers. For example, one stanza of Chu Yohan's poem, \\"To Catch the Moon\\" is translated as follows:One spring day to catch the moonClimbing the night, I ascended the sky.But the moon revealed only half its face:\\"How would you have come if not for the dream?\\"Moreover, after our class compared translations of the poems withtheir originals, we were aware of different nuances that changedthe interpretation of the poems. Although Hwang Jiwoo's wonderful \\"Vanity Fair 1984\\" was translated well, considering itsextreme difficulty, the final line was translated: [Big Brothersaith] \\"Looks good to me!\\" Yet, in the original, there was anobvious allusion to Genesis in which God looked at what he hadcreated and saw that it was good.I think the anthology would have been far more valuable if ithad been presented in the manner that one finds translations ofSouth Asian poetry, especially by the late A.K. Ramanujan, inwhich the translations are both smoother and more carefullyexplained. However, I believe this volume is a good first start, and I hope that additional anthologies of Korean poets will follow."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"My family thinks that this is the best toilet paper available."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"In the name of science, you will try to prove with propagande;if you really want to decode how junk scientifics manipulate the world: go http://nomorefakenews.com and do not buy this junk BOOK!"},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"BOOK REVIEWJunk Science Judo. Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, Cato Institute, Washington, DC, USA, 2001, ix-xii + 218 pp.A superb manual for understanding health claims and detecting fraud, \\"Junk Science Judo\\" is written in a punchy, easy-to-read style that allows the mathematically challenged, like myself, to interpret the usual bell-curve statistics that are used for environmental health threats and diet threats. One may also use this approach to judge the benefits of prescription drugs or alternative treatments. He shows how to look for p values of 0.05 or less, and he shows how to use the 95% confidence intervals (CI) to see whether the low or high limit crosses the reference value of 1.00. If it does, Milloy suggests disregarding any result that is claimed.In epidemiological or ecologic studies, Milloy suggests discarding those results in which the relative risk (RR) is between 0.5 and 2.00, whichever applies. Milloy goes far beyond the usual cautions that an association is not necessarily a cause. He is contemptuous of, but not totally dismissive of epidemiology. For Milloy, the descending pecking order of research on health hazards is: clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and ecologic studies. He describes publication bias, confounding, and \\"tainted experts\\". He reminds us that mice are not little people, and that there is a safe dose of everything.Milloy encourages intelligent contact with the sources of health advice to support or refute the recommendations, and he recommends a number of sources of supposedly reliable health information. His criticism of medical journals, which includes the defects of peer-review, is the most detailed I have seen in print, and very well-taken, in my opinion. He skewers broadcast media on their emphasis on ratings rather than accuracy or balance. He deplores the motivation of many activists. Many specific examples are given, from Alar to radiation.This book is extremely valuable for helping anyone who is not a medical or epidemiological specialist to judge the value of health or health-threat claims.Now the bad news. Milloy does not question the use 1-tailed statistics, or the failure of many relationships to follow a bell-curve (Kauffman, 2001). Milloy failed to warn of the common deception of reporting an effect of something on a certain health condition without the inclusion of total death rates. Milloy's fine example of prostate cancer \\"non-prevention\\" by eating foods high in selenium (p164) may mislead people into ignoring the benefits of selenium supplementation, which has been shown in a clinical trial to lower the RR of all cancers to 0.83 (95% CI 0.47-0.85), and is most effective against lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers (Clark et al., 1996). Milloy downplays the dangers of trans fats (Oomen et al., 2001), but his own example shows that the highest two quintiles of consumption are not healthful (p165). Milloy made the mistake of writing that the absence of a biological explanation for the claimed effects of electric and magnetic fields means that they have no effects (p76); readers of JSE know that such judgments based on lack of knowledge are faulty. ....Joel M.

Milloy relates how zealous lawyers can draw false or misleading inferences from scientific data in order to extract large rewards from lawsuits against defendants with deep pockets, often with collaboration from those in the &quot;scientific&quot; community who stand to profit from their &quot;research&quot; (what better way to justify large government grants to continue research into some promising area?). Most telling are the cases of the lawsuits involving breast implants and Agent Orange, where a total absence of evidence was ignored by courts and juries eager to punish unpopular defendants and to reward those who were definitely disadvantaged (but probably not as a result of either the implants or Agent Orange).Despite a generally good job of writing a primer on how not to be taken in by faulty conclusions or misleading inferences of cause and effect, Chapter 11 of this book contains one significantly dubious conclusion of the author himself. In a discussion of the statistical technique of meta-analysis (a technique where the results of numerous small studies are combined to simulate one large study), Milloy repeatedly takes stabs at this respected technique. His criticisms appear to be based mainly on questions raised in an editorial in a medical journal where the editor cited poor data quality and publication bias (i.e., only research studies showing significant results tend to get published) as reasons for questioning conclusions from meta-analysis. Although the editor is correct, it does not follow that all meta-analysis is therefore useless. Given enough well-executed studies without bias in the findings, meta-analysis can be a very useful and enlightening tool.I highly recommend that all consumers of information either purchase this book or at least borrow it from someone, and read it thoroughly. I suspect that you will never again be able to read uncritically any account of some purported new crisis brought on by zealous lawyers, journalists or politicians. When some &quot;scientific&quot; conclusion appears to be counterintuitive, it is most likely incorrect. Subsequent research may, in fact, show that the conclusions were incorrect, but (since this is not exciting) the correction is likely not to be brought to the public's attention. Since it is impossible to prove a negative, the burden of proof should be on the scientific community to exercise caution in releasing insignificant findings to the press. Junk science may sell newspapers or gain an audience for the evening news, but it is devastating when it causes major disruptions in the lives of people who either aren't given the whole picture or who can't interpret the information when it is presented.The best defense against junk science is an informed public. Read this book and you will definitely become better informed!"},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"Some parts of this book literally left my jaw hanging open. The endless examples of high-level fraud in government agencies and special interest groups are enough to make any logical thinker sick.Bear in mind that this book is probably not for the trained scientist. The author takes time to explain basic research concepts for the casual reader, and also interjects his own attitude to make the book more fun to read. However, for those readers who do want to check up on the author's science, the 17-page listing of 314 cited studies should leave no question that the author beckons the audience to follow his own advice by examining his research.If I had one complaint about this book, it would be that the author often relies too heavily on quoted material. I think the author is trying to show that he was not skewing the cited studies, as would the individuals he criticizes in the book. While effective in this regard, the practice sometimes results in a monotonous pattern. The author's comments on the quoted studies become predictable midway through the book as the reader learns to identify the glaring problems in cited research methods.In the end, this book was an excellent read for the choir to which it preaches. I would recommend it as an excellent resource for anybody who wants ammunition to fight junk science, or to back up political debate with embarrassing proof of the ineptitude on which many health/environmental policies are based. Anybody who cares about ridding public policy of special interest politics should read through this book once and keep it handy for later use as a reference tool."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"I purchased this book after spending much time on Mr. Milloy's web site, www.junkscience.com, and found it to be an excellent primer on the way information is manipulated to serve various purposes.The book is well-written, and an easy read, with an eye toward the scientific novice. But the book focuses not so much on science, but on statistics, which are often used as a surrogate for science. Indeed, Mr. Milloy never claims to be a scientist; his biography notes that he has a degree in statistics, making him well-qualified to criticize the misuse of such numbers.I recently had the opportunity to use the information gleaned from \\"Junk Science Judo.\\" A local group used a study as evidence that cranberry bogs present a cancer risk, i.e., the hypothesis of the study was that living near cranberry bogs exposed local residents to enough pesticides to cause cancer. While the authors did find a correlation between living near cranberry bogs and a particular kind of brain cancer, it was only a correlation.This was an ecologic epidemiological study (the worst kind according to Mr. Milloy). The authors never established that the study subjects were exposured to the pesticides used on cranberry bogs; blood or urine samples were never obtained, but a formula was used to estimate exposure levels.There were other problems; the sample size was too small (only a dozen individuals had brain cancer) to be of value; cancer rates were no higher for those individuals who had known exposures to pesticides (such as pest control or agricultural workers) than for the control group; pesticide use on the cranberry bogs could only be guessed at - the authors did not know what pesticides were used, when they were used or in what quantities.In short, the study raised more questions than answers. But when I critizied the study and the use of it, the only thing anyone could say was, \\"Pesticides are toxic.\\" Well, duh. But as Mr. Milloy notes, the dose makes the poison.Ironically, most of the bad reviews of this book make an issue out of motivation, and appear to be criticizing Mr. Milloy personally, instead of the book and its contents.Scientists can be activists, and when they are they often hide behind their scientific training, claiming to be impartial even as they advocate a certain point of view (believe me, I've encountered them). And just because a corporation pays for a study does not mean that that study is any less relevant than one paid for by an environmental organization. I've gone so far as to research some of the examples Mr. Milloy uses (such as the Love Canal) and found them to be true.My point - and that of Mr. Milloy's book - is to look at the claims made with a critical eye; examine the science behind them. In \\"Junk Science Judo,\\" Mr. Milloy provides us with the information needed to determine if the claims made are true, exaggerated, or completely out of the ballpark. This book is not a collection of blind rants, but a close examination of how public health claims are made and justified (rightly or wrongly).Get the book, but keep an open mind, because there is no doubt that it will challenge some of your basic assumptions. If you're a natural skeptic, it will give you a foundation upon which to base your skepticism. If you're not a skeptic, it will open your eyes."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"Every day American readers are given scare stories about health issues in news accounts based on some statistics and little analysis. Many accounts are circulated by special interest groups or lawyers. Milloy's background in law and health lends to his ability to point out the fallacies of 'junk science' and tips on how the average reader can separate junk science from real science."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"Steven Milloy is a journalist, and pundit whose principled stand on behalf of scientific logic benefits all of us. He stands side by side with Stephen Jay Gould and Michael Schermer in debunking the outrageous claims of pseudo science. Milloy attempts to provide a framework to evaluate the nonsensical claims made by individuals and organizations with agendas which are independent of the facts. It is this framework he calls \\"junk science judo.\\" Actually what he provides us is the kind of suspicious phraseology and statistical trickery often employed by scammers. In most cases it would take a thorough review of the claimants' research techniques and statistical interpretation to spot the scam. We come away suspicious of almost any claim. All in all, though, Milloy is readable and he is right. Don't miss his column, \\"Junk Science,\\" on the Opinion page of FoxNews.com.Postscript: With the passage of time I've become aware of a blind spot in Milloy's vision. It doesn't appear in this book, but it does repeatedly in his columns and website. He denies global warming, which is reliably documented by science. Where junk science enters the debate is in the extent of human causality. To date there is no credible evidence for human causality; it is an issue pressed by political populists and our competitors in global trade. Global warming is good science; human causality is junk science. Science shows that if humans disappeared from the Earth, global warming would continue, and likely continue to accelerate. Milloy is so incensed by the assertion of human causality that he denies warming altogether. In his acceptance of the politicization of the debate, he plays into the hands of his adversaries. His willingness to distort facts in support of this cause unnecessarily introduces doubt about his objecivity in other issues."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"And, those who have no valid counter arguments use ad hominem attacks.If your \\"Statistics for Health Professionals\\" class was as incomplete as mine, then, you need this book. Finally, you will get a clear explanation of p-values, confidence intervals and study designs. Lesson 4: \\"Epidemiology is Statistics\\" alone was worth the price of the book. However, don't miss out on the other 11 lessons. It's just like the 12 steps up from alcoholism. By learning and living these rules, you will at last be able to free yourself from those maddening health scares that bombard us daily. Milloy writes in a sassy, bold as brass style that entertains whilst it informs. Personally, I like that sort of thing. This book is an easy read, and if you really, really want to, you can find and read the original studies that are discussed. Then you will appreciate an author who can tackle complex subjects in a straightforward manner, and be funny in the bargain.\\"When the enemy comes welcome him, when he goes, send him on his way,\\" is a tenet of the practice of the art of judo. Milloy will show you the enemy, and equip you with the means of speedily dispatching them to the junk pile where they belong. You will truly welcome the next scientific study you encounter."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"If you're tired of being frightened and victimized by the never ending procession of doom-and-gloom prognostications, this book is for you. It lucidly explains how statistics and &quot;scientific&quot; studies are routinely manipulated by groups with their own agendas who are willingly assisted by the media who are all too happy to be given a shocking headline for public consumption. After reading this book, you will never react to alarmist news reports in the same way."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"This book does a very good job of explaining, in easy to understand terms, how to tell good science from bad, how to identify the different types of studies and methods, what to keep an eye out for, and how to differentiate between anecdotes, statistics, and science.I find it quite ironic that the only negative reviews here are of the ad hominem variety of which the author warns us to be wary."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"The book, \\"Junk Science Judo\\" by Steven Milloy prepares you to be able to identify the junk science that gives you a false sense of security, reduces your wealth and peace of mind, and may get you fired. The fundamental purpose of this book is to defend you, friends, relatives, and your business from junk science. The definition of junk science in the book is, \\"Falty scientific data and analysis used to advance a special interest\\" (Milloy 34). There is a ton of junk science in the world as Milloy points out, such as, deception about second hand smoke, chlorinated water, breast implants, over the counter drugs, organic food, and so on. There are overwhelming amounts of people that have a false sense of security about their health from absorbing junk science.Milloy describes the types of people responsible for junk science in his book. The people involved in junk science range from small time con artists to as big as people inside government agencies. Basically anyone could be a potential candidate for posting junk science, because it is so easy to do. One example of junk science is the claim that grapefruit juice is heart healthy. There is no solid evidence that supports that claim. The con artists posting junk science go out of their way to establish a cause and effect relationship with what they are trying to prove. These people are interested in their own succession, and should not be considered scientists at all.A really captivating point in the book is that news channels, such as CNN, often report pseudoscience. Reporters are not supposed to make up lies, but the information they broadcast is not always true. Milloy brings up a good point that the news does not like debunking there own news. This book teaches you to have doubts about even the most reliable sources. Often times, many studies that back up a claim are done on small sample sizes, which often makes them useless to the population as a whole. Frequently activists put their own desires before the facts, and will say anything to promote their claim. Junk science even gets through the judicial system, and pollutes the courts and juries. Millions upon millions of dollars have been lost due to junk science legislation.After reading \\"Junk Science Judo\\" what you think is true, may not be true to you anymore. You will see the doubt in many of the claims that you have come across in your life. Think about this question for instance, how could you personally tell if eating cereal gave you cancer? You can't. You have to take someone else's word for it, and they could either have reliable or unreliable data. The fact of the matter is that often times you hear of the unreliable data. You will even realize that politicians use pseudoscience to get elected. Although it is wrong in every way, pseudoscience often means an easy route to the top; that is if you don't get caught. After reading this book you will understand the importance of the scientific method, taking an idea from a theory to a scientific law, and how generations builds upon each other's claims.This book was easy to read in the sense that there was a lot to catch your attention, and never would you feel stuck on one topic or event. There are countless examples of junk science in this book. Each lesson teaches you more and more about how to defend yourself against junk science. The length of the book made it not discouraging to get through. It wasn't too long, or filled with any dull or useless information. Even if you are a person who is stubborn, Milloy's point that you ought to be, \\"Better safe than sorry.\\" (Milloy 148) will probably end up saving your skin one day.The book \\"Junk Science Judo\\" shows you the key default assumptions in health risk assessments. Milloy teaches you to become aware that many researchers like to skip the testing stage, and get a conclusion with no proof. One fact is that, \\"Theories, anecdotes, and assumptions aren't proof of anything\\" (Milloy 225). I really enjoyed how much this book taught me, and prepared me for a world filled with pseudoscience. For instance when you hear big numbers, it often comes with a large amount of falsity. Statistics are not proof of anything, and many people like to use them because they lack the proof they need. As Milloy states, \\"Statistics are the lingua franca of junk science.\\" (Milloy 212), which is the truth.If you are a person who is for animal rights, there are some facts that might be upsetting toward the end of the book or in Lesson 9 to be exact. Junk scientists often get societies attention using Bioassays, or animal experiments that are often times wrongly performed. Basically the idea in this part of the book is that rats differ from humans, and what is claimed to be harmful to them, cannot necessarily be claimed to harm people, but often is. The book goes over all of the epidemiologic basic studies, such as clinical trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, and ecologic studies. There are many charts and examples in the book to give you an idea of what goes on.By reading \\"Junk Science Judo\\" you will realize that much of the junk science you retain has been engraved in your mind throughout your life, and it will be a challenge to distinguish the pseudoscience from actual science. I agree with the author that by the end of the book you will be a black belt in junk science judo. I would highly recommend reading this book because of the life lessons it taught me."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require &quot;attitude.&quot; In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien.

This coalition is a think tank for corporate interests. The objective of the TASSC is to debunk modern scientific research that concludes corporate pollution has serious consequences on he environment.So Steven's objective is to discredit any scientific findings that come to the conclusion that corporate America's pollution has now and will continue to have global effects on the environment. So he criticizes the results of real scientists that are doing objective research and labels them as radical liberals. He calls their science \\"junk science\\" .The only slip in reasoning here is that the scientists that conclude big business pollution is destructive to the environment and our health weren't paid by billion dollar Industries to come to these conclusions.Steven Milloy and TASSC are funded gratuitously by corporate America to debunk global warming and any other scientific findings that run counter to corporate America's interests.Originally TASSC was funded by Philip Morris with the goal of debunking the scientific conlusion that second hand smoke is hazardous to your health. Would you believe that? If I was paid a million dollars by Phillip Morris to say second hand smoke is not dangerous to your health would you believe me? I really hope not. But that is just what Steven Milloy does. He gets paid enormously by corporate America to say that environmental scientists (who weren't paid off to come to specific conclusions) are the one's producing the junk science. His original funding came from Phillip Morris but TASSC is funded by the following corporations: 3M, Amoco, Chevron, Dow Chemical, Exxon, General Motors, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lorillard Tobacco, Louisiana Chemical Association, National Pest Control Association, Occidental Petroleum, Philip Morris Companies, Procter & Gamble, Santa Fe Pacific Gold, and W.R. Grace, the asbestos and pesticide manufacturers.If you think I'm making this all up do a Google search on \\"Steven J. Milloy Spin doctoring\\" or \\"Steven J. Milloy Phillip Morris\\" and see all of the legitimate resources that expose his true ulterior motives. That is, if you actually do care about the truth more than you care about not being labeled as a liberal radical.The name calling is how these billion dollar corporations enforce compliance by labeling dissenters as deviants. If you care about the environment you are a bleeding heart liberal, if you don't support the United States occupation and Halliburton's profiteering in Iraq you are unpatriotic and sometimes even considered a terrorist. These God and Jesus spewing billionaires define right and wrong and what is moral according to their own interests. They will pay pseudo scientists like Steven J. Milloy enormous sums of money to make it appear that there is scientific evidence to support their agenda."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"It is true. Figures don't lie but liars can figure. Much, if not all of the problems we face today, and the scares and scams are the result of either the misuses of science data and people or the forced ignoring of scientific truths. Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense Against Health Scares and Scams by Steven J. Milloy, is a good start but falls short of all the facts, and most of all, how to turn the tide toward truth. If you are concerned about this subject, read the book but spend the least to acquire it, i.e., buy it as a gift, then read it before giving it away. At least you will get double duty out of money spent. If you are really concerned about this subject, do your research well beyond the books meager coverage, then get involved at the local and state political levels. Keep in mind, if you choose to take such a path that you will come head-on with environmental terrorists such as the lawyers of the Sierra Club, Green Peace, and the likes of others who have perverted the path. The path is a good one, but it is now greatly abused by such groups. Again, the book Junk Science is a \`light' start on the subject-an eye opener if you will-that falls short on how to personally make a difference."},{"Title":"Junk Science Judo: Self-Defense against Health Scares and Scams","review":"Let's talk about junk science.1. Is the person making the claim a relevant authority in the field?For instance, let's take Stephen Milloy, author of this book. What scientific institutions does he work for? He's worked for a variety of firms, including The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition, Multinational Business Services and Citizens for the Integrity of Science, all of which are lobbyist groups for Phillip Morris. He's also worked for fronts groups for ExxonMobil.One of the reported goals of these organizations was to tag targets with negatively charged buzzwords like &quot;junk science&quot; and tag positively-charged labels like &quot;sound science&quot; to policies they wanted to extoll. For instance -- smoking? Bad for you? We need *sound science* before we can pass this new tax on cigarettes. Or, does global warming/climate change exist? That's *junk science*. We need *sound science* before we can pass some more regulations. Naturally, there is never enough sound science.Stephen Milloy is a public relations specialist. And that's what this book is.

It's from the TV network for whose \\"news\\" the author of this tract contributes. Being a skeptic I still took a close look.That the author is with CATO is a sign, but not a condemnation. (Indeed, I've positively reviewed a book by another CATO associate here in Amazon.com!) I too am somewhat of a libertarian, in a \\"liberal\\" sort of way.

First of all, he gets his backing from the Cato Institute, which is a libertarian organization that opposes government regulation, especially regulation of industry. Thus it comes as no surprise that his favorite target is 'junk science' which, if left unchecked might, lead to goverment regulation of industry.A lot of what he attacks in fact (in this book, in other books, on his website,) is not 'junk science' at all, but rather those who employ what is called the 'precautionary principle,' in other words the notion that us humans should play it safe when we don't know what it is we are dealing with.It is this doctrine that is the reason that drugs need to be tested in this country before the FDA will allow them to be sold. In other words, government regulation. People like Milloy hate the precautionary principle and it's practitioners becuase they hate regulation.Nevertheless, you might walk away from this book with a little perspective - that science and people are imperfect, and often in error. Perhaps, that science itself is often far from objective. Then again, Milloy is hardly objective himself (although he puports to be.)

In short, what being a skeptic means to me is that I strive for objectivity in my views through the guiding philosophy of the scientific method. I should hope that Mr. Milloy would admire such convictions. However, in a recent article entitled \\"Suburbs Don't Pose Health Risks\\" (...)it was unclear to me how he was validating his claims. The only supporting 'evidence' he had was that the recent study by the RAND corporation was able to establish a correlational relationship between suburbia and a myriad of health risks, not a causal one. Taking this criticism and concluding that \\"Suburbs Don't Pose Health Risks,\\" as Mr. Milloy did, appears to me to be wholly without merit. While he rightly contends that the methodology of the study was fundamentally unable to establish a clear causal relationship, he has absolutely no case for stating that there is no causal relationship between the two without conducting the type of experimental study that he criticizes the RAND study for not having. Either Mr. Milloy has made a serious logical error, or he has some external motivations to discredit the study.I have emailed Mr. MIlloy 4 times over the past week and have received no response to my questions about his claims, which suggests to me that he is not willing to acknowledge criticism. This is possibly the worst trait a scientist can have; and as such I am inclined to cast serious doubt on his scientific credibility. I gave this book a neutral rating because I haven't read it, nor will I read it until Mr. Milloy allows himself to be open to criticism.

This metaphysical belief is demonstrated quite well, but not only, when it comes to the environment. People given over to this view will always see humans as &quot;the problem.&quot; And to a degree, that is true at certain times and in more limited circumstances. But, in a more important, unintended way, they are right: humans are the problem, especially their hubris in seeing humans as &quot;the problem.&quot;The power (plate tectonics, vulcanism, etc.) and complexity (climatology, etc.) of the earth is beyond the full understaning of humans.

Aided by television and print media interested more in attracting audiences than in reporting fact, Milloy exposes the less-than-pure motives behind the so-called science, offering a layman's explanation of the tools, techniques, and statistical analysis to determine fact from fraud, and to draw logical conclusions independent of the hype. While some of the chapters discussing the actual statistical technique may run a bit dry, for the most part this is a quick and entertaining read. In addition to taking on controversial topics like DDT, PCBs, and dioxin, Milloy debunks popular environmental mega myths including Agent Orange, Love Canal, Cancer Clusters, Three Mile Island, and others.

The text of the article was very clear and the illustrations well done. An editors note at the end mentioned Jaworowski's book (I haden't heard of it). When checking for the book on-line, I saw comments from one buyer that was unhappy that the method of instruction was &quot;non-standard&quot;. That clinched it for me, as I like to try new ideas - even if it is only to prove that the old ideas are better. I did find that the book written less clearly than the magazine article.The first section of the book presents Jaworowski's (and that of Lefty Kreh who is Jaworowski's mentor) method of flycasting - using the variable stoke method taught by many modern flycasting instructors. The book makes extensive use of high quality photos to supplement the text. The photos were selected from many taken by means of high-speed photography. Although the photos are quite good and show the casts from a number of angles they all appear to be relatively short casts (even with an extended long casting stroke). If the reader will study the text and photos and then get out and practice the method I think that he (or she) can see if it improves their flycasting.I feel that the book could have shown a composite photo (or a multiple exposure photo) showing that the tip of the rod follows a straight line path throughout the long stroke (or not).The second section of the book many practical casts that can be applied to fishing situations. I found this section of the book to be somewhat more clearly written than the first section. A couple of the casts (hooking to the left or right) I haden't seen before and am eager to try for myself.As the author says himself - you can't learn to cast simply by reading a book - but I think the book can be helpful to those willing to practice the methods presented - particularly those practical fishing situation casts."},{"Title":"Cast, The","review":"I recomend this book to anyone who wants to improve your distance and feel of the cast.This book teaches you to stop thinking about the clock face, 11oclock, 1 oclock ect. and to load and point the rod the correct way."},{"Title":"Cast, The","review":"With the application of physics (don't let that scare you), Ed Jaworowski has debunked the &quot;old school&quot; method of casting a fly.

In any case, the streams were small and brushy and being an obsessive, I tried about a dozen rods before settling on what I liked to cast -- a short fiberglass rod from Scott. Then one day I decided to buy a fast action saltwater rod to fish for stripers in the Long Island sound. I quickly learned that I didn't really know how to cast that kind of rod that kind of distance, let alone into the wind. About a year later, I took an introductory class on fly fishing with my father whom I had talked into learning the sport. Ed Jaworowski was the teacher. I can say first hand that he can cast a fly line an incredible distance -- and he can teach how. His book had just come out at the time, though I didn't acquire a copy until recently. After all these years, I can say that this is an excellent book on casting the fly rod in a way that maximizes the efficiency of the rod; I strongly recommend it for anyone interested in saltwater fly fishing in particular."},{"Title":"Cast, The","review":"The best casting book I've read.

Should she behave passively? Use pepper spray? A gun?Most people hope they'll get lucky and never be attacked. For those who want to think ahead, there is Paxton Quigley's new book, \\"Stayin' Alive.\\"It turns out that pepper spray may not do you a lot of good when it is raining or snowing. A woman is just as likely to disable herself as the attacker when it's windy or when using the spray indoors.Knives and baseball bats are particularly problematic, because women have to get very close to their attackers to use them, and male criminals - that is, most criminals - tend to be much stronger physically than their female victims. When it comes to physical contact, women generally lose those fights.The advantage of a gun is that it is ideal for keeping the criminal far away from the victim. And the victim isn't responsible for restraining the criminal, as police officers are when arresting suspects. A woman simply wants to keep the criminal away from her.There have been a lot of good books lately exploding the myth that guns endanger people's safety. (And at least one very notable movie, Larry Elder's \\"Michael & Me,\\" devastatingly tackles many of the false claims in Michael Moore's \\"Bowling for Columbine.\\") Quigley's book covers a lot of ground, such as the myths about personal defense, when it is appropriate to use lethal force, whether there are any risks to firing a gun while pregnant (apparently not), how often children are killed by accidental gun shots (very rarely) and how one goes about choosing the best gun for a particular individual's needs. The book answers these questions from a woman's perspective.What works defensively for men doesn't always work for women. As Quigley points out, women who used a gun to resist an attack were 2.5 times more likely to escape uninjured than those who behaved passively. Guns aren't as beneficial for men. They are only 1.4 times more likely to escape uninjured than those who behaved passively.The book includes real-life examples of defensive gun use and offers academic research on the millions of times each year that people use guns defensively. These good-news stories help Quigley illustrate how women actually react in life-threatening situations. And she also does well explaining what women should know before choosing a gun.The book could have gone further debunking common misperceptions about guns. Take the claim that \\"you're more likely to shoot yourself or a family member than kill an attacker.\\" This study assumed that whenever anyone in a gun-owning home was killed by a gun, it was that gun that caused the harm. But academics have found that at least 86 percent of the time, that assumption was wrong - and most of other cases were suicides.While recent polls show that more households own guns after 9/11, there is still a lot of fear and uncertainty about guns, which may keep people from doing what is best for their family's safety. Quigley's book cuts through a lot of that unjustified fear.John R. Lott Jr. is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of \\"The Bias Against Guns.\\""},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"Paxton Quigley is at it again in her 2004 book, \\"Stayin' Alive.\\" Many people, for many various reasons, strongly object to women possessing guns. All who prey upon women object to armed females because their prey isn't supposed to even think about fighting back. Others have a death fetish.A far deadlier device is the automobile. People who object to women driving and riding automobiles are shunned in our society. The real reason is that driving is a sign of maturity, responsibility, and independence in our culture. Yet the automobile is a bigger killer than guns, and guns are intended to be dangerous-it makes guns useful as a deterrent and useful for shutting off an attack. My personal opinion is that if someone isn't responsible enough to own a gun, they shouldn't be licensed to drive automobiles either. The automobile is harder to use safely-guns are really simple mechanical devices.In \\"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World,\\" Paxton Quigley provides success stories of women saving their own lives and the lives of their children with handguns. She discusses the issues of child safety-and \\"CAP laws\\" (Child Access Prevention). Quigley taught me a few things in her book: warnings about how your VIN compromises your automobile's anti-theft devices and security measures for your checks and your stolen wallet are useful information for anybody. In addition to providing evidence against the modern media-driven urban myths about firearms, Quigley covers tactics, formal schools, buying guns, choosing ammunition and equipment, and recommending non-gun alternative weapons. There is even a chapter on \\"Sport Shooting and Hunting,\\" which most women probably won't find interesting-despite feminist rhetoric about access to the \\"boys' tree house,\\" guns and hunting are still regarded as a \\"guy thing.\\" This may be the only exposure to hunting for many women-I recommend everyone get a hunting license even if they don't hunt because the hunter safety course by your state's wildlife management department will introduce you to gun safety, you'll learn about your state's wild animals, and you'll have a better idea of what is going on in \\"public lands.\\" Plus, your license fee will care for public lands and the creatures living on them. You need not hunt simply because you got a license! I find it funny that so many know nothing about a subject, yet have their own \\"expert opinion\\" on it. Guns are not for everyone. Being informed about guns, even if you cannot or will not own any, is important for any adult who can vote. \\"Stayin' Alive\\" isn't the last word in gun knowledge, but you could do worse.I am fairly knowledgeable about firearms-23 years in the military, two decades of security officer experience (with anti-terrorist work), and a library of gun books. I don't know everything about guns, so I keep adding to my library. \\"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World\\" is a worthwhile addition to my library. Paxton Quigley taught me new things in her book. This book is more about WHY having a gun may be good than how to use a gun-and gives the reader a tool to find qualified instructors. It is finally sinking in that adults need to provide their own bottom-line security because nobody else will."},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"It is ironic that the people who need to have a gun the most are the ones who are afraid to own one: women. Paxton Quigley has been working to change all that. This little book gives a quickie course on what women need to know and why they need to know it. The book contains a number of true stories of women using guns to protect themselves. And as every such book needs to do, it exposes all the lies the media tell about guns.Give a copy of this to every woman friend you have. After reading this, you'll be wondering why you and everyone else in this society has been so convinced for so long that it is a bad thing to have a gun around. This book explodes many of the lies and myths that have been packed around the image of the gun and the notion of gun-ownership, as well as the image of gun owners (read \\"gun nuts\\"). The biggest myth, of course, is \\"911\\". People infer almost magical powers to dialing 911. Read this book and find out why only doing that is suicidal.The Second Amendment is needed now more than ever, because now not only the Second but the First and Fourth Amendments are slipping away; and this is happening at the most critical time in our history. If you don't know why, readWhile America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination Are Destroying America From Within. Things are going to get worse, much worse. People living near the border already have guns: they need them every day. But illegals and jihadists are being bussed throughout the country. They blend in with the peaceful and moderate and are \\"invisible\\" until they strike. Then, everyone says, \\"why didn't we see them?\\" Read Michelle Malkin's book and its stories about crimes committed by these people. We don't have much time. Learn why, then act to protect yourself."},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author.

As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere."},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"There has been no finer, more consistent author in the realm of balanced, incisive information on the topics of women, firearms and contemporary society.

This book should be a must read for all families with guns in the house."},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"I'm not a fan of the NRA. Shooting my mouth off is more my style. However, Paxton Quigley's take on firearms and women is so sensible, it makes me feel ridiculous for not taking this practical step toward self-protection. I'm not afraid of shooting an assailant...I'm pretty sure I could aerate any thug who broke into my home or who threatened me or my loved ones and do a big high five afterwards. My concern is that, in confrontational situations, I start to shake, and I'm afraid I'd never be able to hit the target. Ms. Quigley provides us with a very readable book that answers a lot of questions and clears up a lot of misinformation. She gives us a basic education on types of guns, how to choose the right one, selecting ammunition (there are types of ammo that will blast such a wide area, you barely have to aim at your target...perfect for trembling types like me. Paxton is not a one-note diva. She also gives sensible and practical tips on non-gun types of self defense, and does a great job explaining what works and what's just going to get you in more trouble. Forget the can of pepper spray, for example. It works only when the weather is right and the wind is blowing away from you. I've read defense books that are still telling us to \\"jam that spike heel into the attacker's foot.\\" Fine, except what if I'm wearing running shoes...or that pair of Laboutins that are individually worth more than anything else I own? Stepping on an attacker's foot is annoying, not crippling. Now you have a cranky rapist on your hands. Paxton's suggestions are designed to delay the attacker long enough so a woman can make her getaway. Much more sensible than trying to disable someone with a toe stomp. Whether one chooses to heavy up or not, reading this book provides food for thought, do-able safety tips and reasonable ways to defend yourslf. The best self-protection is prevention. Locking doors and windows, being aware of your surroundings, noticing what--and who--is around you, avoiding obvious danger areas. For women who can reasonably say that are at some risk, I'd say \\"buy a gun and Paxton's book.\\" For others in less precarious positions, I'd say \\"Buy Paxton's book and then decide.\\""},{"Title":"Stayin' Alive: Armed and Female in an Unsafe World","review":"Stayin' Alive is a real eye-opener.

Marion Crawford was one of the most prolific, widely-read novelists of the English-speaking world--a sort of Sidney Sheldon of the Edwardian era. Now, his novels are banished to the musty shelves of old-fashioned romance and historical fiction, but his supernatural tales live on, most especially \\"The Upper Berth\\" and \\"The Screaming Skull.\\"Lee Weinstein has collected all eight of Crawford's supernatural stories, some of them gothic in the extreme, others oozing pathos. But this author was at his best when writing of the sea and its unforgiving dead. Many of his stories retain a place of honor in ghostly anthologies for their atmosphere of slowly-building horror. I am in agreement with Lee Weinstein when he says, \\"One can only regret that he did not write more of them.\\"\\"The Dead Smile\\"--A gothic tale of forbidden love and vengeance from beyond the tomb. We 21st century readers are a bit more used to dealing with the theme of incest, but when Crawford published this tale, it must have shocked many Victorian sensibilities. Incestuous hints abound. The evil, dying Sir Hugh Ockram, his son, and his son's fianc&eacute;e all have the same hellish smile: \\"...She smiled--and the smile was like the shadow of death and the seal of damnation upon her pure, young face.\\" The best scenes are in the vault below the castle, where the Lords of Ockram lie in burial shrouds, but not entombed.\\"The Screaming Skull\\"--A doctor murders his wife by pouring molten lead in her ear. He dies mysteriously with his throat torn out. The old seaman who inherits the doctor's cottage also inherits a skull in a hat box. Something inside the skull rattles when he shakes it. When he tries to get rid of the skull, the screams begin.\\"Man Overboard!\\"--This story was worth the price of the book for me, because I'd never seen it before, and it's a great ghost story. Just let the obscure nautical language flow past you, e.g. \\"I coiled down the mizzen-topsail downhaul myself, and was going aft to see how she headed up...\\" This is a story of identical twin brothers who both love the same woman. When they go to sea on the 'Boston Belle,' one brother is swept overboard during a storm and drowns--but somehow remains part of the crew. As is true in most supernatural stories featuring a wedding, the innocent bride meets a horrible fate.\\"For the Blood is the Life\\"--I don't much care for vampire stories, but this one is wonderfully eerie. Two men are dining on the roof of an old tower-fortress on the Southern Italian coast. After moonrise, the guest sees a figure lying on a mound of earth near the tower and goes to investigate. When he returns, his host tells him the story of the grave-mound.\\"The Upper Berth\\"--A business traveler who makes many Atlantic crossings secures a berth on the 'Kamchatka,' bound for Liverpool. He requests a room with a double bunk and is disappointed to learn that he will have a roommate in the upper berth. The first night of the voyage, his roommate runs screaming out of the small room and throws himself overboard. The business traveler learns that three other men who booked into room 105 have killed themselves in the same fashion, and he is determined to investigate.\\"By the Waters of Paradise\\"--A gothic tale that has a happy ending for a change. A melancholy young man is raised by his superstitious Welsh nurse in an ancestral castle, surrounded by gardens and fountains. One night the old nurse sees \\"One--two leaden coffins, fallen from the ceiling!\\" Sure enough, his parents die, and the nurse tells her charge the story of the Woman of the Water.

Finally, he instructs his young daughter to return the doll to its owner. The daughter doesn't return, but the doll does.\\"The King's Messenger\\"--A man is seated between a lovely young girl and her beloved at a dinner party, and learns that his right-hand neighbor is the King's Messenger.

She was delighted when she found the pokemon book. It has tons of great songs from the show on TV and from the movie. Your 8-10 year old will really enjoy this music book."},{"Title":"Pokemon - 2.B.A. Master: Piano Fun! Pack","review":"I was looking for a piano songbook for childern to play on a piano. I should have realized it was not just the songbook from the price. It comes with an electronic toy piano. The songbook is play by numbers and this did nothing for somebody that is learning to play piano. Very disappointing. Age level is pre-school, before able to read."},{"Title":"Thesaurus Larousse","review":"Are you REALLY serious about improving your essay writing skills as well as you vocabulary? If you are, then this is the book that will help you to do it. To properly use a Thesaurus a) of this size and b) written only in French, your language skills must to be quite strong. So be prepared. This is a book to acquire as you are approaching near fluency. When I was finally ready to use the Larousse Thesaurus as it was meant to be used, I was able to judge the nuance of the French language (most of the time.) Still, I found it to be so helpful a tool that I haven't been able to write a paper without it since I bought it.If you are serious about majoring in French, not just getting through the &quot;dreaded&quot; college language requirements, I would really advise you to invest in one of the larger Larousse Thesaurus editions as well as a French-French Petit Robert Dictionary (preferably one that is several inches thick) Both will be well worn, put to good use and worth each and every penny by the time you get your degree."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"Here is that unusual New Orleans book, beautifully written by Jeannette Hardy and Lake Douglas, and sumptuously photographed by Richard Sexton, that journeys outside the heavily touristed French Quarter and into the neighborhoods that truly infuse the city with its unique spirit. French Quarter gardens are not neglected, of course, but the book is easily the best of its kind at revealing the entire far-flung city, its people and their lovely and sometimes idiosyncratic gardens."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"I bought this book hoping to get some ideas on how to make my backyard into a New Orleans garden oasis and this book delivered. Not only is it a helpful resource for gardeners (it has a chart of commonly used plants in New Orleans gardens), but it also is nice to just leaf through and look at the pictures. My only gripe is that there weren't enough gardens featured."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"I was fortunate enough to find this book in a wonderful little garden shop tucked away inside the French Quarter of New Orleans. If you've never visited and seen their charming style and beauty first hand, this book is filled with superb photographs that come to life, with a wealth of great information about the homes and gardens you really will feel like you're there. For any lover of gardening, New Orleans simply transcends conventional time and space, capturing all of the senses and inspiring the heart and the imagination like no place else in the world. . .from the petite cottages to the elaborate plantations, there is garden for every home and every occassion! Tres-magnifique!!!"},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"Not only is the photography lush and gorgeous, but I also love the way this book has chapters on a variety of New Orleans gardens. There are examples of hidden courtyards and terraces as well as public parks and Garden District homes. There's even a comprehensive section on the history of the city. I treasure this book all the more given the recent tragic events with the hurricanes."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"Quality of photos: amazing. I'm very pleased with this book. I especially love the pictures of the courtyard, balcony, and porch gardens. It's also nice to read the little stories behind the gardens presented as well. I strive to maintain gardens as glorious and lush as these but can only come so close."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"Are \\"Southern Review\\" and I looking at the same book?? I've been through this book hundreds of times and each time I enjoy it more. The chapters are organized into the different geographic and cultural areas and their different gardens. All are fascinating. I'll admit that I skip the historical chapter much of the time and go straight for the photos of the French Quarter gardens. I really appreciate that the authors include gardens from very modest homes as well as the grander ones. The chapter on the gardens of Shotguns, Cottages and Bungalows is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Gardens of New Orleans: Exquisite Excess","review":"New Orleans is a sultry, seductive city whose gardens reflect a rich history. Decadent nineteenth-Century buildings and courtyards provide an exquisite backdrop for exotic profligate vegetation. These serve as inspiration for all garden enthusiasts.Beginning with A Brief History, that may not be brief enough; - the book stolidly drags the reader on through endless bayous of pages that recount the minutiae of the French settlers, Native Americans, African Slaves, German and Swiss farmers.Subsequently, it combines the cities latest horticultural overlay of recent Southeast Asian immigrants depicted at vegetable markets with mounds of cut mint. Then, it offers impassive photos of the Warehouse Arts District, and dilapidated fence structures of no particular aesthetic merit, interest, or relevance.The few published photos available to the buyer are quite nice. Nonetheless, the book itself, offers little more in the way of exotic balcony gardens, or lush French Quarter design to inspire ardent gardeners. This pre-Katrina effort adroitly circumvents all that is attractive, interesting, vibrant or comely within the city. It plods along with sluggish text, mostly unremarkable photography, and seemingly indifferent editing."},{"Title":"Powerful Golf","review":"Michael J. Russ' Powerful Golf: Lower Your Golf Score By Changing The Way You Think is a 77-minute CD audiobook that teaches the listeners how to improve their golf scores by taking control of their attitudes and emotions. From learning to rise above anger and frustration; to the use of heightened awareness; the implementation of practical self-talk; and the transcendental virtue of forgiveness, Powerful Golf presents itself as an exceptional motivational guide and especially appropriate for a sport in which confidence makes or breaks the player. If you play a dedicated game of golf, then Powerful Golf is the audiobook for you!"},{"Title":"Powerful Golf","review":"I only picked up golf last October and though I have taken many lessons I seemed to be stuck in a rut. I love to listen to books on tape when I am driving, it makes the time go faster. So when I saw this book about golf on, it seemed perfect. Not only was it easy to listen to, but it was also very clear and concise. The author is very focused on getting your mental game in order as a way to lower your golf score. I didn't realize what a big part the mental game played until I listened to this. My score has begun to drop off its plateau and I am now hovering in the 103 range. With these concepts in place each time I play I feel that I will be playing bogey golf within the month. Kudos to the author for touching on a subject which is rarely taught and seldom thought about."},{"Title":"Powerful Golf","review":"I purchased this audio book for my husband whose game is well beyond the skill level addressed in this book. He told me this book would probably be good for players hoping to break 90, who need help with developing the proper golf swing."},{"Title":"Powerful Golf","review":"My 19 year old son took up golf about 3 years ago, and seemed to enjoy it - but for the fact that if he missed a shot he would throw his clubs, pitch a tantrum, and mess up the remainder of his game. It took about 3 weeks, but this audio book helped us work on him focusing on what was important, and letting go of the bad stuff. After all, we ALL have bad games. Now, he's much better at taking his time, and when his ball is in the bushes, he deals with it, and let's it go."},{"Title":"The Selected Prose of John Gray (British Authors Ser, 1880-1920)","review":"Although John Gray is known mainly for his poetry, this volume collects many of his prose works. His short novel Park is included in full, as are reviews and short stories collected from various sources. Many are reprinted here for the first time since their initial publication. This is an invaluable companion volume to Ian Fletcher's collection of Gray's poetry, and an excellent insight into a much neglected writer from Britain's late Victorian era."},{"Title":"The conduct of the understanding","review":"The book itself is incredible and has changed the way I think. However, it's heavy reading and a bit dated so many time I'll have to read through a paragraph multiple times in order to get the intended meaning of it. This is made worse by the fact that the OCR software that was used to scan in the book is imperfect... so many times it's difficult to tell if Locke is just expressing something in a way that is confusing to me, or if it's confusing because one of the words is wrong, or both."},{"Title":"Holy War Online: A Debate in Cyberspace","review":"This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the \\"publisher's review\\", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."},{"Title":"Holy War Online: A Debate in Cyberspace","review":"After having been told about this book by a good friend who also could not believe it she was finally able to get the copy borrowed again from her co-worker. The first 50 pages or so were mildly interesting only if the topic interested you (it didn't interest me) and if you lean towards people having sometimes idiotic arguments appeals to you. Then after around six weeks of this nonsense is when the \\"author\\" gets involved in the tpic discussion. The \\"author\\" seems to have an agenda right from the start and yes that agenda seeems to be agitation, irritation, sowing discord and creating a climate to intentionally encourage retaliation. I even wondered if the objective right from the start was to create a scene where the \\"author\\" would then be able to do noting more than copy all of the postings and caal it a book. In his conclusion he speas of a sequel which makes one think even more that this was a \\"set up\\" from the start. And the concluding posting is such a childish example of \\"getting in the last word\\" and in such a demeaning way that the author should be ashamed. Glad this was a borrowed book!"},{"Title":"Holy War Online: A Debate in Cyberspace","review":"Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this \\"so-called\\" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a \\"book\\"."},{"Title":"Create a Life That Tickles Your Soul: Finding Peace, Passion, and Purpose (Tickle Your Soul S.)","review":"I first read &quot;Create a Life....&quot; about a year ago at a time when I had been phased out of a job I thought I loved, my mother died and a friend was suffering from depression. I was angry, stressed and burnt out. As a sort of one year anniversary gift to myself I have just re-read the book. It is concise. The writing is clear and crisp, and the ideas are beautifully supported with everyday examples. Among the most meaningful tidbits for me are the three words, &quot;You are enough.&quot; For most of my life the more I accomplished the harder I pushed. I was rewarded with bonuses and kudos and still felt the need to compete. Finally, I gave myself permission to get off the merry go round and pursue other interests. And as Zoglio advises, I let go of anger and resentment and began to take care of myself. I now choose what I do. I have time for volunteering and time for me. This is a book of simple truths... if you want love and abundance in your life, give it away. If you believe in something, believe in it all the way. Choose how you use each day of your life. The pages are filled with passion. My best advise after the reading the book a second time is buy one for a friend."},{"Title":"Create a Life That Tickles Your Soul: Finding Peace, Passion, and Purpose (Tickle Your Soul S.)","review":"Jack Canfield (Chicken Soup for the Soul) was right on the mark when he called Tickle Your Soul a \\"gem\\". Having recently read the book, when I think of gem and Tickle in the same context, the \\"Hope\\" Diamond comes to mind. Boomers.....there IS Hope. Talk about a wake up call! Until I read Tickle, I never really thought in terms of a second phase of life the way the author presents it (the best one!). I enjoyed Dr. Zoglio's approach to \\"reinventing your life\\" as she takes you through a touching, thought provoking, empowering process where you will, among other things, let go of old baggage, move out of your comfort zone, dream, find your purpose, and take action. I found the exercises to be fun and easy, and they left me feeling enlightened, energized and focused.Tickle is loaded with practical wisdom, so I suggest a highlighter. True, you will have your own Life's Purpose Plan to follow, but it is nice to be able to quickly reference those gems that lit you up in the first place. I do it to re-energize and stay on track. Just a few of my favorites: \\"You deserve a life that is exquisitely tailored to the uniqueness of you.\\" \\"No one else knows what pictures fill your mind or what passions fuel your heart.\\" \\"Passion in life stems from a forward focus. If we are not growing, learning and evolving, we will begin to wither inside.\\" \\"Suddenly, we have an urge to do what we've always wanted to do...before it's too late.\\"Dr. Zoglio has done a masterful job of taking a formidable task, and presenting it in a very manageable, doable and enjoyable process. When I finished Tickle I thought....\\"it can't be this easy!\\". Well, I had an opportunity very recently to share a few of her exercise questions with a relative that was really struggling with some life's purpose/passion issues. The results: Truly incredible...almost miraculous! I highly recommend this book. Don't waste a precious moment. Tickle your soul, live your life with purpose, and follow your dreams!"},{"Title":"Create a Life That Tickles Your Soul: Finding Peace, Passion, and Purpose (Tickle Your Soul S.)","review":"I received &quot;Create A Life That Tickles Your Soul&quot; as a gift from friends as a means of inspiring me during the most overwhelming time in my life. I had turned forty a few months earlier and my husband of nearly eleven years had just died. I was facing a myriad of challenges and this book was like a beacon in the darkness. It affirmed much that I already knew and helped me open doors in my life just as many were closing behind me. I found Suzanne's writing style to be flowing and the message both educational and enlivening. It was as if I was sitting comortably in my living room and engaging in conversation with a friend. The book mark embellished with a feather is taped to my computer monitor as a reminder that I can do anything I set my mind and heart upon. Thank you Suzanne for the blessing that is your book!

Dr. Zoglio does an excellent job of describing the keys to happiness. Long ago, I independently arrived at many of the same conclusions about happiness, but I have never been able to articulate them as clearly and simply as Dr. Zoglio does in her book. While reading it, I found myself underlining text and writing notes on almost every page.

When I bought the first copy(for myself)I opened it to the chapter titled &quot;Make a difference every day&quot;. This is the chapter I read first. Since then, I have refered to most of the content of this book, many times. Dr.Zoglio writes in a way that makes &quot;The Tickle book&quot; easy reading and one does not have to be a therapist or a group facilitator to understand and get the message! &quot;Tickle&quot; is inspirational,uplifting and it gives a great dose of positiveness...all of which we need in large quantities, especially these days!"},{"Title":"Create a Life That Tickles Your Soul: Finding Peace, Passion, and Purpose (Tickle Your Soul S.)","review":"Wow, wow, wow!

A great, upbeat volume that will compel you to re-read it again and again.

If I get nothing else out of this book, the affirmations alone would have been worth the price I paid. This book helps you change your outlook when you are down on life in general. It gives you positive steps to take control of your life. I especially liked the section on dreams. So many people put down the notion that we should have dreams for our life. We should dream and dream big. It's very easy to read and flows easily from chapter to chapter. If you are a person who does not have a lot of time to read, the chapters are divided up well to allow for stopping. Excellent book. I bought two and gave one to a friend.

Finding books that appeal to more than one grade level is a challenge.I have found that the pictures in this version of 'Puss' appeal immensely to kindergartners through third graders. (Fourth and Fifth grade children also like it, but are often embarassed to say so in a classroom setting!). Children who often have a hard time sitting still for a story have sat transfixed as I read this book, holding the pictures in front of them all the time and giving them lots of opportunities to check out the wonderful use of light and color. The illustrator uses a lot of wonderful yellow that is very appealing to young children and seems to draw them into the book. I love reading this book out loud both to see children's reaction and also because I love the detail and color in the pictures.Reading this book aloud has also sparked some beautiful art work from young children."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"It shouldn't surprise anyone that the stock of \\"Puss In Boots\\" went up when \\"Shrek 2\\" came out in theaters. Suddenly that little cat with the fancy footwear was garnering a lot more interest than he ever had before. I've always wondered why this fairy tale was ignored by the Disney animation studios in their heyday. Now if you're looking for the quintessential version of the tale, there are really only two illustrators to pick between. You can either choose the multi-talented Fred Marcellino version (responsible for some of my favorite picture books like, \\"I, Crocodile\\" and \\"The Story of Little Babaji\\") or you can go the Paul Galdone route. I personally have always found Galdone to be a bit of a bore, except in the cat department. For some reason, Galdone was always particularly good at drawing amusing felines. I'm not entirely certain why Amazon.com has decided to link these two titles with one set of reviews, but just to clear everything up I'd like to state that for all its charms I'm eschewing the Paul Galdone version of \\"Puss\\" and instead reviewing the Marcellino version in its stead. May God have mercy on my soul.There once was a miller who had three sons. At the start of the story the miller has kicked the bucket and the sons have divided his paltry legacy amongst themselves. The youngest son is left with only a cat... but WHAT a cat it is! The puss tells the man to give him a good pair of boots and once he has done so the feline will make his master's fortune. The youngest son is fortunately a game sort (or perhaps he was merely charmed by the idea of a talking cat). Whatever the case, he gives Puss what he wants and the story chronicles the animal's clever ploys. He poaches wild game for the king. He dresses his master all in finery and makes him out to be a Marquis. In the last part of the book, Puss tricks an ogre who is half a sandwich shy of a picnic into becoming a yummy little mouse. After subsequent inevitable gobblings on the part of the cat, his master marries the king's daughter and \\"Puss became a great lord and gave up chasing mice, except just once in a while for the fun of it\\".The book is a direct translation of Charles Perrault's original tale from the French by translator Malcolm Arthur. Mr. Arthur is to be commended for it too, by the way. Not only is the book infinitely readable, but its harsher moments are lessened through his wording. In some versions of this tale, the youngest son's contemplations of eating his pretty puss might've come off as barbaric. Here, they seem more wistful than malicious. Likewise the parts where the cat threatens the peasants with agreeing to a lie with the threat that if they don't \\"you'll be cut up into sausage meat\\" strains credulity (or do they trust a cat in boots more than one not in boots?). Still, there's something about the pacing of the tale that works in its favor. This may also certainly be due to Fred Marcellino's illustrations, which are truly lovely. The cat, for his part, is both charming and catlike. The pictures appear to have been drawn in colored pencil or possibly pastels. Whatever the case, they've a soft and hazy feel that compliment the tale to a tee.So if you're on the look-out of the definitive version of \\"Puss In Boots\\", there is no need to look further. If the praise I've lavished on it does no good, consider the 1991 Caldecott Honor it garnered itself once upon a time. A classic tale that constantly shocks me when I consider how few children actually know it. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"The artwork and the large font are beautiful. And I like the translation. It's rich enough to introduce some new vocabulary, without being so thick it can't be understood."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"Sorry about the 1-star rating -- it is not for the book's content (I can't read it), but for the horrible way it displays on my iPad.The cover page is nice and big, fills the screen, and looks great. Ever subsequent page however is about half size, meaning that two pages fit across the iPad screen, and the font is too small to be readable.Furthermore, the iPad version only allows landscape viewing, and the stupid Kindle app remains in this orientation after returning to my books list, and moving on to another book.Am I missing something here?"},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"This new translation of the \\"fairy\\" story first presented by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) in his Tales of Mother Goose in 1697 was illustrated by Fred Marcellino and translated by Malcolm Arthur. It was a 1991 Caldecott Honor book (that is, a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. The youngest son of a recently deceased miller receives a cat as his inheritance. He feels that he will soon die of starvation (after he has eaten the cat) since he has no other possessions. But, the cat convinces him to get him boots. The cat proceeds to find a fortune and a position for his young master."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"Puss in Boots is a wonderful story. This book is so beautiful that is like a precious work of art. A great read aloud with exceptional illustrations. Children and adults adore it. Presenting this tale to children takes great thought though. Try to avoid the dishonesty, terrorism, and thievery and focus on resourcefulness, first impressions, and survival. Fred Marcellino is one of the top illustrators of our time. Wish he had a website!"},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"I am going to start this review by pointing out that most, if not all, of the reviews on this page are NOT for the \\"Paul Galdone\\" version of \\"Puss In Boots. In fact, these same reviews appear on the pages for the \\"Fred Marcellino\\" illustrated version.Next I am going to say that I did not purchase this particular edition. I did not get the cassette and have not heard the narration.I am reviewing this though because my children (3 and 5) are really into cassette readings at this moment and so I would sincerely suggest that you try this version of \\"Puss in Boots\\" if you haven't tried cassettes previously.As for this book, we really enjoyed it. I had completely forgotten much of how the tale unfolded until we ran across this on my entering Kindergartner's Summer Reading List.What you will find in this story is the classic tale of how a cat helps a bumpkin to become a prince. You will also find that Mr. Galdone pulls no punches in his retelling. When he does a translation, he cuts nothing out.Thus, in \\"Puss in Boots\\", you will find that Puss eats the Giant --after he becomes a mouse, of course. And that Puss lies and carries on in a non-PC manner. He kills wild game and threatens haymakers with violence.He says: \\"When the King drives past and asks to whom this field belongs, you must reply, \`To the Marquis of Carabas.' If you don't, I shall chop you fine as mincemeat.\\"Despite the fact that violence is one of the things banned from our house, I have found that my children (3 and 5) don't seem to take much notice of the threat, nor do they seem disturbed by giant's consumption.Four stars. Classic art style. Classic story. Minus one for violence and lying."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"I remember hearing this story as young as six. My grandmother's cat disagrees with the story in that cats do not like to wear clothes. I however now have my very own copy of the story on the bookshelf. It's beautifully told and I read it ever so often. The illustrations are wonderful. It's definitely a good choice for younger children at reading time and/or bedtime. It's short, the pictures help explain a lot of what's going on, and the book is large. That last part may sound strange, but have you ever tried 'Reading Circle' with a small book... With 20 children on the floor all wanting to see the pictures and my need to keep their attention... The book is definitely a keeper. Even if not for them, for my own childhood memories of the story."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"\\"Puss in Boots\\" has endured as a classic children's book because the story is excellent. The graphics are intricate, crisp, and clear. I read \\"Puss in Boots\\" at a Read Across America event to 50 second-graders. Most, if not all, of them had never heard of \\"Puss in Boots\\". There was shock and outcry when the Ogre shrank himself to the size of a mouse and then was eaten by Puss. They wanted to know why!!! The Ogre was a victim of his own ego - a show off. And Puss was ruthless. The childrens' imaginations and reasoning were stretched and the story gave them a lot to think about.

I though it would be a nice supplement for my daughter, to reinforce that many of these movies are reinterpretations of time-tested classic stories. Although it took a bit to explain inheritance to my 3 1/2 year old she loves this book. The pictures are marvelous, and it has that crafty cat of course-most kids like the trickster character.

This book should be a part of everyone's library."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"A wonderful story but somewhat short.

I highly recommend \\"The Steadfast Tin Soldier,\\" illustrated by Marcellino, with 5 stars!!!"},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"Paul Galdone's rendition of the classic fairy tale Puss in Boots sticks closely to Perrault's original, with innocently cheerful artistic representation of the story's action-filled scenes. The story is well told, with enough repetition to hold the attention of younger listeners while providing enough detail to interest older readers. While Galdone's artistic interpretation is not as impressive as some editions of Puss in Boots, this book provides a good choice for introducing the story to readers who aren't quite ready for the more difficult original story.Fred Marcellino's artistic interpretation of Puss in Boots, narrated by a spare translation of Perrault's original story, is nothing short of impressive. The book is a visual feast, its fantastical events unfolding with their own strange coherency. The mood of this book is a bit darker than Galdone's, with the puckish Puss killing rabbits for the king \\"without mercy or compassion\\" and the giant's ogreish meals peeking out from under silver trays as servants glide past Puss on his way up the lushly carpeted stair. Parents of sensitive readers may wish to stick with Galdone's version, but this version accurately captures the mood of Perrault's original story.Puss's outrageous success in advancing his master's interests through deception may well be troubling for parents, who will wish to interpret the story to their young children while still encouraging them to tell the truth. Puss's panache is undeniably attractive, and (unlike Toad in The Wind in the Willows), he never receives the just consequences of his unscrupulous behavior. While some parents will choose to avoid the story, it should be noted that Puss's victims were all taken in by means of their own moral weakness: the king was overly fond of good food, which made him vulnerable to Puss's blandishments. The princess was so shallow as to be impressed by the miller's son's clothing (provided in her presence by her weak-willed father). The ogre was too arrogant to view Puss as a threat, and foolishly turned himself into a mouse, opening himself up for attack. All of these people naively accepted the line presented to them, and so were taken in.Puss is a scoundrel, and children ought to know that there are scoundrels in the world who will prey upon the morally weak. The only danger is that the audience will actually be taken in by Puss's charm and admire him for his own sake."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"My daughter liked this book. I imagine any child who likes cats would. However, the animal factor isn't the only thing that makes this book pleasing to children; the book is well written and told with such energy that it makes this classic tale all the more enthralling and grabbing to young readers. Of course, the well drawn illustrations help too.The story is about a savy cat that is determined to bring good fortunes to his poor master. Along the way the cat must deal with a giant Ogre, as well as out wit a king on several occasions. The Ogre has the ability to morph into different creatures, which adds an additional fairy tale element to this adventure of a witty talking cat. The poor master originally thought he was out of luck when he got the cat, but that conclusion never held merit as the master became richly rewarded in the end all due to his loyal feline friend.I hope you give the book a try, I think your young ones will like it.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"Puss in Boots Hb (Read It Yourself)","review":"I ordered this for my 4-year-old grandson who has an imaginary kitty friend.

Mr. Galdone is a consummate illustrator who has a real talent for drawing the facial expressions of people and non-people alike.Mr. Galdone also pulls no punches. When he does a translation, he cuts nothing out, and so far we have found all of his tales very close to the originals. Thus, in \\"Puss in Boots\\", you will find that Puss eats the Giant --after he becomes a mouse, of course. Also, Puss threatens the haymakers with violence to gain his ends: \\"When the King drives past and asks to whom this field belongs, you must reply, \`To the Marquis of Carabas.'

This cat turns out to be quite clever and earns the favor of the King for his master. The cat also obtains land and a castle for his master and gives him the title of the Marquis of Carabas. The King becomes so impressed by the Marquis that he offers his daughter's hand in marriage, and the simple miller's son becomes a prince. The use of clever illustration makes this book an effective piece of folk lore. &quot;Narrative Expectations: The Folklore Connection&quot; discusses the basic pattern of a folktale. The article states that every folktale begins with the main character of the story being no different from or more special than any other character. Then, out of nowhere, the character is boosted into a &quot;supernatural world&quot; and all of a sudden he is moved up to higher society and viewed as a hero (67). This resembles the plot pattern of Puss In Boots, with the Marquis being the average character who becomes a hero. This jump to a higher level of society out of luck is strangely enough realistic in the twenty-first century. With things like inheritance, lotteries, and the stock market, a person of today could easily go from the poor miller's son to a &quot;prince.&quot; However, this is not a common occurrence. The article also states that folklore &quot;functions in part as an informal system for learning the daily logic and worldview of the people around us (71).&quot; The author chooses not to use human characters to represent Master Slyboots and the rich ogre. He could have done this easily with illustration by making Master Slyboots a servant boy and the ogre a Marquis. Instead, he uses an informal style, placing animal characters in the book. This represents a higher level: Using animals in contrast to humans in order to show the differences in people as a whole."},{"Title":"Rendezvous at Katyn: A novel based on one of the most shocking events in modern history","review":"Circa WWII - back in the days when some of our allies were not much better than the enemies we were fighting, something happened at Katyn that provides some rather considerable insight on the ways and targets of tyranny. Wipe out the intelligentsia. As in the formative days of America, the intelligentsia can be a powerful force for liberty - even counter revolution. When tyrannical change becomes fast and revolutionary, the opposition must be wiped out in a single stroke if possible - as at Katyn. The Russians tried to blame it on the Germans, and largely succeeded in a day when America was, to say the least, much more pro-Russia than it was pro-German.The slow revolution presently taking place in America has succeeded in wiping out the intelligentsia in a different, not to say more \\"moderate\\" way - death by media - death by the arts - death by academia. Either way, truth and liberty end up lying in the streets. Ultimately tyranny is a war against the truth. Perhaps you've noticed, there's not much of it around lately. \\"All that is needed for the triumph of evil is that enough good men do nothing.\\"- Burke."},{"Title":"Maritime & Port Security (SEC Nat) (Securing Our Nation)","review":"Maritime and Port Security by Captain Fred Evans is a guide for company, facility, and vessel personnel responsible for formulating policy in anticipation of maritime security incidents. The book covers many aspects of maritime security in response to domestic and international terrorism and other criminal acts including history, funding, and implementation.* \\"Pilots and flight attendants had been taught to handle hijackers in much the way that a bank teller is taught to deal with a bank robber - to cooperate, to surrender what the aggressor wants, and to stall as much as possible in the hope that reinforcements will arrive.

It should also be read by students interested in national defense, international commerce, and the effects of globalization.* \\"If terrorists could interrupt the flow of trade by creating so much fear and anxiety that free and open market principles would be sacrificed in favor of a system of heavy security inspection and regulation, they would have succeeded in slowing the progress of democratic and advanced economic countries of the world.\\" P 31* \\"In the highly competitive business of global commercial shipping, all costs must be justified and demonstrate a value added to product or service and a verifiable return on an investment.

Born a slave, Free Frank used his free time on evenings and Sundays to extract saltpeter from guano in Kentucky, as well as surveying land, and made enough money to first buy his wife out of slavery, then, with her income as a freewoman, to buy himself out of slavery. His industry, sterling character, and persistence eventually allowed him to become wealthy as a real estate developer on the Illinois frontier. He bought all of his children out of slavery, and upon his death, all of his grandchildren as well. And he did it all without ever learning to write.While certainly atypical, he is a reminder that even though the legal system was set up to the detriment of blacks throughout the slave states, it was possible for a slave with a careless or sympathetic master to become free -- and once free, to become wealthy. This is an inspiring story. Just don't read this one book and assume that you know everything you need to know about American slavery. This is the encouraging reminder that even a bigoted legal system wasn't enough to keep a hard worker from moving ahead in the relatively free market of the American frontier."},{"Title":"Free Frank: A Black Pioneer on the Antebellum Frontier","review":"The book Free Frank is an academically written book, which combines a family history with a local and national timeline and societal view.

The book covers all of the relevant topics within ERM: concepts and processes, governance, risk transfer, analytics, risk types, and applications to the business (lessons learned, case studies, etc.).The book is tilted towards banking and energy and could use an update on how ERM has become vogue among corporations in almost every other sector. It could also include more information on operational risk and Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, as well as more recent info on the topic from leading risk organizations and projects (COSO and others). It is not a one stop shop on the subject - hence just four stars.If you have a chance to work with risk managers and/or risk consultants, see the latest dashboard tools, or sit in on risk assessment and ranking exercises, I believe you'll get much more from the book. There is a lot of \\"dot-connecting\\" that needs to go on with ERM.And a special endorsement...I once received a very attractive offer from a leading Fortune 500 company for an enterprise risk manager position. I had just a little experience with ERM, but I used material from this book to get me through six probing interviews. Very few books can help a candidate quite the way this one helped me."},{"Title":"Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls","review":"A little under ten years ago I reviewed \\"Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls\\" by James Lam in Risk Professionals, the flagship magazine of the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP). In the book, Lam made ten predictions for the future of risk management. Ten years later, it is interesting to revisit his predictions and ask how many have come to pass.Here are the predictions with my comments:1. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) will become the industry standard for risk management.Not just yet, but it's on its way. Among the key findings in a recent Accenture 2011 Global Risk Management Study was, \\"More than 80 percent of the survey respondents overall have a ERM program in place or plan to have one in the next two years.\\"The study was based on a survey of C- level executives from 397 companies across ten industries in Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia. Similar studies confirm the same trend. There is not enough space, here, to name them all.2. The CRO will become prevalent in risk intensive businesses.As Lam states in his book, \\"The rise of the CRO goes hand-in-hand with the trend toward ERM\\". Again from the same study above, \\"Companies are establishing C-level oversight of the risk management function.\\"About two thirds of all survey respondents have a Chief Risk Officer operating with that title. Another 20 percent have an executive in the role fulfilling those responsibilities. Thus the criticality of risk management is being recognized by the way the function is staffed and led. That said, there is still a chasm between the traditional risk management model and ERM. A comprehensive, enterprise wide focus on managing risk is an ongoing struggle for most organizations because of the behavioral changes to overcome the conventional management of risk in silos, which companies have had in place for a long time. For that reason, ERM has been pursued by visionary companies rather than by the mainstream of companies. In short, ERM is prevalent in all the major banks across the globe. The hedge fund community in particular is increasingly implementing an ERM model in light of increasing regulation and the broker-dealer market continues to define and establish the ERM model as well.3. Audit committees will evolve into risk committees.In January 2012, the committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) issued its draft ERM - Integrated Framework to be finalized later this year. The new Framework will play a key role in the internal audit function. The Institute of Internal auditors (IIA) says internal auditors should assist both management and the audit committee in their risk management responsibilities and oversight roles by examining, evaluating, reporting, and recommending improvements on the adequacy and effectiveness of management's risk processes. However, the IIA has taken a stand on what roles internal auditing should not undertake: setting the risk appetite, imposing risk management processes, management assurance on risks, taking decisions on risk responses, implementing risk responses on management's behalf, accountability for risk management. These activities should be direct from the top of the organization. Audit committees have evolved and continue to evolve into risk committees.4. Economic capital will be in; VaR will be out.With the advent of the recent economic downturn, the government bailout that injected TARP money into the banking system, and consequent regulation such as Dodd-Frank and Basel III, economic capital is certainly in and VaR is certainly out.5. Risk transfer will be executed at the enterprise level.Partially, this prediction was already realized \\"as far as hedging and insurance strategies were concerned\\" when Lam's book went to press. Today, management of risk transfers through assessments, systems and other tools is at the enterprise level.6. Advanced technology will have a profound impact on risk management.With the rise of risk systems reflecting state of the art applications that encompass regulatory requirements and beyond, this has certainly come to pass. For example, look to the latest automated risk enhancement of Credit Valuation Adjustments which ensures limits are met on a market basis.7. A measurement standard will emerge for operational risk.This operational metric has been formulated for reporting purposes as reported each month in regulatory reports and continues to evolve internally from an operational perspective.8. Mark to market accounting will be the basis for financial reporting.Remember, loans and securities make up the bulk of a bank's assets. Thus, the method you use to establish values for these securities when preparing your financial statements affects shareholders' equity and, in turn, has an effect on a bank's profit and loss statement. In light of the 2008 financial crisis, fair value accounting under FASB 157 returned to center stage with supporters and detractors of the rule. There is also a conflict between the way the U.S. regulators approach mark to market accounting and the approach of international standards under the IFRS. In effect, rules vs. principles. For our purpose here, suffice it to say that FASB and IFRS are exploring changes to the reporting and measurement of financial instruments. In effect, the jury is still out on this prediction.9. Risk education will be a part of corporate training and college finance programs.If you are in risk and haven't seen every major university offering a graduate degree in risk management (not to mention risk training and certification from associations such as PRMIA and GARP), then you are not from this planet.10. The salary gap among risk professionals will continue to widen.Depending on what specialty skill you bring to the table (CRO and all the waterfall functions that work alongside with, or support, that office, legal, compliance, quantifiable risk, subject matter risk expertise within project management, etc.), compensation has risen significantly across the risk landscape to attract and retain talent.In short, nine out of ten predictions have come to pass. Not bad from the perspective of a ten year horizon. Well done! I hope we hear from Mr. Lam soon on his predictions for the next ten years."},{"Title":"Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls","review":"The book has a very basic and elementary level. Probably this is due to the great array of topics it includes. It is a very high level overview of risk management concepts. Good reading for the weekend."},{"Title":"Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls","review":"This book by James Lam provides an excellent insight into this current business strategic problem. In view of all the corporate governance coming from Sarbannes-Oxley legislation and Basel II capital pronouncements, this book provides the user with the building blocks in terms of explaining how credit, market, and operational risk all tie into the big picture of enterprise risk. The author enables one to understand these risks without getting bogged down in mathematical details. He effectively brings these risks together in terms of portfolio management and then presents the reader with some risk mitigation techniques. He goes beyond other books which just concentrate on financial institutions by bringing in energy firms and nonfinancial corporations in his concluding chapters. Lam's book is a must read for anyone considering a career in risk management.Gerald G.

This book makes clear that there is no one way to design and ERM model and that customizing it to the needs of the business will be the one way to optimize the outcomes desired.The book is well organized and starts with a section on setting the \\"context\\" for delving into risk management; outlining the framework of a comprehensive approach; showing real world applications in various industry contexts; and closing with some prognostications on the future of the practice.I highly recommend this book to all business managers who want to take risk management and their careers to the next level."},{"Title":"Enterprise Risk Management: From Incentives to Controls","review":"Excellent resource on Enterprise Risk Management.The author draws upon his 20 years' rich real world experience to drive the subject to home.

It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift."},{"Title":"Pancatantra: The Book of India's Folk Wisdom (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is a translation of an old Indian children's book that is, not surprisingly, also a moral tale on how to live, and, perhaps more importantly, how to govern. I'm not in a position to comment as to whether this is a good or bad translation; it is a fun read for adults and I suppose that a pretty progressive or multicultural parent could read it to their kids in place of the Brothers Grimm or something else....I liked the book. Other books in the age-old stories of wisdom from around the world: &quot;Monkey: A Journey to the West&quot; by Wu Ch'eng-en (translated by Arthur Waley, among others), the tale of Mil-e-re-pa (translated by a number of people: this one might be too risque for a lot of kids....), the 'Meditations of Marcus Aureleus', and the 'Conference of the Birds' by Farud-din Attar.

Nevertheless the book is useful.Translation is extremely dull and unimpressive. It does not flow. It is a literal translation (word by word). Beauty of the writing is lost. The only way to retain it is by translating it idiomatically, and not word by word.

It tells it like it is, in a clear, concise manner. This book will be a real eye-opener to those entering the process, and provide new insights to those immersed in, and even theoretically beyond the process. Many lawyers treat the divorce process like an on-going game, which the legal system enables. This process can victimize women, in particular. The best defense a woman can have is to be well-informed and well-prepared for the battle, which many (ex)spouses choose to wage. Every woman involved in a divorce, regardless of her lawyers ability and reputation, owes it to herself to become educated about the process, the potential problems, and helpful strategies.

Lauren has tried to move on, but has not had closure on the tragedy so decides it is time to head to the South American country to learn what caused her mother, who seemed to have it all, to suddenly kill herself.In Peru, Lauren nearly dies in what seems like a questionable accident. Only the quick action of local psychiatrist Dr. Armando Torres saves her life. He tells her she should go home as it is not safe for her here. She wonders whether he wants her to leave for his own reasons as she demands he tell her what he knows about her mother's death as he was there when she took her life.NOT WITHOUT THE TRUTH is a fast-paced romantic suspense tale that starts at hyperspeed when Laurena arrives in South America and never slows down until the final altercation. Lauren is a terrific center holding the plot together with her need to know, which in turn provides some insight into her mother (at least from her memories). Armando in some ways is the more interesting character as the audience wonders what was his relationship with the mother including how involved was he on the night of the accident. Kay David writes a strong enjoyable action-packed romantic thriller that readers will devour in one sitting.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"THE SHADOW IN THE GLASS","review":"It is always a pleasant suprise when a new author appears on the fantasy scene with a book that should keep them there for a long time.

What is a shocker is the elegant looking woman at the other end of the bar. A planet like this dump only houses tired rejects servicing the lowlifes that frequent places like this. However, he ends up interceding when she becomes embroiled in a bar fight after she is accused of cheating during a game of chance.Moriah needs to leave Giza in order to complete her smuggling mission. She sneaks on board his ship only to learn that her \\"host\\" is helping the Shielders stop from getting annihilated. Both have immediate needs to assist large populations that apparently place Moriah and Sabin in conflict as to time and place. Also adding to the quandary is that Moriah and Sabin are falling in love with one another.Catherine Spangler's previous novel, SHIELDER, garnered several awards as a highly regarded futuristic romance. Ms. Spangler returns to that same setting with the exciting, tense-laden SHADOWER. The story line never eases up due to the apparent opposing objectives of the strong lead characters. However, what makes this tale a triumph similar to its predecessor is the audience can see and hear the heartbeats of these worlds like Giza, which in turn, provides an authentic feel to a wonderful science fiction romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Catherine Spangler is one of today's best writers of \\"futuristic romance\\" fiction. I read \\"Shielder\\" before \\"Shadower,\\" but it doesn't matter which book you read first. Both novels stand on their own as excellent examples of the genre, and both take place on the same planet, Giza, sharing some of the same characters, but the storylines are totally different. Ms. Spangler's narratives are extremely well written, her plots are fresh and original, and her characters jump right off the page, they're so realistic. They sure found a place in my heart!Handsome, hunky, alpha-male, Sabin Travers is a Shadower, bounty hunter extraordinaire, supposedly working for \\"The Collectors.\\" Collectors are the evil folks who rule this particular quadrant of the universe, brainwashing and programing most other inhabitants to do their will through telekinetic control. Those outlaws who somehow manage to escape beneath Controller radar are shadowed, found and turned-in by Sabin and others like him. \\"Shadower\\" opens on the hell-like planet Calt, the hang-out for the dregs of the universe. Anteks, Shens, Jaccians, creatures of all kinds - thieves, smugglers, murderers - come to Calt for R&R; and dirty business dealings.Sabin is having a lousy day. The person he is hunting has eluded him and he's hot, tired and frustrated. Stepping into a local dive for some Elysian liquor, he sees an absolutely beautiful woman at the end of the bar. Intrigued to find such a woman in a place like this, he offers to keep her company - for her own safety, of course. Moriah, the lovely lady, is a smuggler whose ship has been stolen, stranding her on Calt. She ignores Sabin and enters a game of chance, Fool's Quest, with an unsavory group, hoping to win the money to pay her passage off the planet. Her subsequent good luck turns into a bar brawl. Sabin joins in the fray and the two barely manage to escape alive - without Moriah's winnings.The last thing the lady wants is a man in her life, even for a brief fling. She disengages herself from Sabin, after begrudgingly thanking him. If Sabin knew how Moriah made her living, he would probably arrest her. Wounded from the fight and desperate to leave, Moriah decides that Sabin's ship is her only way off Calt. So she stows away. Unfortunately this proves to be a poor decision, as she inadvertently learns some highly confidential information, while on the voyage, that puts her life in grave danger.Sabin and Moriah get along like cats and dogs in the early part of their relationship. Both are strong-willed, intelligent, highly independent people, and Moriah is operating with some heavy emotional baggage from her past. However, it is obvious that sparks fly between the two from the beginning. As the plot develops, so does the relationship, but the more attached Moriah becomes to Sabin, the more complicated her life seems to become, and she begins to make mistakes and poor decisions trying to complete a dangerous job.There is as much suspense as romance here....and the romance sizzles. Ms. Spangler has created a grim universe where technology, progress and education do not prevent evil. She peoples her story with all kinds of fascinating creatures, and fabulous secondary characters. The author won the 1998 Emily Award for \\"Shielder\\" and she certainly deserves it. \\"Shadower\\" is a wonderful read and almost as good. I am addicted to this series.

She expertly tells a tale of a dangerous cat and mouse game full of gutsy moves, calculated risks and raw sensuality. Sabin and Moriah ignite the pages of this book with their battle of wills and ultimately, their surrender. If you love engaging Sci-fi romantic adventure, don't miss this opportunity to sample Ms. Spanglers finest work to date."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"This book is one of those really great finds that don't expect, but you remember forever! It's got all the things that make a book great: a terrific, sexy, heroic man; a strong, sexy, resilient woman; a love affair that is literally out of this world. And in addition to all that, it's got whole new worlds that the author makes feel very real. And secondary characters that will make you laugh out loud! This book is a funny, sexy, romp one minute, then a deep, meaningful life lesson the next. I couldn't put it down, and recommend it to everyone, no matter what your reading tastes!"},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Ah, Sabin, there is no other like him. He is the stuff that dreams are made of (another heavy sigh). I am a new reader of futuristic romance novels, but after reading Shadower and Shielder, I am absolutely hooked. Ms. Spangler's writing is simply magic. She makes her characters so real that you want to reach out and touch them (in particular I would like to reach out and touch Sabin). From the very beginning of Shadower to the very end, Ms. Spangler grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Sabin and Moriah are a modern day Rhett and Scarlett, although Moriah could give Scarlett a run for her money in the femme fatale catagory. I would recommend Shadower (and Shielder) to anyone--from the &quot;die hard&quot; romance reader to the &quot;action/adventure&quot; reader. Ms. Spangler covers all the bases. Can't wait for the next book!!"},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Captain Moriah Cameron was trying to find her contact in the bar when all hades broke loose!

A sci-fi romance, SHADOWER was written after the award-winning SHIELDER to explain the history behind the beautiful merchant Moriah and her bounty-hunter husband, Sabin. So, SHADOWER (the sequel) takes place before SHIELDER (the prequel), timeline-wise. SHADOWER had also been a book I was anxious to read, simply because I thought both Moriah and Sabin were fascinating characters. Their story, however, was not as good as Chase and Nessa's in SHIELDER.The first chapter in SHADOWER in which Moriah and Sabin meet at a seedy bar on a nasty planet was interesting. However, once Moriah stows away on his ship and they begin their cat-and-mouse game of \\"catch me if you can,\\" I started to lose interest, mostly because of how the characters are portrayed. The Moriah that interested me in SHIELDER was tough yet exceptionally feminine. Here in SHADOWER, she's portrayed as a man-hating victim. The victim part bugged me the most. The last thing I wanted to read about was somebody's stark terror at being touched intimately by any man. Plus, it ruined my image of Moriah, seeing her as a clich&eacute; of victimhood. Same thing with Sabin. In SHIELDER, he was this ultra-cool bounty hunter who was rough and tough, yet was secretly protecting his people from the brink of extinction. In SHADOWER, he ends up fumbling every attempt to capture Moriah, who wrongs him in so many ways. It made him look bad - how's he supposed to be an effective bounty hunter if one woman can slip his grasp every time he meets up with her? It also becomes quite clear that he is one of the most whipped heroes that ever existed. Every bad thing Moriah does to him is justified by her victimhood status, which he decides to help her overcome. Oh come on!There is a very similar sci-fi romance out there called THE SKYPIRATE, which was written 5 years before SHADOWER and reads so much better. Both stories are about heroes who fly around in space ships doing supposed bad deeds but are, in reality, actually supporting the existence of their persecuted peoples. Both stories also have heroines who were former sex slaves and have baggage because of it. However, SKYPIRATE is much more enjoyable because, while there is baggage, it doesn't overwhelm the story and doesn't stereotype the heroine into a victim.Also, SKYPIRATE doesn't use a lot of American jargon or phrasing, like SHADOWER does. In SHADOWER, characters ask each other if they are \\"OK\\" or say things like \\"you hated my guts.\\" This is supposed to be a sci-fi set on other planets. They shouldn't talk like Americans in the 21st century.Anyway, while SHADOWER was disappointing, I still intend to read the next book in the series, called SHAMARA. Hopefully, it'll be on par with the first book, SHIELDER, which was such a fantastic romance."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Catherine Spangler's Shadows Fires was a RITA nominee. That didn't surprise me. She is one talented writer. What surprises me is she hasn't received this recognition before. She is without doubt one of the best Futuristic Romance writers around. I have eagerly read each of her tales, but decided to go back and \\"revisit\\" some of the first in the series.Yes, they are a series, but you can easily read them in any order. Spangler gives you an original premise, sharp involving writing, but it's with her characters that make her standout. You become so involved with these people she conjures to life.Sabin Travers is a Shadower, a bounty hunter. He works for The Collectors. The Collectors were the rulers in this particular quadrant of the universe. But their rule is not benevolent. They brainwash and reprogram people to do their will, controlling them with telekinetic powers. There are those who somehow manage to escape their control. For these the Collectors employ the Shadowers. The Shadowers hunt down and turn-in these rebels.The story starts on a hellish planet Calt, which is the \`Dew Drop Inn' for the dregs of the quadrant (think of the bar scene in the first Star Wars Movie), where all creatures great and small come to do business. Sabin has been tracking his latest quarry, but the target has proved elusive. He only wanted to have a drink and relax. He never expected to see the woman at the end of the bar. Women like her are prey in this dive, so he cannot help but wonder why she is there.Moriah Cameron is a smuggler, only her ship was stolen, leaving her stranded on this hellhole. Hoping to win money to pay her passage off the planet, she enters a game. There is a brawl and Sabin manages to help Moriah escape, though her winnings are left behind.Moriah is not too happy with Sabin's protection. If he was aware of how she was a smuggler, he would turn her in - or so she thinks. Still, she has little option but to accept Sabin's ship as her ticket off Calt. But rather than beg his help, she stows away on his vessel. This puts her life in danger as she overhears confidential information.Sabin and Moriah are both strong-willed people, and in cases where the sexual attraction is deep, sparks fly. Only Moriah has a dark secret that makes her mistrust men. This is handled very deftly by Spangler, giving Moriah a depth, a vulnerability, a strength that goes beyond general fiction writing.Spangler was leading the way in Futuristic romance long before it was a hot genre. She creates strong worlds in vivid details. To be a successful writer in the genre the writer has to see the world they write about in order to make the readers see it as well. Spangler dazzles with this ability.Sabin and Moriah are memorable characters who make you care and will linger long in your mind. A brilliant job. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Moriah is a smuggler. Her customers, the Leors will kill her if she doesn't deliver a certain shipment of highly valued ore. Problem is, her space ship has been stolen, she's been injured, she's stranded on a planet light years from help and worse yet, every wicked pirate in the quadrant is zeroing in to hijack her stolen ore shipment.Sabin is a bounty hunter. Moriah's father and Pax, the man who assaulted her and held her in slavery for years, were also bounty hunters. She's not a fan of the profession or the evil men who dash about the galaxy in their spaceships seeking the money to be had for retrieving often innocent people for the evil overlords called the \\"Controllers\\".Not realizing Sabin's true profession, Moriah stows away on Sabin's ship. Moriah is discovered when Sabin makes a covert stop to deliver relief supplies at a secret colony of Shielders. The Shielders are being hunted down and destroyed by the Controllers, so the Shielders would kill Moriah if Sabin leaves her at the secret colony world. Instead of having her executed, Sabin is forced to conceal her and then makes plans to take her to a healer to have her memories of the colony erased.Along the way, they grow to like each other.{Despite the fact SPOILER ALERT that Moriah steals Sabin's ship, and dumps him at a brothel stark naked.}There is also a delightfully humorous sub story of Lionia a warrior gal who loves to cut up men, that falls in love with the geeky space ship mechanic.This is first and foremost a science fiction romance. The characters are flawed, and deep. I LOVED them. They are like the core couple of a soap opera and they also show up in the other Shielder series books. I loved the way the author helped Moriah get around her emotional wall regarding men due to her mistreatment at the hands of the slaver and the chemistry between Sabin and Moriah fairly sizzled.This is a good stand alone novel. But go ahead and order all the Shielder books."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"This book is one of a trilogy that is well worth the time and money. the book was a fast paced adventure with characters you can relate to and cheer for."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"I discovered Catherine Spangler fairly recently from a listmania entry here at Amazon. And I'm so glad I did! I'm a very picky reader, especially of futuristic romance, my favorite genre. I bought both SHIELDER and SHADOWER and sat down to read them in order by release date. I do wish I'd known that though Spangler wrote SHADOWER after SHIELDER, chronologically SHADOWER comes first. Spangler has said that the characters of Sabin and Moriah were so popular that she decided to write their story. I finished SHIELDER and plunged immediately--it was that good!--into SHADOWER and was a bit confused at first but soon realized the chronological order and adjusted. Not a big problem, but I was surprised that I enjoyed SHADOWER even more than the first book!I was VERY satisfied with how Spangler handles the heroine's mistrust of men. Far too often, authors tell us that a heroine has been abused or raped in their past and then the heroine jumps into bed with the hero like she has absolutely no issues or emotional baggage. I find that ridiculous. If an author is going to use sexual abuse as a plot device, I want a realistic reaction on the character's part. No whining; hate that! But Moriah's very believable inability to trust Sabin after the rotten way she's been treated all her life--especially in light of his Shadower profession--made perfect sense to me. As a woman, I can identify with her doubts, and I also adored Sabin's patience in dealing with her. There's nothing I love more than a tough alpha hero who can be sweet and tender with the woman he loves. The little community of women Moriah works to protect and provide for added another believable layer to the heroine's subconscious dilemma of wanting to trust Sabin but not feeling that she could afford to. And the secondary characters of Lionia and Radd and their little romance were extremely funny.All in all, Spangler does a fantastic job in creating a complex, compelling love story with wonderful emotional depths. Sabin is a knockout hero, Moriah is spunky and strong, and the action is non-stop. And, lest I neglect to mention, the sexual tension is fabulous! A GREAT read!"},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"I just finished reading SHADOWER and I found that is a very good story. I didn't give it five stars because I think that the plot could have been a little bit better with more depth in the secondary characters. It was a little slow in the begining but speed up after that. The plot was set up so that you could really see something like this happening. The story of the Shielders reminded me somewhat of what happened to the Jewish people during World War II. All in all it is a good story that left several ideas for sequels."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"This review is kind of hard for me to write since I spent quite a while finding a used copy of this book since it seems to be out of print. I genuinely enjoyed Shielder and Shamara but Shadower was just not up to par with the other two books in the series. While Sabin seemed true to his character portrayal in the other two books, Moriah came off so wrong that I just about stopped reading half way through because I just couldn't get over how whiney and narrow-minded Moriah was and how she just automatically assumed the worst about Sabin every single time as compared to the fun-loving and strong woman she was in the other two books.Yes, bad things had happened to her in her life and she would have been traumatized but for someone to continue to live in the past like she was just didn't appeal at all. Sabin went out of his way to be good and kind to her, especially after he found out what had happened and Moriah just kept coming off with her nasty attitude and erroneous assumptions even though all evidence to the contrary did not support her ideas.I will continue to read Ms. Spangler's books because I enjoyed her other ones but if this had been the first book by her I had ever read I would never have read another.If you want to read the entire series, then by all means find a copy of this book and read it to satisfy your curiosity about the back story to Sabin and Moriah, but just don't expect Moriah to be like the character portrayed in Shielder and Shamara."},{"Title":"Shadower (Shielder Series, Book 2)","review":"Did I read a different book from everyone else? I thought this was horrible! I mean how demeaning to women to imply and then prove that a man would best a woman in strength every time. Even a woman with fighting skills. Then, this whiny main character that, regardless of all the obvious hands on facts that prove Sabin is an honest, honorable man, she still calls foul and continues to abuse him in the worst way. Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin. Lastly, to top it all off, after she's unloaded abuse after abuse on him, he simply tells her he's a good guy and she's like, oh, well, in that case I believe you and I love you. How utterly stupid!

Hari Seldon realizes it and, using the science of psychohistory, the prediction of the future in broad, statistical terms, establishes two Foundations &quot;at opposite ends of the Galaxy&quot; to cushion the Fall. This, the first of the classic Foundation series to be written (though only 3rd in chronological order), traces the early development of the First Foundation as it struggles first simply to survive in the prescence of powerful, hostile Kingdoms (which had formerly been parts of the Galactic Empire), and then to gradual growth and domination of its area of the Galaxy, and the promise of eventually establishing a Second Galactic Empire.

There are almost none of the crudities of most other American sci-fi. I prefer the Foundation and the first novella of Second Foundation to the latter half of the trilogy; Asimov grew a little tired of his main theme as he progressed, although he still has some memorable scenes, such as the description of Rossem. The French translation of this is itself a classic, and irons out Asimov's occasional 'mass-market' juvenilic elements into a very high level of literate expression. But the English is far from bad to begin with, and has, if not a Gibbonian, at least an H.G. Wellsian flavor. Asimov's later Foundation novels are far below the three volumes of the Foundation trilogy proper. They resemble the common run of American sci-fi - aimless plots, flavorless language, etc. I am always puzzled that some people don't think Asimov has convincing characters. Who remembers, or cares, about the characters of a Heinlein or Clarke? But Asimov has at least a dozen characters that are known to every sci-fi fan. Asimov possesses a masculine vigor of language and an episodical manner of imagination that pleases me very much."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions.

The part when the Mule's identity is revealed gave me chills, even the second time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I really liked this book, but I want to give you some warnings about my tastes &amp; what I found odd about it. First I used to read history books for fun &amp; sometimes I still do. Second there were absolutely no female characters in this one. This struck me as bizarre then &amp; it still does (by the way I'm a male &amp; most definitely not a feminist)The later foundation books ,especially those written in the 80's &amp; 90's, are better characterized &amp; women are much better characterized. Also this is a 1940's view of the future. That doesn't mean it's dated (are Dumas or Poe dated?) it just means you have to put it in context. Why did I like it then? My love of history, the ideas, the grandness, &amp; unrepentant sentimentality. I think if I read it again I might not like it as much, but the memory of it's great. If you know a teenager reading star trek books do what my dad did &amp; give them this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have read every book in the Foundation Series. The First must be read to fully appreciate all the others, but the best one in the series is Foundation and Earth. It's so unfortunate that the publishers who don't have the rights to this novel in the series don't include it in their lists."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have read 5 of the 7 foundation books. I find this one to be the least enjoyable, but I still consider it a classic. While Asimov's writing style improved over the years, Foundation is still a great read. Psychohistory is such an interesting idea, that it makes one think if it is possible. Although the books get better as the publishing years increase, the first one is still a great one. One note, though. Asimov's style of &quot;action&quot; here is not excellent, so be forewarned. Personally, I find his Robot series more enjoyable, but Foundation is still one of the best series ever written. I would give 4.5 stars, but unfortunately I cant."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns???

Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \\"technology as magic\\" and \\"religion = magic\\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\\"it's not measurable\\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \\"religious cover for nuclear technology\\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else...."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I hate this book. I don't just &quot;not like it,&quot; I hate it! Such a bad book. Do not read it!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years, I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first: he wrote about a Galactic Empire long before it became cliche, speculated about the limits and triumphs of science, etc. That said, what struck me most about this beginning to the Foundation series was that Asimov's story exactly parallels Hari Seldon's theory of psychohistory: only movements, not individuals, are significant in shaping history, and even the main characters in the book are accordingly underdeveloped to the point of being forgettable. I enjoy world-building as much as the next sci-fi/fantasy buff, but I also appreciate well-constructed sentences and good characterization, both of which I found sorely lacking here. Also, &quot;Foundation&quot; is clearly a man's world, setting a tradition of male adolescent sci-fi in which strong and/or interesting female characters have no place.I give the novel three stars only because it sets up the background for the next two in the series, which overcome some (but not all) of the faults in this first effort. But I think that I will return to my personal favorites among the old masters, including Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon, who have always delivered philosophy, wit, and imagination along with excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The story is one of the most detailed, most thought-out stories ever.

It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space.

I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book based on overall good reviews of the series and Asimov in general. The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \\"sciency\\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \\"settlling-in\\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion...."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from &quot;Foundation&quot; to &quot;How Not to Write a Book&quot; or &quot;Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.&quot; I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes, there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity, because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation consists of five stories separated by several decades each. The Trantorian Empire has lost its hold on the outer perimeter of the galaxy. Hari Seldon, founder of the predictive science of psychohistory, knows that the Empire is doomed to collapse and that thirty millennia of barbarism and anarchy will ensue before a second empire will rise. But Seldon claims to know a way to shorten the dark ages from 30,000 years to a single millennium.The stories in Foundation chronicle the infancy and development of Seldon's Foundation society initially established on the remote planet Terminus. Seldon's psychohistory predicts several crises that the Foundation must survive in order to bring about the desired drastic shortening of the dark ages. Four of the five stories each describe a crisis that confronts the Foundation.So far I've read the Robot series, the Empire series, and the first three books in the Foundation series (Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation). I find the epic story so far to be extremely engaging and imaginative. The stories in Foundation are a bit disconnected and not fleshed out enough, but nevertheless do a more than adequate job of describing the fall of the Galactic Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is amazing. After waiting all these years to jump onto the Asimov train I am glad that I am finally here; the book is thoughtful, smart, and paced wonderfully. The solutions to the Seldon problems all provoke different themes the novel wishes to convey.The book is a short easy read and if you like Sci-Fi, I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's &#34;Foundation series&#34; novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34; moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before.

Be sure to also check out the other two books of the Foundation Trilogy, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\"."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Here in the second installment of Azimov's fantastic Foundation epic, you have a continuation from the first that at first seems a let down. Then the Mule shows up and the action really gets going.The first part is about the General and the reason I say it's a letdown is that what you think is going to happen, and hope for the sake of action is going to happen, doesn't. It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called \\"soft power\\", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was \\"how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!\\"Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, \\"Mayors\\". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Clear intelligent prose marks this as well as Asimov's other books. The fact that there is hardly any action in this trilogy, and yet it is still fun to read, shows you how good Asimov is at writing just \\"intellectual\\" fiction.But the truth be told, Foundation is not \\"the greatest sci-fi series of all time.\\" Sure, it won the Hugo that said just that. But that was only about fifteen years after the trilogy was published, and, remember, only fifteen years after the Hugo Award was instituted. Fifteen years isn't long enough to be making grandiose all-time statements like that.After Foundation, Asimov was to grow as a writer. He said so himself. He admits its faults: lack of a strong cohesive story; weak characterization; hardly any females. It is also now extremely dated. You can just \\"feel\\" that it was written circa 1950.The books aren't even novels, but a collection of stories. That's how it was executed; he never set out to write a trilogy. It is not as complex as you'd think the \\"greatest\\" should be. It lacks a certain depth. Just look at Dune: how Herbert portrayed the religious mind, how religion and commerce and politics all affected one another. On the other hand, Asimov never really understood the religious. So in the Foundation trilogy, priests are like frightened children, driven only by superstition.It may be a classic, but it is not a timeless classic. Yes, Foundation is definitely not his best series. Try the Robot novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself, so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master. No wonder it won a Hugo for best all-time series.It's the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the Foundation guided by psychohistory (a scientific method of predicting the future) developed by the Foundation's founder, Hari Seldon.Classic Sci Fi!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"There are a lot of people reviewing this book on this website who give it low reviews because it's dated. Yeah, sure, it's dated...it was written in the forties, it's going to be dated, but that doesn't lower the quality of the story.Now that that's out of the way: this book is great. Asimov is unbelievably smart, and Foundation shows it. The story to Foundation is interesting: the Galactic Empire is crumbling and its demise will turn the entire galaxy to barbarism for thirty thousand years, if steps arn't taken to lighten the blow. That's where the Foundation comes in. Through a series of crises, the Foundation should be able to shorten the length of time of barbarism from thirty thousand years to only a thousand.Foundation just covers the first few crises, so the book skips forward in time. This causes the trouble with the character development that everyone complains about. When a character is given only a few chapters to develop in, they won't really develop.Asimov really is the master of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ive been a long time sci-fi/fantasy fan. However, it has taken me many years to finally pick up a book Ive heard so much about. Through the first half of the book, it felt like the average sci-fi novel. However, as I neared the end, I found myself enjoying it. Asimov included some witty political resolutions to the puzzles and 'Seldon crisis' throughout the book. I kept wanting more of these carefully crafted shorts and was very entertained towards the end.Asimov could have executed the story a little better so that the timeline didn't skip fifty years after every short. The lasting effect of this piece is somewhat diminished by this fact. Also the repetition of plot will keep me from reading any more of the series. I think it is the tragic flaw in Asimov, too much of a good thing. He has books published about everything it seems. Search for 'Asimov' and you will see what I mean.Overall it was a good book and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyment to pass the time with."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being a science fiction fan for some years, I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I, Robot. On the whole, I think I, Robot is a better read, largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more, which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless, Foundation is still very worthwhile, and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer, and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance, and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel, the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF, this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you, this is a great book for you. Pick it up."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid, enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ah Foundation, this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future, it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent, he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go, and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing, it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close, I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time, but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature, it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction, especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy, you should definatly read those, as for the other four, that is your choice, i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation, it is an excellent book, the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date, from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992, (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death), the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon, to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent, but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus, an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy, from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica, a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote, the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan, and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries, as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life, and his initial realisation as a young man, the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future, while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth), the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping, mother of all twists in the story, which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation, and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am not a science fiction fan without being a fan of the big idea, but in the Foundation Asimov introduced galaxy-wide empires and a plausible new science. There's no new compelling themes in this book. Without that quality, you are left to Asimov's weaknesses: one-dimensional characters and stark writing style, but hey - its still Asimov and his stuff is always fun to read.Like the last book, this is a hodgepodge of short stories Asimov wrote separately. The first half of the book is about a rising general who fights against The Plan but gets swatted down because he can't fight the mathematical forces of psychohistory. The next part is the fun part. One factor was not counted for in his equation: a mutant who knocks The Plan off kilter. To some the identity of the Mule will be laughably obvious. Personally, I was uncertain whether I was on the right track or not.It reads like a mystery novel , though dry in style and severely lacking in the human quotient. Nonetheless, it is a continuing tale of the rise and fall of future civilizations, telepathic mutants, and psychohistory. This is THE classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In this sequel to \\"Foundation,\\" Asimov continues to channel Edward Gibbon, charting the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent rebirth, like a phoenix from the ashes, of a new and improved federation.On its own, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" suffers from an acute case of Middle Chapter Syndrome--and this is somewhat surprising since Asimov originally published his trilogy as a series of nine novellas. The reader who isn't familiar with the first \\"Foundation,\\" with its extended prologue and four installments, will be at a loss. In the previous book, each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead \\"psychohistorian\\" Hari Seldon, who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire, and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.\\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule,\\" the two episodes in this volume, will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the \\"action\\" occurs offstage, and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown, but Asimov presents this incident to make a point: those who think they know when and where historical crises will next occur might miss out entirely on the real predicament at hand.The meat of the book will be found in \\"The Mule,\\" which is presented as a mystery of sorts (although I find it difficult to imagine the reader who won't discern the Mule's \\"secret\\" well before its unveiling). More successfully, this novella is an extended chase scene--it would make a great space adventure movie--in which the Mule's minions pursue our heroes through the far reaches of the universe. The unexpected appearance of a mutant species, represented by the Mule, throws into chaos Seldon's psychohistorical calculations--or does it?Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults. Even by the loose standards of pulp fiction, these two stories suffer from more than their fair share of tautologies, pleonasms, comma splices, sentence fragments, and worse. (No chapter should open with a sentence like either of the following: \\"There was reason to the fact that the element known as 'pure science' was the freest form of life on the Foundation.\\" \\"The blockade was run successfully.\\")But Asimov's fans--myself included--don't turn to his novels for their literary qualities. Instead, we enjoy his ability to present a complicated story and tie up all the loose ends, to weave politics and philosophy and science into his fiction, and to make us think."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology, sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy, even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type, perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great classic Sci Fi. Loved it. It was fun to notice some of the technology that is already outdated, like microfiche and televisions, how nuclear power was so important, but this didn't affect my interest or enjoyment in the novel."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I put Asmimov's Foundation series among the finest science fiction ever written. Up there with Lord of the Rings. His brillance is amazing and he takes you into a world of the future that makes sense."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a reread for me (I read it way back when I was in high school), and to be honest, I can't decide if I liked it more then or if I liked it more now. Which probably means that I felt the same way about it both times.Which is that it is a well-written, intriguing work of thoughtful science fiction.When it comes down to it, Foundation is the type of science fiction that I SHOULD love. It takes place in a believable, scary future, Earth isn't remembered or maybe doesn't even exist, the entire galaxy is populated, and there are lots of cool future gadgets. More than that, it is filled with intelligent people who have to think in interesting, convoluted ways to make the things that happen happen. It even starts off with a mathematician - brilliance!And that is why I DID love this book - I loved trying to figure out how the people were going to think or how they were thinking and what conclusions this would lead them to. It was like a mystery, but one in which you just have to unravel intelligence. The narrative flows beautifully, and the plot is just complex enough to keep you exited and thinking without feeling like Asimov was trying too hard.When it comes down to it, Foundation really is the perfect science fiction novel, and it's no wonder that it won the Hugo and was named \\"Best Science Fiction Series of All Time.\\"But (you knew there was a but coming), I'm not the hugest fan of short stories, and Foundation is, essentially, a series of short stories. Granted, the short stories are so well-linked that you sometimes forget, but when it comes down to it, each chapter is a new story. In each chapter, at least 50 years have passed since the last one, entirely new characters are introduced, and the old ones, for the most part, are rarely mentioned again. The thing linking them is Harri Seldon and the Foundation that he created. It is because of this that, even though I loved it, I can't say that I LOVED it.Still, Foundation is one tight piece of work, and I would recommend it to any and all lovers of science fiction. I mean, when it comes to science fiction, this is it! And I know I'll be rereading the others in the series as well!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I've come to start with four stars as I note that no book is perfect; considering this is just a story, it can't be perfect. My giving a book much less this one four stars is no knock on it.Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark are considered the beginning of 'hard' sci-fi. It's not strictly true as there were guys like H.G. Wells Jules Verne and might I add Johannas Kepler? There's also the Frankenstein story. A point I want to make here is that it seems that nobody has been able to follow in their footsteps! Why? They didn't necessarily mean to just be scientificaly accurate. Their message was scientific humanism. It's the philosophy of being scientific that is portrayed in their books and not just robots and spaceships.Something else that needs to be pointed out is the difference between Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Some would suggest that Arthur C. Clark was more technically sophisticated than Isaac Asimov. Was Arthur C. Clark really all that technically sophisticated in his books? He had guys shooting through a vacuum to get to an A.I. computer gone haywire! Isaac Asimov has faster than light travel by means of space folding in his foundation books(a prediction that may not be so far off . . . in either technical accuracy or time; meaning it could happen sooner than you think!); he has mind reading; we have the ability to plus computers into brains and read what they're thinking and saying now; it's not mass produced(yet); but, it's there. I for one only liked Isaac's first volume of his foundation books because he has this mind-reading which I didn't like; well, what do I know?What seems to continue to set Isaac Asimov's Foundation appart is that of a galactic empire and how it dies(human neglect of rationalism). It should be noted that Isaac managed to connect his foundation books with his empire and robot books; so, he shows how intelligence really grows to dominate a galaxy, and then shows social ways that it can crumble(inspired by the fall of the roman empire).Despite Isaac's reliance on nuclear power as the high technology of the day, his foundation books symbolizes the real issues facing humanity and not what you get on the news channels(actual politics channels; they just call them news channels); they seem to argue for the same things each election year but never solve the same problems! Meanwhile, the science world keeps on chugging(word?lol!) along."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"one would be hard pressed to find better sci-fi in the last 60 years than the foundation novels. what amazing insight these books had."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I like science fiction in a generalized idea, but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult, but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories, until lately, haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book, the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books, perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However, one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future, he was still a product of his time. When he was writing, the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus, the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare, for example, the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead, there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least, if you take this as a futurological document, humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer, but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was \\"serious science fiction,\\" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes, and thousands of years of time, Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent, ailing society--a prevention, if you will, against the society of the 21st century, as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government, Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events, trends, and movements in human history. Branded a madman, he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile, half-grant to the planet Terminus, to found their Foundation, which, it seems, is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age, filled with robots, spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding, and sometimes, even our imagination. A thinker, philosopher, and theologian, Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time, though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around, I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Having always been a big Asimov fan, (after readingmany of hisshort stories, along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world, the 12,000-year old Empire is in decline, and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30,000 years to only 1,000.Going into the first book of the series, I have to say I had high expectations, but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels, but while each of the five stories introduced new characters, I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories, the question of individuality is touched on: are these characters merely following Seldon's plan with no ability to shape events, or are our heroes shaping their futures through their decisions? I have only read Foundation so far, but I expect this theme to continue in the other novels.Also, I have to say that Foundation is very easy to read, entertaining, and I would recommend it without question, even to someone who had never read Asimov, and also to someone who had no interest in the Foundation series. Though, anyone who finishes Foundation will likely want to proceed to the other novels in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you haven't read this or the other two books in the original trilogy, you're in for a treat. This series is almost 50 years old but still among the best SF stories ever"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Throughout the past 12,000 years, the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor, its capital planet, throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor, or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth), are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire, which controls billions of worlds, is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words, it is dying. Hari Seldon, reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30,000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1,000 years, he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new, and greater, Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories, which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a word, story. That's what this is book is meant, story. As a best-class story-teller, Asimov, leads the reader into an intrincated, labyrhynthical STORY, where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions, meanwhile, both are interlaced so closely and deeply, that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in &quot;favour&quot; of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism , that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer, but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book, and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details, but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time, and retro. The idea and plot of this book may in fact have kicked off the whole space opera sub-genre that i love so well. For more larger than life galaxy spanning sci fi mind blowing, try Vernor Vinge's &quot;A fire Upon the Deep&quot;"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I find the Foundation series to be more interesting than the Robot series.

I have my problems with Psycho-History...but so will the characters in this universe, as we shall see."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this novel as a trilogy of Prelude to Foundation, Foundation and Second Foundation. The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory, a colony, of sorts, of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation, as the colony is referred, is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall, various small dominions erupt, and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity, but things soon come to a head, and action must be taken. Unfortunately, scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events, the political structure of the Foundation is altered, and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation, there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation, as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories, taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation, as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon, now long dead, but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written, and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed. If you like REAL science fiction, I highly recommend this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is the best ever. True, it is set in the future but you don't have to like sci-fi at all to appreciate the true brilliance of Isaac Asimov. The Foundation is a short book. Give it a try. I'll be surprised if you don't immediately pick up the next in the series when you are done!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Two stories in one, this book is an excellent follow up to Foundation, and a dramatization of the strength of mind over muscle.First the Foundation is threateded by the Galactic Empire. While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all, wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history), it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General, when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second, he brings in a new factor. The Foundation, secure and dominant but not agressive, is threatened by the Mule, a person who can control the emotions of others, reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction, he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule, by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time, he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages, so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate, and did a truly excellent work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336, this time I'm number 90, which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation, I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though, These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally, there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put, I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though, because I happen to think that if you try hard enough, you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics, but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least, that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out, these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that, but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are, as usual, simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here, the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So, group 1, individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story: The Mule. The Mule is notable for having the first attempt at creating characters that are in any way interesting. For the most part I personally don't think he succeeds, but as I said in my review for the first book, I don't read Foundation for that reason so there's no great loss there.The Mule is a psychic who comes out of nowhere and crushes the Seldon Plan to dust! Since the plan cannot take individuals into account, a weird mutant can do more damage than the old Empire could do. Here, the individual rules and the mighty Foundation is brought to its knees.So, group 1, individual 1. We'll have to wait for the next book to see who comes out on top.As much as I love this classic work, the ideas behind it seem muddled and somewhat contradictory. I would imagine this came from the fact that these were written as discrete short stories and not as a cohesive whole.Despite these criticisms however, this is still very readable if you liked the first book and I'm sure you can find some criticisms of your own in here. Also, keep in mind that there is another Foundation out there... \\"At Star's End\\"So let's head there shall we?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation, and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense, action, dialogue, character-building, world-building, narrative, and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books, the joy comes from not just the narrative itself, but the situations that Asimov places his characters in, and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is, irrefutably, classic science fiction, and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective \\"sardonically\\" - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw, just something that one might notice."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in the original trilogy, and the fourth book overall, Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor, at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows, I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong, this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters, ahead-of-his-time technology, and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great book! Second in the series of three novels, all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks.

Asimov added two more books later, but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories, but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this, but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's \\"Foundation\\" then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire.

The trilogy is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" by Ace books in the 1950s.While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, \\"Foundation\\" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (\\"Foundation And Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.The sections of \\"Foundation\\" are:\\"The Psychohistorians\\" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette \\"Foundation\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in May of 1942.\\"The Mayors\\" - This story is closely tied to \\"The Encyclopedists\\", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of \`Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Bride and Saddle\\" in the June 1942 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Traders\\" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" as the short story \\"The Wedge\\".\\"The Merchant Princes\\" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"The Big And The Little\\" in the August 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic! A modern classic! the series deserves a place among Dune and other SF greats. The Mule was stroke of genius. The surprise ending was wonderful. whatever they charge you for this it is a deal."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I recently read Foundation, all I can say is Wow!. First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK, This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word, Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic, their is no main character, instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades, sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories, too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused, containing only two stories, the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background: The psychohistorian Hari Seldon was able to mathematically foresee the future of human society in the Milky Way. It wasn't pretty. Socio-economic forces were to cause the total collapse of the Trantorian Empire and lead to 30,000 years of anarchy and barbarism before a new empire restored peace and order. However, Seldon saw an \\"alternate path\\" that could reduce the duration of the Dark Ages to a single millennium. He established two societies (called Foundations) to bring this change about.In Foundation, we learn how the fledgling First Foundation established itself after Seldon's death and how it grew powerful. In F&E;, Seldon is long dead and the First Foundation faces much more serious threats: a war with the dying but still powerful Trantorian Empire and a war with a mutant leader called The Mule who possesses incredible powers. The part about the war with the Empire is a straightforward narrative with a couple interesting twists. The second part about The Mule takes place a few decades later and is written in the style of a mystery, sort of like the first two Robot novels.Since The Mule is an individual of extraordinary power, Seldon's psychohistorical predictions for the First Foundation are in jeopardy because they deal only with masses of people and large scale socio-economic forces. Hence the second part is a more exciting read. :-) Also, until the end of the second part the Second Foundation is a mysterious society on the other side of the Galaxy about whom we know next to nothing. Although I guessed the nature of The Mule's powers, I did not guess his identity and it was a great surprise for me when it was revealed at the end. The events of the last two chapters are stunning and really make you want to rip into the third book. Yet F&E; doesn't end on a cliffhanger and is quite satisfying in and of itself. This unique blend is a testament to Asimov's genius as an author. Also, you'll learn why the mutant calls himself The Mule and it's quite enlightening!With novels written later, Asimov tied together three series into one huge one! I recommend reading the entire 14-book series in the following order: the four Robot novels, the three Empire novels, and the seven Foundation novels (the original trilogy plus two prequels and two sequels). So far I've yet to read the last three Foundation books (Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth), but so far most have been excellent and all have been well above average."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As in Foundation, this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read. Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it. If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best, he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure, he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the \\"trilogy\\" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation series was released as a series of three books: Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation, in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. Some datedness to this series is to be expected, but I've read SF stories written 40 years after these that felt more dated, and personally I think the concept, the sweeping distant future galactic empire Asimov writes, far outweighs any datedness one might expect. So much so, that for serious science fiction readers this series is almost essential reading. Not essential in that you *have to*, nothing kills interest faster than making it some classroom prerequisite to SF, but more in that it would be hard to consider that you wouldn't find some aspect of this series worthwhile at least and absolutely fascinating at best. Several reviewers had said that this trilogy is really a series of shorter novellas that were published earlier thus leading to some incohesiveness. Until a few days ago, I wasn't aware of that and when I read this series and discussed with friends afterwards that never came up. This is a sweeping series, where if an *only* 1000 year dark age is the *best* case scenario, you realize that a lot of time may have to be covered leading to chronological jumps.The idea of psychohistory is a fascinating concept and I haven't seen anyone else really copy it. With that said, it could also be considered a far fetched concept. To predict the history of a huge civilization statistically, albeit in large numbers to offset individuality, but still made up the most irrational entities in the known universe, human beings, is pushing credibility. But that's what also makes this a powerful concept as well. This idea has also been considered in the United States, for what else, economic theory. Statistically there had been too many variables, basically risk. Then in the 80's some economic theorists came upon the concept of eliminating the variable of risk, by forming a mutual fund of as many diverse economic sources as possible. The more the better (like Seldon's the larger the group of people the better) because any worldwide effect causing one economic segment to go down would be offset by some other economic segment that wouldn't. This concept was considered revolutionary and massive amounts of money were poured into this mutual fund from numerous financial institutions. And it worked and paid off well... for a while. But like the Mule of the book series, the theory couldn't account for a single element that would take a large segment of the economy with it. In this case, it was the financial meltdown of the Asian economy that was so sweeping, it took down so many markets that this mutual fund plummeted. So many institutions had poured money into the fund that the US government actually had to help bail it out, because it's collapse threatened the US economy and possibly the entire world economy. (PBS did a fascinating documentary on the events.) So the theory of psychohistory is difficult to consider viable, but is still a fascinating theory and the inventor of it in the series, Hari Seldon, is the Albert Einstein of the empire and is successful at it. Until, that is, a powerful individual comes along, The Mule, which the theory cannot account for and the Seldon Plan fails. The Seldon Plan is so visionary at first that every once in a while long after his death, a prerecorded holographic speech of Seldon would occur stating would should be occurring in the universe at that time and indeed it is occurring. The Foundation realizes they're in big trouble when, after the emergence of The Mule, Seldon returns in one of his recorded messages and the events of the time isn't what he predicted. Asimov writes this section brilliantly.Thus Seldon had secretly instituted a Second Foundation (which is essentially a Backup Plan). I cannot call myself an Asimov fan. I don't really care for his robot series in general and the endings of Asimov's novels tend to be anticlimactic. But with the Foundation series he turns this into an advantage. The final book of the series deals with the confrontation with the Second Foundation. By this time the reader is aware of the power of the Second Foundation and thus the confrontation doesn't need to be with laser pistol or light saber, and is over in minutes. What a brilliant conclusion.I've considered the original Foundation trilogy a stand-alone series. Asimov's Foundations Edge, written 30 years later, is different as to be expected. Since the Foundation series was sufficiently concluded (and stood for 30 years), Foundation's Edge has to add a new element and I've always mentally considered it the Third Foundation. The entire Foundation series is now a seven book series (septology?) and some might say that the post-trilogy novels have corrupted the original series. If you decide to read on, Foundation's Edge is a good book, and did win the 1983 Hugo Award, deservedly so, it helps to keep in mind the real-world chronological differences between the two."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"One of the BEST science fiction books I've ever read, as written by one of the best science fiction authors to live, Foundation is a wonderful look into a completely different universe than our own.Foundation is based on a community of planets who have formed and Empire- A large collective society... One mathematician claims that it will collapse into the dark ages, and take 10,000 years to recover and rebuild... The foundation is formed in an attempt to reduce that time to 1,000 years by maintaining the knowledge of the present. While acting as a terrific science fiction setting and story, Foundation also serves as a very deep look into society as a whole, and how predictable a society is. The social implications of each major crisis as it occurs is aptly predicted and accounted for, which proves largely entertaining and intriguing...This is a must read for any science fiction fan, historian, or sociologist... It's well written and imaginative with engaging ideas and concepts true only to Asimov."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A true classic that never grows old.

They obviously missed the boat big time. This book is not for those who have a short attention span, who need action &amp; blood &amp; guts violence or for people who cannot read between the lines. This book is a powerful commentary on the state of OUR world, that, as a society, we will not stay stagnent forever. It is also a very powerful commentary on the absurdity of religion. Read it if you would like to be educated and you like to think."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I started reading this series with the original &quot;Foundation&quot; and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of &quot;mutant&quot; between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is an awesome book, but if you're looking for battles and Star Wars style action, the sequels to this story have more. This novel spans the first 100 or so years of events that take place after the fall of a Galactic Empire. It's a very thin book and a quick read. Some terms such as \\"Gallopin' Galaxies\\" appear in the book, but be mindful of the times in which this book was written...and the intended audience.What is entertaining and interesting is how the characters solve Hari Seldon's predicted problems throughout the book. How cool would it be to have an entire planet of scientists (make that two)...a tiny portion of the galaxy that is pretty much responsible for running it. As a fantasy, it's as fun to dream of scientists in charge as it is to imagine winning the lottery. You might even glean tactics for handling dopey managers, or solving problems without going into combat. Asimov's wit and intrigue throughout make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The writing is hard and cynical. Characters are intelligent and clear. There is scant attention paid to emotional content or the softer virtues. The writing is clear and precise. The premise of the story is simple: civilization is decaying in the future. A colony is set up on the periphery of the known universe.This colony emerges as a society and faces challenges to both it's growth and survival. There's a clever premise to raise the stakes a bit; this society is the Foundation of a new Galactic Empire, created to close the gap of a fifty-millenia barbarity."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Iaasic Asimov is one of the best known Science-Fiction Writers, and for good reason. He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21. Foundation is one of the best books I have read to this date.Science Fiction is a broad area and can only be defined by these two words, hence the name. Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15,000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made, assination attempts, spaceflight, and the exploration of new worlds in detail, the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This novel, the first in a (50's) series of three, has not dated one bit since its first appearance. Like The Lord of the Rings, it should really be read in combination with its sequels, but the book contains its own strong moments, especially the first section on Trantor. I was amazed and moved by the cleverness of Asimov's plots, something he is of course well-known for. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you had bothered to read the entire series, you would know that one of the major heroes in the book is a young girl, Arkady. In fact, once the Foundation books tie in with the Robot series, you will find another woman hero, the &quot;mother of robotics&quot;, Dr. Susan Calvin. So your comment about the &quot;deplorable&quot; lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book. I hope you don't do this with all literature - try getting the facts first, then give an honest opinion. You will be well respected for it, even if most people disagree with you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first book in Asimov's Foundation Series is actually an anthology of stories tracing the formation of the Foundation to its growth into a competitor of the Galactic Empire. The premise is simple, its execution complex: the Galactic Empire has started to decay even though the Empire itself denies the truth. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian whose mathematical theories of historical psychology have allowed him to determine when the Empire will crumble and the probabilities of the aftermath. To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes. This is the foremost intellectual, yet generally accessible, science fiction series ever written. The lone drawback is that Asimov did not finish it before he died."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now, and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared, Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga, and probably Star Trek as well, along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series, and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future, with its nuclear reactors, microfilm communications, and picture phones, all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades, interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression, and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point, and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory, in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire, obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes, is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes, and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy, while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology, politics, and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \\"Don't you see?\\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book, Foundation, Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's, at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future, when planets have not only been discovered and colonized, but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization, which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is, until Hari Seldon, a scientist, discovers the science of psychohistory, by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social, political, and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire, whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand, at a more nuts and bolts level, this &quot;psychohistory.&quot; To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately, though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon, and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect, some of the imaginative possibilities, such as most of those mentioned above, are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series, but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari, a good discussion of psychohistory, or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari), there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets. The dialogue is great, though, and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator, or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist, Salvor Hardin, invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow, this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future: characters say things like, &quot;What in the name of space?&quot; or &quot;Thank space!&quot; The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. Not only are technology and politics the deepest material this book touches, but even the technology the book introduces is not very interesting. With the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There are no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also in the true spirit of what the word &quot;romance&quot; conveys, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far-off worlds is sparesly and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms. Though, admittedly, Asimov's grasp of political personalities is astounding.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game and the moves than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I know I'll take some major heat in saying this, but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel, but to be honest, I just don't."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact, given that this series takes place 50,000 years into the future, one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue, wit, and believable dialog, and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series, and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book, Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20,000 years, and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style, yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone, but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know. If you like Sci-Fi, and are willing to put up with some of it's common shortcomings, this book will appeal greatly to you, for it truly deserves its place in the Sci-Fi canon."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was trying to find it a long time ago and in amazon it was so cheap.Good quality, fast shipping"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"&quot;Foundation&quot; is considered by many SF devotees to be one of the greatest creations of the genre. It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A good solid beginning to a stunning series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Well, here goes. You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is, it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well, not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion, which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them, something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972, a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides, the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum, to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well, ask yourself this. If that were true, would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No, the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful, well-read and informed. The wool hasn't been pulled over their eyes, it has been pulled over yours. Strike six. And you misspelled premises and neutrino - Strike seven.

This Armageddon is foreseen into 3,000 years of barbaric emptiness. Dr. Seldon comes up with an idea that a group of psycho historians will need to work together with Seldon so that they can compose an Encyclopedia of the Galaxy's history to prevent about 2,000 years of political unrest. A Foundation is created. This Foundation represents the community of these historians to produce enough updated volumes of this Encyclopedia every 50 years so that the rivalry that will occur between the time Seldon dies and this Galaxy destruction occurs, it's ready to be of service to those struggling in the future. I found that the most interesting piece of this whole story is that as the struggles get stronger between the Foundation's cycle leaders and the surrounding planet's \\"prefects,\\" the leaders of the Foundation start to create this religion amongst the science involved with the Encyclopedia. These religious \\"high priests\\" become the power and influence amongst these interplanetary societies. It's so great to see how the higher power called the Galactic Spirit is slowly becoming a widespread belief amongst the psychohistorians and their counter parts.I keep thinking about the impact of these thoughts and ideas on our own society and how similar some of these reactions would be. I see a lot of conflict between our country, the United States, and Middle Eastern countries where we are planting ourselves on other's territory so that we can suck from their few and far between plentiful resources that are of high value to us, so we make these deals that are appealing to 2nd and 3rd class countries and once that is started we ultimatley have all of this say over what that country is up to. I feel like Foundation shows how this peaceful and well- intentioned planet is working to create righteous things and there are these outside planets wanting control over how they are going about this and need some sort of power over a smaller community in a self-serving way. The character development is my favorite part of the book because of the different personalities that Asimov creates to work out the story line of the book. The different leaders are these very he-men type characters that are young and self-righteous, working towards the destruction or protection of their homeland.Clashing righteoussness is all over this book and I think that it definaltey symbolizes some of the conflict that exists in our own country today. I did not however feel like Asmiov gave women any role at all. I can't think of one woman that played ANY major role in this book, and when there was a mention of a woman she was nothing but a secretary or a mediator of some sort. I felt like there were just too many hormones flying around this book and I kind of wonder what this says about Isaac Asimov and his life. A great writer but maybe needs a love life? All around this was a great book and I recommend to all of you die hard SF fans!!! If you're a hardcore gal that is in to SF I would pass on this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation.

I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation clearly deserved its awards and recognition for being a classic science fiction novel. The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book, Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire, which had lasted for twelve thousand years, into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However, the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters, the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me, the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story, the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet, each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series.

The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"For beginners into this serie of Asimov, know that their are other books before Foundation, and they are all tied-up.-----------------&lt;Robot serie&gt;:I, Robot/ The Caves of Steel/ The Naked Sun/ The Robots of Dawn/ Robots and Empire&lt;Bridging novel&gt;:Tyrann&lt;Foundation series&gt;:Foundation/ Foundation and Empire/ Second Foundation/ Foundation's Edge/ Foundation and Earth----------------Some highligths:-I, Robot: The beginning of the robots themselves-The Robots of Dawn: Early mention of psychohystory as a possible new field-Robots and Empire: The Earth starts becoming unlivable-Tyrann: A view between the two series ('Robot' &amp; 'Foundation').

But all three books were in one volume, so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since, I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high, I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further, he does, with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire, more politics, and a small band of traders, rebels, and scholars, who wait for the coming of the &quot;magicians&quot; to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out, thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears, as before, as a hologram, explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry, and Seldon's plan is out of whack, and the galaxy might revert to the 30,000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things, that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology, such as something that could withstand any bombardment, or strange neurobiological weapons; and, that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first, it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely, but there is no record of its purpose, and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U., including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one), set off to the center of what's left of the Empire, The planet/city Trantor, to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction, and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist, working on overdrive, seems to have found its location. &quot;It was so simple,&quot; he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it, or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment, Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts, too, but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that, one is not necessarily better than the other two, they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version, then go back and re-read the books, and hold them dear to our hearts."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I thought the book was somewhat dull compared to the first &quot;Foundation&quot; novel, because there are no brilliant characters such as Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow and no great accomplishments. The first part of the book about Foundation's struggle against the Empire is not impressive. The second part about the Mule was moving sort of slow until a brilliant ending. I was absolutely shocked at it and I thought that it was definitely worth reading the entire novel for the ending. In fact the emotion that I experienced must have been something like what people influenced by the Mule felt! I also realized I had a great affection for the Mule, it is fabulous that a person who is predicted to be a pathetic loser in life makes it beyond all expectations.

If you read sci-fi, you've got to read this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this as a youngster.

If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's \\"Foudation\\" before reading \\"Foundation and Empire\\". \\"Foundation and Empire\\" picks up where \\"Foundation\\" left off, with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In \\"The General\\" (the first half of \\"Foundation and Empire), Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire, and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose, the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in \\"Foundation\\". \\"The General\\" is definitely the weaker of the two stories in \\"Foundation and Empire\\", however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation, as well as the decline of the Empire.\\"The Mule\\" (the second half of \\"Foundation and Empire\\") tells the story of the Mule, a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy, and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile, a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of \\"The Mule\\" is absolutely amazing, and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader, which makes it all the more satisfying.In short, \\"Foundation and Empire\\", along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series, is a great science fiction story, beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be, and they do have a point, but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep, realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein, however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation, then you can't go wrong with picking up \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and the rest of the Foundation Series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have similar reactions to all of IA's books... that is simply that they are great fun, an easy and enjoyable read, but not terribly challenging in any respect.

Don't get me wrong- he does go after social issues and examines some things in interesting ways that can be somewhat eye-opening if you're the kind of person who never thinks that way, but it's just not earth-shattering.This sounds horrible... but I don't mean it to.

The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable, face extremely difficult situations, and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation trilogy is today revered as one of the best works of science fiction, by a veritable giant of the genre, Isaac Asimov. Begun originally as a series of eight short stories published in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and 1950, the first four were collected and published for the first time in 1951 under the title of Foundation.The Galactic Empire has ruled the galaxy in splendor, magnificence, and domination for the last twelve thousand years, but now its significant chapter is coming to a close; only no seems to realize this, except Hari Sheldon. Through the revolutionary science of psychohistory, Sheldon has calculated that in five centuries the empire will come to an end and the galaxy will devolve into a hostile, barbarian world that he has predicted to last thirty thousand years. But Sheldon has a plan to cut this time of the dark ages down to a mere millennium. It will take decades and centuries of planning, with the initial creation of the galactic encyclopedia, where all knowledge and record will be stored and kept for the future. To make this happen, he creates a small civilization on a remote planet that he names Foundation. Only through the years and decades, warlords rise up around the galaxy, looking to take down the Foundation, and it is up to Sheldon's planning for the encyclopedia and this small civilization to survive.In Foundation, Asimov doesn't focus greatly on complex character development (or female characters of merit, for that matter), but takes the sociological made-up science of psychohistory and has fun with exploring just what one can do with a world over a period of decades.Originally written on February 4, 2011.Go to[...]for over 500 book reviews and over 50 exclusive author interviews."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second of the first Foundation trilogy, Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction, \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\" cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In \\"The General,\\" the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end, but under the command of General Bel Riose, an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation, somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this, and he also knows knowledge is power, and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge, he knows Bel Riose can be stopped, so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In \\"The Mule,\\" the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms, while the Foundation has become strong and powerful, but also full of corruption, composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise, an enigmatic mutant known as \\"The Mule,\\" who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one, but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions.

It begins a thousand-year project that, through the cleaver acions of the protagonists, attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory, the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10,000 years to 1,000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while, sometimes after 50 years, or 30 years, the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political, economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus, there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire, which stretches into the sequels, is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans, the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia, but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church, the absolute (so-called) ruling kings, the nobles, the equestrians, and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as \\"atomics\\" is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also, a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK.

I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance.

I picked up the first one I found and it happened to be this one, so why not give it a go?I was intrigued right from the beginning, drawn into the story easily. Asimov's style of writing is fluid and engaging, easily allowing the reader to picture and understand everything. In addition the plot came together nicely and, in a simplistic complexity (oxymoron?), you were able to see the growth of the Foundation from a fledgling world to... well I won't reveal anything, suffice it to say the natural progression that Asimov portrayed fit together very nicely.My only complaints with Asimov, though, was that it did come together to nice and neat, never really engaging the reader to the extent of wondering, thinking, feeling and diving into the story. Instead you are almost lead from A to B to C without any guessing and wondering, without any involvement, with everything almost being a foregone conclusion. Add to this his style of writing is a bit simplistic, in that there isn't anything too complex, which isn't altogether bad because he backs it up with a fluid and believable plot that is more than enough to add credence to the story. In fact we've seen this in fantasy as well as David Eddings wrote simplistically but backed it up with a story that was enjoyable to read.I will definitely read Asimov again, especially the rest of the series, if only to what Asimov would do, being a pioneer of the genre. I would certainly recommend Asimov to anyone looking to start reading science fiction and/or a light, quick read. A recommend.3.75 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire\\" by Issac AsimovTwo hundred years have passed of the 300 Hari Seldon predicted it would take for the Empire to fall. All things have gone according to the Seldon plan and the Foundation is one of the most powerful states in the galaxy. This might change though because there are 2 more Seldon Crises on the horizon.This is another good addition to Foundation trilogy but as is typically the case not quite as good as the first. Foundation and Empire covers the next period of time for the foundation when the Foundation is finally brought back to the attention of what remains of the Empire. The Empire has heard of the power the Foundation now wields and views them as a threat and two different generations of Empire men seek to remedy that threat...The Good: The same aspects that were good in the first are present in the second. The idea overall and the way each story unfolds is good. Foundation and Empire ends with a Cliffhanger of sorts or at least without true resolution which would appear to lead into the next book.The Bad: The characters are a little flat and though it isn't as problematic in Asimov's stories as it would be in others it is a little more problematic in this than in the first. It was a non issue in the fist book because there are 5 Seldon crises and hence 5 different groups of characters. The stories are event driven and not character driven so when 5 events are spread across one event driven book it works out. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is similar in length to \\"Foundation (Foundation Novels)\\" but only covers 2 crises so we are forced to deal more with the flat characters and less with events in an event driven story. This in no way ruined the book as it was still very good but is just a highlight of one of the weaker points.Overall: If you liked Foundation you will probably enjoy Foundation and Empire. If that is the case pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\" right after, and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga, more Robot novels, and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now, only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place, including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Over the years I have read a great many books from many, many authors and yet the \\"Foundation\\" series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of \\"Foundation\\" it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series, the \\"Robot\\" series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the \\"Robot\\" series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the \\"Foundation\\" series aside, it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life.

The earlier books are the best, as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves.

If that's what you're looking for, you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it, you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that \\"golden age\\" style sci-fi suites your taste, you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three, you can continue, but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a \\"golden age\\" sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series, get the first three Foundation books.

The very first time I attempted to read the book, I was unable to get much further than the first part (The Psycho- Historians). As soon as you begin to get used the characters, a shift takes place. Unfortunately, this happens again and again. When you read Foundation, it becomes neccesary to think of each of the five parts as a short story.While the story was displayed in the best way I could imagine, the classic simply did not live up to my expectations. The emphasis is on the plot, and very little is put into the characters. While the book has it's flaws, I find it simply amazing when the date it was published is taken into consideration. Put simply, it's like the majority of 'classics' out there; while they were astounding in their own time, they simply can't stand up to the best of modern modern literature out there."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read this book when I was young, perhaps in my early 20's. I remember it as astounding, but recall little of it's content. In my early 30's, I went through and reread the entire trilogy straight through, which by then was a total of seven books. I believe Isaac is a true genius beyond most any man of our age. His insight into politics, religion, society, hope, hatred, love, friendship is beyond most anything I have known. And how he was able to incorporate these things into a series of books about the future of humanity nearly overwhelms me when I consider it. Most of what happens in the world, especially in the world of technology, has been shown in his books. It seems as if he must have has a direct link to the future."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Fifteen years ago, this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today, I know there are many better books. But you should read it anyway, it's a classic. You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar with the great Foundation.Isaac Asimov is, of course, a very skilled writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book, you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius, you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't.

As for the book's plot itself, Hari Seldon's psychohistory plan, which can predict the future of humanity, is being used as the Galactic Empire falls.

Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A trilogy consists of three books so, even although &quot;Foundation&quot; (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself, formally &quot;Foundation&quot; needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy.

Out of all the Asimov books, I feel that this one is closest to being ready to become a movie (I am not sure why I, Robot and Bicentennial Man were before this one). If you have not read this one, you are in for a treat. If you have read this one, then you know it should be added to your collection."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens, planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way, sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon, master of Psychohistory, uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events, but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book, and what makes the book a true science fiction classic, is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The great thing about Foundation is it's scope. It's a bit unsettling at times that you don't really get to know a character considerably well as the parts of the book break down over the span of several generations, but reading everything unfold and the implications that the events have in the long term is really fascinating.Asimov's writing is a mixed bag. It's imaginative and has a great vision. But at times the people seem too... squeaky-clean to be people. Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also, and I know the book was first published in the early 50's, but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good, in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation, so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov, is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself, this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden, especially in his early novels, but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college, and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works, as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon, who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and, thus, predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel \\"Foundation\\" and the third in the series, \\"Second Foundation.\\" And, of course, later in his career, Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed, in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction, he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one, the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And, just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted, he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov, and is why he was so entertaining to read, even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is, at best, functional in these works (he improved with time).Then, there is the case of the Mule, where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating, as explained in this novel. Thus, the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov, the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents, of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great, but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series, the Robot series, and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Any fan of science fiction needs to read this series.

It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, \\"With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides,\\" Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about \\"psychohistory,\\" a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is not a novel, but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives, particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods, I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success, although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future, and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read, even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Personally, I don't like &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi. It can be preachy, dated, dry, corny or just not as &quot;mature&quot; as modern science fiction. However, Asimov gives just enough characterization, not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like &quot;Galaxy knows!&quot; or &quot;By Seldon!&quot; evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember, this was written in 1941. Furthermore, the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple, clean, and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question, what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development: political autonomy, technology protected by religion, and economy. I think Asimov did a great job in breathing life into these characters. After I finished the book, I remembered Hari Seldon's mystic wisdom, Salvor Hardin's determination and Hober Mallow's money hungry practicality and what remains is an overwhelming sense of awe and satisfaction. You will get that too."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation trilogy is really a rebinding of stories published serially in Astounding Magazine, so each part really stands on its own, making only passing references to previous stories and explaining anything necessary to the current plot.Asimov's writing is rather dialog-heavy, and evolves slowly enough that I couldn't get past the first book when I read it the first time (in high school). Coming back to it years later, I've really enjoyed these three volumes, and am looking forward to reading the extension novels by Greg Bear and David Brin, two of my favorite authors (and the reason I picked up Foundation again). It's not as slow as Lord of the Rings (also worthwhile for those with patience).The story is very interesting, and lets you into the psyche of the characters only through their words and actions, so your understanding of them builds slowly through your reading.I definitely recommend Foundation. I also read Bujold's &quot;Warrior's Apprentice&quot; recently, which I find to be similar in style, and I recommend that as well."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the second volume published of Asimov's classic Foundation series (originally published as two novellas in 1945). Part I is titled &quot;The General.&quot; A military leader in the Old Empire sees the Foundation as a threat (about forty years after the end of the events described in &quot;Foundation&quot;). He gets permission from the emperor to wage a campaign. The Foundation must find a way to stop him. Fortunately, the mathematics of Hari Seldon has already considered a course of action. In Part II, called &quot;The Mule,&quot; a mutant with unparalleled power (power never considered in Hari Seldon's psychohistory; he can control the emotions and commitments of others) fights and defeats the Foundation about 300 years after the start of the novel &quot;Foundation.&quot; But, now the Mule has to go in search of the Second Foundation which is made up of psychologists and psychohistorians (the First Foundation had been set up primarily with physical scientists). When &quot;The Mule&quot; appeared in magazine format in 1945, it wowed the readership. With these stories, the series really began developing a following. I am in my 50s and have read the books a couple of times. But, my father has read them ten times!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's classic series has a quaint, nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Many consider Foundation a Sci-Fi classic, while others concider it a poorly written, boring piece of something I really shouldn't mention by name.I personally fall within the first category, I liked this book a lot. But although I myself loved this novel and its sequels, I do can imagine why other people simply hated it.Those who don't like it usally refer to the fact that there is virtually no character development, no action of any kind whatsoever, and that the technology used seems outright \\"retro\\" (nuclear trashcans and the like).All of this critism is undoutably true. Since this book is actually a collection of a series of short stories, and all of those are about different eras in the history of the Foundation, Asimov has to replace most of his characters every 50 to 100 pages which leaves room nor reason for descent characters.And since the story focusses promary on events in the future \\"history\\" of mankind and the reasons they take place, most of what happens is people talking to other people, with only small references to battles, wars, and sofort.Finally, lest not forget that these stories were written when the last century was only halfway over. Nuclear trashcans, atomic guns, and typwriter-isch computers were perfectly plausable back then.The point I am trying to make with this review is that this book is about a subject that simply isn't everybody's cup of tea. Foundation is nowhere near as accessible as Sci-Fi series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, or Babylon 5 (all good series in their own right). Or even like the more famous classic Sci-Fi novels such as \\"2001: a Space Oddessy\\", \\"1984\\", or \\"Dune\\".If you like juggling with logic and stories of people trying to make sense of their situations, then you're probably going to liove it.However, if you're more into character development, scientific discovery, or action, I wouldn'd recommend reading this novel. You'll probaly just get bored to tears."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a landmark in science fiction, and epitomizes the best of what Isaac Asimov stood for. This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence (\\"-the last refuge of the incompetent\\") to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense, and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents, in all their aspects, subsequently debates, and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics, and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say, rebellion, anarchy, and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel, but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same, in principle, as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications, and come out with an answer that will work, without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this, but make it interesting, and, indeed, arresting. This is an essential science fiction read, and perhaps Asimov's apex."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had read a great deal of Arthur C. Clarke, Peter F. Hamilton and H.G. Wells before finally coming upon Issac Asimov.I really hadn't heard of him until a friend of mine recommended him to me. I was looking for a new author to read after coming off 4,000+ pages of Peter F. Hamilton, and decided to try something different.In the beginning, I was a little worried that since the books were written in the early 50s that they would be technologically dated and not have the technological appeal that newer scifi books had.I was TOTALLY wrong. The concepts that Asimov illustrates in his writting are still used today, and were probably their original origin.Asimov's writing style does take a little getting used to, however, but in the end, I appreicated it more than hated it. It's so different that it seems to give the characters an entirely different feel. With long, descriptive, deep dialoge and a very schemish design, you don't really fully understand the ENTIRE story until the end, when it finally clicks in one of the character's heads what is really going on, after meeting the supposed opponent and hearing his side of things.I think, in the end, the best part is how you can really see the evolution of the Foundation right before your eyes, and see how things happen and how some little thing that happened a hundred years ago set off some other thing that was HUGE in the present in the story.If you do not read Asimov's Foundation series, you cannot call yourself a scifi buff, remember that, always. Now GO and read!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the best scifi, besides Dune. The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great, i strongly recamend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like &quot;hard&quot; (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi, this is a must. Actually, the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea, which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult, but not impossible, to find some generalised maths to describe it, but the rewards would certainly justify it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic, what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by &quot;Dune&quot; and only a few others come close eg &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card) series and the &quot;Galactic Milieu&quot; series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction, without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses, eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed, corruption and the like, much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery, simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe, but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me, really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers, that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature, I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone, the novel Foundation may seem mundane, and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy, together with the two later written sequels, together with the later two written prequels, together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot, together with three &quot;pre&quot;prequels written posthumously by outside authors, I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short, Foundation, serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense, drama, and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"i loved this book and how the 2 great cultures of new and old me"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The foundation series isthe second best sci-fi series ever (clarke's rama series is the first) This is an awsome book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"F&amp;E shows in marvelous guise the slowly growing power of Terminus, the inevitable clash with the still powerful remnants of the Galactic Empire, and the downright weird occurrances that follow the conquests of the Mule, a Telepath who can shape other people's minds to suit his permanantly, and who aspires to dominance. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was my first Asimov book. Based on the reviews I've seen for this series, I was expecting a more captivating story. However, another reviewer's comments has convinced me not to give up yet. That reviewer notes that this is an early work of Asimov's and the sequels are better. I'll give the next one a try."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Ultimately, the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so, this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation, then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first, then go onto Foundation. In that case, this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make, don't read this book first.On the surface, Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening, so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book, you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry, almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer, but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact, he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts, with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways, you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule, don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second novel in Isaac Asimov's landmark science fiction series, is a definite improvement on the first novel. The first novel was hardly a novel at all, but rather a loose and uneven collection of short stories. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is actually two novellas, and more care has obviously been taken with writing style, pacing, and character development.The second story, \\"The Mule,\\" is perhaps the best of the entire Foundation series. The characters are enjoyably real and likable, and there are two masterful surprises at the end.The entire Foundation series is essential reading for any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You can read the publisher's summary for yourself, but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However, the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work, Asimov was not the best writer, nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So, taking it for what it is, not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip, i need to give the trilogy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the events,this book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real, that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one , by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire , follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Welcome to the second book in the Foundation trilogy (although Asimov did write further books, it was a trilogy originally). The book picks up where Foundation left off - the Foundation has established itself as a formidable force in the Periphery of the Galaxy. Of course, everyone is too well aware that gaining control of the local warlords is small potatoes compared to what's to come. In Foundation and Empire, the inevitable comes.As the previous novel, Asimov has divided this into books, however here there are only two. As a result, he gets to explore the characters at more length then in Foundation. But again, expect wonder, amazement and enjoyment at the themes, issues and grandeur of this book, not the characterisation and &quot;literary&quot; qualities.In the first book, the conflict between the Foundation and what's left of the Empire develops. This however is a much bigger game - in the past, the warlords barely out-war-powered the Foundation, while here the Empire dwarfs it even in its twilight. As always, something must be done other than a brute force tactic. Furthermore, the &quot;heroes&quot; of the Foundation are no more, in the conflict there are no Mallows or Hardins to guide the political intrigue, so it is here that Seldon's plan is put to the ultimate test.In the second book (not to give away too much), a new threat to the Plan arises. A man known only as the Mule comes to light. And for the first time, an individual drastically changes the course of history. Indeed, he consists of the biggest threat to the plan thus far. What's so special about him?.. Personally, I found this book the most enjoyable in the whole trilogy - it reminds me of the little cryptic &quot;detective&quot; plotting from other Asimov works I read, such as I Robot and Steel Caves. However, here, it's an almost perfect melodrama played out (and unlike many detective elements in novels includingthose of Asimov - this one doesn't seem contrived or make you feel at all &quot;cheated&quot;), as we follow some Foundationers in their quest to find out what the Mule is and how to deal with him.This is a great continuation of the saga and will also bring out many interesting questions - like whether an individual can change the course of history. It will also shake up your conception of the Seldon plan - overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion, trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire, we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before, we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1,000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However, these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause, even the greatest opponent. Thus, we are asked, \\"Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not, then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?\\"...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back, it leaves you hanging, desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory, which, in my mind, makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book, don't say anything), and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end, however, we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all, it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death, destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme, I think, is present throughout the series and, in my opinion, is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly, Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and, according to Asimov, the galaxy has ever seen."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book of the original trilogy, this book is an amazing follow on to &quot;Foundation&quot;. The seven books of the Foundation series together form what I consider to be the most complete and astonishing blend of deep reality with science fiction.

Do yourself a favor, buy them all. If you don't drool over the books by the time you're done with them, read them again."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I give all 14 books 5 stars!For those of you who would like to read the Foundation story in it's entirety, from beginning to end, chronologically, then I suggest following this course. There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R. Daneel Olivaw who designed and created the Trantorian empire in the first place, and so the robot novels--which introduce the cradle world of Earth before the dawn of the empire--come before the Foundation Trilogy:The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and EarthNow some of you might not recommend that one read the Second Trilogy before the first. True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \\"hot Jupiters\\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as &quot;A Long time ahead, in a galaxy far far away&quot;. Yes, that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However, readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book, which is a good thing, it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel, which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good, but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault, as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow, this book does a few twists in it, as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan, but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is my all-time favourite book. It is so amazing, especially the science Asimov created. And it made sense too! The story is awesome, and leaves you wanting more.

It is a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it.

As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The greatest sequel ever!

Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the \`Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called \`old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled \`Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word \`atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of \`atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If \`style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the \`atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the \`Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb \`Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of \`Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy \`Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word \`atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia. Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have. More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults).

I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer.

Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"So many people like this book and have called it a \\"classic\\" - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader, but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert, Heinlein, Bradbury, and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise, I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life, but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the \\"eureka\\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case, they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice: avoid this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Being a sci-fi fan myself, I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great &quot;Foundation&quot; was, so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words (&quot;using dollar words where dime words would suffice&quot;). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that &quot;I wonder what's going to happen next to ---&quot;. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King, who can be pretty tough to get into his stories, has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help exulting on the philosophy of the book and the characters' conduct. Though the Foundation keeps confronting belligerent forces, the heads of Foundation's government and those in charge do not resort to violence! Instead of the automatic jump to use violence in a threatening situation, they use civil disobedience, embargos, and gentle ways of subjugation. Even though some warhawks (the Actionists of Terminus in Hardin's time) agitate the Foundation to go to war, in the end, the doves prevail, using their tactics of nonviolence. Since Asimov (genius) published this book in 1951, three years since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, I could tell that it was influenced by Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy. Albert Einstein recognized the enlightened mind of Gandhi, who advocated nonviolent tactics and change without shedding blood. Throughout Asimov's Foundation, published three years after Gandhi's assassination, Gandhi's teachings are very evident. Most readers probably didn't recognize this, but Foundation was probably influenced by one of the major figures of our century--Gandhi. Also, the nonviolent philosophies of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau are also somewhat present."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I really liked Foundation. Then I really liked the first part (&quot;The General&quot;) of this. And then the Mule showed up... First, Asimov always had trouble writing a mystery. I identified the Mule the first time he showed up, and I figured out the basics of his mutation as soon as the Visi-Sensor was described. And that leads me to my second nitpick. The Mule didn't need to have such a powerful ability to affect others. The ability to read minds plus high intelligence would give the Mule the same ability to predict reactions as a trained psychohistorian, and the Visi-Sensor would give him the tool to exploit it. The story itself would go much the same way, with the Mule's ability to force predicted reactions replacing his ability to force actions, but with a tighter integration with the ideas of the previous book. Furthermore, it would have meant none of the psychic conspiracies which proceeded to dominate in the books Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, etc. The ability to twist minds transforms psychohistory from the powerful science of Foundation to simply a method of forecasting the societal impact of psychic manipulation. It also transformed the Foundation series from moderately hard SF stories about the impact of a new science to just another set of stories about mind control magic. BTW, I like fantasy and soft SF -- I just wish Foundation didn't change genres in mid-trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia.Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have.More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to this kind of thing, or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust, power, fear, and so on are too powerful to overcome.Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie, Author, &quot;Virus of the Mind"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The instant I read this wonderful series, my life changedin some very significant ways. I have two degrees inmathematics, and am working on a Ph.D. in mathematics as a DIRECT RESULT of these books. Asimov explores the whole notion that human behavior is predictable on a very large scale, but completely unpredictable on an individual scale. The marriage between the clockwork Universe and the humanistic feeling that we have free-will is masterfully completed in this award-winning work. The Foundation series is classified as Sci-fi, but it is in a league of its own!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Simply the best science fiction series ever. No one macthesAsimov in the combination of thought provoking futurism andsheer out and out entertainment. This book will get youstarted on the rest of the series (which you willimmediately want to read) and hopefully on a long career ofreading all of Asimov's fiction. The Good Doctor's greatestcontribution to the genre is the notion that brains willalways win out over brawn. His plot twists never turn onmajor battles or laser fights, but always with the triumphof reason. It's all here in abundance."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Though \\"Foundation\\" was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted, using psychohistory, that the 12,000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30,000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30,000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1,000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also, Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1,000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"My 14 year old loves science fiction and fantasy and I've introduced him and reintroduced myself to some of the Classic Works of the Genre that Predate Star Wars and Serenity.Its been at least 20 years since I first read the trilogy. I had completely forgotten that the books are several self contained novella's that show the evolution of Hari Seldon's plan to keep the dark ages from the fall of the First Empire to the creation of a second empire confined to a period of a single millenia.He foresees a set of crisises that can only be managed with one solution every 75 years or so to increase the power of the foundation. Some are solved by trickery, some are resolved by Religion, and some by economics.I didn't notice until this reading that each \\"crisis\\" that emerges is resolved by someone thinking 'outside the box' of the people who resolved the previous crisis and are now controlling the reins of the Foundation.Classic scifi from the Golden Age before Star Wars.

He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.\\"Foundation,\\" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in \\"Astounding\\" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet, through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire, this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time, and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read. I read the Del Ray paperback edition, and I have never seen so many typographical errors in a published book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is the second of the three novels in the original \\"Foundation Trilogy\\", which was published in 1952 by Gnome Press. An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title \\"The Man Who Upset The Universe\\". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was \\"primitive\\" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of \\"Foundation And Empire\\" are:\\"The General\\" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Dead Hand\\" in the April 1945 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Mule\\" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella \\"The Mule\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The set arrived on time and enjoyed listening to the tapes, the tapes arrived in good condition and great sound."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great book by Isaac Asimov.

It is the first novel in what is known by many as the greatest science fiction trilogy of all time. The story envelops the reader from cover to cover and never stops. The characters are real, with great development from the author.The story itself is about the trials gone through by a small group started by the great scientist Hari Seldon. The goal of the group is to rebuild the Empire after its inevitable fall. The characters are actiive, and the plot is always moving, never letting the reader go for a second.

A new character arrives to totally disrupt everything he has planed out for the future, The Mule.Humans are so unpredictable."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...P>The story was very unique.The world he creates and the society therein is fantasic and dangerous.The protagonist is a mathmatician running around just doing his thing not realizing that destiny awaits him.I really, really recommend this book and the next. By the middle of the third book I did begin to loose interest as my male testosterome began to scream for more violence and suspense.Characters are likeable and the story resolution is very satisfying. This book was great and enjoyable in and of itself even if you don't continue on with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his \\"foundation universe\\" to tie it with his \\"robot universe\\" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an \\"empire\\" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The \\"empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes \\"foundation\\" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of \\"control\\", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering \\"who is the ultimate master?\\" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This was probably my fourth reading of the book and what can I say? I highly recommend it.My brief review is this. The book is a lot of fun to read, has some excellent characters, and a very intriguing plot. For a little more detail continue reading.I'll start with three specific observations.FIRSTGeorge Lucas was impregnated by the Foundation prior to the birth of Star Wars.Let's check off some parallels. Decadent empire in decline? Check. Deep space religion? Check. Traders/smugglers with a wild-west attitude? Check. Central planet is entirely one city? Check.If you are a Star Wars fan and have NOT read this book these little hints alone should be reason for you to check it out.I'm not discrediting GL for his development of Star Wars, simply identifying a primary source of his inspiration.SECONDThese short stories which became this novel were originally written in the 40's. Given that the stories are written before the computer age it's really easy to forgive what technologies he didn't anticipate and appreciate the development of his futuristic world and its own technology.However, it is interesting to note that the technological innovations of the Foundation anticipate to some degree the technological phenomenon we see everywhere in that devices get smaller and smaller but more and more powerful. The main difference is that the Foundation's limited resource was metal while our real world limitations are more related to energy.THIRDThe scary point? That even in decline certain civilizations can produce their most advanced achievements. These achievements are however quickly lost as the downward impetus of that civilization is too great to escape its destiny with implosion.Yikes!I think I'll end with that. Have a nice day!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I love classic sci-fi, in all it's wondrous unbelievability. I like stories where humans go to venus and find rainforests and go to mars and establish colonies and can breathe for no reason at all. It's way off science fact. but it's awesome. There's a nostalgic feeling to it that makes me feel comfortable and happy.I've never read anything by Asimov before, so i thought i'd start with his multi-part epic classic. The Foundation series takes place in the far, far distant future when humanity has spread itself across the entire galaxy. They live in a political empire, quadrillions of people on billions of planets unified for millenia under one system, advanced, strong and stable. Enter Hari Seldon, a psychohistorian (aka a mathematician who can use advanced formulas and sociology to predict the future with absolute certainty). Seldon predicts the demise of the Empire and a period of chaos, a new dark age, that will last for 30,000 years, unless he takes direct action to preserve all of human knowledge and make subtle changes to reduce those 30,000 years of disunity to a mere 1,000. I know. A 1,000 year long story. Epic. Seldon is tried for treason and disruption of the peace of the empire, but convinces the leadership of his theories and sets up the Foundation, responsible for the construction of an encyclopedia galactica to preserve all human knowledge on the rim of the galaxy, away from the turmoil about to unfold.From this introduction, Asimov proceeds to tell his story in almost like an anthology format. We see major figures and major events from each generation and how the members of the Foundation deal with crises that lead them to the forging of a new empire, conquering the darkness, chaos and barbarism that spreads across the galaxy in the wake of the fall of the first empire. There are wonderful themes explored from fate, predestination, individuality, change, and religion. This last is probably the most powerful for me. In the wake of the collapse of civilized society and it's technological wonders, the Foundation finds itself the only group of humans with advanced technology (mainly nuclear power). The other bands of humans whose tech has fallen into disrepair looks upon this advanced technology and science as magic, and the Foundation is quick to seize upon this and make a new religion out of the science, teaching \\"priests\\" how to repair and use the technology to further their own power and domination in the galaxy. An interesting concept.Asimov is a brilliant sociologist and finds interesting ways to resolve immense political and economic crises. The series is well thought out and brilliantly executed. So why four stars? Well, the scope of the story is so large that there are innumerable characters to keep track of and develop. Asimov does a fantastic job at that, but I never really identify with anyone, and just when I start liking someone, they die and we move on to the next generation. This is more of a personal quibble than anything serious. Asimov forsees a great many modern technologies from the early 50s including video conferencing, the internet, and miniaturization of a lot of the gadgets available in the 50s, a trend we see continuing today. Looking forward to the second book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I buy a few and the others are missing. Why? Is Prelude to Foundation an &#34;obscure&#34; book? This is absurd."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The second book in the Foundation series and by far the strongest of the three, and my personal favorite.The book is divided into two parts giving the characters ample time to develop (compared to the first) and the story itself will grip you and never let go. It will very easily keep you on the edge wanting more and the final conclusion will leave you wide eyed. Both parts of the book, especially the second, create some incredibly strong and memorable characters that will immerse you so completely in the universe you'll not want it to end. Asimov created a master piece with the Foundation series and this second book is the staple that holds it together."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation series portrays a tremendous sweep of future history. Published in 1951, Foundation is the first book of this series (however, Asimov would later write prequels to Foundation). Set many thousands of years into the future, this book opens with a description of psychohistory and its founder Hari Seldon. Psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. Mathematician Hari Seldon predicts a series of crises which will impact the Galactic Empire. Wanting to preserve knowledge Seldon sets up a foundation staffed with scholars and scientists.As Asimov wrote Foundation he was influenced by Edward Gibbon's multi-volume work History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In fact, Asimov read Gibbon's book not once, but twice! It may be inferred that the emergence of Christianity during Roman times and the emergence of a new religion in Foundation are parallel events. What struck me about this book is that it is primarily composed of dialogue. I also found it interesting that Asimov has newspapers and tobacco still in existence so far into the future. I did like this book and I look forward to reading additional volumes in this epic science fiction series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Notetably one of the finest chapters in the Foundation series...the \\"original triology\\" is still the best."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"These are just a phenomenal set of books.

Once I picked up Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot;, I could not put it down. To write a book of such imagination and complexity, and yet to capture the mind of the reader as it did mine, is and extraordinary feat. Asimov is a brilliant writer. I have now begun reding the fourth installement of the series, titled &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot;. He has been able to keep the same level of intensity throughout the entire series, and is still able to keep the reader guessing. Asomov is truly a mastermind.

Asimov has this clever idea that extensive control of the population requires religion, technology and the guise of freedom.In reading the introduction by Asimov he reveals the Foundation story was created after completing Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.The story is full of political intrigue and religious power-plays.Some of my highlights from the book:\\"...religion-controlled commercial empire\\"\\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\\"\\"...so that we could incubate art, science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.\\"\\"Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.\\"I'm looking forward to the second and third books in the trilogy, Second Foundation and Foundation and Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had never read any of the foundation novels and yet, considered myself a science fiction fan.

Even the smart ones do dumb things, they just do them for smart reasons."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book, introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion, but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out, as well as the newspapers, and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book, but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under, the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work, read contemporaries of Asimov, and you will find that only he, Bradbury, Herbert, and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case, Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size, and using hyperspace to solve distance problems, so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point, someone had acted with rash heroics, his mathmatics would be rendered null, and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is simply way out of this scarry scarred annoying world we are forced to live in called earth, with all its stomach aches and dripping joints and footsores and boredom. But old Asimov gives you a chance to go way out of this into just plain gigantic empires and it's all so way past any human imagination it keeps you satisfied, your poor little soft skin human body satisfied, so long as you keep reading it. Asimmov knows really how to keep you out of it all as long as your nose in his pages. But what is too much a puzzle I just don't get is how so many people want to take a good fanstasy like his and say he is actually realistic, this is the world we are going to make ourselves in a few hundred years or even sooner. But these people are totally missing the point, I don't care even if Asimov himself wanted to make all this Foundation real oine day or hoped people would, beause then if we are actually living in this sort of Foundation Empire then, if you think about it, we'll all actually just be back in boring old scratchy reality again that always feels sort of uncomfortable like velcro. They just don't get how the whole genre is called \\"science fiction and FANTASY.\\" The two halfs go together like the inside and outside of your face. Keep reality out. Hooray for unreality and yummy unreality like this one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Breathes there a teenager of the md-20th century with a love of science fiction who was not weaned on the Foundation series? All that sweeping drama, testosterone-laden but basically non-violent (all the violence is simply swept into summarizing references to ships destroyed and cities ransacked) marching through decades without concentrating on anything really boring, like character development, emotional entanglements or the trappings of society. Not a single reference to such trash as classical music, or stage shows, or pop music, or romance, just sweeping views of a distant future (or could it have been the distant past?) with the means of traveling between stars in the galaxy in the flash of a gnat's eyelash.And yet . . . revisiting the beloved Foundation, reading through the filter of a lifetime of experience, cracks appear in the plaster, and beneath them one finds that the lath is too widely spaced, the bricks behind that lath are often without mortar, and one can see the trees where bricks are missing. We live already in an age where technology has bypassed this particular Universe. Computers have become infinitely more pervasive than Asimov might have dreamed in his wildest fantasy, for at the time of the writing they were mere collators of stacks of punched cards, the transistor had yet to be introduced or shrunk to the size of a grain of sand, much less a sub-microscopic speck imprinted by the millions on a tiny wafer of silicon.Asimov had enormous faith in the future of Humanity, but he had no idea of how rapidly that future would approach - or how slowly humans would react and adapt to the challenges posed. No Empire can be established when information is instantaneously available to three-quarters of the population. Will an army composed of humans indefinitely repress an entire population composed of their friends, family, relatives? We see the answer in Libya, in Egypt, in Syria, in Africa - where the mobile phone has allowed guerrilla tactics to be employed by any group, whether terrorist or freedom-fighter or mall-invasion gangs or \\"mothers against the death camps of dog pounds.\\"Human society has been transformed by 24/7 information availability - but the universe of the Foundation proposes a populace of ciphers acting in ignorance of facts that would already be generally available in the 21st century. \\"Just Google it\\" or \\"look it up in Wikipedia\\" is nowhere to be found. There is a project of the First Foundation to write a \\"Galactic Encyclopedia\\" - yet it already exists in 2012.And yet that universe is immensely attractive, reduced to comic book simplicity, perfect for any adolescent (whether 14 or 74) to immerse himself - or very infrequently herself, as this universe is truly misogynist: the strongest female is just a papier mach&eacute; accoutrement.The psychobabble of \\"psychohistory\\" which is the very premise of the Foundations is wholly implausible, of course. The introduction by Asimov of \\"The Mule\\" is his admission of the absurdity of such a concept, which he probably didn't consider when the first book was written. Man has mutated more rapidly in the past 10,000 years than Asimov's populace has in 50,000 - a highly unlikely probability in the event that man actually progresses to interstellar colonization.All that said - I downloaded the trilogy on Kindle whilst in America, read it through lovingly, and was again transported to that clean, technologically impossible universe, forgetting all the travails of real life at present, putting the horrors of terrorism, the Hunger Games, the beheadings of \\"infidels\\" and the lies of politicians to one side for too brief a span. It isn't great literature, not even great Science Fiction - yet it is riveting to any adolescent male who enjoys reading as opposed to or in parallel with the escapism of cinematic action films like the \\"Matix\\" or \\"Terminator\\" trilogies.For some reason, Europeans aren't allowed to download the books. No doubt the vagaries of copyright laws, tax authorities and those %^&* politicians - as well as the accursed lawyers (who are blissfully absent from the trilogy, undoubtedly bred out of existence due to their total lack of humanity).Asimov was the supreme techie of his time - and it shows in his use of language - sparse, precise, technically impeccable, but occasionally impenetrable without a modicum of concentration.I heartily recommend it to you !"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov is incredibly easy to read. His sentences are perfectly formed, neither too long, nor too decorated, nor too sparse. He strikes the perfect balance for his type of story, driving things forward consistently through description or dialogue whenever each is appropriate.This story takes place over a rather large time period and could really be considered a collection of closely related short fiction instead of a novel. It works well that way. We're only given information on the most exciting periods of time in the Foundation's history, and we're left to fill in most of the blanks on our own.On the downside, there wasn't much time to get to know any of the characters. I, Robot follows the same two characters through several situations and you get to know something about them by the end (even if they are almost cardboard cutouts, it works). In Foundation, nobody lasts long enough to really care about.Despite that flaw, it did what any good book should do- it made me interested in continuing the story. Luckily, this is a long series. I'll have plenty of time to finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"WHY CAN'T I BUY THIS FOR MY KINDLE?????

We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10,000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the \\"nucleonics\\" of the Foundation, its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see, the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who, through inside and cleverness, make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author, I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization), parodies and criticism of religion and science, trade and technology, is throughout the book.Near the end, we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades, some more, and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended. Not \\"hard core\\" sci-fi so much as character-driven sci-fi.Recommend:The Foundation Trilogy Boxed Set (Foundation, Second Foundation, Foundation and Empire)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The foundation novels are superb!

A welcome change."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy, at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire, and 30,000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy, little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome, with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read, so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters, and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation, so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism, you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them, and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time, such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page, it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming, and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end, this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going, and held my interest until the end."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already, so if you are reading this, you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings, a habit which has cost me more than a few \\"helpful\\" votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people, especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question. That question is: Are you interested in rich, well drawn characters that develop over time and make you love them? If the answer is yes, for God sake, go read something else. This is no insult to these books, they are great, but if you want character development, you really need to look elsewhere. SF in this time period in general tended to be rather, um.. what's the word... DULL, THAT'S THE WORD. Notice I didn't say bad, I said DULL. SF books of this period read more like philosophy tracts then what we would think of as novels.NOW!! With all that being said, when I first read this book in the 8th grade I thought it was the best thing since Dune (I didn't have a real sense of copyright dates so Dune came first.The reason I liked this book so much had something very much to do with my love of history and the underlying idea that you could use math (another interest of mine) to predict it. For me that was great, my fellow 8th graders thought I was In-SANE. They didn't get it, as they didn't get most things I was interested in and so I sluffed them off like the useless intellectual baggage they were.Now, at 34, I reread these books, and now I think they may have had a point. This book (and the ones after it) are just people having long political discussions as time goes by in a series of increments. Because the book is comprised of short stories that are set decades apart, you get all the grandeur and scope of a great epic with almost none of the action.To make this clear and simple, this book is about politics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a book about politics, but if you read the description and you think this is a grand epic full of action and war and complex politics then you are going to get one out of three. If you want ALL three, I suggest that you read the original Dune series instead.It should be noted that when I was reading Foundation, the normal children were reading The Pigman and their idea of SF was William Sleator's Interstellar Pig and Jane Yolen's Dragon's Blood. These are all good books, but it just so happened that I wasn't normal and so I was reading Dune and Foundation.My point is this: your average run-of-the-mill younger reader will probably find this incredibly boring, but if you are one of the odd ones, the geeky ones, the ones who watch TV Sci-Fi and think \\"There has to be more than this,\\" you know, the kind who actually don't think that a movie being old doesn't automatically equate to a movie being BAD and/or isn't afraid of a book because it has more than 24 pages, this one just might be for you.If on the other hand, you think Star Trek or even Star Wars are the peak of SF (I did at one point) you may not be ready until you have a couple of years on you. Lucky for us the people immigrating to print SF are growing up with much more mature SF then I had on TV. Babylon 5, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, the first season of Heroes and the British New Wave shows like Doctor Who and Torchwood, completely and especially Torchwood are ensuring that the people who change over to print SF are much more well balanced then I was at that age. I had Robotech as my big Sci-fi epic and that was IT, and anyone who is a fan of THAT show knows that blueballs is no myth, we've been waiting for the end of that story for 25 years and.. but that's a different review.These books are a cornerstone of SF because they deserve to be. That doesn't mean you'll like them, but I hope I've given you a clue as to whether you want to pick them up. I hope so, but make sure it's the right time.Good Reading.P.S. If you still aren't sure, try to get your hands on the very cool BBC adaptation of the Foundation Trilogy. It's rather spacey and is more like Doctor Who meets Foundation, but if you can deal with that, you're probably a fan :)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"You would be hardpressed to point to another of Asimov's work and name it better the Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Over a decade ago I checked this book out of the library, only to return it later having read only a couple of pages. I bought a copy the other day and was pleasantly surprised.Asimov started writing the Foundation series when he was 21 and this novel was first published in 1951. In some ways the time period in which it was written can be seen. Nuclear power is envisioned as the be-all, end-all of energy. People smoke (although the cure for cancer was apparently found, so any carcinogenic effects would be annulled) and there's talk of \\"microfilm records.\\"That said, the story was well-written and the reader can clearly imagine the events depicted as plausible. There is an overarching narrative focusing more on the grand sweep of history, but it is told in vignettes from the lives of key characters at important moments in time.\\"Foundation\\" is a clever book with a storyline that ages well."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Comes this novel, given to me on Christmas, by my dad, on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan, not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King, I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas, a month or so goes by, and I finally open \\"Foundation\\". Doing research before reading this, I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book, I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read, as I was very confused. Before I knew it, im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading, and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent, yet simple. His character's aren't deep, but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is, of course, the awsome interplay between technology, politics, religion, economy, and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus, the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself, Hari Seldon, is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply, descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism\\" within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians\\" and the foundationeers, so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably: nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter annihilation). To put it simply, the idea that nuclear fission will be powering everything at the point in time 12 millenia from now is archaic.Besides nuclear power, there are number of minor ideas introduced in the book that also did not hold well or at all since its writing (prevalent smoking, for instance). Together, the whole technological and cultural setting of the book has sort of a retro feel now... kind of like the Fallout games.All that, however, can be forgiven for the most part since it is often impossible to write about technology of the future merely decades from now let alone whole millenia from now. Asimov was a writer and a scientist, not a psychic.Striking is also the absence of biochemistry or genetics, since one would assume that those would be Asimov's strong points for the fact that he majored and worked in biochemistry.Third, while the passage of time had appropriate atmosphere of scale (more or less), the galaxy felt kind of small. The distances weren't shown or explained very well so a trip from the Periferies to Trantor or Kolgan(sp?) seems like a trip to an amusement park only some 100 miles away.Nevertheless, the best what Foundation has to offer more than makes up for its shortfalls."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Imagine an empire so humongous it stretches across the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine a mathematical formula that can actually prove future events. Then imagine that formula predicts this galactic empire will soon crumble and a new dark ages lasting at least 30,000 years will follow.If you can imagine all that, you get the gist of Foundation by Isaac Asimov and the beginning of a highly regarded series of books in the science fiction genre.What happens next is a group of people try to find ways to circumnavigate, though not necessarily halt, the new approaching dark age.Asimov isn't for everyone, and I can't admit to loving his prose. But his ideas for plots are top notch. This book, and the series of books that follow it, are proof of this.Asimov's writing is often considered too dense for the casual reader, and there's some truth to this. If you like your science fiction with lots of action and ray guns and alien spaceships flying about, Asimov isn't for you. But if you like hard science fiction based upon hard, indepth science, this Asimov is probably right for you, especially the Foundation series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact, I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression, displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures, and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much, is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great, rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov, is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature.

Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology, most importantly nuclear power. This source of power, needed by all, then became an object of worship, and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail, it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war, and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three, so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring, I found it to be an interesting book, the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Oh how avidly I read these long ago.

But let's say that it encompasses a future history spanning tens of thousands of years at it's most crucial time - when the very fabric of its society is about to plunge into a dark age. Only one man can save it, Hari Seldon, by writing an Encyclopedia Galactica that will redirect the knowledge of mankind into a small group of scientists who can rebuild humanity in just a few thousand years.Epic in proprtion, brilliant in detail, this is a must read for anyone who not only savors the salt of Sci-fi literatue, but anyone who just wants to read the best of the best of any genre."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Great book!

Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal \\"masterpiece\\" for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi, I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh, forsooth, the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more, only this time, more than 12,000 years into the future.But, lo, some things have never changed: women are little more than pawns to the men who run the Galaxy -- still concerned with \\"housewife\\" duties.Distance is still measured in miles; microfiche and paper still reign supreme; the priesthood flourishes; folks still haven't learned that smoking kills.Not one to espouse elucidation, the new bard Asimov floods pages with convoluted dialog that fails to eschew obfuscation.The five barely connected stories that comprise this mess are loosely thrown together in homage to Hari Seldon, as we are seldom harried by logic.While I realize that it's easy to criticize the grand master of sci-fi after his passing, someone must raise the cry that the emperor was born with no clothes."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation novel is very dated, which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an \\"atomic blaster,\\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me, I guess."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. \\"Nuclear\\" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape.

It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire, led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general, and the dumb-luck, mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how, under the Seldon plan, it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant, the Mule, who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls, and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists, philosophy, and colorful, memorable characters. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This series sets the standard for excellence. This demonstrates a master of the craft of writing. Asimov was brilliant and when he turned that intellect to writing, he created amazing works, none better than this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"That's not saying much since I thought that \\"Foundation\\" was pretty poor.\\"Foundation and Empire\\" was pretty good, but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak, I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation, there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire, it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations, but not as much asthe first \\"Foundation\\" by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant, the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel, \\"Second Foundation.\\" Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for \\"Second Foundation\\" because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if \\"SecondFoundation\\" is better than this book then I will recommend the\\"Foundation Series\\" to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy, one of the touchstones of Science Fiction, began as a magazine serial in John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction in November 1949. Respective stories were gathered together into the three volumes: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953). Finally, the whole shebang was published as The Foundation Trilogy in 1961 and in 1966, won a Hugo Award as the best science fiction series of all time. I don't know that this last is still true, but it is certainly one of the seminal works in the history of Science Fiction and remains extraordinarily influential.Oliver Morton, in The New Yorker of May 17, 1999, had an excellent essay about the books wherein he pointed out that Asimov is really responsible for the concept, so prevalent in science fiction, of the Galactic Empire. He particularly demonstrates the debt that the Star Wars series owes to Asimov's vision, a vision which apparently in turn owes a debt to Edward Gibbon, whose Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Asimov had read twice as a young man.He also draws one important distinction; where the main foundation of the Star Wars series is speed (iconified by the image of the accelerating starship), the Foundation series is built upon size. It is the epic scope, spanning thousands of years and worlds and incorporating billions of people, that really made Foundation so groundbreaking. It enabled Asimov to apply historical themes to a genre that, virtually by definition, lacked history.All of this is certainly true, but it strikes me that the epic scope as utilized by Asimov presents a political/philosophical problem. Asimov posited a future science of psychohistory, a discipline which would bring scientific cause and effect certainty to the field of human affairs. The Trilogy traces the fall and reemergence of a Galactic Empire with the entire process having been predicted by and, to some extent guided by, Hari Seldon, the Founder of Psychohistory. This premise manages to combine two of the worst ideas that human's have ever had--first, that history is deterministic and follows some kind of iron clad pattern; second, that there is any merit to psychology, particularly as a predictive tool when applied to large populations over a lengthy period of time.The whole thing is sort of creepy in so far as it dismisses free will and the impact of ideas and individuals on man's development. The quest for discernible patterns and laws in human existence is nothing new, most religions are predicated on the revelation of such hidden patterns. And it is natural for scientists to be attracted to the idea that there are certain universal laws that will eventually explain our behavior, everything from why we love or why we kill to why I just typed the letter r. But I for one, do not believe that our lives are predetermined. In fact, I find such an idea pretty bleak and antihuman.I still recommend the series, particularly in light of the influence it has had on the genre and for the massive scope of Asimov's vision, but, for me at least, the Freudian &amp; Hegelian overtones are a little bit off-putting.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion, and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion, Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion, or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses, as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire, and the historical allusions show. However, there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell, most of the figures holding real political, social, or economic power in this society of the future, thousands of years ahead, were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned, though, that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s, during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of SF, female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission, Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction. To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is seen as classic science fiction. Shockingly, Foundation is hardly a classic. Its theme of history repeating itself is drilled into the readers head. However, Foundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy, continues with these themes with better fluency and character.\\"The General\\" continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation, and Asimov, once again, reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire, Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in \\"The Mule\\" Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation, like the empire, will fall. The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers, was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act, but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader, but with foreshadowing, many revelations are undermined. Bayta, one of the main characters, has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"How can this be considered a classic? It's fun, it's entertaining, but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down, but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel. A classic novel is suppose to convey a message to the reader about life, the words and writing style is suppose to be superior to the average writer, and the story should stand out as one of the more creative stories. This novels main lesson about mankind is not a unique one : The idea of history being preditced by math ,science, and psychology. People will never change, civilization will always end up destroying itself. Nothing is for certain even if science says so. I have heard this all before he did not invent this idea I want to hear somthing new and original. The great writers have superior writing skills. Askimov writing skills are just average. I expect to see in a classic novel a lot of symbolism, carefully crafted prose, well thought out sentences, better play on words, and better dialog! The dialog spoken by the characters is 3rd gradish and dull. Finally the author lacks the creativity the classic writers have. I expect to see a detailed lay out of how each creation works. I like an author who invents hi-tech gizmos and then educates the reader with all the scientific details of how it works. I like to learn a little physics when I read a science fiction book. --Main point: I liked the robotic novels better. Askimov went into details of how the robots worked. His robot books were good,not classics, but much better I thought."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"...The first book (excluding PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION) in a five-book series introduces the idea of pyschohistory. Pyschohistory is simply the mathematics and variables in predicting the general future since it cannot predict an individual's. Hari Seldon, pioneer of this revolutionary science has seen into the future where chaos will INEVITIABLY exist for thirty thousand years but with the triumph with each &quot;Seldon Crises&quot; they will be able to shorten the years by a millenium. Hari Seldon must rely on the future (Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow) to provide each step in shortening the amount of years. FOUNDATION covers the first 100 years of this chaotic period following the life of Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, the key players in the book. Though somewhat lacking action and fast-pace suspense, it's a very good book nonetheless. Asimov is able to find clever ways to conquer each &quot;Seldon crises&quot; so ingeniously that it makes up for the lack of action. Infact, Asimov writes with a &quot;cause and effect&quot; basis. The book also ends in a way leaving the reader somewhat satisfied yet will want to read the rest of the series.I recommend this book to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for a great read, but the lack of action can bore some. And altogether the series is also great to read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I read this book as a teenager, and loved it. Read it again several years later, and could not understand what it was that I liked. Sure, Asimov writes with ease - and it is equally easy to read. But the characters are totally flat, the plot (?if any) is thoroughly predictable, and he also shows a terrible amount of prejudice against women, minority people and just about anything that does not fit the template of &quot;middle-age white american male&quot;. The book generally left a bad taste, as if you'd stuffed yourself on marshmallows - mostly air but enough sugar to make you feel sick."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you only read one sci-fi book this should be the one.

However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The book, Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one, and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books, but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can, as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read &quot;Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov, but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Keep in mind: this is the first book in a trilogy. Even though each book stands on its own as a classic of science fiction, you have to take them as a whole, I think. Besides, once you've read Foundation, you'll want to read the others. That said, I first came across this trilogy in the library and was reluctant to read it. On first reading, I was weighed down and a little turned off by the politics, and I almost lost interest. Hari Seldon, a mathemetician, predicts that the mighty Empire, centered on the giant planet/city Trantor, will be destroyed in 500 years, which will be followed by 30,000 years of barabarism and social decay. Only after that will a new Empire emerge. He devises a plan to shrink that dark period to 1,000 years, and new rulers of his design will take over. After a trial, Seldon and his band are exiled to a backwater planet, Terminus, surrounded by stronger and more resourceful enemies. What band? Those working on a great Encyclopedia to preserve the knowledge of mankind once the dark period strikes. They wouldn't travel to the other end of the galaxy on their own accord. Forced exile was the only way Seldon's Plan would work. Soon the true purpose of the Plan is revealed. Seldon was dead before the Foundation established itself on Terminus. But he appears as a hologram during times of crisis. It turns out Seldon predicted these crises, and the Foundation's actions are forced down one path. The Foundation slowly gains advantage over its enemies. It will still be centuries before they are strong enough to take on the Empire. The Foundation gains these advantages sometimes by heroic acts of its leaders. But according to Seldon, the actions of the individual are unpredictable and can't be counted on. So is there some greater power guiding this whole scheme? The question is not approached until the next book, Foundation and Empire. We and the men of the Foundation know that Hari Seldon formed two Foundations, and that's all we know. You might spot elements that George Lucas borrowed for his Star Wars movies: Empires, small versus the mighty, parsecs, blasters, and as you read further, mind control. Foundation sets up the series strongly. Read it, and keep reading. The politics don't bother me so much anymore. They are a necessary part of the story. That's why I say to take the trilogy as a whole. All three books are essential to the whole story, one is not necessarily the best, but the real excitement and surprise endings are saved for the next two books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"\\"Foundation\\" by Isaac AsimovIn the distant future: humanity has spread to the stars and it has been so long that most have forgotten which planet humanity originated from. All of the inhabited planets (almost 25 million) owe allegiance to the Empire, a gigantic centralized government that is located on the planet of Trantor. Hari Seldon is a scientist and the utmost expert of new science known as \\"Psychohistory\\". Hari uses psychohistory which is mathematics based to map out the future in detail. He has determined that the Empire will fall within 300 years. Hari knows that he cant stop the fall but wishes to minimize the dark ages that follow in which he predicts that most science will be lost and that it will take humanity over 30,000 years to get back to where they currently are. Hari thinks he can minimize this amount of time by forming the Foundation whose job it will be to compile all knowledge into a galactic encyclopedia.........This was actually a very good and well thought out story. The story unwinds in an interesting and unique way that is very different from most sci-fi stories I have read.The Good: The story was well thought out and unfolds interestingly. Asimov is a great world/universe builder and his take on the emerging society of the foundation and its purpose driven evolutions is excellent. The story is well paced and never really felt like it had time to slow down. It is surprising that Asimov managed to tell his tale which covers an expansive amount of time in just under 250 pages and still make it feel fleshed out.The Bad: Some say the characters in \\"Foundation\\" are flat. This isn't untrue however as surprising as it may sound this doesn't have an extreme adverse effect on the story. The reason it doesn't is because the story isn't character driven. The characters act more as small pieces in a large extended chess game and merely serve to move an event driven story along its path.Overall: Foundation was a great and unique read. Pick it up and give it a read!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is an amazing story about the ingenuity of one man whose quests bring him to the brink of barbarism-- in a time a million years from now. Hari Seldon is the character we'd all like to be, and Isaac Asimov is the writer we'd all like to be. Definately five stars. I recommend for anyone with a likeness to math, history, or science, or anyone who has read anything by Asimov, Brin, or Bear."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"With all the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the \\"science\\" in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \\"nuclear powered devices.\\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation, however, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style, context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring, unimaginative, and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"For its time \`Foundation' by Isaac Asimov was a tale that predicted futurism as the calculation of the eventual outcome of each technological economic progression that mankind could, and would, go through, if it stuck to certain paths, especially the implementation of the concept that \\"small is better\\" with an economic drive that produces its best results when under stress, such as wartime. This model is pretty much the way the world works today with technology leaps made when there is a demand for it to do so and at no time is this demand greater than when a nation is faced with a possible crisis. Asimov's \`Foundation' is a story about a society of colonized scientists that have been chosen by Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, who sees a crisis developing in the cosmic empire that can only be avoided if certain conditions are met for each impending emergency that is predicted through psychohistorical analysis. He sets up an off world colony at the unknown edge of the galaxy, the foundation, that goes through several generations, with each generation reaching a hidden 'Seldon crisis' point that becomes the focus of several successive stories in the book. Futurism was actually an artistic movement originating in Italy around 1910 whose aim was to express the energetic, dynamic, and violent quality of contemporary life, especially as embodied in the motion and force of modern machinery. Nowadays it means to believe that the meaning of life and one's personal fulfilment lie in the future and not in the present or past. Foundation symbolizes these ideas. Although not the most exciting or action packed SF you could read, is also somewhat limited in its SF feel, is more of a revelation of economics and is the kind of literary material that would impress the business and politically minded reader more than the seasoned SF reader. None-the-less this is still an important work that remains relevant today as it did in the early 50s, but the sequels might be a bit of a hard sell on the bases of this educational SF novel."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I love this book and now fully understand why Asimov is considered one of the grandmasters of this genre. Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits, but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion, politics, economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take, for instance this quote from page 210.\\"The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds\\"In regards to the power of economics\\"The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.\\" - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However, Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point, but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series. If you have not read it then I say move it to the top of the list. This is truly one of the great SciFi stories of all time.Leave a comment below and let me know what you think!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation surprised me. I had been expecting dry, hardcore science fiction with hard to grasp worlds and characters. I couldn't have been more wrong. Foundation takes politics, psychology, statistics and survival and showcases them in a galaxy far, far away.Time passes quickly in the novel, so you don't get very attached to any of the characters. The focus is the big picture, the future, and the steps taken to prevent the coming anarchy. More than that, the focus is on the plot. Clean dialogue and a lack of heavy description keeps the plot constantly moving forward. The pace the plot progression sets makes the book very hard to put down. Foundation is a smart and easy read that deserves its label as being the best science fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A decent series, but none of the books really stood out for me. The first, as is usually the case, was the best. A very fascination premise."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"When I first read The Foundation book, I was pretty dissappointed and I didn't finish it.

Asimov is a fabulous writer, no doubt."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book did not meet my expectations. First, it was really boring and predictable. Second, you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters, Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better. However, FOUNDATION is just an average read."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"A nod to the greatness of this book, on a recent episode of Deep Space Nine, a group of genetically altered humans got together and used mathematical formulas to predict the outcome of the Dominion War.

If only they would have given credit..."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I just finished it today, and must say I wasn't dissapointed. The movement in time for each section is very effective and interesting in moving the story. I found that at each part, the radical, the person immediately disliked, turns out to be the savior of the Foundation during that crisis. I've been exposed to a lot of Science Fiction and while reading this book, I saw pieces of almost all of them in here. The Galactic Empire of StarWars originated here, the personal shields and the control of the spice guilds from Dune, to name a few. I must say, in my humble opinion, Foundation deserves the high placing as one of Science Fiction's greatest works."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed &quot;Foundation&quot; and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated &quot;Foundation&quot; may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov takes the reader on a journey that is thought provoking and entertaining. It's probably his best work of all the foundation series.&quot; Foundation and Empire&quot; is one of those books that you simply can not put down."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I have just read all the volumes in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Because the basic ideas of society and its control (&quot;psychohistory,&quot; &quot;Foundation, &quot;Gaia&quot;) are cleverly and skillfully constructed, I could grasp these highly abstract ideas much easyly. Forever Asimov's Galactic genious! Of course this series planned as an entertainment, it can be recommended to the academician, who has his/her major in social science or its related area."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book does not need action to be great. Mr. Asimov was a profound writer. I do NOT mean swears or grownup matters. His words go beyound the sci-fi plot. This is why I give it five stars. This book may be hard to follow. This is because Mr. Asimov wrote it in sections for a magizine. Just be patient an you will lovvvve it."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Before &quot;Foundation&quot; i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. Issac Asimov shows off his expertise in what is probably the best series ever. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian and can predict the future. He sees the impending collapse of the Empire and establishes two Foundations to prevent that."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation details the fall of the Galatic Empire and rise of an island in the midst of desolation - the Foundation. Not full of starship battles, but I have never seen a more clever story in its use of thought. The three Seldon crisises and the solutions have an intellectual beauty to them in that 1) the crisises are believable and 2) the solutions are also believeable and in retrospect obvious. I have noticed this about other Asimov books, espically &quot;The Stars, like Dust,&quot; and it is my favorite part of his style. Very higly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"this is the first book i read by asimov. of the 7 books in the &quot;trilogy&quot;, i found it the most gripping. (this is where i start to digress and spell words wrong) i am happy that i read it before the books that he wrote after but take place before the action in this one. i believe that the first two books ruin some of the suspense in later novels. ah, the book... my first venture into sci-fi, and i am so greatful that i took it. although it is in the future, i never got the impression that it was unrealistic. well, i hope i helped. live well and for yourself."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books, Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions, he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions, which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea, Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov, remember, wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book, but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it, change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39, I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age, helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematical equations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"This book is a well written science fiction classic. While not a major action-adventure story like many science fiction novel really makes you think about the plot, the characters, and all of humanity.It is truly one of the best scienc fiction books I have ever read and encouraged me to read the whole, equally enthralling, series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day, Dr. Seldon, finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away, this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find. As people explore, explain, create, and discover more and more of the universe, will there eventually come a time that there is nothing else to find?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe, written by Asimov and other authors. While not all authors live up to Asimov, their contribution allows his loyal fans a chance to slip back into the universe he created. If anyone is interested in Scifi books, the Foudnation series is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Still a great classic! Got to read the rest of the series now. Why do they make me type more words for a review than I feel like saying at Amazon?"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I'd say that you will probably be a bit lost if you don't start with foundation and plan to continue with second foundation after this book. Reading this as a stand alone would be a bit like reading Tolkien's two towers without having started at the beginning of the series. You could probably do it and get something from the story, but the beauty of the foundation series is that it is a series telling one coherent story. This book shows it's age with some of the technology it discusses, but it is also vividly imaginative and full of timeless lessons."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you pick this book up, i would plan on getting the rest of the series. I decided not to start with the prequel, but with what are considered to be some of Asimov's best novels. I am currently on second foundation, the third book in the series, and i am looking forward to finding out what happens next. I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does. Characters are introduced, they play their parts and then fade into history as a new set of characters is introduced. As a fairly well read individual i would recommend these books to anyone."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"when I was child we read this story and did essays in high school ... today I find it hard to follow the story line or read more then a few pages at a time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second volume in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\".In \\"The General\\", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.\\"The Mule\\" is set roughly one hundred years after \\"The General\\". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever, with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation, a collection of five short stories, is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories, \\"The Psychohistorians\\", takes place on Trantor, the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory, Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years, the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason, Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus, where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In \\"The Encyclopaedists\\", having progressed 50 years into the future, the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily, Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.\\"The Mayors\\" takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However, the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In \\"The Traders\\" another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with, and contamination by, Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is \\"The Merchant Princes\\". The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell, a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking, especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series, but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters, planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding.

His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"As is all Issac Asimov Novels this is good reading! The 4 star rating is that the story does not seem to come to a complete end, I did expect more."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society, where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact, is interesting, it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it, but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks, since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends, but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes, I rated it only three stars, but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice, since I believe it is still a very good book, but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read. I personally prefer a Peter Hamilton, Stephen Baxter or Andreas Eschbach for example."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, \\"Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.\\"Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in \\"Foundation.\\" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.Yet \\"Foundation\\" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as \\"psychohistorical\\" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies \\"psychohistory\\"--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the \\"cold war\\" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in \\"Foundation,\\" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the \\"character development\\" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as \\"2001\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\"). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \\"Do individuals matter?\\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an \\"equal\\" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is \\"mule\\").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Normally I need lots of action and suspense to keep me interested in a book. This book had some level of suspense (not like Koontz's, The Watcher) but focused more on the growth of the main character. Very intriguing plot that had me wondering what was going to happen next. I liked it enough to read the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by &quot;the Killer B's.&quot; Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his &quot;I, Robot.&quot; There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the &quot;series.&quot; Understand that he took 3 different series, his robot series, foundation series, and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet, all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov, start here or with his &quot;I, Robot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation series is Sci-Fi's grandest and most accessible epic. Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever. (The galactic empire of Dune shares a lot of similarities)...Great stuff from the Grandmaster!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book, the &quot;unofficial&quot; start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands.

Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!).

Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the \\"Foundation\\" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"All I can say, for warm start, is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner, he really makes you feel a part of the future, as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking, but also in politics, economy, religion, mass manipulation and, of course, in every way that makes a human, human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah, that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view, he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times, that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history, statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart, he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired: the Encyclopedia Galactica.Set as a scientific colony and lacking natural resources, the Foundation, as it is called, starts to suffer of politics and diplomatic issues and that's just where all the greatness starts coming. As it's well more developed in technology and science than the rest of Periphery - as they call the region of the galaxy containing the Terminus system - other colonies start trading natural resources, such as gold and iron, for scientific gadgets to control their masses.Based on science, there is created a new religion in which priests are, actually, researchers and technicians. It was Arthur C. Clarke who once said that high level technology is indistinguishable from magic, though it makes perfect sense for this novel, except we are not taking magic in consideration, but religion (although they are equal if you look from a different angle, but this is not to be discussed in this review). To control masses in the Four Kingdoms of Periphery, they sell science. And it works pretty well until there's a crisis, and another, and another. In each of them, those called Seldon Crisis and taken in consideration when the psychohistorian predicted the need of Foundation, he appears and hints a new period of development.But it is not only religion that control masses and it is not only faith that is needed in human race, but also trading, protection, food, gadgets, industry and, of course, a stable economy. Nuclear force moves everything in the future, that's how Asimov puts it and he puts it so well that he really makes us think if isn't it the power we should explore - consider this book was written in the beginning of nuclear power.The book is well-split in five sections: The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders and The Merchant Princes. In each of those, Asimov explores a deep wound in human civilization, psychology and sociology, based on a few dominating aspects, and shows that it is even easier to overpower an entire society poking only its foundation.It is a masterpiece, well-thought from the beginning to the last word. That's all I have to say.95/100"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read.

I read this one in record time. A great read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is a \\"trilogy\\" of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation, a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia, starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless, I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later, when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character, though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book, challenges arise to meet the Foundation, and at each challenge, the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses, the Foundation gets more and more technology, while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen, Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Foundation And Empire, by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy, which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book, Foundation, save that the book has only two \`books', to the original's five, which allows for less epic scene setting, and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful, deep, and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term \`silhouetting', wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do, or that which is not described in \`on stage' actions. This book, though, is not merely a continuation of the first book, but an expansion of its themes, which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy, ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire, which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience, predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation, on the planet Terminus, has survived several \`Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention, which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies, and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein), and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone, even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside, and proving its internal \`validity', the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security, as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then, the Empire seemed impervious. Yet, Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic, when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors, nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet, lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers, it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy: \`What place does the individual have in the overall scheme of things?', or, more succinctly, \`Does an individual matter?' The Mule seems to be a resounding answer of YES! He also seemingly cuts to the dubious heart of Psychohistory, which is based upon the well known Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends. Because of these philosophical depths, wonderfully concise and spare writing which does not bore one silly with extraneous detail, but a lean, clean narrative line, excellent characterizations, and an ability to deliver a twist ending many mystery writers would envy, Foundation And Empire ranks as a truly great novel, even outside its genre. Only readers addicted to the modern need to reveal why everything is, in excruciating detail, and to have mere action, action, action on every page, will not recognize this as not only great sci fi, but great literature. Asimov, too, deserves the label as a great writer. As The Mule might say: On to Second Foundation!"},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"What else can one possibly say about one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written??

There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R.

True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way. Note also that I do not consider Asimov's early &quot;Empire&quot; novels to apply to the Foundation series. Interesting that they were included in Foundation's Triumph, but not relevant. It was cheesy in my opinion that the &quot;time machine&quot; was included in that story and then not even used for any practical purpose. Again, another plot-joiner there (Triumph was filled with them!). So, 14 books in all, in my estimation. The three galactic empire books are so cheesy, just don't read them...nothing to do with Foundation at all."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever.

It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future.

I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."},{"Title":"Foundation","review":"From everything I've heard about this book, I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break, I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a &#34;barbaric&#34; state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned.

Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out.

It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders, & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses, there will follow 30,000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse, but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1,000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book, and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise, which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular, The Traders, seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole, Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be.

The premise and scope of this novel are staggering and the plot develops at a blistering pace. You will not be able to put this book down once you start. The only minor critique I have of this book is that, as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future, characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore, it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate, though interconnected stories. When all is said and done, this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time.
