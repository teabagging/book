AND YOUNG : IA DRANG The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam (LIBRARY OF MILITARY HISTORY)","description":"New York Times Bestseller: A  powerful and epic story . . . the best account of infantry combat I have ever read  (Col. David Hackworth, author of About Face). In November 1965, some 450 men of the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Harold Moore, were dropped into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was brutally slaughtered. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. They were the first major engagements between the US Army and the People s Army of Vietnam. How these Americans persevered sacrificing themselves for their comrades and never giving up creates a vivid portrait of war at its most devastating and inspiring. Lt. Gen. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting interviewed hundreds of men who fought in the battle, including the North Vietnamese commanders. Their poignant account rises above the ordeal it chronicles to depict men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have once found unimaginable. It reveals to us, as rarely before, man s most heroic and horrendous endeavor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RrVV-b_2enkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Help Lord the Devil Wants Me Fat","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ECG Interpretation Made Incredibly Easy!

Fantastic Victory explains the complexities behind the decades of failed negotiations and subsequent wars to conquer the Jews.

Nothing tangible points to foul play behind his fall from a cliff, but FBI agent John Lau, a relative of the coffee\\\\growing family, has his suspicions. What he needs is evidence, and who better to provide it than his friend, anthropologist Gideon Oliver, the Skeleton Detective? Gideon is willing to help, but surprisingly and suspiciously both the police and the other family members refuse to okay an exhumation order. As a result, Gideon, to his surprise and against his better judgment, finds himself sneaking into a graveyard under cover of night with John, a flashlight, and a shovel not exactly up to the professional standards of the world s most famous forensic anthropologist, but necessary under the circumstances. Gideon prefers his bones ancient, dry, and dusty, but the body he must examine had lain in the tropical sun for a week before it was found and then buried native\\\\style shallow, with no casket so it is not exactly his . . . well, cup of tea. But it is not the state of the remains that bothers him the most, it is the deeper human ugliness that his examination uncovers: subtle clues that do indeed point to foul play, to mistaken identity, and to a murderous conspiracy that may have percolated through the family for decades and brewed a taste for murder.

Once there, this data can be combined and used to develop electronic profiles of individuals and groups that are potentially far more detailed, and far more intrusive, than the files built up in the past by state police and security agencies. Reg Whitaker shows that private e-mail can be read; employers can monitor workers' every move throughout the work day; and the U.S. Treasury can track every detail of personal and business finances. He goes on to demonstrate that we are even more vulnerable as consumers. From the familiar - bar-coding, credit and debit cards, online purchases - to the seemingly sci - -''smart cards'' that encode medical and criminal records, and security scans that read DNA - The End of Privacy reveals how ordinary citizens are losing control of the information about them that is available to anyone who can pay for it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VzpGUqVeSb4C&dq=The+End+of+Privacy:+How+Total+Surveillance+is+Becoming+a+Reality+(Back+to+Basics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Elements of Taste","description":"Gray Kunz has teamed up with food writer Peter Kaminsky to put together a cookbook that looks precisely at what taste is.

He challenges the traditional convention of relying on totalitarian or democratic functions of a particular state to explain and understand relationships of authority and resistance in a number of national contexts. Gran maintains that there is no single developmental model but diverse forms of hegemony that emerged out of the political crisis following the penetration of capitalism into each nation. In making comparisons between seemingly disparate and distinctive nations and by questioning established canons of comparative inquiry, Gran encourages people to recognize the similarities between the West and non-West nations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M2cZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood in the Argonne: The \\"Lost Battalion\\" of World War I (Campaigns and Commanders)","description":"In this unique history of the  Lost Battalion  of World War I, Alan D.

Attacks ascribed to the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes who worked in the slums of London and whose throats were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from at least three of the victims led to the suspicion that their killer possessed surgical knowledge. Author Melvin Harris spent years of research examining and discarding many fake documents and falsified testimonies in his quest for the true Ripper. He had to unravel the many dubious theories which have led to wrong identifications including unfounded speculation that a member of the Royal family could have been the Ripper. He believed that the evidence, meticulously documented in this book, leads to one man who was interviewed by the police at the time of the murders and had inside information on all of them. Using FBI techniques for identifying serial killers, he built a totally convincing case against the suspect and presented a mass of unpublished evidence that will amaze those familiar with the case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J14_zQEACAAJ&dq=True+Face+of+Jack+the+Ripper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","description":"***Please note: This ebook edition does not contain the photos found in the print edition.*** A MAN IN UNIFORM He was a captain in the U.S. Air Force.

Tired of spending one too many nights apart from Marty who was often away on his flight missions, Michelle turned to the Internet to meet men and relieve her loneliness. With each encounter, Michelle became more daring in her sexual escapades. But one man stood out among all the rest: former U.S. Army Staff Sergeant John Diamond. A WOMAN IN HEAT The more time Michelle spent with Diamond, the less she wanted to be with her husband. Then on December 17, 2000, Marty was gunned down on a street outside of Michelle's office building. Suspicion first turned to Diamond, and she watched him take the fall for a murder she had masterminded. When authorities went after her, Michelle vanished. For months, federal marshals hunted desperately for Michelle, who had resorted to plastic surgery to avoid the law. In 2002, authorities finally captured her.

Why did they track the desperate tappings of an unknown number of trapped sailors without sending an international SOS? Why did they repeatedly decline international rescue offers while their own rescue equipment repeatedly failed to make any progress? To a world community still mystified by deadly Russian deceits surrounding the Kursk submarine disaster, Ramsey Flynn's book uncovers the truth once and for all.

Perry, co-author, with Oprah Winfrey, of What Happened to You? Born for Love reveals how and why the brain learns to bond with others and is a stirring call to protect our children from new threats to their capacity to love.  Empathy, and the ties that bind people into relationships, are key elements of happiness. Born for Love is truly fascinating.    Gretchen Rubin, author of The Happiness Project From birth, when babies' fingers instinctively cling to those of adults, their bodies and brains seek an intimate connection, a bond made possible by empathy the ability to love and to share the feelings of others. In this provocative book, psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry and award-winning science journalist Maia Szalavitz interweave research and stories from Perry's practice with cutting-edge scientific studies and historical examples to explain how empathy develops, why it is essential for our development into healthy adults, and how to raise kids with empathy while navigating threats from technological change and other forces in the modern world. Perry and Szalavitz show that compassion underlies the qualities that make society work trust, altruism, collaboration, love, charity and how difficulties related to empathy are key factors in social problems such as war, crime, racism, and mental illness. Even physical health, from infectious diseases to heart attacks, is deeply affected by our human connections to one another. As Born for Love reveals, recent changes in technology, child-rearing practices, education, and lifestyles are starting to rob children of necessary human contact and deep relationships the essential foundation for empathy and a caring, healthy society. Sounding an important warning bell, Born for Love offers practical ideas for combating the negative influences of modern life and fostering positive social change to benefit us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pltsIbjQqywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","description":"To help us understand what happened during the Ice Age, Peter Ward takes us on a tour of other mass extinctions through earth's history.

For writers such as John Hector St. John de Cr vec?ur and Claude-Fran?ois de Lezay-Marn sia, America was never more potent as a driving ideal than in its loss. Examining the paradoxical American paradise depicted in Cr vec?ur s Lettres d un cultivateur am ricain (1784); the  uchronotopia  the imaginary perfect society set in America and based on what France might have become without the Revolution of Lezay-Marn sia s Lettres  crites des rives de l Ohio (1792); and the political and nationalistic motivations behind Fran?ois-Ren  Chateaubriand s idealization of America in Voyage en Am rique (1827) and M moires d outre-tombe (1850), Hoffmann shows how the authors  liberties with the truth helped create the idealized and nostalgic representation of America that dominated the collective European consciousness of their times. From a historical perspective, Posthumous America works to determine when exactly these writers stopped transcribing what they actually observed in America and started giving imaginary accounts of their experiences. A vital contribution to transatlantic studies, this detailed exploration of French perspectives on the colonial era, the War of Independence, and the birth of the American Republic sheds new light on the French fascination with America. Posthumous America will be invaluable for historians, political scientists, and specialists of literature whose scholarship looks at America through European eyes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E-VaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Elk in Paris: A Novel","description":"Madou, a strong-willed young woman in a family who is fed up with the arrogance of French culture and the constraints it puts on women, is strangely drawn to Black Elk, a Native American Indian with whom she eventually falls in love, but when Madou and Phillipe, a likeable physician, try to help him, it is Black Elk who ends up transforming the lives of those around him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6MplAAAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Elk+in+Paris:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamental techniques of plastic surgery and their surgical applications","description":"This text provides a straightforward account of the principles and practice of the basic techniques of plastic and reconstructive surgery, including the management, repair and reconstruction of defects and wounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q2NsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fundamental+techniques+of+plastic+surgery+and+their+surgical+applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Camp Conviction (Serena Wilcox Mysteries)","description":"In this third installment starring the \\"pizza loving detective\\", Serena Wilcox sends her sleuthing partner Karyn to camp, tracks down a stalker on the Internet, and searches for clues in a place that will make claustrophobics cringe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8iWz8Ty5wTcC&dq=Camp+Conviction+(Serena+Wilcox+Mysteries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged","description":"Contains over 472,000 entries defining the English language as it is written and spoken today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CXR-tTsHo58C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirit of the Web: The Age of Information from Telegraph to Internet","description":"Newly revised and updated, this new paperback edition of Spirit of the Web is an absorbing, dramatic, and comprehensive history of the development of communications technologies over the past 150 years.

He is not meant to worry about speaking truth; he must create human characteristics amidst the chaos.\\"--Marcel Schwob Imaginary Livesremains, over 120 years since its original publication in French, one of the secret keys to modern literature: under-recognized, yet a decisive influence on such writers as Apollinaire, Borges, Jarry and Artaud, and more contemporary authors such as Roberto Bola?o and Jean Echenoz. Drawing from historical influences such as Plutarch and Diogenes La?rtius, and authors more contemporary to him such as Thomas De Quincey and Walter Pater, Schwob established the genre of fictional biography with this collection: a form of narrative that championed the specificity of the individual over the generality of history, and the memorable detail of a vice over the forgettable banality of a virtue. These 22 portraits present figures drawn from the margins of history, from Empedocles the \\"Supposed God\\" and Clodia the \\"Licentious Matron\\" to the pirate Captain Kidd and the Scottish murderers Messrs. Burke and Hare. In his quest for unique lives, Schwob also formulated an early conception of the anti-hero, and discarded historical figures in favor of their shadows. These \\"imaginary lives\\" thus acquaint us with the \\"Hateful Poet\\" Cecco Angiolieri instead of his lifelong rival, Dante Alighieri; the would-be romantic pirate Major Stede Bonnet instead of the infamous Blackbeard who would lead him to the gallows; the false confessor Nicolas Loyseleur rather than Joan of Arc whom he cruelly deceived; or the actor Gabriel Spenser in place of the better-remembered Ben Jonson who ran a sword through his lung. Marcel Schwob(1867-1905) was a scholar of startling breadth and an incomparable storyteller. The secret influence on generations of writers, Schwob was as versed in the street slang of medieval thieves as he was in the poetry of Walt Whitman (whom he translated into French).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UwQoswEACAAJ&dq=Imaginary+lives,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Vine Bible Study Leader's Edition","description":"Break Through to Abundance with inspiring Bible teacher Bruce Wilkinson, author of the top two New York Times bestsellers The Prayer of Jabez and Secrets of the Vine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-QZwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Secrets+of+the+Vine+Bible+Study+Leader%27s+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Summer (Poetry Ser.)","description":"With a lightning-fast pace, unforgettable characters, and gut-wrenching action, Iris Johansen's Dark Summer is compelling terrain for this master storyteller.

Indeed, Christians have sometimes tended to lose sight of its symbolism of its symbolical significance and to regard it as no more than the sign of a historical event.

Newtonian telescopes and astronomical refractors  for many years the only choice for amateurs  invert the observed image. The standard Hatfield Atlas therefore follows the IAU (International Astronomical Union) convention of having maps (and photographs) with South at the top and West on the left: an inverted image. However, the current ranges of Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov telescopes  that s most of those manufactured by Meade, Celestron, and many others  don t invert the observed image but instead reverse it left-for-right. That s with North at the top and East on the left. Because of the way the human visual system works, it is almost impossible to mentally  mirror-image  a map to compare it with the view through the eyepiece , so even turning an IAU-standard atlas upside-down doesn t help! This new SCT version of the Atlas solves this problem for observers. Identification of lunar features is made quick and easy. The new, digitally re-mastered second edition vastly improves the clarity and definition of the original photographs  significantly beyond the resolution limits of the photographic grains present in earlier atlas versions  whilst preserving the layout and style of the original publications. This has been achieved by merging computer-visualized Earth-based views of the lunar surface, derived from NASA s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data, with scanned copies of Commander Hatfield s photographic plates, using the author s own software. The result is a The Hatfield SCT Lunar Atlas for 21st century amateur telescopes up to and beyond 12-inch aperture. It contains all the features that made the original so widely used: a combination of an index of all International Astronomical Union named primary lunar features, and twelve chart areas help to locate any named lunar features of interest that can each be examined under typically five different states of illumination. Close ups of interesting features are also included. The new Atlas is supplemented by an introduction to its use, a short description of the digital re-mastering technique, and a completely new section describing lunar observing techniques. At the end of the atlas there is an index of all named features and crater diameters, along with a summary table of the dates and times that the original Hatfield images represent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iMI4nwEACAAJ&dq=The+Hatfield+Photographic+Lunar+Atlas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Choice of Catastrophes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lpaAAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Choice+of+Catastrophes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unmasking Of Robert-Houdin","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YnU81ZV6uhQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wuthering Heights","description":"Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff?s dwelling. ?Wuthering? being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date ?1500,? and the name ?Hareton Earnshaw.? I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here ?the house? pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.

Looking at both art and religion as closely related, but not identical, behaviors a more coherent definition of religion can be formed that avoids pitfalls such as the Eurocentric characterization of religion as belief or the dismissal of the category as nothing more than false belief or the product of scholarly invention. The book integrates highly relevant insights from the ethology and anthropology of art, particularly the identification of \\"the special\\" by Ellen Dissanayake and art as agency by Alfred Gell, with insights from, among others, Ann Taves, who similarly identified \\"specialness\\" as characteristic of religion. It integrates these insights into a useful and accurate understanding and explanation of the relationship of art and religion and of religion as a human behavior. This in turn is used to suggest how art can contribute to the development and maintenance of religions. The innovative combination of art, science, and religion in this book makes it a vital resource for scholars of Religion and the Arts, Aesthetics, Religious Studies, Religion and Science and Religious Anthropology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=je7QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Megilloth and Jonah-PR-Hebrew/English","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cXrpAAAAMAAJ&dq=Five+Megilloth+and+Jonah-PR-Hebrew/English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Light of My Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Weather Wizard's 5-Year Weather Diary","description":"A handy, fact-filled way to track the weather year by year.

Schiavelli grew up in Brooklyn, speaking both Sicilian and English at home. Some of his earliest memories are of sitting at the kitchen table while his grandparents told stories of the life and the people they had left behind in Polizzi Generosa, a small city in the Madonie Mountains of Sicily. As Schiavelli grew older, those stories, and the city about which they were told, took on a mythic quality. When he was nearly forty he made his first trip there, and what he found was more extraordinary than the \\"once upon a time\\" fables of his childhood. In Many Beautiful Things, Schiavelli invites readers to join him in discovering the people, culture, and food of the city that has, in essence, become his second home. Equal parts memoir and cookbook, it is the best of both. Schiavelli is an accomplished and elegant writer who evokes a foreign and often closed culture from a unique perspective: an outsider fluent in the language with still-strong familial ties. The recipes -- which reflect the ancient influences of Greece, North Africa, and Spain -- are simple, rustic, and delicious, depending on local products and seasonal bounty. This is not your usual Southern Italian fare but a unique regional cuisine: Pumpkin Caponata, Ditali with Drowned Lettuce, Fried Ricotta Omelet, Potato Gratin with Bay Leaves, Almond Love Bites, Veal Shoulder Roasted with Marsala, and Baked Pasta with Almonds (rigatoni baked in a pork ragu with chopped toasted almonds) are just a few of the extraordinary dishes you'll find in this book, all of which can be reproduced by cooks with delectable results. Schiavelli provides a comprehensive list of mail-order sources. And if you want to visit Polizzi Generosa, there's a guide on how to get there, where to stay, and where to eat. Illustrated with black-and-white line drawings by Polizzi's best known artist, Santo Lipani (who also happens to be an extraordinary cook), Many Beautiful Things is a feast, both culinary and literary.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3m5f8i5B-0QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"African Myths and Legends (Oxford Myths and Legends)","description":"A collection of 34 tales taken from the folklore of different African peoples.

More than a thousand volunteers set out to fight for the cause. The Philhellenes, whether they set out to recreate the Athens of Pericles, start a new crusade, or make money out of a war, all felt that Greece had unique claim on the sympathy of the world. As Byron wrote, 'I dreamed that Greece might Still be Free'; and he died at Missolonghi trying to translate that dream into reality. William St Clair's meticulously researched and highly readable account of their aspirations and experiences was hailed as definitive when it was first published. Long out of print, it remains the standard account of the Philhellenic movement and essential reading for any students of the Greek War of Independence, Byron, and European Romanticism. Its relevance to more modern ethnic and religious conflicts is becoming increasingly appreciated by scholars worldwide.

The Rifle is an inspirational story and hero s journey of a 28-year-old U.S. Marine, Andrew Biggio, who returned home from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, full of questions about the price of war. He found answers from those who survived the costliest war of all -- WWII veterans. It began when Biggio bought a 1945 M1 Garand Rifle, the most common rifle used in WWII, to honor his great uncle, a U.S. Army soldier who died on the hills of the Italian countryside. When Biggio showed the gun to his neighbor, WWII veteran Corporal Joseph Drago, it unlocked memories Drago had kept unspoken for 50 years. On the spur of the moment, Biggio asked Drago to sign the rifle. Thus began this Marine s mission to find as many WWII veterans as he could, get their signatures on the rifle, and document their stories. For two years, Biggio traveled across the country to interview America s last-living WWII veterans. Each time he put the M1 Garand Rifle in their hands, their eyes lit up with memories triggered by holding the weapon that had been with them every step of the war. With each visit and every story told to Biggio, the veterans signed their names to the rifle. 96 signatures now cover that rifle, each a reminder of the price of war and the courage of our soldiers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0bsyEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Rifle+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (27 Volume CDrom Set)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gHlmpHNWRjUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Sisters","description":"\\"First published in Great Britain by Penguin Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House UK\\"--Verso.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HQtFDwAAQBAJ&dq=Blood+Sisters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ on Trial: 2000 Years Later","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_NA1AAAACAAJ&dq=Christ+on+Trial:+2000+Years+Later&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":".NET Web Services Solutions","description":".NET Web Services Solutions offers just what its title states: practical solutions to the real challenges you face as you use .NET to create applications that communicate with web services and--more to the point--to build and deploy web services of your own.

It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students, teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a familiar and authentic kana script. Combining Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features: ? A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words ? Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese ? Semantic and usage differences between Japanese words and expressions are explained in clear English ? Thousands of example sentences and phrases illustrate how Japanese words are used in context ?

Historians have generally supposed that the main outlines of the Puritan church were determined in England and Holland and transplanted to the new world. The author convincingly suggests, instead, that the distinguishing characteristic of the New England churches the ideal of a church composed exclusively of true and tested saints developed fully only in the 1630's and 1640's, some time after the first settlers arrived in New England. He also examines the influence of the Separatist colony at Plymouth on the later settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and follows the difficulties created by a definition of the religious community so selective that the New England churches nearly expired for lack of saints to fill them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xh2780VqWbMC&dq=Visible+Saints:+The+History+of+a+Puritan+Idea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stranger to the Ground","description":"Richard Bach s first book, Stranger to the Ground is above all else an insight into the character of a man whose great compulsion is to measure himself against storm and night and fear.

The Secret History of The World and How To Get Out Alive is the definitive book of the real answers where Truth is more fantastic than fiction. Laura Knight-Jadczyk, wife of internationally known theoretical physicist, Arkadiusz Jadczyk, an expert in hyperdimensional physics, draws on science and mysticism to pierce the veil of reality. With sparkling humour and wisdom, she picks up where Fulcanelli left off, sharing over thirty years of research to reveal, for the first time, The Great Work and the esoteric Science of the Ancients in terms accessible to scholar and layperson alike. Conspiracies have existed since the time of Cain and Abel. Facts of history have been altered to support the illusion. The question today is whether a sufficient number of people will see through the deceptions, thus creating a counter-force for positive change - the gold of humanity - during the upcoming times of Macro-Cosmic Quantum Shift. Laura argues convincingly, based on the revelations of the deepest of esoteric secrets, that the present is a time of potential transition, an extraordinary opportunity for individual and collective renewal: a quantum shift of awareness and perception which could see the birth of true creativity in the fields of science, art and spirituality. The Secret History of the World allows us to redefine our interpretation of the universe, history, and culture and to thereby navigate a path through this darkness. In this way, Laura Knight-Jadczyk shows us how we may extend the possibilities for all our different futures in literal terms. With over 800 pages of fascinating reading, The Secret History of The World and How to Get Out Alive is rapidly being acknowledged as a classic with profound implications for the destiny of the human race. With painstakingly researched facts and figures, the author overturns long-held conventional ideas on religion, philosophy, Grail legends, science, and alchemy, presenting a cohesive narrative pointing to the existence of an ancient techno-spirituality of the Golden Age which included a mastery of space and time: the Holy Grail, the Philosopher's Stone, the True Process of Ascension. Laura provides the evidence for the advanced level of scientific and metaphysical wisdom possessed by the greatest of lost ancient civilizations - a culture so advanced that none of the trappings of civilization as we know it were needed, explaining why there is no 'evidence' of civilization as we know it left to testify to its existence. The author's consummate synthesis reveals the Message in a Bottle reserved for humanity, including the Cosmology and Mysticism of mankind Before the Fall when, as the ancient texts tell us, man walked and talked with the gods. Laura shows us that the upcoming shift is that point in the vast cosmological cycle when mankind - or at least a portion of mankind - has the opportunity to regain his standing as The Child of the King in the Golden Age. If ever there was a book that can answer the questions of those who are seeking Truth in the spiritual wilderness of this world, then surely The Secret History of the World and How to Get Out Alive is it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X3I_7Srgs1oC&dq=The+Secret+History+of+the+World+and+How+to+Get+Out+Alive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Unsolved Mysteries of American History","description":"A second collection of cultural puzzles by the author of Unsolved Mysteries of American History analyzes thirty historical riddles including those about the conspiracy to assassinate Abraham Lincoln and the murder trial of O.

Dreaming of Diana explores the way in which Diana moved ordinary people who had never met her, many of whom were ambivalent towards her, some who loved her, and others who disliked her. In this collection of dreams, ordinary people find parallels in their own lives with that of a woman who led a life most of us cannot begin to imagine. This book may be about Diana, but is more about us. There are no psychologists to interpret the dreams, no media pundits, political analysts or royal watchers imparting their wisdom.

For the seventy thousand readers who have been captivated by Raphael s eye-opening accounts, history has never been the same. In this revised tenth-anniversary edition, Raphael revisits the original myths and explores their further evolution over the past decade, uncovering new stories and peeling back additional layers of misinformation.

They either address the wrong problems, or they keep beating on the same solutions, wondering why things don't improve. This is when you need an objective way to look at the problems. This is the time to get some data.\\" Watts S. Humphrey, from the Foreword This book, drawing on work done at the Software Engineering Institute and other organizations, shows how to use measurements to manage and improve software processes. The authors explain specifically how quality characteristics of software products and processes can be quantified, plotted, and analyzed so the performance of software development activities can be predicted, controlled, and guided to achieve both business and technical goals. The measurement methods presented, based on the principles of statistical quality control, are illuminated by application examples taken from industry. Although many of the methods discussed are applicable to individual projects, the book's primary focus is on the steps software development organizations can take toward broad-reaching, long-term success. The book particularly addresses the needs of software managers and practitioners who have already set up some kind of basic measurement process and are ready to take the next step by collecting and analyzing software data as a basis for making process decisions and predicting process performance. Highlights of the book include: Insight into developing a clear framework for measuring process behavior Discussions of process performance, stability, compliance, capability, and improvement Explanations of what you want to measure (and why) and instructions on how to collect your data Step-by-step guidance on how to get started using statistical process control If you have responsibilities for product quality or process performance and you are ready to use measurements to manage, control, and predict your software processes, this book will be an invaluable resource.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q7b81omMbiEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cenci (The Library of liberal arts, 170)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fTAhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Girl with a Monkey: New and Selected Stories","description":"Fiction.A Lost Angeles Times Best Fiction Title of 2000.

The first book to reveal the depths of black men s buried mental and emotional pain, Standing in the Shadows weaves the author s story of his twenty-five-year struggle with depression with a cultural analysis of how the illness is perceived in the black community and why nobody wants to talk about it. In mainstream society depression and mental illness are still somewhat taboo subjects; in the black community they are topics that are almost completely shrouded in secrecy. As a result, millions of black men are suffering in silence or getting treatment only in the most extreme circumstances in emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and prisons. The neglect of emotional disorders among men in the black community is nothing less than racial suicide. John Head s explosive work, Standing in the Shadows, addresses what can be done to help those who need it most.In this groundbreaking book, veteran journalist and award-winning author John Head argues that the problem can be traced back to slavery, when it was believed that blacks were unable to feel inner pain because they had no psyche. This myth has damaged generations of African American men and their families and has created a society that blames black men for being violent and aggressive without considering that depression might be a root cause. The author also explores the roles of the black church, the black family, and the changing nature of black women in American culture as a way to understand how the black community may have unwittingly helped push the emotional disorders of African American men further underground. As daring and powerful as Nathan McCall s Makes Me Wanna Holler, Standing in the Shadows challenges both the African American community and the psychiatric community to end the silent suffering of black men by taking responsibility for a problem that s been ignored for far too long. Additionally, Standing in the Shadows gives women an understanding of depression that enables them to help black men mend their relationships, their families, and themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DaEUDfmf8wUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary's the Ged Math Problem Solver: Reasoning Skills to Pass the Test","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w0SutQEACAAJ&dq=Contemporary%27s+the+Ged+Math+Problem+Solver:+Reasoning+Skills+to+Pass+the+Test&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spider(#47) : Slaves of the Black Monarch","description":"Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"School Newspaper Adviser's Survival Guide (J-B Ed: Survival Guides)","description":"Patricia Osborn earned a B.A. in journalism and her teaching credentials from Bowling Green State University in Ohio.

While existing anthologies of Romantic drama have focused almost exclusively on  closet dramas  rarely performed on stage, The Broadview Anthology of Romantic Drama instead provides a broad sampling of works representative of the full range of the drama of the period. It includes the dramatic work of canonical Romantic poets (Samuel Coleridge s Remorse, Percy Shelley s The Cenci, and Lord Byron s Sardanapalus) and important plays by women dramatists (Hannah Cowley s A Bold Stroke for a Husband, Elizabeth Inchbald s Every One Has His Fault, and Joanna Baillie s Orra). It also provides a selection of popular theatrical genres from melodrama and pantomime to hippodrama and parody most popular in the period, featuring plays by George Colman the Younger, Thomas John Dibdin, and Matthew Gregory Lewis. In short, this is the most wide-ranging and comprehensive anthology of Romantic drama ever published. The introduction by the editors provides an informative overview of the drama and stage practices of the Romantic Period. The anthology also provides copious supplementary materials, including an Appendix of reviews and contemporary essays on the theater, a Glossary of Actors and Actresses, and a guide to further reading.

The most influential and popular may be Neal Adams, who in the late 1960s put the Dark Knight back in the shadows and updatedhis image for a new generation of fans. Now, for the first time, all of Neal Adams's Batman work, covers and stories, will be chronologically collected. This second volume, featuring Adams's contributions from 1967-1969, shows the process ofintroduction, adaptation, and innovation that the young artist brought to this legendary crime fighter.

(Brandingusa)","description":"Should business strive to be socially responsible, and if so, how? The Debate over Corporate Social Responsibility updates and broadens the discussion of these questions by bringing together in one volume a variety of practical and theoretical perspectives on corporate social responsibility. It is perhaps the single most comprehensive volume available on the question of just how \\"social\\" business ought to be. The volume includes contributions from the fields of communication, business, law, sociology, political science, economics, accounting, and environmental studies. Moreover, it draws from experiences and examples from around the world, including but not limited to recent corporate scandals and controversies in the U.S. and Europe. A number of the chapters examine closely the basic assumptions underlying the philosophy of socially responsible business. Other chapters speak to the practical challenges and possibilities for corporate social responsiblilty in the twenty-first century. One of the most distinctive features of the book is its coverage of the very ways that the issue of corporate social responsibility has been defined, shaped, and discussed in the past four decades. That is, the editors and many of the authors are attuned to the persuasive strategies and formulations used to talk about socially responsible business, and demonstrate why the talk matters. For example, the book offers a careful analysis of how certain values have become associated with the business enterprise and how particular economic and political positions have been established by and for business. This book will be of great interest to scholars, business leaders, graduate students, and others interested in the contours of the debate over what role large-scale corporate commerce should take in the future of the industrialized world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xIE3AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NMS Review for USMLE: United States Medical Licensing Examination, Step 2 (2nd Edition)","description":"The thoroughly updated Third Edition of this popular and widely used review book offers excellent preparation for the CK (clinical knowledge) component of the USMLE Step 2.

O M. B. ) in a course on electrochemistry to students of energy conversion at the University of Pennsyl- nia. It was there that he met a number of people trained in chemistry, physics, biology, metallurgy, and materials science, all of whom wanted to know something about electrochemistry. The concept of writing a book about electrochemistry which could be understood by people with very varied backgrounds was thereby engendered. The lectures were recorded and written up by Dr. Klaus Muller as a 293-page manuscript. At a later stage, A. K. N. R. joined the effort; it was decided to make a fresh start and to write a much more comprehensive text. Of methods for direct energy conversion, the electrochemical one is the most advanced and seems the most likely to become of considerable practical importance. Thus, conversion to electrochemically powered transportation systems appears to be an important step by means of which the difficulties of air pollution and the effects of an increasing concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide may be met. Cor- sion is recognized as having an electrochemical basis. The synthesis of nylon now contains an important electrochemical stage. Some central biological mechanisms have been shown to take place by means of electrochemical reactions. A number of American organizations have recently recommended greatly increased activity in training and research in electrochemistry at universities in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=et72BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Conquest of Texas: Ethnic Cleansing in the Promised Land, 1820-1875","description":"This is not your grandfather s history of Texas. Portraying nineteenth-century Texas as a cauldron of racist violence, Gary Clayton Anderson shows that the ethnic warfare dominating the Texas frontier can best be described as ethnic cleansing. The Conquest of Texas is the story of the struggle between Anglos and Indians for land. Anderson tells how Scotch-Irish settlers clashed with farming tribes and then challenged the Comanches and Kiowas for their hunting grounds. Next, the decade-long conflict with Mexico merged with war against Indians. For fifty years Texas remained in a virtual state of war. Piercing the very heart of Lone Star mythology, Anderson tells how the Texas government encouraged the Texas Rangers to annihilate Indian villages, including women and children. This policy of terror succeeded: by the 1870s, Indians had been driven from central and western Texas. By confronting head-on the romanticized version of Texas history that made heroes out of Houston, Lamar, and Baylor, Anderson helps us understand that the history of the Lone Star state is darker and more complex than the mythmakers allowed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PAuIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On escalation: metaphors and scenarios","description":"In this widely discussed and influential book, Herman Kahn probes the dynamics of escalation and demonstrates how the intensification of conflict can be depicted by means of a definite escalation ladder, ascent of which brings opponents closer to all-out war. At each rung of the ladder, before the climb proceeds, decisions must be made based on numerous choices. Some are clear and obvious, others obscure, but the options are always there. Thermonuclear annihilation, says Kahn, is unlikely to come through accident; but nations may elect to climb the ladder to extinction. The basic material for the book was developed in briefings delivered by Kahn to military and civilian experts and revised in the light of his findings of a trip to Vietnam in the 1960s. In On Escalation he states the facts squarely. He asks the reader to face unemotionally the terrors of a world fully capable of suicide and to consider carefully the alternatives to such a path. In the never-never land of nuclear warfare, where nuclear incredulity is pervasive and paralyzing to the imagination even for the professional analyst, salient details of possible scenarios for the outbreak of war, and even more for war fighting, are largely unexplored or even unnoticed. For scenarios in which war is terminated, the issues and possibilities of which are almost completely unstudied, the situation is even worse. Kahn's discussion throws light on the terrain and gives the individual a sense of the range of possibilities and complexities involved and are useful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oku1mwEACAAJ&dq=On+escalation:+metaphors+and+scenarios&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sanctuary (Star Trek, Book 61)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWApwgEACAAJ&dq=Sanctuary+(Star+Trek,+Book+61)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period","description":"Focusing on the actions and attitudes of the courts, legislatures, and public servants in six colonies, Judge Higginbotham shows ways in which the law has contributed to injustices suffered by Black Americans","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AVxfQAAACAAJ&dq=In+the+Matter+of+Color:+Race+and+the+American+Legal+Process:+The+Colonial+Period&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Lucy To Language: Revised, Updated, and Expanded","description":"Explores what physical artifacts can tell the modern world about key questions pertaining to humanity, language, and race, including such recent discoveries as the Homo floresiensis and Mary Leakey's Kenyanthropus platyops.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cThaAAAAYAAJ&dq=From+Lucy+To+Language:+Revised,+Updated,+and+Expanded&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rails across the Mississippi: A HISTORY OF THE ST.

Whereas Save the Children claimed that it was \\"saving children to save the world,\\" the vision of the world it sought to save was a strictly delimited one, characterized by international capitalism and colonial rule. Emily Baughan's groundbreaking analysis, across fifty years and eighteen countries, shows that Britain's desire to create an international order favorable to its imperial rule shaped international humanitarianism. In revealing that modern humanitarianism and its conception of childhood are products of the early twentieth-century imperial economy, Saving the Children argues that the contemporary aid sector must reckon with its past if it is to forge a new future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ls1DEAAAQBAJ&dq=To+Save+This+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lawless (THE KENT CHRONICLES, 7)","description":"The Kent family faces internal clashes as the Civil War ignites from the #1 New York Timesbestselling author of North and South.

An effort has been made to present a comprehensive summation of the many design and damage control problems which were disclosed or emphasized by the war experiences of Franklin. In addition, various pertinent war experiences of other large carriers have been considered in this report. 1-2The damage sustained by Franklin as a result of the actions of 13 and 15 October 1944 was superficial and is included in this report only for the purpose of rendering her damage history complete. The major damage sustained in each of the actions of 30 October 1944 and 19 March 1945 demonstrates the effectiveness of bomb hits when received by aircraft carriers during the extremely vulnerable period just prior to and during periods of launching strikes. The damage sustained on 30 October is a reasonably good example of what may be expected from a suicide plane crash and subsequent fire on a carrier having a full complement of planes on board which are gassed but not armed except for small caliber ammunition. Similarly, the damage sustained on 19 March may be considered as about the maximum to be expected from fires and detonations of large numbers of bombs and rockets on the flight and hangar decks when a carrier having heavily armed, fully fueled planes aboard is hit by one or more bombs properly placed. 1-3The latter two cases of damage to Franklin illustrate thoroughly the ability of modern U.S. aircraft carriers to survive extensive damage from plane crashes, fire and heavy bombs. The basic design and construction of this class of carrier, which was developed prior to World War II and therefore without the benefit of war experience, is favorably reflected in the manner in which Franklin absorbed heavy damage. Materiel alterations and improvements in damage control organization and technique during the war further increased the ability of this class carrier to minimize potentially severe damage. At the same time many lessons have been obtained from the experiences of Franklin and other cases of war damage and results of this knowledge have been and will be incorporated in existing ships where feasible and in future design and construction. 1-4This report is based on the references, inspections of Franklin upon her return to this country, and informal interviews with various officers attached to Franklin by representatives of this Bureau.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QIUonwEACAAJ&dq=Brink+of+War+(Carrier+Naval+Aviation+Series,+13)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estonian grammar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GR4HAQAAIAAJ&dq=Estonian+grammar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Like a Rockstar: Even When You're Poor as Dirt","description":"After being laid off from his job as a computer programmer, freelance writer Camper English had to learn to make do on a salary that was somewhat smaller.

Goodreads Choice Awards Winner ? A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: Smithsonian, Science Friday, The Times (London), Popular Mechanics, Science News \\"This is scientific storytelling at its most visceral, striding with the beasts through their Triassic dawn, Jurassic dominance, and abrupt demise in the Cretaceous.\\"  Nature The dinosaurs. Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet s great mysteries. Now The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before. In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a book for the ages. Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, T. rex, Triceratops, Brontosaurus, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs  peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a  sixth extinction.  Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research which he calls  a new golden age of discovery  and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China. An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs  epic saga, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come. Includes 75 images, world maps of the prehistoric earth, and a dinosaur family tree.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aOMtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little boys","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"An empire in denial: the limits of US imperialism.(United States): An article from: Harvard International Review","description":"In light of the United States' \\"age of terrorism\\" and the controversial involvement in the war in Iraq, U.S. policies toward diplomatic peace education are coming under increasing scrutiny.

This gathering of eight essays by top scholars probes Morrison's novels and her growing body of nonfiction and critical work for the complex and potent aesthetic elements that have made her a major American novelist of the twentieth century. Through traditional aesthetic concepts such as the sublime, the beautiful, and the grotesque, through issues of form, narrative, and language, and through questions of affect and reader response, the nine essays in this volume bring into relief the dynamic and often overlooked range within Morrison's writing. Employing aesthetic ideas that range from the ancient Greeks to contemporary research in the black English oral tradition, The Aesthetics of Toni Morrison shows the potency of these ideas for interpreting Morrison's writing. This is a force Morrison herself has often suggested in her claims that Greek tragedy bears a striking similarity to \\"Afro-American communal structures.\\" At the same time each essay attends to the ways in which Morrison also challenges traditional aesthetic concepts, establishing the African American and female voices that are essential to her sensibility. The result is a series of readings that simultaneously expands our understanding of Morrison's work and also provokes new thinking about an aesthetic tradition that is nearly 2,500 years old. These essays offer a rich complement to the dominant approaches in Morrison scholarship by revealing aspects of her work that purely ideological approaches have obscured or about which they have remained oddly silent. Each essay focuses particularly on the relations between the aesthetic and the ethical in Morrison's writing and between the artistic production and its role in the world at large. These relations show the rich political implications that aesthetic analysis engenders. By treating both Morrison's fiction and her nonfiction, the essays reveal a mind and imagination that have long been intimately engaged with the questions and traditions of the aesthetic domain. The result is a provocative and original contribution to Morrison scholarship, and to scholarship in American letters generally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dkNwItcrbI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Weirdos (Factoid Books)","description":"Provides comic strip profiles of such original individuals as Ivan the Terrible, Adolf Hitler, Thomas Edison, and flagpole-sitter Shipwreck Kelly","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6WdQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Big+Book+of+Weirdos+(Factoid+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Parents, New Babies: The Best Websites","description":"A guide to the best websites dedicated to helping new parents.

And, until very recently, there was no good context for writing a serious history of tattooing in the West. This collection exposes, for the first time, the richness of the tattoo's European and American history from antiquity to the present day. In the process, it rescues tattoos from their stereotypical and sensationalized association with criminality. The tattoo has long hovered in a space between the cosmetic and the punitive. Throughout its history, the status of the tattoo has been complicated by its dual association with slavery and penal practices on the one hand and exotic or forbidden sexuality on the other. The tattoo appears often as an involuntary stigma, sometimes as a self-imposed marker of identity, and occasionally as a beautiful corporal decoration. This volume analyzes the tattoo's fluctuating, often uncomfortable position from multiple angles. Individual chapters explore fascinating segments of its history--from the metaphorical meanings of tattooing in Celtic society to the class-related commodification of the body in Victorian Britain, from tattooed entertainers in Germany to tattooing and piercing as self-expression in the contemporary United States. But they also accumulate to form an expansive, textured view of permanent bodily modification in the West. By combining empirical history, powerful cultural analysis, and a highly readable style, this volume both draws on and propels the ongoing effort to write a meaningful cultural history of the body. The contributors, representing several disciplines, have all conducted extensive original research into the Western tattoo. Together, they have produced an unrivalled account of its history. They are, in addition to the editor, Clare Anderson, Susan Benson, James Bradley, Ian Duffield, Juliet Fleming, Alan Govenar, Harriet Guest, Mark Gustafson, C. P. Jones, Charles MacQuarrie, Hamish Maxwell-Stewart, Stephan Oettermann, Jennipher A.

A controversial but widely acclaimed technique that could revolutionise any golfer's game. In athletics developments in technique have improved performances dramatically, yet before Mindy Blake no instructor had looked at golf from the point of view of athletics. Mindy Blake believed that \\"golf is purely a matter of technique\\" and was the first golf instructor to look at improving a golfer's technique by studying what they could learn from other sports (as well as understanding the science behind such sporting techniques). Looking at developments in events such as shot putting and pole vaulting Mindy Blake began to challenge conventional ideas of golfing technique. The result was controversial but it has revolutionised the game of all who have tried it. In athletics legs are the source of the athlete's power but it is their body which channels that power, Mindy Blake has created a technique that is based on athletic principles and which will dramatically improve the swing of a golfer of any standard. The line drawings make this book the ideal guide for anyone who wants to know how to improve their swing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ayuGDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cyber Adversary Characterization: Auditing the Hacker Mind","description":"The wonders and advantages of modern age electronics and the World Wide Web have also, unfortunately, ushered in a new age of terrorism.

The name evokes grandeur and exoticism gold, cunning, and complexity. In this unique book, Judith Herrin unveils the riches of a quite different civilization. Avoiding a standard chronological account of the Byzantine Empire's millennium long history, she identifies the fundamental questions about Byzantium what it was, and what special significance it holds for us today. Bringing the latest scholarship to a general audience in accessible prose, Herrin focuses each short chapter around a representative theme, event, monument, or historical figure, and examines it within the full sweep of Byzantine history from the foundation of Constantinople, the magnificent capital city built by Constantine the Great, to its capture by the Ottoman Turks. She argues that Byzantium's crucial role as the eastern defender of Christendom against Muslim expansion during the early Middle Ages made Europe and the modern Western world possible. Herrin captivates us with her discussions of all facets of Byzantine culture and society. She walks us through the complex ceremonies of the imperial court. She describes the transcendent beauty and power of the church of Hagia Sophia, as well as chariot races, monastic spirituality, diplomacy, and literature. She reveals the fascinating worlds of military usurpers and ascetics, eunuchs and courtesans, and artisans who fashioned the silks, icons, ivories, and mosaics so readily associated with Byzantine art. An innovative history written by one of our foremost scholars, Byzantium reveals this great civilization's rise to military and cultural supremacy, its spectacular destruction by the Fourth Crusade, and its revival and final conquest in 1453.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n2aYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Byzantium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anglo-Norman Nobility in the Reign of Henry I: The Second Generation (Middle Ages Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uk1nAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Anglo-Norman+Nobility+in+the+Reign+of+Henry+I:+The+Second+Generation+(Middle+Ages+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","description":"Sensible artistic advice and lively personal anecdotes in rare important work by famed Surrealist.

With more than one million financial services practitioners in the United States and Canada, competition for clients can be intense. While some professionals believe that working furiously around the clock at the expense of a personal life is the route to success, top-producing industry veterans Ron Carson and Steve Sanduski disagree. They believe that financial services is a commodity business, and as such, that performing better, delivering better financial plans, or having access to certain products doesn t differentiate advisors effectively. Rather, differentiating through service, brand and relationship is the only sustainable way advisors can compete. In Tested in the Trenches: A 9-Step Plan for Building and Sustaining a Million-Dollar Financial Services Practice the authors explain how securities representatives, insurance professionals, investment advisors and CPAs can do just that . . . and create great lives along the way. Based on concepts taught in professional coaching workshops worldwide, Tested in the Trenches outlines: The four \\"\\"foundation\\"\\" steps to success. Four ways to generate revenue. 15 habits of top achievers. Forms and checklists to organize your financial services practice. Online sources for additional business-building ideas and tools.

Yes, we probably are, argues John Leslie in his chilling account of the dangers facing the human race as we approach the second millenium. The End of the World is a sobering assessment of the many disasters that scientists have predicted and speculated on as leading to apocalypse. In the first comprehensive survey, potential catastrophes - ranging from deadly diseases to high-energy physics experiments - are explored to help us understand the risks. One of the greatest threats facing humankind, however, is the insurmountable fact that we are a relatively young species, a risk which is at the heart of the 'Doomsday Argument'. This argument, if correct, makes the dangers we face more serious than we could have ever imagined. This more than anything makes the arrogance and ignorance of politicians, and indeed philosophers, so disturbing as they continue to ignore the manifest dangers facing future generations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DWWFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Applications (New Forum Books)","description":"How should a prize be awarded after a horse race? Should it go to the best rider, the best person, or the one who finishes first? To what extent are bystanders blameworthy when they do nothing to prevent harm? Are there any objective standards of moral responsibility with which to address such perennial questions? In this fluidly written and lively book, Daniel Robinson takes on the prodigious task of setting forth the contours of praise and blame. He does so by mounting an important and provocative new defense of a radical theory of moral realism and offering a critical appraisal of prevailing alternatives such as determinism and behaviorism and of their conceptual shortcomings. The version of moral realism that arises from Robinson's penetrating inquiry--an inquiry steeped in Aristotelian ethics but deeply informed by modern scientific knowledge of human cognition--is independent of cognition and emotion. At the same time, Robinson carefully explores how such human attributes succeed or fail in comprehending real moral properties. Through brilliant analyses of constitutional and moral luck, of biosocial and genetic versions of psychological determinism, and of relativistic-anthropological accounts of variations in moral precepts, he concludes that none of these conceptions accounts either for the nature of moral properties or the basis upon which they could be known. Ultimately, the theory that Robinson develops preserves moral properties even while acknowledging the conditions that undermine the powers of human will.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PtQkmQEACAAJ&dq=Praise+and+Blame:+Moral+Realism+and+Its+Applications+(New+Forum+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FORTRESS MALTA; AN ISLAND UNDER SIEGE 1940-1943.","description":"The extraordinary drama of Malta's WWII victory against impossible odds told through the eyes of the people who were there. In March and April 1942, more explosives were dropped on the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta - smaller than the Isle of Wight - than on the whole of Britain during the first year of the Blitz. Malta had become one of the most strategically important places in the world. From there, the Allies could attack Axis supply lines to North Africa; without it, Rommel would be able to march unchecked into Egypt, Suez and the Middle East. For the Allies this would have been catastrophic. As Churchill said, Malta had to be held 'at all costs'. FORTRESS MALTA follows the story through the eyes of those who were there: young men such as twenty-year-old fighter pilot Raoul Daddo-Langlois, anti-aircraft gunner Ken Griffiths, American Art Roscoe and submariner Tubby Crawford - who served on the most successful Allied submarine of the Second World War; cabaret dancer-turned RAF plotter Christina Ratcliffe, and her lover, the brilliant and irrepressible reconnaissance pilot, Adrian Warburton. Their stories and others provide extraordinary first-hand accounts of heroism, resilience, love, and loss, highlighting one of the most remarkable stories of World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=In85AgAAQBAJ&dq=FORTRESS+MALTA%3B+AN+ISLAND+UNDER+SIEGE+1940-1943.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yonder: Stories of Fantasy and Science Fiction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dKEwAAAAIAAJ&dq=Yonder:+Stories+of+Fantasy+and+Science+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brownies and Blondies (American Baking Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sikh Diaspora: The Search For Statehood (Global Diasporas)","description":"This book offers an overview of the Sikh diaspora, exploring the relationship between home and host states and between migrant and indigenous communities.

His formal innovation ranks with Beckett and Kafka, his outrageously cantankerous voice recalls Dostoevsky, but his gift for lacerating, lyrical, provocative prose is incomparably his own.One of Bernhard's most acclaimed novels, The Loser centers on a fictional relationship between piano virtuoso Glenn Gould and two of his fellow students who feel compelled to renounce their musical ambitions in the face of Gould's incomparable genius. One commits suicide, while the other-- the obsessive, witty, and self-mocking narrator-- has retreated into obscurity. Written as a monologue in one remarkable unbroken paragraph, The Loser is a brilliant meditation on success, failure, genius, and fame.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VprkaRVFyhAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Carvel","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zmc3AQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Field","description":" A big, bold, brilliantly crafted page-turner with HUGE ideas that challenge every last view about how the world works. This is both a primer to understand the law of attraction and the essential book of our age.    Jack Canfield, author of The Success Principles(TM) and featured teacher on The Secret(TM)  One of the most powerful and enlightening books I have ever read. A magnificent job of presenting the hard evidence for what spiritual masters have been telling us for centuries.    Wayne W. Dyer During the past few years science and medicine have been converging with common sense, confirming a widespread belief that everything especially the mind and the body is far more connected than traditional physics ever allowed. The Field establishes a new biological paradigm: it proves that our body extends electromagnetically beyond ourselves and our physical body. It is within this field that we can find a remarkable new way of looking at health, sickness, memory, will, creativity, intuition, the soul, consciousness, and spirituality. The Field helps to bridge the gap that has opened up between mind and matter, between us and the cosmos. Original, well researched, and well documented by distinguished sources, this is the mind/body book for a new millennium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uivwpQIRMwUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"David, The Story Of Ben Gurion.","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Patterns of Home","description":"Clearly written and profusely illustrated, this text brings the timeless lessons of residential design to homeowners who seek inspiration and direction.

Perhaps its rigors are too strong and its advocates are too weak. That it is still considered worth studying is testimony to its intellectual credibility, particularly its single-minded emphasis on individual liberty. Obsession with liberty and skepticism of government are as alive today as they were in the nineteenth century. This book offers a comprehensive introduction to anarchism in the United States, revealing its historical roots and relevance to today's problems. The relationship between anarchy and individualism in the nineteenth century is well known. How this affected the larger system is what the bulk of the anthology is about.Liberty was a magazine featuring some of the outstanding anarchist thinkers in America at the turn of the century. This anthology offers a selection of writings spanning the magazine's twenty-seven year life and features some of its major writers: Benjamin Tucker, Victor Yarros, Steven Byington, John Beverley Robinson, and Gertrude Kelly. The chapters are divided into four sections: political theory, economic theories and reforms, social implications, and strategies of individualist anarchism. The authors criticize censorship, state support of patriarchal marriage, and the general invasion of privacy. Though quite radical, the writers were not revolutionaries in a conventional sense; they emphasized passive resistance, rather than violent assault, as proper.The Individualist Anarchists is not merely of historical Interest, but offers a fundamental critique of government and authority - one that remains a relevant part of today's libertarian movement. It will be of Interest to political theorists, economists, sociologists, and scholars of American history; above all, to those who may not yet have appreciated the worth of an analysis made so many years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lpguDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family ancestors of Joseph Barron, 1771-1843, and Marie Josephine Gameline, 1786-1836, Cass Co., Ind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_2EOtwAACAAJ&dq=Family+ancestors+of+Joseph+Barron,+1771-1843,+and+Marie+Josephine+Gameline,+1786-1836,+Cass+Co.,+Ind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blakely's Ark","description":"David Blakely tries to survive in a world devastated by a parasitic virus, governed by martial law, and roamed by gangs of savage youths","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eXKkMQEACAAJ&dq=Blakely%27s+Ark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The language of ballet;: An informal dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i2u1AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+language+of+ballet%3B:+An+informal+dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colonial Cooking (Exploring History Through Simple Recipes)","description":"Discusses everyday life, family roles, cooking methods, most important foods, and celebrations of the colonial period in American history.

This work addresses the intersection of various types of discourse within the process of professional identity development, emphasizes that the intersection of the personal and professional in teacher identity formation is more complex than is acknowledged in typical methods classes, and accents the need for teacher educators to take steps to facilitate such integration. Specific suggestions for methods courses are presented that teacher educators can use as is or adapt to their own contexts.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"eDirectory Field Guide","description":"* Handy all-in-one reference to Novell s eDirectory for all platforms. * Network consultants and administrators will find instant solutions to common administration issues based on the author s own Novell experiences. * Industry-wide solutions are based on the latest versions of eDirectory and how they integrate with all other versions of NDS and eDirectory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ynM8kYi-AygC&dq=eDirectory+Field+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Guide Solutions Manual","description":"This manual includes chapter introductions that highlight new materials, chapter outlines, detailed comments for each chapter section, a glossary, and solutions to the problems, presented in a way that shows students how to reason their way to the answer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8ys_nQEACAAJ&dq=Study+Guide+Solutions+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analysis by Its History (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics / Readings in Mathematics)","description":"This book presents first-year calculus roughly in the order in which it was first discovered.

A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Industrial Revolution 1760-1830","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-vJDLbl5SEQC&dq=The+Industrial+Revolution+1760-1830&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Wicca","description":"An accessible resource for practitioners at any level focuses on the earth, nature, and fertility while covering everything from core beliefs and practices to basic and group rituals, festivals, holy days, and rites of passage.

Rosalynn Carter, former U.S. First Lady, and chairperson, The Carter Center Mental Health Task Force In mainstream society depression and mental illness are still somewhat taboo subjects; in the black community they are topics that are almost completely shrouded in secrecy. As a result, millions of black men are suffering in silence or getting treatment only in extreme circumstances in emergency rooms, homeless shelters, and prisons. The neglect of emotional disorders among men in the black community is nothing less than racial suicide. In this groundbreaking book, veteran journalist and award-winning author John Head argues that the problem can be traced back to the time of slavery, when it was believed that blacks were unable to feel inner pain because they had no psyche. This myth has damaged generations of African American men and their families, creating a society that blames black men for being violent and aggressive without considering that depression might be a root cause. Black Men and Depression challenges the African American community and the psychiatric community to end the suffering of black men, and address what can be done by loved ones to help those who need it most.

Author and independent network design consultant Kevin Dooley outlines \\"top-down network design\\" for building a technological infrastructure to fit your organization's requirements, a process far more effective and cost-efficient than fitting the organization to the parameters of a shrink-wrapped proprietary solution.Dooley argues that the design of a network is largely independent of the products used. Whether you use a Cisco or Juniper router, the same security issues and protocols apply. The questions he addresses in this book are need-specific: Do I use a router or a switch? Should I route between switched areas or switch between routed areas?Designing Large-Scale LANs covers everything from security, bandwidth and scalability to network reliability, which includes backup, redundancy, and points of failure. Specific technologies are analyzed in detail: network topologies, routing and switching strategies, wireless, virtual LANs, firewalls and gateways, security, Internet protocols, bandwidth, and multicast services. The book also discusses proprietary technologies that are ubiquitous, such as Cisco's IOS and Novell's IPX.This complete guide to top-down network design will help you choose the right network solutions.

The book is a study of a number of systems, their methods, their rela tions, their differences. In pursuit of this goal, a chapter explaining basic concepts of modern logic together with the truth-table techniques of definition and proof is first set out. In Chapter 2 a kind of ur-Iogic is built up and deductions are made on the basis of its axioms and rules. This axiom system, resembling a propositional system of Hilbert and Ber nays, is called P +, since it is a positive logic, i. e. , a logic devoid of nega tion. This system serves as a basis upon which a variety of further sys tems are constructed, including, among others, a full classical proposi tional calculus, an intuitionistic system, a minimum propositional calcu lus, a system equivalent to that of F. B. Fitch (Chapters 3 and 6). These are developed as axiomatic systems. By means of adding independent axioms to the basic system P +, the notions of independence both for primitive functors and for axiom sets are discussed, the axiom sets for a number of such systems, e. g. , Frege's propositional calculus, being shown to be non-independent. Equivalence and non-equivalence of systems are discussed in the same context. The deduction theorem is proved in Chapter 3 for all the axiomatic propositional calculi in the book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ivpCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sticks & Stones & Ice Cream Cones, The Craft Book For Children","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NQqbvQEACAAJ&dq=Sticks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of Evolution: A Journey in Search of Clues to the Third Mass Extinction Facing Planet Earth","description":"A paleontologist draws on contemporary research and the fossil record to recreate prehistoric life and to search for clues to the catastrophic mass extinctions that have greatly impacted evolution","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BK8khjC2Cl8C&dq=The+End+of+Evolution:+A+Journey+in+Search+of+Clues+to+the+Third+Mass+Extinction+Facing+Planet+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is It, Tink, Is Pan in Trouble?: A Doonesbury Book (Doonesbury Books (Andrews & McMeel))","description":"The Doonesbury gang careens towards middle age in the 1990s in the latest collection from G.

In the transition of Mexican fiction from direct statements of nationalism and social protest to a concentration on cosmopolitanism, the works of Rulfo hold a unique position. These stories of a rural people caught in the play of natural forces are not simply an interior examination of the phenomena of their world; they are written for the larger purpose of showing the actions of humans in broad terms of reality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nf_eDyxtbD0C&dq=Burning+Plain+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9X6dBJclISoC&dq=Colorado+Summer/Fall/Winter/Spring&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cabinet of Wonders, A","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ethiopia Map","description":"The bibliography of climatic maps of Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Somalilands is compiled from sources in the Weather Bureau Library, the Library of Congress, and the Department of Agriculture Library.

In his provocative new work, Ancient-Future Faith, Robert E. Webber contends that present-day evangelicalism is a product of modernity. Allegiance to modernity, he argues, must be relinquished to free evangelicals to become more consistently historic. Empowerment to function in our changing culture will be found by adapting the classical tradition to our postmodern time. Webber demonstrates the implications in the key areas of church, worship, spirituality, evangelism, nurture, and mission. Webber writes, The fundamental concern of Ancient-Future Faith is to find points of contact between classical Christianity and postmodern thought. Classical Christianity was shaped in a pagan and relativistic society much like our own. Classical Christianity was not an accommodation to paganism but an alternative practice of life. Christians in a postmodern world will succeed, not by watering down the faith, but by being a counter cultural community that invites people to be shaped by the story of Israel and Jesus. A substantial appendix explores the development of authority in the early church, an important issue for evangelicals in a society that shares many features with the Roman world of early Christians. Students, professors, pastors, and laypeople concerned with the churchs effective response to a postmodern world will benefit from this paradigmatic volume. Informative tables and extensive bibliographies enhance the books educational value. - Amazon","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5IGStGLC_6MC&dq=Ancient-Future+Faith:+Rethinking+Evangelicalism+for+a+Postmodern+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lean System Success Plan","description":"Richard Mallory introduces a leadership framework for system management, including practical tools and guidance for its use. It enables an agile quality framework throughout an entire organization that will build the kind of \\"learning organization\\" championed by Peter M. Senge in his classic book, The Fifth Discipline. This innovative framework opens a broad new horizon for management science through the use of structured leadership systems as a new foundation for organizational structure. This book shows leaders how to achieve superior leadership results by applying a Lean DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) structure to leadership systems and program office operations. It provides specific guidance on system improvement through development of best known practice, achievable best practice, and an operational plan to carry it out. Mallory shows leaders how to align and evaluate systems using a Lean approach, that will eliminate duplication and waste of executive and senior management time, and that will reduce the wait time and non-value add in dependent processes. The book shows how to set up an organization-wide scorecard to rank the maturity and capability of fact-based management in all systems, projects and processes throughout an organization, as a means of creating sustained and predictable delivery of excellent products and services.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0-pTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surfeit of Lampreys","description":"A suspicious inheritance comes to the rescue of a cash-strapped aristocratic family:  Entertaining and devious . . .

They have also become vibrant educational centers, full of engaging exhibits that share those discoveries with students and an enthusiastic general public. At the heart of it all from the very start have been curators. Yet after three decades as a natural history curator, Lance Grande found that he still had to explain to people what he does. This book is the answer and, oh, what an answer it is: lively, exciting, up-to-date, it offers a portrait of curators and their research like none we ve seen, one that conveys the intellectual excitement and the educational and social value of curation. Grande uses the personal story of his own career most of it spent at Chicago s storied Field Museum to structure his account as he explores the value of research and collections, the importance of public engagement, changing ecological and ethical considerations, and the impact of rapidly improving technology. Throughout, we are guided by Grande s keen sense of mission, of a job where the why is always as important as the what. This beautifully written and richly illustrated book is a clear-eyed but loving account of natural history museums, their curators, and their ever-expanding roles in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hj0bDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up Black and Proud: A Guide for Teenagers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M3dNAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heart Sounds Made Incredibly Easy (Incredibly Easy!

Davis, authors of the PEN Center USA award-winning Dallas 1963, comes a madcap narrative about Timothy Leary's daring prison escape and run from the law. On the moonlit evening of September 12, 1970, an ex-Harvard professor with a genius I.Q. studies a twelve-foot high fence topped with barbed wire. A few months earlier, Dr. Timothy Leary, the High Priest of LSD, had been running a gleeful campaign for California governor against Ronald Reagan. Now, Leary is six months into a ten-year prison sentence for the crime of possessing two marijuana cigarettes. Aided by the radical Weather Underground, Leary's escape from prison is the counterculture's union of \\"dope and dynamite,\\" aimed at sparking a revolution and overthrowing the government. Inside the Oval Office, President Richard Nixon drinks his way through sleepless nights as he expands the war in Vietnam and plots to unleash the United States government against his ever-expanding list of domestic enemies. Antiwar demonstrators are massing by the tens of thousands; homemade bombs are exploding everywhere; Black Panther leaders are threatening to burn down the White House; and all the while Nixon obsesses over tracking down Timothy Leary, whom he has branded \\"the most dangerous man in America.\\" Based on freshly uncovered primary sources and new firsthand interviews, THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA is an American thriller that takes readers along for the gonzo ride of a lifetime. Spanning twenty-eight months, President Nixon's careening, global manhunt for Dr. Timothy Leary winds its way among homegrown radicals, European aristocrats, a Black Panther outpost in Algeria, an international arms dealer, hash-smuggling hippies from the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, and secret agents on four continents, culminating in one of the trippiest journeys through the American counterculture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DIqNswEACAAJ&dq=The+Most+Dangerous+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heritage","description":"Following in the footsteps of Robeson, Ali, Robinson and others, today s Black athletes re-engage with social issues and the meaning of American patriotism Named a best book of 2018 by Library Journal It used to be that politics and sports were as separate from one another as church and state. The ballfield was an escape from the world s worst problems, top athletes were treated like heroes, and cheering for the home team was as easy and innocent as hot dogs and beer.  No news on the sports page  was a governing principle in newsrooms. That was then. Today, sports arenas have been transformed into staging grounds for American patriotism and the hero worship of law enforcement. Teams wear camouflage jerseys to honor those who serve; police officers throw out first pitches; soldiers surprise their families with homecomings at halftime. Sports and politics are decidedly entwined. But as journalist Howard Bryant reveals, this has always been more complicated for black athletes, who from the start, were committing a political act simply by being on the field. In fact, among all black employees in twentieth-century America, perhaps no other group had more outsized influence and power than ballplayers. The immense social responsibilities that came with the role is part of the black athletic heritage. It is a heritage built by the influence of the superstardom and radical politics of Paul Robeson, Jackie Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith, and John Carlos through the 1960s; undermined by apolitical, corporate-friendly  transcenders of race,  O. J. Simpson, Michael Jordan, and Tiger Woods in the following decades; and reclaimed today by the likes of LeBron James, Colin Kaepernick, and Carmelo Anthony. The Heritage is the story of the rise, fall, and fervent return of the athlete-activist. Through deep research and interviews with some of sports  best-known stars including Kaepernick, David Ortiz, Charles Barkley, and Chris Webber as well as members of law enforcement and the military, Bryant details the collision of post-9/11 sports in America and the politically engaged post-Ferguson black athlete.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f8CGDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Heritage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Cops: The Case For Preventive Policing","description":"Police departments across the country have begun to embrace a new approach to law enforcement based on accountability to citizens, better leadership, and collaboration with the communities they serve. Standing in marked contrast to  Ashcroft policing,  these new strategies are exactly what police need both to make the streets of our cities and towns safer, and to prevent terrorism. David Harris, law professor and nationally known expert on police profiling, has spent the last five years visiting police forces across the country, collecting examples of smart, progressive law enforcement. Drawing on successful strategies currently in use in Detroit, Boston, San Diego, and other cities and towns all over the country, all of which have reduced crime without infringing on civil rights, Harris here unveils the concept of  preventive policing,  a term he has coined to meld these strategies into a new vision for good cops. From preventive policing s founding principles to its real-world applications, Harris shows that the solutions to reducing crime, fighting terror, and preserving civil liberties are within reach if only the Department of Justice will listen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nTwaBQAAQBAJ&dq=Good+Cops:+The+Case+For+Preventive+Policing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirty Years a Slave: From Bondage to Freedom","description":"Louis Hughes was born in 1832 to a white plantation owner and black slave in Charlottesville, Virginia. His autobiography entitled Thirty Years a Slave: From Bondage to Freedom, published in 1897, documents the daily lives of southern slaves. Jack McGee (or McGehee), a cotton plantation owner in Pontotoc, Mississippi, purchased Hughes at a young age. As a young adult, Hughes later traveled to Memphis, Tennessee, to work on the construction of McGee's second home. He tried multiple times to run away but failed. Late in the Civil War, Hughes and other McGee slaves were sent to labor at a salt works in Tombigbee, Alabama before they were sent back home near the end of the war as the Confederacy began to crumble. Hughes finally received liberation from slavery late in 1865, after the war had already finished, when the Union occupation forces finally began to secure northern Panola County, Mississippi. At first, Hughes was compelled to flee himself to Memphis before returning to Mississippi in a dramatic confrontation with his former masters. The institution of human slavery, as it existed in this country, has long been dead; and, happily for all the sacred interests which it assailed, there is for it no resurrection. It may, therefore, be asked to what purpose is the story which follows, of the experiences of one person under that dead and accursed institution? To such question, if it be asked, it may be answered that the narrator presents his story in compliance with the suggestion of friends, and in the hope that it may add something of accurate information regarding the character and influence of an institution which for two hundred years dominated the country-exercising a potent but baneful influence in the formation of its social, civil and industrial structures, and which finally plunged it into the most stupendous civil war which the world has ever known. Though Hughes discussed at length the mundane lives of slaves, he shed even mire light on slave families and the challenge of reuniting with loved ones after emancipation. As was common among slaves, Hughes never found his mother again. But in June 1865 Hughes was determined not to leave his wife and children behind. In the company of another newly freed slave and with the help of two Union soldiers, Hughes returned to Panola to bring his family to safety. Hughes recalled how the Union soldiers berated the southern whites who were trying to keep his family enslaved.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oV88rgEACAAJ&dq=Thirty+Years+a+Slave:+From+Bondage+to+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Of Friends","description":"An unthinkable tragedy forever changes a group of teens and turns family against family in this edge-of-your-seat thriller that begs to be read in one sitting.

His behaviour mystified his friends and other witnesses, yet he never imagined he was ill. Instead, he rationalised his behaviour as a fight for spiritual freedom and made it the cornerstone of his heroic ideal, which was central to his work and to his life and his death. This fresh biographical study aims to explore neglected or misunderstood aspects of his private life to illuminate his writing, his affairs with women, his passion for Napoleon and his conflicted friendships with Coleridge and Shelley. This in turn leads to a new understanding of his masterpiece, Don Juan. 15 July 2019 marks the 200th anniversary of its first publication. Antony Peattie situates these patterns of behaviour in a vividly rendered contemporary world, culminating in Byron s last days in Greece, where he tried to starve himself into heroic leadership but damaged his constitution, resulting in his death at the age of thirty-six.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTmIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scots Dialect Dictionary Comprising the Words in Use from the Latter Part of the Seventeenth Century to the Present Day.","description":"Excerpt from A Scots Dialect Dictionary: Comprising the Words in Use From the Latter Part of the Seventeenth Century to the Present Day The Introduction and the Dialect Map by Mr Grant I owe to the zeal for the Scottish vernacular shown by him as Convener of the Scottish branch of the English Association. His professional knowledge and experience as Lecturer in Phonetics to the Aberdeen Provincial Committee for the Training of Teachers render him exceptionally fitted to deal with the subjects handled in the Introduc tion and to draw the map showing the distribution of the dialects. These subjects are in brief as follows (i) A short history of Scottish, showing its original identity with Northern English; its use as a literary language down to about 1600; its decline during the seventeenth century; and the revival of a vernacular literature about 1700. (2) The separation into dialects; the distribution of these so far as at present known; their leading characteristics; and the extent to which they have been used in literature. (3) The pronunciation of Scottish, with special reference to the literary forms and the usual spelling. (4) The present state of studies in Scottish and the efforts to record the existing dialects. I have also received from Mr Grant two large lists of words, which have been incorporated in the Appendix as far as was needful. The readiness with which Mr Grant undertook to comply with my request that he should write the Introduction on these lines, and his accomplishment of his voluntary contribution to the usefulness of this book, lay me and - may I say - all who use this book, under very great obligation. I trust that its publication may help to further the purpose to which he is devoting so much energy - the purpose of ultimately gathering all available material over Scotland for a thoroughly scientific Dictionary comprehending all Scottish, Early, Middle, and Modern, so far as this is possible. Further contributions of words not found in this or any other Dialect Dictionary will be gratefully welcomed if sent to Mr Grant or to myself. All such words should be vouched for by the senders, with the exact meaning, the locality in which they are used, and an indication of the pronunciation.

Thompson. Following the success of the New York Times bestseller ESPN SportsCentury comes a new collection of essays, illustrations, and photographs that explores a completely original concept: sports as the American secular religion. We've all seen the images: a stadium of fans performing the \\"we are not worthy\\" genuflection, a St. Vincent Lombardi medal, Michael Jordan being followed by a worshipful crowd of media members. And what room doesn't grow silent to absorb the words of the prophet-like Muhammad Ali, or to revel in footage of the miracle victory of the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team Indeed, the parallels are unmistakable: Sports is America's secular religion, and its famous figures occupy a hallowed place in our culture. No one has ever captured this topic as cogently as the writers included in Saints, Saviors and Sinners. Each section of the book is accompanied by numerous photographs, which viscerally support the theme of each grouping. Le Anne Schreiber writes about \\"Saints,\\" Ralph Wiley discusses \\"Saviors,\\" Peter Carlson examines \\"Sinners,\\" Robert Lipsyte explores the \\"Prophets,\\" and George Plimpton delves into \\"God.\\" Superbly designed by the prize-winning team behind ESPN SportsCentury, Saints, Saviors and Sinners is far more than a compendium of photos, illustrations, and essays -- it is a cohesive, insightful, and instructive examination of America's top sports figures and their position in our society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wRzkwAEACAAJ&dq=Gospel+According+to+ESPN,+The:+Saints,+Saviors,+and+Sinners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Navajo","description":"Based on statements given to the Navajo Uranium Miner Oral History and Photography Project, this revealing book assesses the effects of uranium mining on the reservation beginning in the 1940s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5lEr1d-C4bAC&dq=Navajo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peach orchard road: The documentary of a double kidnap-murder","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f2szGwAACAAJ&dq=Peach+orchard+road:+The+documentary+of+a+double+kidnap-murder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basis of the Premillennial Faith","description":"Are you looking forward with expectation?

The setting was in Egypt under the Roman Empire, among men who had received some instruction in Greek philosophy, and especially the Platonism of the period, but were not content with merely accepting and repeating the cut-and-dried dogmas of the orthodox philosophic schools and sought to build up, on a basis of Platonic doctrine, a philosophic religion that would better satisfy their needs. Included here are the libelli of the Corpus Hermeticum, the Asclepius, the Hermetic excerpts in the Anthologium of Stobaeus, and other fragments. The entire text is produced in the original Greek or Latin, with an English translation on facing pages.

It is one of the most important topics of research in the area of mobile and personal communications. SDR is viewed as the enabler of global roaming and a platform for the introduction of new technologies and services into existing live networks. It therefore gives networks a greater flexibility into mobile communications. It bridges the inter-disciplinary gap in the field as SDR covers two areas of development, namely software development and digital signal processing and the internet. It extends well beyond the simple re-configuration of air interface parameters to cover the whole system from the network to service creation and application development. Reconfigurability entails the pervasive use of software reconfiguration, empowering upgrades or patching of any element of the network and of the services and applications running on it. It cuts across the types of bearer radio systems (Paging to cellular, wireless local area network to microwave, terrestrial to satellite, personal communications to broadcasting) enable the integration of many of today's disparate systems in the same hardware platform. Also it cuts across generation (second to third to fourth). This volume complements the already published volumes 1 and 2 of the Wiley Series in Software Radio. The book discusses the requirements for reconfigurability and then introduces network architectures and functions for reconfigurable terminals. Finally it deals with reconfiguration in the network. The book also provides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST, MOBIVAS and TRUST/SCOUT. Key features include: Presents new research in wireless communications Summarises the results of an extensive research program on software defined radios in Europe Provides a comprehensive view on reconfigurability in three very active research projects as CAST (Configurable radio with Advanced Sodftware Technology), MOBIVAS (Downloadable MOBIle Value Added Services through Software Radio and Switching Integrated Platforms), TRUST (Transparently Re-configurable Ubiquitous Terminal) and SCOUT (Smart User-Centric Communciation Environment).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pwjecYxO0NQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Hunley","description":"Presents the history of the submarine the Hunley, including the building, missions, mysterious sinking, recovery, and restoration.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X_wFAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Voyage+of+the+Hunley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Camillo takes the Devil by the tail","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=112PtQEACAAJ&dq=Don+Camillo+takes+the+Devil+by+the+tail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Triumph of Hope : From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel","description":"Triumph of Hope From Theresienstadt and Auschwitz to Israel Now available in English, here is the award-winning and internationally acclaimed testament of a Jewish woman who was taken to Auschwitz while several months pregnant, where she was forced to confront perhaps the most agonizing choice ever imposed upon any woman, upon any human being . so that both she and her newborn infant should not die in a Nazi \\"medical\\" experiment personally conducted by the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele.

A master data modeler must come into any organization, understand its data requirements, and skillfully model the data for applications that most effectively serve organizational needs. Mastering Data Modeling is a complete guide to becoming a successful data modeler. Featuring a requirements-driven approach, this book clearly explains fundamental concepts, introduces a user-oriented data modeling notation, and describes a rigorous, step-by-step process for collecting, modeling, and documenting the kinds of data that users need. Assuming no prior knowledge, Mastering Data Modeling sets forth several fundamental problems of data modeling, such as reconciling the software developer's demand for rigor with the users' equally valid need to speak their own (sometimes vague) natural language. In addition, it describes the good habits that help you respond to these fundamental problems. With these good habits in mind, the book describes the Logical Data Structure (LDS) notation and the process of controlled evolution by which you can create low-cost, user-approved data models that resist premature obsolescence. Also included is an encyclopedic analysis of all data shapes that you will encounter. Most notably, the book describes The Flow, a loosely scripted process by which you and the users gradually but continuously improve an LDS until it faithfully represents the information needs. Essential implementation and technology issues are also covered. You will learn about such vital topics as: The fundamental problems of data modeling The good habits that help a data modeler be effective and economical LDS notation, which encourages these good habits How to read an LDS aloud--in declarative English sentences How to write a well-formed (syntactically correct) LDS How to get users to name the parts of an LDS with words from their own business vocabulary How to visualize data for an LDS A catalog of LDS shapes that recur throughout all data models The Flow--the template for your conversations with users How to document an LDS for users, data modelers, and technologists How to map an LDS to a relational schema How LDS differs from other notations and why \\"Story interludes\\" appear throughout the book, illustrating real-world successes of the LDS notation and controlled evolution process.

In other words, just cutting up your credit cards will not make you rich. What does make you rich is financial education...unfortunately a type of education we do not receive in school. If a person has a solid financial education, they would know that there are two kinds of debt...good debt and bad debt. A person with a sound financial education would know how to use good debt to make them richer faster...much faster than a person who only saves money and has no debt. Rich Dad's Guide to Becoming Rich * Are you in credit card debt? * Is job security dead? * Is your financial security threatened? * Is a high-paying job the answer? * Is your money working for you? * Do you have good debt or bad debt? We all need more financial education. We need to know how to have our money work hard for us so we don't have to spend our lives working for money.

Half the world is at war and with the other half about to join in, a thousand U.S. Marines stand sentinel over the last days of an uneasy truce between ourselves and the Imperial Japanese Army in chaotic North China. By November 27, FDR is convinced Japan is about to launch a military action. Washington doesn't know where, isn't sure precisely when. But the Cabinet is sufficiently alarmed that War Secretary Henry Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox are authorized to send an immediate and coded \\"warning of war\\" to American bases and units in harm's way. In Shanghai two cruise ships are chartered and 800 armed American Marines are marched through the great port city with enormous pomp and circumstance and embarked for Manila. Another 200 Marines, unable to reach Shanghai, and serving in small garrisons and posts from Peking to Mongolia and the Gobi Desert, are caught short by this \\"warning of war.\\" This is their story. Of how a detachment of American Marines marooned in North China as war erupts, set out on an epic march through hostile territory in an attempt to fight their way out of China and, somehow, rejoin their Corps for the war against Japan. James Brady dazzles us once again with a stunning and unflinching look at America at war. Warning of War is a moving tribute to sheer courage, determination, and Marine Corps discipline, and is a wonderful celebration of America in one of its darkest but finest hours.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2QNE1UVqe6gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gods, graves, and scholars: The story of archaeology","description":"C.W.

Mary Anning was only twelve years old when, in 1811, she discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. Until Mary's incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, \\"She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore.\\" She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary's peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin drew on Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. A story worthy of Dickens, The Fossil Hunter chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: \\"The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it.\\" Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is \\"probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology,\\" to her deserved place in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Yoga","description":"A celebration of bodies and play for yoga-loving parents and little ones.

A Strong West Wind begins in the 1950s in the wilds of the Texas Panhandlea place of both boredom and beauty, its flat horizons broken only by oil derricks, grain elevators, and church steeples. Its story belongs to a girl who grew up surrounded by dust storms and cattle ranches and summer lightning, who took refuge from the vastness of the land and the ever-present wind by retreating into books. What she found there, from renegade women to men who lit out for the territory, turned out to offer a blueprint for her own future. Caldwell would grow up to become a writer, but first she would have to fall in love with a man who was every mother s nightmare, live through the anguish and fire of the Vietnam years, and defy the father she adored, who had served as a master sergeant in the Second World War. A Strong West Wind is a memoir of culture and historyof fathers and daughters, of two world wars and the passionate rebellions of the sixties. But it is also about the mythology of place and the evolution of a sensibility: about how literature can shape and even anticipate a life. Caldwell possesses the extraordinary ability to illuminate the desires, stories, and lives of ordinary people. Written with humanity, urgency, and beautiful restraint, A Strong West Wind is a magical and unforgettable book, destined to become an American classic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SHEbxb1gVtEC&dq=A+Strong+West+Wind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trafalgar: The Men, the Battle, the Storm","description":"Two hundred years ago, Napoleon Bonaparte dominated Europe and threatened Britain with invasion.

Spanning two centuries of one family s history, The Hairstons tells the extraordinary story of the Hairston clan, once the wealthiest family in the Old South and the largest slaveholder in America. With several thousand black and white members, the Hairstons of today share a complex and compelling history: divided in the time of slavery, they have come to embrace their past as one family. For seven years, journalist Henry Wiencek combed the far-reaching branches of the Hairston family tree to piece together a family history that involves the experiences of both plantation owners and their slaves. Crisscrossing the old plantation country of Virginia, North Carolina, and Mississippi, The Hairstons reconstructs the triumphant rise of the remarkable children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the enslaved as they fought to take their rightful place in mainstream America. It also follows the white descendants through the decline and fall of the Old South, and uncovers the hidden history of slavery's curse and how that curse followed slaveholders for generations. Expertly weaving stories of horror, tragedy, and heroism, The Hairstons addresses our nation s attempt to untangle the twisted legacy of the past, and provides a transcendent account of the human power to overcome.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOn4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urban Reflections: Illustrated World Cities","description":"The world is filled with successful examples of urban spaces that retain the vitality for which they were designed.

It is a hilarious and touching journey that shines a spotlight on a world and a set of beliefs long gone, and asks several vital questions: where does philanthropy stop and social engineering begin? Is it right for an employer to dictate how his workers spend their weekends and hire private detectives to make sure they are doing it properly?

It has become necessary for professional geologists, hobby collectors, and commercial collectors to recognize each others existence and to try to work together within a framework of regulation, courtesy, and common sense so that material of scientific value is not lost and undue restrictions are not placed upon collecting. There is a continuing need for collectors and professionals to work together with resource managers and legislators to develop workable laws and rules affecting the collecting of minerals and fossils. This publication contains details information about collecting areas, divided by county to make for ease of use. Each collecting area contains information about the minerals, rocks, or fossils present, map recommendations, and other helpful tips on getting to the sites.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t-XvE8DTiW0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE IDOLATERS","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EoA3KxGal2oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Puerto Rican Nation on the Move: Identities on the Island and in the United States","description":"Puerto Ricans maintain a vibrant identity that bridges two very different places--the island of Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland. Whether they live on the island, in the States, or divide time between the two, most imagine Puerto Rico as a separate nation and view themselves primarily as Puerto Rican. At the same time, Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917, and Puerto Rico has been a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Jorge Duany uses previously untapped primary sources to bring new insights to questions of Puerto Rican identity, nationalism, and migration. Drawing a distinction between political and cultural nationalism, Duany argues that the Puerto Rican \\"nation\\" must be understood as a new kind of translocal entity with deep cultural continuities. He documents a strong sharing of culture between island and mainland, with diasporic communities tightly linked to island life by a steady circular migration. Duany explores the Puerto Rican sense of nationhood by looking at cultural representations produced by Puerto Ricans and considering how others--American anthropologists, photographers, and museum curators, for example--have represented the nation. His sources of information include ethnographic fieldwork, archival research, interviews, surveys, censuses, newspaper articles, personal documents, and literary texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8jzqCQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Puerto+Rican+Nation+on+the+Move:+Identities+on+the+Island+and+in+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Call (The Destroyer)","description":"Last Call is a book of poems that explores the journey and search for our elusive God. This is the journey of the soul, and the search is joined through the intimacies of everyday experiences, the confusions of relationships, the ever-present struggle with aging and mortality, and the wanderings amid the mysteries of faith. These poems reflect that, even in our uncertainty and not-knowing, we are continually summoned to live with an abiding sense of gratitude.

Neither the Sergeant nor the Nun had any idea that their brief encounters at the old Leper's Home had any particular significance for the future, or even that their paths would cross again. The war over, the Sergeant, looking for help in the fulfillment of a promise he had made to himself to provide personally-inscribed gifts at Christmas for the leprosy patients he could not forget, rallied his family and friends to the cause. Seeking advice, he decided to visit the Massachusetts headquarters of the Marist Missionary Sisters who staffed the leprosarium in Jamaica. There he again encountered the Nun who was back home for medical attention. She was allowed to help him in his project -- a joining of efforts which today flourishes as the Damien-Dutton Society for Leprosy Aid. As the Society's horizons expanded, so did its membership and its world recognition. Five decades later it was not only \\"two hearts, one fire\\" but thousands upon thousands of generous hearts afire with the need to alert the public to the unique problem of a much maligned, much misunderstood leprosy affliction, known today as Hansen's Disease.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o09oAAAACAAJ&dq=Two+Hearts,+One+Fire+a+Glimpse+behind+the+Mask+of+Leprosy+SIGNED&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Meade's country cookbook","description":"This classic collection features more than 600 recipes for such hearty, wholesome fare as country fried chicken, sausage and cornbread stuffing, and pot roast with onions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7TEWAAAACAAJ&dq=Mary+Meade%27s+country+cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story Of My Life","description":"Capture the stories of a lifetime Record the stories of your life--or a loved one's--for posterity!

Selected from thousands of letters and edited by Linda Gray Sexton, the poet s daughter, and Lois Ames, one of her closest friends, this collection exposes Sexton s inner life from her boarding school days through her years of growing fame and ultimately to the months leading up to her suicide. Correspondence with writers like W. D. Snodgrass, Robert Lowell, and May Swenson reveals Sexton s growing confidence in her identity as a poet as she discusses her craft, publications, and teaching appointments. Her private letters chart her marriage to Alfred  Kayo  Sexton, from the giddy excitement following their elopement to their eventual divorce; her grief over the death of her parents; her great love for her daughters balanced with her frustration with the endless tasks of being a housewife; and her persistent struggle with depression. Going beyond the angst and neuroses of her poetry, these letters portray the full complexities of the woman behind the art: passionate, anguished, ambitious, and yearning for connection.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7PGZCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Encyclopedia of the Violin","description":"First published in 1925, this renowned reference remains unsurpassed as a source of essential information, from construction and evolution to repertoire and technique.

Cahnman brings together out of scattered dispersion his writings about Max Weber, Ferdinand Toennies, and historical sociology. The great theoretical range and depth of his intellect and mastery of sociological thinking is apparent as he discusses the impact of romanticism on modern thought, and how Weber and Toennies both analyzed and reacted to modernity.Cahnman places Weber (1864-1920), the dominant figure in twentieth-century sociology, in the midst of the methodological controversies so characteristic of contemporary social science, and he fully discusses the overarching importance of Weberian ideal-type theory. Although less well-known than Weber, Toennies (1855-1936) was also a sociologist of the first rank. He is best remembered for his enormously influential twin concepts, Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, which contributed to our understanding of the historical and sociological basis for the change from premodern to modern societies. The essays in this volume establish Toennies' intellectual connections to Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Herbert Spencer, and clarify his influence upon American sociology.Cahnman stood against strict separations between history and sociology, and his essays are all informed by a wonderful admixture of the theoretical and the concrete. They demonstrate how a genuine historical sociology, not unlike that of Weber and Toennies, can find and explain linkages between seemingly disparate events spanning time and place. This volume will be of interest to sociologists, political scientists, and intellectual historians.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ym2DswEACAAJ&dq=Weber+and+Toennies:+Comparative+Sociology+in+Historical+Perspective&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heaven Around The Corner (Best of Betty Neels)","description":"COULD SHE COPE WITH THE SAVAGE FAMILY?

The local lords or clan chiefs waged ceaseless war against each other, while the court, wholly steeped in Chinese culture, seemed to take no further interest in the affairs of the nation. In 1191 the Minamoto clan mastered the disturbances and finally imposed its rule. Hard work, respect for the hierarchy, the cult of nationalism, a sense of self-sacrifice and duty  such was the new trend. The Buddhist doctrine of Zen made its appearance. It gave mystical support to the samurai, and the Japanese spirit was henceforth directed towards a political and religious asceticism which had an enormous influence on all aspects of art, thought and daily life. An acknowledged authority on the  classical  period of Japanese history, the author reveals what the life of the Japanese people was like during these five centuries, and shows how a transformation of heart and mind produced a civilization as original as it was profound.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OAPHBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Poems and Plays: 1909-1950","description":"An indispensable collection of the Nobel Prize winner s most renowned works.

The setting was in Egypt under the Roman Empire, among men who had received some instruction in Greek philosophy, and especially the Platonism of the period, but were not content with merely accepting and repeating the cut-and-dried dogmas of the orthodox philosophic schools and sought to build up, on a basis of Platonic doctrine, a philosophic religion that would better satisfy their needs. Included here are the libelli of the Corpus Hermeticum, the Asclepius, the Hermetic excerpts in the Anthologium of Stobaeus, and other fragments. The entire text is produced in the original Greek or Latin, with an English translation on facing pages.

They symbolize everything from the Old West to the hippie counter-culture; everyone from car mechanics to high-fashion models wears jeans. And no name is more associated with blue jeans than Levi Strauss & Co., the creator of this classic American garment. As a young man Levi Strauss left his home in Germany and immigrated to America. He made his way to San Francisco and by 1853 had started his company. Soon he was a leading businessman in a growing commercial city that was beginning to influence the rest of the nation. Family-centered and deeply rooted in his Jewish faith, Strauss was the hub of a wheel whose spokes reached into nearly every aspect of American culture: business, philanthropy, politics, immigration, transportation, education, and fashion. But despite creating an American icon, Levi Strauss is a mystery. Little is known about the man, and the widely circulated \\"facts\\" about his life are steeped in mythology. In this first full-length biography, Lynn Downey sets the record straight about this brilliant businessman. Strauss's life was the classic American success story, filled with lessons about craft and integrity, leadership and innovation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_veqswEACAAJ&dq=Levi+Strauss:+The+Blue+Jeans+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qfCpzgEACAAJ&dq=Chambers+Twentieth+Century+Dictionary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walking Through the Jungle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principles of Biblical hermeneutics","description":"Dr. S.

Alongside over 600 photographs taken by Mick Rock, Bowie's intimate and often humorous commentary gives unprecedented insight into his best and most memorable creation.

On the foggy morning of August 16, 1780, American and British armies clashed in the pine woods north of Camden, South Carolina, in one of the most important and influential battles of the Revolutionary War. An American victory would quash British plans to subjugate the southern colonies and virtually guarantee the independence of the fledgling United States. A victory for the British would pave the way for the conquest of North Carolina and Virginia. After nearly an hour of frenzied, bloody combat, the British army emerged victorious, and American morale plummeted to its lowest point of the war. The rout at Camden was not a total loss, however as Patriot forces eventually came away with a renewed determination to resist British advances, and the lessons from the defeat were applied to secure future victories that finally allowed the Patriots to triumph in the South. This book presents the Battle of Camden as never before: through the words of American and British participants and contemporary observers. The events leading up to the conflict, the combat itself, and the consequences of Camden are all described in striking detail. The cunning strategies of both American Major General Horatio Gates and British Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis are revealed, as are a number of battlefield reports from soldiers on both sides. In addition to these compelling first-hand accounts, The Battle of Camden includes analysis of the battle and its effects in America and Europe from George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Lord George Germain. With this landmark text, historian Jim Piecuch offers a comprehensive consideration of a vital Revolutionary battle and its effects on the war for American independence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7P9_CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dante Experience","description":"This book articulates a new approach to medieval aesthetic values, emphasizing the sensory and emotional basis of all medieval arts, their love of play and fine craftsmanship, of puzzles, and of strong contrasts.

This pervasive yet little- examined obsession with bargains is arguably the most powerful and devastating market force of our time, having fueled an excess of consumerism that blights our land-scapes, escalates personal debt, lowers our standard of living, and even skews of our concept of time. Spotlighting the peculiar forces that drove Americans away from quality, durability, and craftsmanship and towards quantity, quantity, and more quantity, Ellen Ruppel Shell traces the rise of the bargain through our current big-box profusion to expose the astronomically high cost of cheap.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wDkR4Jt1FcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of a Tuscan Chef","description":"Offers seasonal menus and recipes for such dishes as penne with crab meat, baby artichoke salad, beans and caviar, stuffed squab, and pork chops with rosemary","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_fUBAAAACAAJ&dq=Diary+of+a+Tuscan+Chef&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abby's Passion","description":"Abby lives a solid and uneventful life... except where her sister, Mona, is concerned.

The legacy of the Corvette is matched only by its beauty, captured here like never before. Art of the Corvette profiles two dozen Corvettes from all seven generations, beginning with the first 1953 Blue Flame Six Corvette and concluding with the return of an icon, the stunning 2014 Corvette Stingray. Using a unique style of portraiture known as light-painting, acclaimed photographers Randy Leffingwell and Tom Loeser present the most recognizable, unique, and historic Corvettes ever produced. From the chrome-lined grilles of the 1953 Roadster and sexy curves of the first C3s to the aggressive snarl of the 2012 ZR1 and the bold, blunt powerhouse of the 2014 Corvette Stingray, all are presented in breathtaking color and detail. Rare and one-off cars abound as well, like the 1963 Z06 Sting Ray and one of only a handful of 1967 L88 convertibles. With an authoritative text by Leffingwell, one of the world's leading Corvette historians, and over 200 stunning photographs, Art of the Corvette presents this landmark of American automotive engineering and design, the Chevrolet Corvette, as never before seen.

With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was  sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.

Through the dual understanding of the art-theoretical concept of the Idea, an evolution will be revealed that illustrates the embittered battles over style and the overarching intellectual shifts in the period between art production and conceptualization based on Aristotelian and Platonic notions of creativity, beauty and the goal of art as an exercise in encapsulating the  divine  truth of nature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OwB4DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Motorcycle Mechanics","description":"For courses in Motorcycle Mechanics.

Of those 5%, more than half must also cope with one or more comorbid disorders of learning, emotion, and behavior complicating ADHD diagnosis and treatment. The challenge for clinicians is to treat not just ADHD, but also the psychiatric disorders and comorbid disorders that often accompany it. Edited by a leading researcher and practitioner, Attention-Deficit Disorders and Comorbidities in Children, Adolescents, and Adultsbrings together the work of 25 distinguished contributors all on the cutting edge of ADHD research. The past decade of research and clinical experience has shown that ADHD is far from the simple disorder, starting in childhood and remitting in adulthood, it was once thought to be. Divided into two main sections, this volume includes a chapter on each of the psychiatric disorders and comorbidities that often occur with ADHD. ? In the first section, \\"ADDs With Comorbidities,\\" the editor introduces readers to ADHD by talking about our emerging understanding of and the latest genetic research on ADHD. The author of each subsequent chapter shows how ADHD interacts with mood and anxiety disorders, oppositionality and aggression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, learning disorders, substance abuse disorders, sleep disturbances, Tourette syndrome, and developmental coordination disorder. This section concludes with two final chapters: one on assessing and treating ADDs in preschoolers and the other on different treatment outcomes as reported in existing longitudinal studies of ADDs. ? The second section, \\"Assessments and Interventions for ADDs\\", includes in-depth chapters on clinical assessment and diagnosis, pharmacotherapy, psychosocial and educational interventions, and a cognitive therapy perspective on ADHD. This section wraps up by emphasizing the importance of tailoring treatment to the individual as a whole, considering not only comorbidities but also family and social settings. Heavily annotated and written with practical implications for both clinicians and educators in mind, this comprehensive volume demonstrates a scope and depth unparalleled within the current literature. As such, it will find its way into the libraries of professionals and interested laypersons alike: clinical psychiatrists and psychologists; pediatricians, family practitioners and other primary care physicians who treat children, adolescents, and adults; education professionals, including school nurses, special education teachers and administrators, and college and university disability services personnel; and juvenile justice system professionals, including clinical and social workers and administrators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=03b7Ug4oFlgC&dq=Attention-Deficit+Disorders+and+Comorbidities+in+Children,+Adolescents,+and+Adults&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Looking for Canterbury","description":"Several Vietnam veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome strive to heal themselves by telling stories about themselves in Central Park that have nothing to do with Nam. In flight from years of unrewarding support-group therapy, all seven of them hope to work out their problems by playing roles which take off on Chaucers storytelling characters (whose personalities they strikingly resemble)--on the theory that the truth is best arrived at by indirection and through a more personal and human approach. The pilgrimage to an American Canterbury is the brainchild of one Harry Baylor, a Broadway Avenue butcher and Vietnam vet in flight from an unhappy marriage and a recurring nightmare that he killed his best buddy during an enemy attack and ran from the field of battle.A Chaucer nut, Harry got hooked on the great medieval poet while attending night-classes at City College taught by Professor Dorsett, a paraplegic who served as a medic in Nam and who, too, is a member of the support group. Nam and Chaucer fuse to form Harry Baylors dual obsession (now and then, when he is under duress, the conversation lapses into Middle English). Troubled Harry withdraws 58,178 dollars--corresponding to the number of names on the Wall of the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial in Washington, DC -- from his marital joint bank account and splurges them on his Chaucer gala; he puts up his fellow Nam vets in a plush hotel on Central Park South, outfits them in Chaucerian costumes (e.g., the former nurse in Vietnam, herself the splitting image of the flamboyant, sexy Wife of Bath, sports a heavy headdress of finely woven kerchiefs, scarlet and tightly gathered hose, and soft new shoes), and stages a medieval feast with spectacular entertainments (a la Chaucers day) and food authentic down to the last--sometimes rather unappetizing--detail. Harrys dream of finding salvation in Central Park runs into opposition. The Pilgrims take a week off from their busy jobs with some misgiving and only after he persuades them that the stark alternative is living death or continuing to live like zombies each tormented by his or her own Nam-connected demon. And when they try to tell stories about themselves free of Nam, they either fail to complete them or the tales disintegrate into chaotic reminiscences of the particular Nam horror that has preyed on the mind of each all these years.The Chaucer gala turns into a shambles; their feelings of frustration cause Harrys fellow vets to turn against him, making him their scapegoat.Why, they ask, did you get us into this?Why did you promise us so much? How come you required us to tell a tale when you declined to do so?At least we tried!Whathave you got to hide? (Harry has pleaded his scholarly integrity;--the Host in The Canterbury Tales does not tell a story). Throughout his trial by fire, Harry Baylors loving and admiiring Monica, his Wife of Bath, is tenderly supportive. (Soon Harrys divorce will come through and he will, a la Chaucer, become her sixth husband.) Like Chaucers pilgrims to Canterbury, the Nam vets underake their journey during spring, the season of redemption and rebirth. In Central Park, the Wife of Bath, for example, tells her fairy tale of wish-fulfillment while ensconced in the lap of Alice in the Alice in Wonderland statue; the rambunctious Millerand the sinister psychiatrist... \\"Jason Marks has written an accurate and thoughtful memorial to the many Vietnam Veterans who continue to suffer from the hellishness of war, and the humiliation of their homecoming.

McClellan took command of the Union Army of the Potomac. In the spring of 1862, having rebuilt his forces, the Little Napoleon devised a plan to end the war in a single campaign. Transporting his army by sea to the Virginia Peninsula, he would outflank Confederate forces and march unopposed on Richmond, the Southern capital. Excessive caution squandered the opportunity, however, and the Union lost its main chance to achieve an early end to the war. By the spring of 1862 most Americans had realised that the Civil War would not be brought to a conclusion without a major effort and a substantial financial and human cost. However, General George B. McClellan, the new commander of the Union Army of the Potomac, aimed to avoid a long war by capturing Richmond, the Confederate capital, in a single campaign. What followed was an operation which caught the Confederates off-guard and poised to capture the Confederate capital in a matter of weeks. This did not take account of General McClellan's excessive caution, however. Having executed the first part of his masterstroke and successfully transported the Army of the Potomac to the Virginia Peninsula, McClellan threw away his advantage - it took him almost two months to advance within sight of Richmond. The result was the bloody one-day battle of Fair Oaks, fought on 31 May 1862. The result was tactically indecisive, but the vicious Confederate attacks again unnerved McClellan and he called off any further advance on Richmond, despite the protests of Generals Hooker and Kearny who insisted the city was still vulnerable. The Union Army of the Potomac, and in particular its commander, lost confidence in their abilities as the campaign progressed. An unstoppable military force simply ran out of steam, surrendering the initiative to the enemy and squandering the chance to end the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yk5LAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fair+Oaks+1862+:+McClellan%27s+Peninsula+Campaign+(Praeger+Illustrated+Military+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jem","description":"A cynical and compelling tale of politics, exploitation and colonisation on another planet The discovery of another habitable world might spell salvation to the three bitterly competing power blocs of the resource-starved 21st century; but when their representatives arrive on Jem, with its multiple intelligent species, they discover instead the perfect situation into which to export their rivalries.

But what if at least one of those legends, that of the vampire, is actually the ill-recollected history of another species? And what if that species still exists, intentionally keeping itself hidden, lest superstitious humans try to destroy them?

Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) allow organizations to manage and back up huge file systems quickly, thereby keeping their lifeblood flowing. W. Curtis Preston's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of building and managing large data centers using SANs and NAS. As a network administrator you're aware that multi-terabyte data stores are common and petabyte data stores are starting to appear. Given this much data, how do you ensure that it is available all the time, that access times and throughput are reasonable, and that the data can be backed up and restored in a timely manner? SANs and NAS provide solutions that help you work through these problems, with special attention to the difficulty of backing up huge data stores. This book explains the similarities and differences of SANs and NAS to help you determine which, or both, of these complementing technologies are appropriate for your network. Using SANs, for instance, is a way to share multiple devices (tape drives and disk drives) for storage, while NAS is a means for centrally storing files so they can be shared. Preston exams each technology with a vendor neutral approach, starting with the building blocks of a SAN and how they can be assembled for effective storage solutions. He covers day-to-day management and backup and recovery for both SANs and NAS in detail. Whether you're a seasoned storage administrator or a network administrator charged with taking on this role, you'll find all the information you need to make informed architecture and data management decisions. The book fans out to explore technologies such as RAID and other forms of monitoring that will help complement your data center. With an eye on the future, other technologies that might affect the architecture and management of the data center are explored. This is sure to be an essential volume in any network administrator's or storage administrator's library.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JV0pW2RjVQYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The journey to the polar sea (Everyman's library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZfZ74Vs-aR0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PLUMED SERPENT","description":"\\"The Plumed Serpent\\" by D.

Nettuno was his destination because this town, south of Rome, has been the baseball capital of Italy since 1944, when the game was introduced by the American GIs who liberated the region. Bidini wanted to spend time in a town where everyone is as nuts about the game as he is, and in Nettuno, they love the game so much that they hand out baseball gloves and bats to children taking their first communion. For six months Bidini followed the fortunes of the Serie B Peones, Nettunese to the core. At the same time he was also learning about his own heritage, having spent his youth vigorously ignoring his Italianness. The result of his summer in Italy is vintage Bidini: a funny, perceptive, and engrossing book that takes readers far beyond the professional sport to the game that people around the world love to play.

Selected by a team of poets and prominent Neruda scholars in both Chile and the U.S., this is a definitive selection that draws from the entire breadth and width of Neruda's various styles and themes. An impressive group of translators that includes Alistair Reid, Stephen Mitchell, Robert Hass, Stephen Kessler and Jack Hirschman, have come together to revisit or completely retranslate the poems; and a handful of previously untranslated works are included as well. This selection sets the standard for a general, high--quality introduction to Neruda's complete oeuvre. \\" ...The Essential Neruda will prove to be, for most readers, the best introduction to Neruda available in English. In fact, I can think of few other books that have given me so much delight so easily. At only 234 pages (bilingual), it somehow manages to convey the fullness of Neruda's poetic arc: Reading it is like reading the autobiography of a poetic sensibility (granted, the abridged version).\\"--The Austin Chronicle \\"This book is a must-have for any reader interested in a definitive sampling of the most essential poems by one whom many consider one of the best poets of the 20th century.\\"--Mike Nobles, Tulsa World \\"What better way to celebrate the hundred years of Neruda's glorious residence on our earth than this selection of crucial works-- in both languages -- by one of the greatest poets of all time. A splendid way to begin a love affair with our Pablo or, having already succumbed to his infinite charms, revisit him passionately again and again and yet again.\\"--Ariel Dorfman, author of Konfidenz and The Nanny and the Iceberg \\"If the notion had struck Pablo Neruda, I am quite sure that like Fernando Pessoa and Antonio Machado he would have given birth to what the former called heteronyms. Like Pessoa especially, Neruda can be several poets according to where he is and when and what his mood might be. It is quite fitting therefore that his work in this anthology be shared by various translators, for, ideally, a translator is but another heteronym speaking in a different tongue and at a different time.

But Carson had his own agenda: without any warning to his NBC bosses, he announced that he was leaving the \\"Tonight\\" show - NBC's flagship late-night program, and the most profitable television show ever. Carson's motive for dropping this bombshell in front of NBC's most treasured - and needed - allies is only the beginning of one of the most incredible stories of corporate infighting and show business intrigues ever to play itself out on the soundstages and in the boardrooms of New York and Hollywood. Bill Carter, who covers the television industry for the New York Times, has uncovered the true behind-the-scenes story of two giant corporations - CBS and NBC - and two quirky comedians with dreams and ambitions of their own, David Letterman and Jay Leno, fighting for the honor and the hundreds of millions of dollars that go with the abandoned late-night throne. It's a story that's as big as the manipulations of Hollywood's most feared power brokers and multi-million-dollar negotiators - and as personal as the effect on executives of being snubbed by a party invitation. Bill Carter interviewed all of the key - and dozens of not-so-key - players in this story to get the entire picture of posturing, infighting, hurt feelings, and political maneuvering that put NBC's biggest franchise at risk - and examines the fates of the executives whose wrongheaded decisions allowed it to happen. The Late Shift tells the never-before-told story behind Johnny Carson's role in Letterman's decision to defect to CBS; the secret NBC documents that sealed the future of the \\"Tonight\\" show before Carson announced his retirement; the bizarre story of Jay Leno hiding in a closet to spy on a secret NBC staff meeting; evidence that Carson didn't willingly retire - he was maneuvered out; and NBC's final offer to David Letterman, and their reasons for keeping it a secret. But, ultimately, like any great dramatic story, this is a story of people: Warren Littlefield, the head of NBC programming, who finally stepped out of the shadow of Brandon Tartikoff, only to make a tactical error that cost his company millions; Peter Lassally, David Letterman's executive producer, who tried desperately to mend the hard feelings between his boss and NBC - and almost pulled off a monumental coup; Helen Kushnick, Jay Leno's manager and producer, whose high-pressure tactics and high-decibel rantings cost her her job and her biggest client - and almost lost Jay his show; Howard Stringer, the president of CBS, whose strategic deal-making turned NBC against itself - ensuring that one way or another his network would become a force in late-night programming; and Bob Wright, the president of NBC, who realized too late that the executives beneath him had left the barn door open. And, of course, it's the story of two comedians whose careers and fates are inextricably linked, despite the fact that their personal and comedic styles couldn't be more different. Leno and Letterman - complex, driven men with their own inner needs to succeed - thrown into a wildly public media rivalry that is finally decided with remote control devices in bedrooms coast to coast. The Late Shift is the story of big corporations, big money, and big egos - and a cultural institution that shapes the American night.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=saRkAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Late+Shift:+Letterman,+Leno&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays And Aphorisms","description":"One of the greatest philosophers of the nineteenth century, Schopenhauer (1788-1860) believed that human action is determined not by reason but by 'will' - the blind and irrational desire for physical existence. This selection of his writings on religion, ethics, politics, women, suicide, books and many other themes is taken from Schopenhauer's last work, Parerga and Paralipomena, which he published in 1851. These pieces depict humanity as locked in a struggle beyond good and evil, and each individual absolutely free within a Godless world, in which art, morality and self-awareness are our only salvation. This innovative - and pessimistic - view has proved powerfully influential upon philosophy and art, directly affecting the work of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein and Wagner among others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EWt_5YLqHcAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pieced Roman Shades: Turn Your Favorite Quilt Patterns into Window Hangings","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 VBA Programmers Reference","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a62DswEACAAJ&dq=AutoCAD+2000+VBA+Programmers+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jesus","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Interpreting the Old Testament: A Guide for Exegesis","description":"A guide to essential aspects of Old Testament exegesis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9mBEc30dH7UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only Parent","description":"Trustworthy Stepfamily Expert Offers Single Parents a Guide to Dating Single parents who are dating or want to begin a dating relationship wonder, How will dating affect my children and my parenting?

The goal of ecumenism is to reverse the Protestant Reformation. In today's ecumenical world, Evangelicals need to understand what Catholicism is and how easily it mixes with non-Christian religions. That's why Catholic Concerns was written. Evangelical pastors are promoting Catholic mysticism and contemplative prayer. But where does it lead? At the end of this road, we find Catholic monks who want to be good Buddhists, and Catholic priests who act like gurus, wear orange robes, call Hindu temples a \\"sacrament,\\" and consider non-Christians to be their brothers and sisters in Christ.

This revised and extended second edition contains more discussions of US and international codes and the issues underlying their development. There is significant revision and expansion of the discussion on Monte Carlo simulation, along with more examples. The book serves as a textbook for a one-semester course for advanced undergraduates or graduate students, or as a reference and guide to consulting structural engineers. Its emphasis is on the practical applications of structural reliability theory rather than the theory itself. Consequently, probability theory is treated as a tool, and enough is given to show the novice reader how to calculate reliability. Some background in structural engineering and structural mechanics is assumed.

A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider+(&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Belgium of the Belgians","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mswAAAAIAAJ&dq=Belgium+of+the+Belgians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GOD and the Hillbilly","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Three Critics of the Enlightenment: Vico, Hamann, Herder","description":"Isaiah Berlin was deeply admired during his life, but his full contribution was perhaps underestimated because of his preference for the long essay form. The efforts of Henry Hardy to edit Berlin's work and reintroduce it to a broad, eager readership have gone far to remedy this. Now, Princeton is pleased to return to print, under one cover, Berlin's essays on these celebrated and captivating intellectual portraits: Vico, Hamann, and Herder. These essays on three relatively uncelebrated thinkers are not marginal ruminations, but rather among Berlin's most important studies in the history of ideas. They are integral to his central project: the critical recovery of the ideas of the Counter-Enlightenment and the explanation of its appeal and consequences--both positive and (often) tragic. Giambattista Vico was the anachronistic and impoverished Neapolitan philosopher sometimes credited with founding the human sciences. He opposed Enlightenment methods as cold and fallacious. J. G. Hamann was a pious, cranky dilettante in a peripheral German city. But he was brilliant enough to gain the audience of Kant, Goethe, and Moses Mendelssohn. In Hamann's chaotic and long-ignored writings, Berlin finds the first strong attack on Enlightenment rationalism and a wholly original source of the coming swell of romanticism. Johann Gottfried Herder, the progenitor of populism and European nationalism, rejected universalism and rationalism but championed cultural pluralism. Individually, these fascinating intellectual biographies reveal Berlin's own great intelligence, learning, and generosity, as well as the passionate genius of his subjects. Together, they constitute an arresting interpretation of romanticism's precursors. In Hamann's railings and the more considered writings of Vico and Herder, Berlin finds critics of the Enlightenment worthy of our careful attention. But he identifies much that is misguided in their rejection of universal values, rationalism, and science. With his customary emphasis on the frightening power of ideas, Berlin traces much of the next centuries' irrationalism and suffering to the historicism and particularism they advocated. What Berlin has to say about these long-dead thinkers--in appreciation and dissent--is remarkably timely in a day when Enlightenment beliefs are being challenged not just by academics but by politicians and by powerful nationalist and fundamentalist movements. The study of J. G. Hamann was originally published under the title The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism. The essays on Vico and Herder were originally published as Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas. Both are out of print. This new edition includes a number of previously uncollected pieces on Vico and Herder, two interesting passages excluded from the first edition of the essay on Hamann, and Berlin's thoughtful responses to two reviewers of that same edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GiYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Three+Critics+of+the+Enlightenment:+Vico,+Hamann,+Herder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collins Gem Beer Pb","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The history of England,: From the invasion of Julius Caesar to the revolution in 1688","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OlYVAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gila, river of the Southwest (Rivers of America)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Gregg Shorthand Dictionary Simplified","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jUYWAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herodotus Book I","description":"Recounts the causes and history of the wars between the Greek city-states and Persia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WrPxj8hk9OAC&dq=Herodotus+Book+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sell It Today, Sell It Now","description":"Sell it Today, Sell it Now is the authoritative resource by America's #1 sale trainer Tom Hopkins on closing sales in less steps.

Comparing the United States with other market democracies, and one American state with another, this book presents irrefutable evidence that inequality is a driver of poor health, social conflict, and violence. Pioneering social scientist Richard Wilkinson addresses the growing feeling so common in the United States that modern societies, despite their material success, are social failures. The Impact of Inequality explains why inequality has such devastating effects on the quality and length of our lives. Wilkinson shows that inequality leads to stress, which in turn creates sickness on the individual and mass level. As a consequence, society suffers widespread unhappiness and high levels of violence, depression, and mistrust across the social spectrum. With persuasive evidence and fascinating analysis, the diagnosis is clear: Social and political equality are essential to improving life for everyone. Wilkinson argues that even small reductions in inequality can make an important difference for, as this book explains, social relations are always built on material foundations.

Curtis Jadwin had to compete with other suitors to secure his wife s hand in marriage, but after a year of marital bliss, he finds himself captivated by another: the high-stakes competition at the Chicago Board of Trade. At first merely dabbling in wheat speculation, Jadwin soon becomes obsessed with making deals and the roaring excitement of the trading pit. In pursuit of ever greater wealth and power, Jadwin devotes his days and nights to the pit, recklessly gambling with the livelihoods of farmers he will never meet. Meanwhile, his wife is increasingly neglected and resorts to the companionship of a former suitor. But while his marriage is on the precipice of ruin, Jadwin is on the verge of his greatest win: cornering the wheat market. And while his play destroys the fortunes of many men, including his best friend, it is only when his own fortune crumbles that Jadwin will finally take stock of his life. The second standalone novel in Norris s planned Epic of the Wheat Trilogy, The Pit was published posthumously in 1902. A runaway bestseller and critical success, it was adapted into a Broadway play as well as the film A Corner in Wheat, directed by D. W. Griffith.

The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend a family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend a family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc a M rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master. Alternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pgPWOaOctq8C&dq=One+Hundred+Years+of+Solitude+%5BCliffs+Notes+Study%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Assessment Color Review of Avian Medicine (Sacr)","description":"This completely revamped second edition of Avian Medicine and Surgery includes over 260 all-new colour illustrated cases, with questions and answers fully exploring a breadth of diseases and disorders.

Born in Boston in the late 1920s and early 1930s, these men were the subjects of the classic study Unraveling Juvenile Delinquency by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck (1950). Updating their lives at the close of the twentieth century, and connecting their adult experiences to childhood, this book is arguably the longest longitudinal study of age, crime, and the life course to date. John Laub and Robert Sampson's long-term data, combined with in-depth interviews, defy the conventional wisdom that links individual traits such as poor verbal skills, limited self-control, and difficult temperament to long-term trajectories of offending. The authors reject the idea of categorizing offenders to reveal etiologies of offending--rather, they connect variability in behavior to social context. They find that men who desisted from crime were rooted in structural routines and had strong social ties to family and community. By uniting life-history narratives with rigorous data analysis, the authors shed new light on long-term trajectories of crime and current policies of crime control. Table of Contents: Acknowledgments 1. Diverging Pathways of Troubled Boys 2. Persistence or Desistance? 3. Explaining the Life Course of Crime 4. Finding the Men 5. Long-Term Trajectories of Crime 6. Why Some Offenders Stop 7. Why Some Offenders Persist 8. Zigzag Criminal Careers 9. Modeling Change in Crime 10. Rethinking Lives in and out of Crime Notes References Index The accounts of individuals are quite riveting, and the book can be recommended strongly purely for the stories provided about diverse lives. However, the book is much, much more than that in terms of the serious challenge that the authors' findings and ideas present to some of the leading contemporary theories of both crime and development. A highly original and scholarly contribution of the highest quality. --Sir Michael Rutter, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London ttitleShared Beginnings, Divergent Lives is an extraordinary work which shows the deep insights gained by studying the whole life course, beginning in childhood and ending in later life. With access to a rare data archive, the authors provide compelling evidence on the remarkably varied adult lives of teenage delinquents who grew up in low-income areas of Boston (born 1925-1935). The story behind these varied life paths and their consequences inspires fresh thinking about crime over the life course through models of life trajectories and vivid narratives that reveal the complexity of lives. --Glen H. Elder, Jr., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill This book redraws the landscape of developmental criminology that Laub and Sampson already have done so much to define, setting new standards and benchmarks along the way. The authors both provide new evidence for earlier conclusions and challenge prevailing assumptions and assertions, thereby reshaping the criminological research agenda for years to come. --John Hagan, Northwestern University","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yfFnbDg03_cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Eagle","description":"Best Books of the Month: Wall Street Journal, Kirkus Reviews From the Pulitzer Prizewinning author of The Gulf, a sweeping cultural and natural history of the bald eagle in America. The bald eagle is regal but fearless, a bird you re not inclined to argue with. For centuries, Americans have celebrated it as  majestic  and  noble,  yet savaged the living bird behind their national symbol as a malicious predator of livestock and, falsely, a snatcher of babies. Taking us from before the nation s founding through inconceivable resurgences of this enduring all-American species, Jack E. Davis contrasts the age when native peoples lived beside it peacefully with that when others, whether through hunting bounties or DDT pesticides, twice pushed Haliaeetus leucocephalus to the brink of extinction. Filled with spectacular stories of Founding Fathers, rapacious hunters, heroic bird rescuers, and the lives of bald eagles themselves monogamous creatures, considered among the animal world s finest parents The Bald Eagle is a much-awaited cultural and natural history that demonstrates how this bird s wondrous journey may provide inspiration today, as we grapple with environmental peril on a larger scale.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5EM3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook: America's Bestselling Step-by-Step Cookbook, with More Than 1,400 Recipes","description":"Carefully diagrammed recipes are presented together with information on cooking techniques, advice on microwave cooking, and a dictionary of herbs and spices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TucnTDr5qdAC&dq=The+Good+Housekeeping+Illustrated+Cookbook:+America%27s+Bestselling+Step-by-Step+Cookbook,+with+More+Than+1,400+Recipes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Disagree Without Being Disagreeable: Getting Your Point Across with the Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense","description":"As bestselling author Suzette Haden Elgin proves, you don't have to live your life on red alert.

Why would religious worshipers flog or crucify themselves, sleep on spikes, hang suspended by their flesh, or walk for miles through scorching deserts with bare and bloodied feet? In this insightful new book, Ariel Glucklich argues that the experience of ritual pain, far from being a form of a madness or superstition, contains a hidden rationality and can bring about a profound transformation of the consciousness and identity of the spiritual seeker. Steering a course between purely cultural and purely biological explanations, Glucklich approaches sacred pain from the perspective of the practitioner to fully examine the psychological and spiritual effects of self-hurting. He discusses the scientific understanding of pain, drawing on research in fields such as neuropsychology and neurology. He also ranges over a broad spectrum of historical and cultural contexts, showing the many ways mystics, saints, pilgrims, mourners, shamans, Taoists, Muslims, Hindus, Native Americans, and indeed members of virtually every religion have used pain to achieve a greater identification with God. He examines how pain has served as a punishment for sin, a cure for disease, a weapon against the body and its desires, or a means by which the ego may be transcended and spiritual sickness healed. \\"When pain transgresses the limits,\\" the Muslim mystic Mizra Asadullah Ghalib is quoted as saying, \\"it becomes medicine.\\" Based on extensive research and written with both empathy and critical insight, Sacred Pain explores the uncharted inner terrain of self-hurting and reveals how meaningful suffering has been used to heal the human spirit.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mxeWPr53730C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Filtering the News: Essays on Herman and Chomsky's Propaganda Model","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Nicholas Feast","description":"Glasgow 1492.

But now an internationally renowned sleep expert provides a middle-ground method that will have your child sleeping through the night at any age. Dr. Eduard Estivill s no-fail technique focuses on a mixture of authority, ritual, and reward. Parents can end negative cycles of resistance and wakefulness and feel as rested as their child will by following these expert tips: ? Adopt a firm and confident attitude (your child will pick up on your mood). ? Use meals as a cue to announce your child s next nap or nighttime sleep. ? Incorporate appropriate elements (such as a stuffed animal or a pacifier) at bedtime so your child will not rely on you as a vital part of the sleep process. ? Reinforce the contrast between light (day) and dark (night). ? Never punish children by making them go to bed (it sends the wrong message about sleep time). ?

An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stampin' Up!

One of the defining moments of world history had been brought about by a tiny number of people, including Jawaharlal Nehru, the fiery prime minister-to-be; Gandhi, the mystical figure who enthralled a nation; and Louis and Edwina Mountbatten, the glamorous but unlikely couple who had been dispatched to get Britain out of India without delay. Within hours of the midnight chimes, however, the two new nations of India and Pakistan would descend into anarchy and terror. INDIAN SUMMERdepicts the epic sweep of events that ripped apart the greatest empire the world has ever seen, and reveals the secrets of the most powerful players on the world stage: the Cold War conspiracies, the private deals, and the intense and clandestine love affair between the wife of the last viceroy and the first prime minister of free India.

Comprehensive, enlightening, and terrifyingly timely.  The New York Times Book Review (Editors' Choice) WINNER OF THE GOLDSMITH BOOK PRIZE ? SHORTLISTED FOR THE LIONEL GELBER PRIZE ? NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post ? Time ? Foreign Affairs ? WBUR ? Paste Donald Trump s presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought we d be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang in a revolution or military coup but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one. Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die and how ours can be saved. Praise for How Democracies Die  What we desperately need is a sober, dispassionate look at the current state of affairs. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, two of the most respected scholars in the field of democracy studies, offer just that.  The Washington Post  Where Levitsky and Ziblatt make their mark is in weaving together political science and historical analysis of both domestic and international democratic crises; in doing so, they expand the conversation beyond Trump and before him, to other countries and to the deep structure of American democracy and politics.  Ezra Klein, Vox  If you only read one book for the rest of the year, read How Democracies Die. . . .This is not a book for just Democrats or Republicans. It is a book for all Americans. It is nonpartisan. It is fact based. It is deeply rooted in history. . . . The best commentary on our politics, no contest.

After serving his country in World War II, Richard Dadier decides to become an English teacher and for the sin of wanting to make a difference, he s hired at North Manual Trades High School. A tough vocational school in the East Bronx, Manual Trades is home to angry, unruly teenagers exiled from New York City s regular public schools. On his first day, Dadier endures relentless mockery and ridicule and makes an enemy of the student body by rescuing a female colleague from a vicious attack. His fellow educators are bitter, disillusioned, and too afraid of their pupils to risk turning their backs on them in the classroom. But Dadier refuses to give up without a fight. Over the course of the semester, he tries again and again to break through the wall of hatred and scorn and win his students  respect. The more he learns about their difficult circumstances, the more convinced he becomes that a good teacher can make a difference in their lives. His idealism will be put to the ultimate test, however, when a long-simmering power struggle with his most intimidating student explodes into a violent schoolroom showdown. The basis for the blockbuster film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Evan Hunter s The Blackboard Jungle is a brutal, unflinching look at the dark side of American education and an early masterpiece from the author who went on to write the gritty 87th Precinct series as Ed McBain. Drawn from Hunter s own experiences as a New York City schoolteacher, it is a  nightmarish but authentic  drama that packs a knockout punch (Time).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0QzUDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mouse in the Matzah Factory","description":"Journey with a curious little mouse as he travels from a wheat field in the country to a big city factory where harvested wheat is baked into matzah.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y5-bAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Ploughmans Talk","description":"In 'John Ploughman's Talk' I have tried to talk for ploughmen and common people.

I'm not a good man, and I've never pretended to be. I don't believe in goodness or God or any happy ending that isn't paid for in advance. In fact, I've got my own personal holy trinity: in the name of money, sex, and Macallan 18, amen. So when the gorgeous, brilliant Zenny Iverson asks me to teach her about sex, I want to say yes, I really do. Unfortunately, there are several reasons to say no--reasons that even a very bad man like myself can't ignore. 1. She's my best friend's little sister. 2. She's too young for me. Like way too young. 3. She's a nun. Or about to be anyway. But I want her. I want her even with my best friend and God in the way, I want to teach her and touch her and love her, and I know that makes me something much worse than a very bad man. It makes me a sinner. And it's those very sins that are about to save me... ***Sinner is a standalone companion to Priest about Father Bell's brother Sean.

What strengths and weaknesses of analytical methods emerge in relation to strongly confessional philosophical theologies, or to Continental philosophies? Faith and Philosophical Analysis evaluates how well philosophy of religion serves in understanding religious faith. Figures who rarely share the space of the same book - leading exponents of analytic philosophy of religion and those who question its legacy - are drawn together in this book, with their disagreements harnessed to positive effect. Figures such as Richard Swinburne and Basil Mitchell reflect on their life-long projects from a perspective which has not previously been seen in print. A wide range of approaches found in contemporary philosophy of religion are explored, including: reformed epistemology, 'traditional' metaphysical theory building, feminist methodologies, Wittgensteinian approaches, and American pragmatism. Considering the trends in philosophy of religion as they are interacting across continents, looking particularly at philosophical influences in North America, Britain, and Continental Europe, this book will appeal to students, scholars and general readers with an interest in philosophy of religion, theology, or analytical philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pG2pDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And scatter the proud,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5SZfAAAACAAJ&dq=And+scatter+the+proud,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Computational Brain (Computational Neuroscience)","description":"An anniversary edition of the classic work that influenced a generation of neuroscientists and cognitive neuroscientists. Before The Computational Brain was published in 1992, conceptual frameworks for brain function were based on the behavior of single neurons, applied globally. In The Computational Brain, Patricia Churchland and Terrence Sejnowski developed a different conceptual framework, based on large populations of neurons. They did this by showing that patterns of activities among the units in trained artificial neural network models had properties that resembled those recorded from populations of neurons recorded one at a time. It is one of the first books to bring together computational concepts and behavioral data within a neurobiological framework. Aimed at a broad audience of neuroscientists, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and philosophers, The Computational Brain is written for both expert and novice. This anniversary edition offers a new preface by the authors that puts the book in the context of current research. This approach influenced a generation of researchers. Even today, when neuroscientists can routinely record from hundreds of neurons using optics rather than electricity, and the 2013 White House BRAIN initiative heralded a new era in innovative neurotechnologies, the main message of The Computational Brain is still relevant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z4pfDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Computational+Brain+(Computational+Neuroscience)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart of Karate-Do","description":"Instructions and photographs clarify the ancient martial art's fundamental stances and techniques as means to achieving flexibility, strength, coordination, and agility of body and mind","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=058TAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Heart+of+Karate-Do&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under Drake's flag: A tale of the Spanish Main","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9C8DAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GIs and Fruleins: The German-American Encounter in 1950s West Germany","description":"With the outbreak of the Korean War, the poor, rural West German state of Rhineland-Palatinate became home to some of the largest American military installations outside the United States. In GIs and Frauleins, Maria Hohn offers a rich social history of this German-American encounter and provides new insights into how West Germans negotiated their transition from National Socialism to a consumer democracy during the 1950s. Focusing on the conservative reaction to the American military presence, Hohn shows that Germany's Christian Democrats, though eager to be allied politically and militarily with the United States, were appalled by the apparent Americanization of daily life and the decline in morality that accompanied the troops to the provinces. Conservatives condemned the jazz clubs and striptease parlors that Holocaust survivors from Eastern Europe opened to cater to the troops, and they expressed scorn toward the German women who eagerly pursued white and black American GIs. While most Germans rejected the conservative effort to punish as prostitutes all women who associated with American GIs, they vilified the sexual relationships between African American men and German women. Hohn demonstrates that German anxieties over widespread Americanization were always debates about proper gender norms and racial boundaries, and that while the American military brought democracy with them to Germany, it also brought Jim Crow.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FYxGDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE FERN GUIDE - Northeastern and Midland United States and Adjacent Canada","description":"A complete and authoritative guide to the ferns of the Northeast and Midwestern United States and adjacent Canadian regions, this reference describes and illustrates 135 varieties.

Key features include: Treatment Orientation Although some chapters include a discussion of theoretical issues, the primary emphasis is on intervention techniques and strategies for changing various behavior and learning problems. Case examples are often used to illustrate treatment procedures. Empirical Orientation While most authors have adopted a broad-based behavioral or cognitive-behavioral orientation, they were encouraged to review the entire treatment literature and to construct their presentations on the basis of empirically supported treatment techniques and procedures. Psychopharmacotherapy Chapter The chapter on child and adolescent psychopharmacotherapy focuses on psychopharmacological interventions rather than on which drugs should be prescribed for specific behavior or learning problems.

Many of the problems of post-communist Russia-including the heated debates about the best way forward, which eventually resulted in virtual stalemate and stalled reforms, and the various ramifications of the near-absence of the bourgeoisie, including the rise of corruption, of the so-called oligarchs, and of nomenklatura privatization-can ultimately be traced back to the seriously distorting effects of the logic of communist economics in Russia.

Today, the demand for faster approaches is increasing across a broad spectrum of organizations in business and society, as they are faced daily with an array of change mandates-new business strategy development and deployment, merger and acquisition integration, work re-design, community organizing, and more. Traditional command and control structures and processes no longer enable and mobilize people in organizations-the rapid rate of change in the environment demands new and different ways for organizations to respond. Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations combines systems theory and practical methodology to offer a proven, flexible approach that leads to aligned action by hundreds, even thousands of people-and creates powerful processes for change. Shattering the old paradigm about how long it takes organizations to change, the book shows how to rapidly engage the whole system in meeting organizational agility and flexibility demands. It offers adaptable, repeatable strategies for different settings and convening issues through the authors' unique Whole-Scale approach-which has been successfully applied in diverse businesses and industries, the service sector, health care, education, government, other nonprofits, and communities throughout the world. Imagine everyone in your organization pulling in the same direction, everyone with the same information, acting quickly to solve the problems and confront the issues facing your organization. Whole-Scale Change provides not only the theories and principles underlying the approach, but also the practical methods, tools, and road maps for unleashing the energy and combining the power and wisdom of all the people in an organization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eNOl4NO7GMgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Red Hat Linux 9","description":"Your Complete Guide to the World's Leading Linux Distribution Whether you depend on Linux as a server or desktop OS, Mastering Red Hat Linux 9 gives you the practical information you need to install, configure, and administer the latest version of Red Hat's operating system to suit your specific computing needs.

King, Carole Nelson Douglas gave readers a compelling look into Victoriana with a bold new detective character: Irene Adler, the only woman to ever outwit Sherlock Holmes. An operatic diva and the intellectual equal of most of the men she encounters, Irene is as much at home with disguises and a revolver as with high society and haute couture. Chapel Noir is the fifth book in Carole Nelson Douglas's critically acclaimed Irene Adler series, which reinvents \\"the woman\\" that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle introduced in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" as the heroine of her own extravagant adventures. This time readers are thrust into one of the darkest periods of criminal fact and fiction when two courtesans are found brutally slaughtered in the lavish boudoir of a Paris house. No woman should ever see such horrors, authorities declare, but a powerful sponsor has insisted that Irene investigate the case, along with her faithful companion, sheltered parson's daughter Penelope Huxleigh. But does anyone really seek the truth, or do they wish only to bury it with the dead women--for there is a worse horror that will draw Irene and her archrival, Sherlock Holmes, into a duel of wits with a fiendish opponent. These Paris killings mimic a series of gruesome murders that terrorized London only months before, in a dangerous and disreputable part of town known as Whitechapel . . .

SOMEWHERE IN THE HEART OF LEGEND LIES THE KEY TO HER TERRIFYING DREAMS The charm of spending the Christmas holidays in South Wales, with its crumbling castles and ancient myths, seems the perfect distraction from the nightmares that have plagued literary agent Lyn Ravenshaw since the loss of her baby five years ago. Instead, she meets an emotionally fragile young widow who's convinced that Lyn's recurring dreams have drawn her to Castle Farm for an important purpose--and she's running out of time. With the help of a reclusive, brooding playwright, Lyn begins to untangle the mystery and is pulled into a world of Celtic legends, dangerous prophecies, and a child destined for greatness.

When in fact, it was the preeminent massage parlor in the area-some would say in the country. Life as a massage parlor operator, to say the least, was good. Golden had all the money he cared to spend. If he wanted to buy a new car, he took cash and drove it off the lot. If he wanted to spend a weekend gambling in Atlantic City or Vegas, he simply made a call, making full use of casino limos and first-class airfare. And then, of course, there were the Odyssey girls. Golden was surrounded by beautiful women of every hair and skin color: a veritable cornucopia of potential pleasures, with most willing to do the boss a favor-or just do the boss. For a decade and a half, Golden only had to go to work to get lucky. Of course, everything changed one fateful day when the Odyssey was busted, and a two-year battle with a vindictive legal system began.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B5PJswEACAAJ&dq=Massage+Parlor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CliffsNotes Mythology","description":"The original CliffsNotes study guides offer expert commentary on major themes, plots, characters, literary devices, and historical background.

A novel.","description":"'Whenever two Russians come together, the shadow of autocracy is with them...haunting the secret of their silences.' First published in 1911, Under Western Eyes traces the experiences of Razumov, a young Russian student of philosophy who is uninvolved in politics or protest. Against his will he finds himself caught up in the aftermath of a terrorist bombing directed against the Tsarist authorities. He is pulled in different directions - by his conscience and his ambitions, by powerful opposed political forces, but most of all by personal emotions he is unable to suppress. Set in St Petersburg and Geneva, the novel is in part a critical response to Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment but it is also a startlingly modern book. Viewed through the 'Western eyes' of Conrad's English narrator, Razumov's story forces the reader to confront the same moral issues: the defensibility of terrorist resistance to tyranny, the loss of individual privacy in a surveillance society, and the demands thrown up by the interplay of power and knowledge. This new edition is based on the first English edition text, and has a new chronology and bibliography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2dDC0PsJ8QAC&dq=Under+western+eyes.+A+novel.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curriculum Content for Students with Moderate and Severe Disabilities in Inclusive Settings","description":"Focusing on key concepts and themes important to readers learning managerial accounting, this text is part of a flexible learning system designed to enhance the understanding of managerial accounting.

Economists call matchmakers multisided platforms because they provide physical or virtual platforms for multiple groups to get together. Dating sites connect people with potential matches, for example, and ride-sharing apps do the same for drivers and riders. Although matchmakers have been around for millennia, they re becoming more and more popular and profitable due to dramatic advances in technology, and a lot of companies that have managed to crack the code of this business model have become today s power brokers. Don t let the flashy successes fool you, though. Starting a matchmaker is one of the toughest business challenges, and almost everyone who tries to build one, fails. In Matchmakers, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, two economists who were among the first to analyze multisided platforms and discover their principles, and who ve consulted for some of the most successful platform businesses in the world, explain how matchmakers work best in practice, why they do what they do, and how entrepreneurs can improve their chances for success. Whether you re an entrepreneur, an investor, a consumer, or an executive, your future will involve more and more multisided platforms, and Matchmakers rich with stories from platform winners and losers is the one book you ll need in order to navigate this appealing but confusing world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIhZCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Her Here","description":"This is my collection of poems so far.

I tend to put the titles at the bottom so there won't be any bias in the reading.

Its scope is broad, encompassing political, economic, military, and cultural history, and drawing upon Chinese and Japanese sources untapped by Western scholars. The book presents new information on a wide range of topics: the impact of Western ideas on women, especially in education; the importance of women in the labor force; the relative independence enjoyed by some women textile workers; the struggle against footbinding; the influence of anarchism; the participation of a women's brigade in the Revolution of 1911; the role of women in the May Fourth Movement; the differences between the more assertive women of South China and the 'traditional' women of the North in organizing for political action; the involvement of peasant women in insurgency and anti-Japanese struggles in the countryside; and the effects of the Marriage Law of 1950.

Lukien, the Bronze Knight of Liiria, had been taken in by the royal family when, at fourteen, he saved Akeela's life, but he'd never forgotten the brutal lessons of the streets he'd grown up on. A bond of loyalty stronger than blood linked these two men but no two souls could be more different. And as Akeela and Lukien entered their enemy's stronghold on a mission of peace, neither man could forsee the turmoil this historic mission would wreak on their lives. For, to seal the peace, King Karis of Reec would bestow upon Akeela the hand of his charming, beautiful, and accomplished daughter Cassandra. But Cassandra hid a terrible secret. She was experiencing the first symptoms of a disease which would threaten her life and cause unimaginable strife for all who loved her. For Akeela and Lukien, the quest for Cassandra's salvation would overwhelm every bond of loyalty, every point of honor, every dream of peace. For only the magical amulets known as the Eyes of God could halt the progress of Cassandra's illness. But the Eyes of God would also open the way to a magical stronghold which could tear their world apart and redefine the very nature of their reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Z0jUqzpxpB0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The case of the daring decoy (Pocket book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-1zZugAACAAJ&dq=The+case+of+the+daring+decoy+(Pocket+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motor Auto Body Repair","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5-Qu6GW6w38C&dq=Motor+Auto+Body+Repair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Court of the Lion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L3XNzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Court+of+the+Lion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam a Challenge to Faith","description":"This detailed guide to Islam was meant to assist Christian missionaries achieve their ends with Muslim communities around the world.

Some five weeks after the survivors from the Titanic landed in New York, I was the guest at luncheon of Hon. Samuel J. Elder and Hon. Charles T. Gallagher, both well-known lawyers in Boston. After luncheon I was asked to relate to those present the experiences of the survivors in leaving the Titanic and reaching the Carpathia. When I had done so, Mr. Robert Lincoln O'Brien, the editor of the Boston Herald, urged me as a matter of public interest to write a correct history of the Titanic disaster, his reason being that he knew several publications were in preparation by people who had not been present at the disaster, but from newspaper accounts were piecing together a description of it. He said that these publications would probably be erroneous, full of highly coloured details, and generally calculated to disturb public thought on the matter. He was supported in his request by all present, and under this general pressure I accompanied him to Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company, where we discussed the question of publication. Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company took at that time exactly the same view that I did, that it was probably not advisable to put on record the Loss of the SS. Titanic, by Lawrence Beesle 4 incidents connected with the Titanic's sinking: it seemed better to forget details as rapidly as possible. However, we decided to take a few days to think about it. At our next meeting we found ourselves in agreement again, --but this time on the common ground that it would probably be a wise thing to write a history of the Titanic disaster as correctly as possible. I was supported in this decision by the fact that a short account, which I wrote at intervals on board the Carpathia, in the hope that it would calm public opinion by stating the truth of what happened as nearly as I could recollect it, appeared in all the American, English, and Colonial papers and had exactly the effect it was i","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=upe_4mTcxhQC&dq=The+Loss+of+the+S.S.+Titanic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"House Beautiful Paint","description":"Offers almost five hundred paint colors for interior design, featuring personal insights from top interior designers on their favorite hues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cG4UngEACAAJ&dq=House+Beautiful+Paint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wisdom of Jesus: His Life and Teachings in Calligraphy and Illustration","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Wings and Tails and Dragon Scales (Super Coloring Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mqf7PQAACAAJ&dq=Wings+and+Tails+and+Dragon+Scales+(Super+Coloring+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild And Willing (Triplet Brides) (Harlequin Presents)","description":"Eminent doctor Adam Deacon had his life neatly planned: a high-flying career and a suitable bride!

Bonnie Wilder has lived here, on Blackberry Corner, all her life, and would be content but for her deep desire to have a child. She and her husband Naz cannot conceive, and he refuses to adopt. Even the support of her outrageous best friend Thora to whom Bonnie tells everything can  t help fill the emptiness inside her. Then Naz finds a blanketed infant on the banks of Canaan Creek, and suddenly Bonnie s life is transformed. She has found her calling. Together with Thora and the rest of the hilarious, tough, and all-too-human women from her church group, Bonnie creates an underground railroad for unwanted babies. But one of these precious gifts will come back to haunt her: a deception begun in good faith comes full circle, ultimately forcing Bonnie to find the courage to confront a difficult truth at the center of her own life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6daKDQAAQBAJ&dq=Sisterhood+of+Blackberry+Corner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tom Clancy's Op-Center: Mission of Honor","description":"More information to be announced soon on this forthcoming title from Penguin USA","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a3kF3ax9QqkC&dq=Tom+Clancy%27s+Op-Center:+Mission+of+Honor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tess of the d'Urbervilles (Cambridge Literature)","description":"The life of a simple country girl in nineteenth-century England is destroyed by her father's determination to use her in order to regain the family's former social standing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8mp3PwAACAAJ&dq=Tess+of+the+d%27Urbervilles+(Cambridge+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cast of Killers (Signet)","description":"Somebody in Washington is updating Shakespeare.

Authority averse, Putnam gives the cops only bare bones information -- but he tells Margaret \\"Sweetie\\" Sweeney that he thinks he will be the next victim.The reason, he explains, is quite simple. There are two plans afoot to seize control of the federal government. At the center of one plan is the speaker of the House of Representatives.

Told by both Gilliam and McCabe, who provides an on-set diary, this unique account reveals exactly how a film is made - or ruined - in today's Hollywood system. THE BROTHERS GRIMM is Terry Gilliam's film for autumn 2005. After two years of pre-production hell, the film was finally greenlit in March 2003 by Miramax's Dimension Films with a budget bigger than anything Gilliam has ever had to work with - on condition that the film was fast-tracked for a 2004 release. With stars Matt Damon and Heath Ledger playing the brothers Jake and Will, and co-starring Jonathan Pryce, hero from Gilliam's seminal BRAZIL, this movie is hailed as an \\"Indiana Jones and the Brothers Grimm\\"-style adventure, in which two Middle-Ages conmen who travel the countryside inventing horrendous ghost stories, only so they can claim to have defeated evil and be showered with gifts and women, finally encounter a real magical curse and are forced to find the courage to do a proper day's work of evil-vanquishing. Drawing upon numerous crewmember's diaries and candid, outspoken interviews with Terry Gilliam and the stars as the basis for this book, author Bob McCabe follows Gilliam through the pre-production battle of wills between director and producers, the nightmares of filming without budget, equipment or even cast, and the anarchy and brinkmanship of post-production inevitable in a Gilliam film. He seeks to unravel the truth buried between the lines, and reveals exactly how a film is made - or ruined - in today's Hollywood system. Guaranteed to fascinate film buffs and Terry Gilliam fans alike - already intrigued after the collapse of his Don Quixote movie formed the basis of a captivating documentary film - this amusing chronicle will be an unputdownable read and should put anyone who has aspired to direct a film in the future completely off the idea!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3u8cAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dreams+and+Nightmares:+Terry+Gilliam,+The+Brothers+Grimm,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kathy Ireland Total Fitness Workout","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bring 'Em Back Alive: The Best of Frank Buck","description":"The intrepid Texas jungle adventurer Frank Buck spent his life capturing alive every kind of animal, and enthralled generations of readers with the stories of danger and daring collected here.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNnhbq9gwTUC&dq=Bring+%27Em+Back+Alive:+The+Best+of+Frank+Buck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Private Soldier Under Washington","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0FxVcAAACAAJ&dq=The+Private+Soldier+Under+Washington&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Share of Honour (Charnwood Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0CngAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Share+of+Honour+(Charnwood+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unfolding Tradition: Jewish Law After Sinai","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DiKOjgEACAAJ&dq=The+Unfolding+Tradition:+Jewish+Law+After+Sinai&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management Teams","description":"Meredith Belbin's work on teams has become part of everyday language in organizations all over the world.

Morris will delight you, guide and inspire you, challenge and encourage you, and improve your chances of reaching the ultimate goal of every children's book author: your reader inside your story and your story inside your reader. A published author of both fiction and nonfiction for children, Morris draws on extensive experience teaching children how to write and teaching adults how to write for children. Here she combines concrete methods and step-by-step techniques with succinct rules of thumb: work at making your novel whole from the start; never underestimate the power of the plain truth; personality quirks are no substitute for character; doing a good job of writing usually means doing a good job of rewriting. Using judiciously chosen examples from successful children's literature, Writing Fiction for Children covers the building blocks of plot, characters, and setting and addresses common problems such as awkward plotting, oversimplifying, and taking a preachy or self-conscious tone. Pragmatic exercises stimulate writers to scour their experiences, sharpen their powers of observation, and capture the details, voice, and narrative energy that can bring stories vividly to life and keep readers submerged in make-believe. Loaded with practical advice and helpful exercises, Writing Fiction for Children is especially useful for anyone who aspires to write for children in the \\"middle ages\\" of eight to twelve. Children's books should be hopeful, thrilling, funny, interesting, touching, and a pleasure to read, Morris says. Above all, they must have something at stake that matters.

Written by the doyenne of Franklin scholars, it conveys Franklin's humor, resiliency, courage, and intelligence, and his faith in a better future. The selections are based on Claude-Anne Lopez's research in the treasure trove of nearly thirty thousand documents on Franklin assembled at Yale University. They include a detailed refutation of an anti-Semitic forgery attributed to Franklin and currently circulating on the Internet; three mini-detective stories showing Franklin on the fringes of the espionage world; discussions of Franklin's efforts to outfit Washington's army and to choose the first dinner set for the Foreign Service; and the tale of the misadventures of a French utopian scheme he sponsored. The only piece of fiction in the book is an imaginary party during which, on the first anniversary of his death, six illustrious Frenchmen discuss Franklin's influence on their country. Lopez has provided brief personal introductions to each of the pieces, giving her reasons for writing them and in the process threading the essays together.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y25u-9K4y4IC&dq=My+Life+with+Benjamin+Franklin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eppie: The Story of Ann Landers","description":"This candid profile of the syndicated columnist describes the course of her successful career, her feud with twin Abigail van Buren, and the breakup of her marriage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f_4_Nbx5CjoC&dq=Eppie:+The+Story+of+Ann+Landers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of German Business Management","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Naked Flame (Black Lace)","description":"Venetia Halliday is a go-getting entrepreneur who's trying to make it in London's fiercely competitive restaurant business.

Herein lies some of the most superb classical poetry produced within the last half century, a testament to the superlative skill, intuition, and brilliance of the author. Seldom will one find such high calibre writing, particularly from the ranks of contemporary writers. Reminiscent of the gothic imagery of Edgar Allen Poe, this poet entwines classical style and mythological references with truly inspirational sentiment and theology. In the epic poem, The Serpents Left Hand, one is truly horrified by the imagery of Hell, and yet, equally inspired by the sublime grandeur of Heaven. Concurrently, the lasting metaphors presented in The Siege at Caerphilly demonstrate the heights and depths of which the human spirit is capable. Obligatory reading for any individual who might truly understand the nature of man. - United Kingdom In a beautifully lyrical collection of verse, W. B. Baker explores an extensive diversity of literary motifs. The poet uses syntax and rhythm to powerful effect, conveying emotion through the musicality of language whose enduring imagery lingers in the mind long after reading. With masterful ease, each succeeding composition sweeps the reader into an exhilaration of ascending and descending emotional environments; from the indiscriminate carnage and utter futility of warfare in The Siege at Caerphilly, to passionate sentiments of love in Sonnets for Elisa, to a sinister, disturbingly vivid conception of Hell in The Serpents Left Hand. Particularly memorable are the scenes of slaughter and bloodshed, which perhaps support the Aristotelian perception that what is best in literature often springs from what is worst in life. Beautiful writing and moving sentiments, whose affecting and enduring images appeal to the most majestic and basest nature of us all. - New Millennium Publishing London, England Throughout this slender yet profound volume of verse, the author presents shimmering vignettes of heroic and mundane motifs, transmogrified by the lyrical language of bard and poet. Syntax and rhythm combine to convey impressionist harmony in a palate of emotions that range from indiscriminate war carnage to sentimental love sonnets, and from the vivid flashing of hell to sublime familial bonds. Enduring imagery undergirds each succeeding work as the authors skill and art speak to our emotions. In a style that draws from the full, rich well of old language, the poet conveys us into a world that appears, at first, to be but half remembered. The beauty of the writing and the depth of the emotion open a landscape that continues to uphold us even at the dawn of this new millennium. We stop, think, and indeed do fully remember that these enduring images come from the human soul. - Dr. Daniel P. Larson, Vice President MVCC/State University Of New York While each poem or component of prose contained within the volume considers a modified facet of the human experience, the author devotes particular emphasis to the expression of the readers realisation of truth rather than simply the poets interpretation of emotional or historical fact. A Solitary Frost is an eclectic compilation of two significant works, The Siege at Caerphilly and The Serpents Left Hand, along with several abbreviated selections of diverse character. The predominant motifs of human integrity, character, and personal morality are appraised in disparate treatments throughout the volume. The Siege at Caerphilly is based on an actual battle which occurred in 1316 between the English Marcher Lord, Gilbert de Claire, designated as the Lord of Glamorgan by the English monarchy, and the forc","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f98kU8ps4rkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town","description":"Everywhere hailed for its quirkiness, its hilarity, its charm, Pasquale's Nose tells the story of a New York City lawyer who runs away to a small Etruscan village with his wife and new baby, and discovers a community of true eccentrics -- warring bean growers, vanishing philosophers, a blind bootmaker, a porcupine hunter -- among whom he feels unexpectedly at home.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LskzjjJz4qYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising Strong Daughters","description":"Steve Biddulph s Raising Boys was a global phenomenon.

Where can one go for help with these very personal problems? What is required, particularly on the part of the man or woman who has been concerned with doing things rather than with talking about them, would seem to be neither an elaborate survey of formal usage nor yet a discussion of the fine points of an expert's play - the preparation of elaborate addresses, or the mysteries of \\"high-pressure salesmanship\\" - but a plain account of how to make the best use of resources which we all possess in situations which we all experience. That is, substantially, what this book offers. It seeks to show the reader how to make an analysis of the conditions of the type of public address in which practically everyone today has to participate, and of conversation as well; to give him a clear statement of what is expected of him, according to current standards of good form; and to suggest practical methods for improving his \\"technique,\\" at a minimum cost in effort and time. The chapters are the outgrowth of many years' experience in helping individuals to work out their own problems of communication - students in school and college, salesmen, executives in different lines of business and professional activity, women's clubs, social and fraternal organizations. Good talking is the result of sound thought and energetic purpose utilizing the principles of clear and tactful statement to meet the situation of the moment. All of us talk well now and then, when we are at our best. About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

From the time of the Greeks and the Persians clashing in the Mediterranean, sea power has determined world power. To an extent that is often underappreciated, it still does. No one understands this better than Admiral Jim Stavridis. In Sea Power, Admiral Stavridis takes us with him on a tour of the world s oceans from the admiral s chair, showing us how the geography of the oceans has shaped the destiny of nations, and how naval power has in a real sense made the world we live in today, and will shape the world we live in tomorrow. Not least, Sea Power is marvelous naval history, giving us fresh insight into great naval engagements from the battles of Salamis and Lepanto through to Trafalgar, the Battle of the Atlantic, and submarine conflicts of the Cold War. It is also a keen-eyed reckoning with the likely sites of our next major naval conflicts, particularly the Arctic Ocean, Eastern Mediterranean, and the South China Sea. Finally, Sea Power steps back to take a holistic view of the plagues to our oceans that are best seen that way, from piracy to pollution. When most of us look at a globe, we focus on the shape of the of the seven continents. Admiral Stavridis sees the shapes of the seven seas. After reading Sea Power, you will too. Not since Alfred Thayer Mahan s legendary The Influence of Sea Power upon History have we had such a powerful reckoning with this vital subject.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A-YZDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass: An American Slave (Cliffs Notes)","description":"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass First published in 1845, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is an eye-opening depiction of American slavery.

Managing Digital Resources in Libraries is a practical guide to managing library materials in digital formats. Working librarians share their expertise in the acquisition and management of digital resources, addressing questions of licensing, funding, and providing access. The contributors also examine innovative projects and systems, such as the integration of PDA-accessible resources into a library collection and the development of all-digital libraries. You'll also find supplementary reading lists and bibliographies of additional resources, including relevant Web sites. Addressing the challenges of and barriers to the preservation and dissemination of electronic information, Managing Digital Resources in Libraries explores vital questions, such as: How are librarians coping with digital resources? How do they compare and select titles and formats to purchase? How do they allocate limited funds to lease or to purchase high-priced electronic titles? Does consortium membership provide the answer to funding problems, or does it force librarians to pay for content their users neither want nor need? Is MARC still an appropriate format for cataloging? How can librarians make themselves familiar with the multitude of available resources? Managing Digital Resources in Libraries will update your working knowledge of: online resources open archives their uses and their history the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the First Sale Doctrine, and the Fair Use Doctrine and their implications for librarians e-journal cataloging and e-journal management software electronic collection development and management personal digital assistants digital licensing agreements electronic searching systems, including ELIN@, Electronic Journal Finder, Pirate Source, OPAC, and cold fusion databases","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nYmOpsAcUc0C&dq=Managing+the+Digital+Library&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against All Odds: &#34;Lord, I've Ruined My Life. I'm Yours, If You Still Want Me.&#34; (International Adventures)","description":"**The instant New York Times bestseller** The untold story of four of the most decorated soldiers of World War II all Medal of Honor recipients from the beaches of French Morocco to Hitler s own mountaintop fortress, by the national bestselling author of The First Wave  Pitch-perfect.  The Wall Street Journal ?  Riveting.  World War II magazine ?  Alex Kershaw is the master of putting the reader in the heat of the action.  Martin Dugard As the Allies raced to defeat Hitler, four men, all in the same unit, earned medal after medal for battlefield heroism. Maurice  Footsie  Britt, a former professional football player, became the very first American to receive every award for valor in a single war. Michael Daly was a West Point dropout who risked his neck over and over to keep his men alive. Keith Ware would one day become the first and only draftee in history to attain the rank of general before serving in Vietnam. In WWII, Ware owed his life to the finest soldier he ever commanded, a baby-faced Texan named Audie Murphy. In the campaign to liberate Europe, each would gain the ultimate accolade, the Congressional Medal of Honor. Tapping into personal interviews and a wealth of primary source material, Alex Kershaw has delivered his most gripping account yet of American courage, spanning more than six hundred days of increasingly merciless combat, from the deserts of North Africa to the dark heart of Nazi Germany. Once the guns fell silent, these four exceptional warriors would discover just how heavy the Medal of Honor could be and how great the expectations associated with it. Having survived against all odds, who among them would finally find peace?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bhU3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Krell, John C.

Rather than establishing hard-and-fast rules, they provide guidelines for actions in combat, concentrating on mission orders, the focus of effort, and the search for the enemy's surface and gaps (strengths and weaknesses). The three manuals are complemented by b. Col. H. T. Hayden's new material, which sets the theory and practice of Marine Corps doctrine in its historical perspective, looks to the future of maneuver warfare, and comments on the text of the manuals.

Rogers surmised that a large percentage of ethnic differences are the result of sociological factors and in these volumes he gathered what he called  the bran of history  the uncollected, unexamined history of black people in the hope that these neglected parts of history would become part of the mainstream body of Western history. Drawing on a vast amount of research, Rogers was attempting to point out the absurdity of racial divisions. Indeed his belief in one race humanity precluded the idea of several different ethnic races. The series marshals the data he had collected as evidence to prove his underlying humanistic thesis: that people were one large family without racial boundaries. Self-trained and self-published, Rogers and his work were immensely popular and influential during his day, even cited by Malcolm X. The books are presented here in their original editions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lSwIBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Christian rhetoric (The New Testament library)","description":"An illuminating New Testament study depicts the power and beauty of language that speaks with the words of God and man.

In Tesla: Man Out of Time, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties. From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live. Tesla: Man Out of Time is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La\\\\Psychanalyse du Feu","description":"Autoddidacte adopt  par la Sorbonne, Bachelard fait songer   un faune r veur et barbu invit  au banquet des philosophes, De quel bois se chauffent les po tes ?

Dr Garth-Lewis argues differently. She addresses the need for a return to the indeterminate sentencing policy and the parole plan for all convicted felons, as well as the ex-offender's responsibility as a contributor to his/her community. Unfortunately, the government-operated prison work programs do not always adequately prepare convicts for the demands of the job market once they leave prison. During the 1990s, guided by research, conversations with advocates for prison industries, victims, and inmates, Dr. Garth-Lewis explored the factors that make ex-felons' success on parole so difficult to achieve. Her work adds to the discourse about how to return producers rather than predators back to the community.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uaVKjwEACAAJ&dq=How+PIE+Turns+Predators+into+Producers:+The+World+of+Private+Prison+Industries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stronghold Crusader Official Strategy Guide","description":"BradyGames Stronghold Crusader Official Strategy Guide provides complete coverage of the four campaigns.

How he managed it was something of a puzzle, for he never had painting lessons, his drawing was often wildly inaccurate, and, while his perception of a Tree Personality was true and vivid, his rendering of it might almost approach the ludicrous.

When one of them kills himself the night after a long talk with Joanne, she is pushed into investigating just what her neighbours are involved with, an investigation that has startling  and fatal  consequences. Bowen s depiction of this community of lawyers, each in his or her way now divorced from the ideals of justice and mercy that once motivated them all, is both compassionate and hard-nosed. There is Zack, the charming but controlling paraplegic; Blake and Lily, whose daughter, Gracie, struggles to keep her dignity as her parents  marriage falls apart; Noah, who would rather practise carpentry than the law, and his wife, Delia, who is consumed by worry about the firm. The mounting stress among these lawyers is palpable as Joanne delves into their lives. And Joanne faces her own personal anxieties too when she discovers that her former lover, Inspector Alex Kequahtooway, is mixed up in what seems to be some very sordid legal business.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oJiK0yLM2bwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry","description":"\\"Wise words from a wise man.\\" -- Wall Street Journal\\"McHugh is one of the best and most original writers in psychiatry or psychology.

Against the night sky, all I could see was the crumbling walls that were nothing more than a ghostly silhouette of some previous grand existence. The evening summer breeze whistled through the trees bringing with it the laughter of children who once lived there and the caring call of a mother letting them know dinner was ready. This novel has been in the works since its beginning in 2005 when a century and half old colonial style home was restored by the author and his wife, Barbara. For over twelve months, the house did an amazing transformation, the third time since its original construction in 1845. The first time it was restored was 1861. The second time in 1932 and the last time in 2005. Although a work of fiction, the story was inspired by actual events that will raise the hair on the back of the reader's neck. What happened to the woman who disappeared overnight? Stand and watch a paint lid as the name \\"Annie\\" is written in cursive in the wet paint right before your eyes. Or, listen to the heavy footsteps of a construction worker on the roof in the middle of the night? Smell cherry tobacco smoke in the hallways when no one is around? What lies under the white limestone rock in the rose garden, other than dirt? We don't wish to spoil the suspense by telling what all the events were that inspired James into writing this story, but we will tell you a bit about the story. In THIS OLD HOUSE, James creates a historical mystery set in the small town of Eagle Lake, Texas, only an hour drive to the southwest of Houston in the late 18th century. Visiting the old house or what was called the Smithson's Inn named after Wm. T. M. Smithson, who moved there from Weimar Texas in 1854. Visiting the well known Inn are a number of Americans, French aristocrats, and a couple who earlier in the day married in Stafford's Point near Rosenburg, Texas, Mister Johnathan Thompson, and the former Miss Rebecca Davison. When they arrived, they insisted on staying on the first floor and were given an old room that was once a parlor converted into a bedroom. Annie Smithson, the proprietor of the Inn and daughter of Wm. Smithson, became involved when there was a murder, but the body disappeared and was nowhere to be found until sixteen years later. The story evolves into one of hidden passages, murder, deception, and general chicanery ensues. Although most of the old homes built in the mid-1800s in this small community have been destroyed, this home still stands, and the part of the house removed from it still stands on the adjacent lot next door, which by the way was the kitchen at one time. Again, this is a story of fiction for entertainment purposes. But, haunting events did occur in this home that inspired the author to write this story!

Both descriptions are accurate - and therein lies the money magic. A CRT is just the thing for a person who wants to avoid capital gains taxes on appreciated property, in pursuit of increased retirement income or seeking estate tax relief. But this trust is also the perfect vehicle to achieve your personal philanthropic goals, while also helping yourself and your family. In fact, while tax savings and income enhancement are central attractions of the CRT, the chief motivation should be the settlor/ donor's charitable intentions. After all, when the final distribution of trust assets is made - and they can have considerable value - the charity of your choice will be the major beneficiary. In the meantime, there is no reason why the objects of your generosity cannot reward their benefactor with a seat on your church board of trustees, or your alma mater's establishment of a scholarship bearing your name. Here is what the creation of a CRT can accomplish for you. Properly drafted, formulated and managed, a charitable remainder trust is an excellent \\"transfer tax\\" avoidance instrumentality that can: . avoid completely any capital gains tax payment on your appreciated property, regardless of the original cost basis; . convert your low-yield property into a high income investment guaranteed to provide you and your spouse the financial security of lifetime income, immediate or deferred, with greatly reduced income tax consequences; . serve as a vehicle to receive the \\"roll over\\" of your qualified pension plan or Individual Retirement Account (IRA), increasing both retirement income and tax savings; . provide you with an immediate substantial charitable income tax deduction against your taxes for the year in which the CRT is created; . diminish estate and inheritance taxes on the donated property - and avoid the probate mess as well; and . for your heirs, provide a greatly increased inheritance, financed by the tax savings and increased income your CRT will provide. Sounds too good to be true - or to be legal in present day, tax oppressed America? Believe us, it is true.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rW4_AQAACAAJ&dq=The+Charitable+Remainder+Trust:+Reduce+Estate+And+Income+Taxes+Through+Charitable+Giving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost in Time and Space With Lefty Feep: Eight Funny and Fanciful Fables of the Forties, Plus One Brand-New Parable of Modern Times","description":"The Newbery Medal and Coretta Scott King Award-winning classic about a boy who decides to hit the road to find his father from Christopher Paul Curtis, author of The Watsons Go To Birmingham 1963, a Newbery and Coretta Scott King Honoree.

However, In 1997, experiments were conducted in which light particles (photons) originated under certain conditions and traveled in opposite directions to detectors located about seven miles apart. The amazing results indicated that the photons \\"interacted\\" or \\"communicated\\" with one another instantly or \\"in no time.\\" Since a distance of seven miles is quite vast in quantum physics, this led physicists to an extraordinary conclusion--even if experiments could somehow be conducted in which the distance between the detectors was half-way across the known universe, the results would indicate that interaction or communication between the photons would be instantaneous. What was revealed in these little-known experiments in 1997 is that physical reality is non-local--a discovery that Robert Nadeau and Menas Kafatos view as \\"the most momentous in the history of science.\\" In The Non-Local Universe, Nadeau and Kafatos offer a revolutionary look at the breathtaking implications of non-locality. They argue that since every particle in the universe has been \\"entangled\\" with other particles like the two photons in the 1997 experiments, physical reality on the most basic level is an undivided wholeness. In addition to demonstrating that physical processes are vastly interdependent and interactive, they also show that more complex systems in both physics and biology display emergent properties and/or behaviors that cannot be explained in the terms of the sum of parts. One of the most startling implications of non-locality in human terms, claim the authors, is that there is no longer any basis for believing in the stark division between mind and world that has preoccupied much of western thought since the seventeenth century. And they also make a convincing case that human consciousness can now be viewed as emergent from and seamlessly connected with the entire cosmos. In pursuing this groundbreaking argument, the authors not only provide a fascinating history of developments that led to the discovery of non-locality and the sometimes heated debate between the great scientists responsible for these discoveries. They also argue that advances in scientific knowledge have further eroded the boundaries between physics and biology, and that recent studies on the evolution of the human brain suggest that the logical foundations of mathematics and ordinary language are much more similar than we previously imagined. What this new knowledge reveals, the authors conclude, is that the connection between mind and nature is far more intimate than we previously dared to imagine.
