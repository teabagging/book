Also, I might add that this is a most delightful book and teaches much about attitude and respect."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"I generally lean toward old classics in selecting books to read to my precocious 6-yr old. This one is undoubtedly a classic, it is indeed very good literature, excellently written -- everything the other reviewers have said. Nevertheless, its story, its conflict, its central preoccupation revolves around a very British idea of class: one's \\"quality\\" as a person is determined by one's birth. This is antithetical to the very idea of America and will be much too hard to explain to a child. Yet if I wait until he is older, he will probably be turned off by the idealized, syrupy characterization."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Of course, his Little Lordship was a tad too good to be true (and I've a sneaking suspicion that he'd be what one would consider nowadays as queer - not gay, just weird -- what with sunshine just emanating in smothering waves from him).This story makes for a light, amusing escape. Escape from the ghastliness of how people nowadays treat each other: often with suspicion, bluntness, and - dare I say it - parasitism. \`User-friendly' is practically a code to live by. A person is approached with an eye out for what s/he could possibly *do* for you. Don't know yet what that favor could be? Then just keep that person in one's \\"social network\\" \`til he can prove to be of some worth one day.But the little hero of this story frighteningly succeeds in shaming that aspect of the human condition. And he does nothing more than be naturally warm, steadfastly friendly and loyal, and blessedly oblivious to the coarser nature of those around him. He collects friends *not* because he yearns to be that person who is known to have the \`most-number-of-friends-in-his-friends-list', but because people irresistibly, inevitably, find themselves charmed and absolutely tickled to make his acquaintance.This 7-year old boy is the delight of nannies and the nightmare of school bullies. The first for the obvious reasons: a sweet yet mature disposition; and the second because, even if he gets pummeled at school (which, let's face it, would be more than likely - remember, he calls his mother by the name \`Dearest'), he would just as soon turn to the bully and offer to rehabilitate him, proffering a hand of friendship, honest sympathy and earnestness on his \`golden handsome' countenance. A look of horror would then creep on the bully's face as he gapes at this sickeningly sweet boy who just refuses to cry uncle and is now offering to befriend him. The bully then turns and flees as if the hounds of Beelzebub were at his heels.Taking aside the improbability that someone of Cedric's nature exists anywhere or anywhen in this world (think 'Children of the Corn' gone eerily good), this story is actually more suited for consumption for its message of redemption, friendship, and - bear with me on this - contentment in all things simple."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Not only is it a flimsy book with no illustrations (when the illustrations are quite important to the story), but my copy was missing a page, right before the end.

Every mother apparently wanted their boy to be as selfless and precocious as the title character, so they dressed the innocent boy in the absurd outfit of the book - the velvet, lace collared affair that scarred a generation.But that misses Burnett's point. She creates a world where a child of American sensibilities - raising all boats as his own tide increases - counters the old British guard which, at the time, was the lord had it all, the villagers had nothing.My two favorite childhood books are A Little Princess and Secret Garden. And while Cedric is a little too perfect, the message and the characterization of sudden wealth leading to actual kindness is refreshing."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is a quick read and very well written.

Our kids need to read good books, to be good people."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"Cedric Errol is a seven-year old boy who lives with his mother in the mid-1880s on a \\"New York side street\\" that is described as \\"shabby.\\" His father, also named Cedric Errol had died when the boy was a toddler. It turns out that Captain Cedric Errol was the third son of the very wealthy English Earl of Dorincourt who, when his son went to America and married, cut him off. But the Earl's two older sons have died childless, and now little Cedric is his only male heir, known as Lord Fauntleroy, so he sends his lawyer, Mr. Havisham, to America to bring Cedric and his mother back. Cedric is to live with his grandfather in his castle-like manor house to be trained as an aristocrat, while Mrs. Errol, whom Cedric calls \\"Dearest,\\" is to live in another house on the estate. Cedric can visit her whenever he wishes, but she is not to come to the manor house.During this time, Cedric writes his friends in New York, Mr. Hobbs the grocer and Dick Tipton the bootblack. Then a woman comes, claiming that she was the wife of Bevis, the Earl's oldest son, and had a boy by him who is the real Lord Fauntleroy. What kind of influence will young Cedric have on his crusty old grandfather? How can Dick the bootblack help to determine if the boy of the woman who claims to be the mother of Bevis's son is whom he's claimed to be? And will the Earl ever become reconciled to his daughter-in-law? We have read and enjoyed author Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Little Princess and The Secret Garden. However, Little Lord Fauntleroy was her first children's novel and perhaps best-known title. It was originally published as a serial in the St. Nicholas Magazine between November, 1885, and October, 1886. The accompanying illustrations by Reginald Birch set fashion trends. Also the book set a precedent in copyright law in 1888 when the author won a lawsuit against E. V. Seebohm over the rights to theatrical adaptations of the work.The story is perhaps best known today from a 1936 film starring Freddy Bartholomew as Cedric and featuring Mickey Rooney as Dick Tipton, the Brooklyn bootblack. Like Pollyana and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, Little Lord Fauntleroy has been misunderstood, and the term is now sometimes used in derision to describe a pompous spoiled brat, usually a young male, who takes his wealth and privilege for granted. However, this is not consistent with the original character, whose personality could be described as naturally and innocently generous, kind, and friendly. I enjoyed reading the book. There are a few minor references to drinking wine, smoking a pipe, and dancing, but there is also emphasis placed on going to church services and praying. Some people today might think the book hopelessly outdated and completely irrelevant to modern life. However, I believe that children need to read books with characters who exemplify good behavior. The fact is that young people don't have to grow up spoiled and bratty as they're often pictured in many books nowadays. They can be raised to be polite and kind, and Little Lord Fauntleroy is certainly a role model of that kind of deportment toward which we can aim."},{"Title":"Little Lord Fauntleroy","review":"This is an excellent book. The man who wrote the book is called F.H.Burnett (Francis Hodgson Burnett).I read this book because my sister was telling me all day long to read it. Now I have to say thanks to her, because it's a great book, what's more, is one of the best books I've ever read.It is about a boy called Cedric Errol. He's not only intelligent but also kind and beautiful. He used to live with his father and his mother, but his father died, so he started trying to make his mother happier.One day, he was in the corner with her close friend Hobbs (he is a man, not a boy), when the woman that works in his house, Mary, went to the corner to tell to Cedric that he have to return to his house. There he saw a man... This man was called Mr.Havisham, he was the lawyer of Cedric's grandfather. This man was there to go with Cedric and his mother to Dorincourt (that was the castle of his grandfather). Cedric would become a Lord, Lord Fauntleroy. At first, he doesn't like that but then...all the things change.The lawyer of his grandfather gave him a lot of money to do what he wanted. The surprise was that Cedric, instead of buying things for himself, decided to help other people. For example: he helped the old woman that sold apples in the street to buy a shop.When Cedric met his granfather, he thinks that his grandfather is the kindest man in all the world, but this opinion is not the same that the poor people that lives there have.Cedric and the countess become very close. But suddenly, a woman appeared telling to all the people that her son was the real Lord Fauntleroy. This new Lord was very stupid and he was not what we can call \\"beautiful\\". Obviouslly, the countess doesn't accept that this stupid boy was the son of his son, and he starts investigating.Here I have to stop, if not I will tell you all the book, no?.

And I do really like this author. He is quoted in many other commentaries on John's epistles, and has provided a wealth of interesting thoughts for the scholar or scholarly student.Here are some of the best things about this book.The format of the material is the most pleasant of any commentary I have on John's epistles. The pages are a bit larger (wider) with formatting to set off different parts of the material.He has an overview section from 1:5 through 2:17 called \\"Communion with God\\". In that section (I will look at 2:12-17) he has a number of subsets. Each natural paragraph is treated as a unit and then each verse individually. So everything is easy to find (a lot easier than the WBC series that's for sure). In 2:12-17 he calls the subset \\"Concrete Ethical Demands\\". He then gives a short overview of the paragraph. After that he starts in with vv 12-14. Underneath everything is a clearly separated footnoting section with dense bibliographical trails for the student or scholar who wants more on a particular jot or tittle. This is great for the pastor (like me) who wants to skip most of that stuff and get to the conclusions he makes. In vv 12-14 he spends a lot of time (several pages) dealing with nuances of the striking use of tenses for the verbs there. The reason it is important is because how one sees John's use of verbs here can feed into different theories on who wrote 1, 2, 3 John and why one scholar is correct vs another scholar in the debates around these sort of things.Well, that's important I suppose. But if you have to talk to people about the Bible who are not required to attend your lectures, there really isn't a lot in his several pages to inspire anyone. So for my purposes, I found his material interesting, but not very inspiring. In other words, I will use this commentary only for the more technical parts of my research. Almost all pastors never have time to get to that part of their sermon prep, so this commentary will have to remain a secondary resource at best for most pastors.Because of this, I only recommend this commentary for pastors who have a lot of time in their schedule to do extensive exegetical reading. It's really more of a scholars dream. So many great points in the battles that scholars work out on these things. From that perspective I think this is an excellent work and ought to receive a five star rating. But from a practical ministerial perspective, I recommend Smalley's work on John's epistles, which lacks the wonderful formatting of this series, but has a lot of inspiring and preachable points throughout."},{"Title":"The Johannine Letters (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible)","review":"The Hermeneia series is an expensive but outstanding set of commentaries. The main advantage for an English or North American student is that they offer the opportunity to engage the studies of outstanding European scholars that might not otherwise be available. Strecker's work has been translated from German but reads very easily and smoothly. The quality of the series is outstanding, both in the physical presentation of the books to the detail and care put into the writing of the commentary itself.I find the Johannine letters to be wonderful windows into the early church, and Strecker's work is comprehensive in it's analysis of the deep themes that run through these letters. Strecker has a great ability to give understanding to the Greek words such as agape which dominate the writing and theology of these letters. He is able to demonstrate both the similarities between I John and II and III John while giving proper respect to each letter as an individual entity.I am a lay student attempting to study my way through the New Testament to enhance my understanding of these books and also to help my preparation as an adult and high school teacher. This book has been very helpful to me in both these goals. It would help to have a basic knowledge of Greek to read the text, but it is not essential. I have read Marshall's volume in the NICNT series, and I would favor slightly favor this book. Both are outstanding commmentaries. I enjoyed this commentary and the format, which leaves most of the scholarly discussion in the footnotes, to be accessed if needed. This book is pricey, but well worth it if you want to explore the riches of these wonderful letters."},{"Title":"The Crime Cult","review":"A strangler is a work, along with a couple of mobsters named Flash and Dip.

While the stories in this collection cover diverse immigration experiences, each story deals with the challenges that are unique to adolescents arriving in a new country. The stories, though fiction, deal with the difficult realities many immigrant teenagers face, realities such as self-doubt, social and linguistic isolation, racism, and family conflict. The reading level and subject matter of this book make it suitable for middle school and high school students. The collection lends itself well to opportunities for discussion and writing extensions."},{"Title":"First Crossing: Stories About Teen Immigrants","review":"For a summer reading assignment in my high school, I had chosen to read First Crossings: Stories of Teen Immigrants by David Gallo. Although initially, I had expected true stories of immigrants in a longer format, the stories in First Crossings are fictional and short.I enjoy reading multicultural fiction, and I throughly enjoyed reading some stories in the book, although after reading three to four stories, the stories began to become transparent and rather canned.I guess this is to be expected with a collection of stories all about the same subject, but I expected more from such prolific writers of the topic such as Lesley Namioka (whose books I have read before).Also missing from First Crossings is something that I think would be very relevant to current events in the United States, a story about illegal Mexican or Central American immigrants living in America, rather then just the immigration process.. Reading through the book, I found that it covered all manners and variety of immigration to America, with the glaring omission of this topic.To be more complete, I would recommend such a story be included. Otherwise, I have enjoyed reading from this book.A wide variety of topics related to immigration are presented in a sometimes humorous format, including the immigrant handling of cultural differences and misunderstandings, the customs and cuisine of a new country, and, especially valuable, the search for an identity as an immigrant in a new country, coming from a country with a distinct culture to another country with another distinct culture.The characters in the \\"identity-related\\"stories often struggle to find a balance between their birth and adopted cultures, and satisfyingly, appear to make adjustments and blend the two in unique ways.Although not what I expected, I enjoyed reading First Crossings."},{"Title":"First Crossing: Stories About Teen Immigrants","review":"First CrossingHave you ever felt out of place? Have you ever tired to fit in, tried to figure out how the world works? The book \\"First Crossing\\" edited by Donald R. Gallo, are stories about teen immigrants.

One of my favorite stories is \\" First Crossing\\" by Pam Mun Ryan.\\"First Crossing\\" shows that it is not easy to cross the border to America. A boy named Marco and Papa try to cross the border to America to work. It might be Papas tenth time crossing the border, but for Marco it is his first crossing. One important phrase said by Papa was \\"My future and the children's future are marked in stone here\\". This is important because he is saying, in America there is a better life for him and his family.I did not like all of the stories in this book, but I would still recommend this book to anyone that wants to read stories about people trying to fit in. Some of the stories I liked were \\" First Crossing\\", \\"They don't mean it\\", \\"Pulling up stakes\\", \\"Making Maddie mad\\", and \\"The Swede\\". Do the people fit in?

Bonnie, Meridian, ID."},{"Title":"First Crossing: Stories About Teen Immigrants","review":"In the book titled \\"First Crossing: Stories about Teem Immigrants\\" edited by \\"Donald R. Gallo\\" contains a set of different stories about teen immigrants. In these stories we can see what many teenagers experience when they first come to this country, United States. In addition, this book actually expresses various points of view from teen immigrants from different cultures, with different backgrounds, and with different situations after arriving to the United States. The book also talks about the different manners that these teens have, and how they might have to change them because they are not the same as the ones in the United States, and because of this others might even consider them weird. It also mentions how teen immigrants my also obtain a nickname as an effect of how they act or what they do. And, even about the opportunities that you might not be offered for being an immigrant or new in the place you arrived. But, most importantly these book talks about the memories and objects that have a meaning to these teen immigrants because they bring to them old memories from their native country and/or their old ancestors. One thing that I would have to say I liked about this book is that it does not only include one story, from the point of one single immigrant, but it includes many. Therefore, it makes it more likely for more teenagers to connect with these writers because they might even be able to find a story with their own point of view, and the exact same thing that happened to them. On the other hand, something I didn't like was that some of the stories were left with an open ending. This can also be seen as interesting because it allows the reader [me] to be able to create my own ending, based on my understanding of text/story. If I were to recommend this book to anyone, I would recommend it to teens in general. Not only teen immigrants, because I believe that every teen in the united states has met or at least seen someone in the street who is an immigrant, and we many times judge these teens based on their background without really knowing them - by reading these book these other teens would be able to see the situations immigrants go through, and will be more conscious when insulating or judging their ability to understand, do, or say some things."},{"Title":"First Crossing: Stories About Teen Immigrants","review":"I was required to read this book for school, and found it throughly depressing.

In both cases, they were organized from existing guards regiments (Coldstream, Welsh, Scots, Grenadier, Irish, and for WWI Machine Gun). After each war the divisions were disbanded but the regiments remain. The reason I was curious about the subject was that the Guards Armored were a signficant part of Operation Market-Garden (A Bridge Too Far).This book is an excellent guide for the modeler of WW I&amp;II. I for one plan to add a touch of distinction to otherwise dull and usual figure uniforms with the &quot;All-Seeing&quot;/&quot;Ever-open&quot; eye, which the photos and illustrations show very well. On tanks, on flags, on uniform sleeves, on trench signs...The modeler's possibilites are endless!The book's greatest shortcoming is length, despite being extended into the longer &quot;Elite&quot; series. For a subject with so much material, 64 pages just doesn't cut it. They probably should have given two books, one for each World War. The book is slightly more focused on WWI, be aware. It tries to give an account of each of the battles the divisions were involved in, and the shortness gives amusing results. For Market-Garden's failure it says &quot;Despite ever effort the armour of the Guards was stopped six miles short of the beleaguered paratroops...&quot; Um, after the Guards pushed through Nijmagin, the last stop before the airborne at Arnhem they stopped to drink tea while the last paratroopers were overwhelmed. Whether they could have reached them in time is debatable, but that's not &quot;every effort&quot;.Overall, a recommended volume for modelers especially, but the lack of detail due to length is a disapointment."},{"Title":"Finite orthogonal series in the design of digital devices: Analysis, synthesis, and optimization","review":"This book presents mathematic foundations for spectral methods in logic design in a condensed, but self-containted way, discussing both binary and multiple-valued logic functions uniformly through the Fourier analysis on finite Abelian groups and its extensions and generalizations.The present interest in increased functional density of basic blocks in logic networks, and applications of decision digarams for representaiton of discrete functions, bring a renewed actuality to this book.

It's NOT video, it's one frame every 5-8 seconds while the audio streams so you INSTANTLY become confused when he's writing something on the board and it freezes.. but yet you hear him explaining further steps without ever seeing it on screen. It's not my computer, it's how they set up the cd.No one in my class likes this book, I've done all my learning from web sites since chapter 2 because the book is absolutely not written by a math instructor."},{"Title":"Algebra With Trigonometry for College Students","review":"An excellent book such as this one deserves praise. I read it, I got it, and I can teach it."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5: Unintended Consequences","review":"I've been following Straczynski's run on &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; ever since the first book caught my eye in the graphic novels rack. This is his fourth volume, and he shows no sign of slowing down. Quick summary: Peter and his wife have just reunited, but -- as these things tend to happen in their world -- a reincarnated gangster shows up in New York, bent on getting revenge on the now-elderly Mafia boss who killed him fifty years before. On again, Straczynski shows himself to be one of the most capable writers in comics -- great dialogue, great plots, and his character work is something you have to see to believe. I've never seen anyone get inside Spidey's head like he does; in only five issues, he makes the new villian, Digger, one of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in comics at the same time (just take his reaction as he catches up to the fifty years of history he's missed...). An excellent job -- I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5: Unintended Consequences","review":"Title: Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 4: Unintended ConsequencesPublisher: MarvelWriter: J. Michael StraczynskiArtist: John Romita Jr.Collects: Amazing Spider-Man #51-56Price: $12.99This volume collects two story arcs: Digger and Unintended consequences. The first arc introduces a new character (Digger, duh!) who is a bit reminiscent of Solomon Grundy. The character is a conglomerate of many mobsters who were killed, buried near a chemical dump site, and then resurrected in a monstrous form (complete with green hulk-like skin) after a gamma bomb test near the place where they were buried. Yeah, I know... it's pretty generic and ridiculous. Not the best character I've seen introduced lately, and it's clear Straczynski made him up as a disposable character. Digger does die and break apart by the end of the story arc, and Spidey's character is really not advanced any further. The story's a no-brainer, and really nothing special, but it was an easy read for me that required no real introduction or set-up to jump into. So, in terms of accessibility, the writer does a good job.The same can be said of the second arc. It focuses on the life of one of the students in Peter's school. After learning that the young girl dislikes Spider-Man because he sent her older brother to jail, Peter tries to find some way to help out this stubborn, independent child. Along the way, he crosses paths with the mysterious Ezekiel, and manages to reunite the girl with her paroled but missing brother. It's a feel-good story that seemed to me to be stronger than the more action-oriented Digger arc.It's really nice to see Peter and MJ back together again, too. I really didn't like the separation idea, as it seemed too contrived and too much like an afternoon soap opera dilemma. I know the idea was supposed to show realism in the characters, but I hate it when Peter is all-too-often shown as a depressed man on the verge of breaking down.Something else I've noticed with Straczynski's writing is that he seems to portray Peter as a real motor-mouth who doesn't know when to shut up. I really don't like this. It's perfectly fine for Peter to be a smart mouth, but talking incessantly seems wrong for him - like he's a nervous girl. I doubt Straczynski will be changing anything anytime soon, but I hope other writers don't copy this aspect of his writing. Also, once again, I found Straczynski's humor in the book to just be OK. I understand how it could be hard to come up with new material for Peter that is pretty funny, so I can cut him some slack. But I wish the humor was a bit funnier.JRJR on art chores is usually a good thing. Here, he continues his excellent tradition of hard work and strong pencils. Most everything looks great. Peter's facial expressions are well-done and MJ looks (appropriately) like a foxy supermodel. My only beef with his artwork is his portrayal of May Parker. For some reason, he likes to portray May with a very large cranium - way out of proportion to her elderly body. I haven't run across many bobble-headed old ladies, so I'm not sure why he chooses to render her this way. It's odd to the point of distracting, which is unfortunate. Now, some may read the book and not even notice this aspect of the penciling details, but I don't see how. If he would have done a better job or drawing May Parker, I really could have given him a higher score on the art.Overall, this book is just OK. It's not bad, but I can't give it a strong recommendation like I have to some of the previous JMS books.Writing: 6/10Artwork: 7/10Overall: 6.5/10"},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5: Unintended Consequences","review":"&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Unintended Consequences&quot; is the fifth trade paperback volume representing the work of writer J. Michael Straczynski and artist John Romita, Jr. that has revitalized America's favorite web-spinner. Collected here are issues #51-58 of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man,&quot; which starts in the aftermath of Mary Jane's decision to return home with Peter.The first four issues deal with a new character, called Digger. In 1957 there was a gangland hit in Las Vegas, and now, after a Gamma bomb test near where the bodies were buried, a mutated creature crawls out of its grave and head to New York City to find the mobster to find Forellli, the mobster who ordered the hit. Meanwhile, Peter and Mary Jane are having fun out on the town reconciling, until the creature starts ripping a nightclub apart. The next thing we know our hero is getting weird clues from Lt. Lamont, having chats with mobsters, taking a trip to Las Vegas, and, most surprisingly, being hired by Forelli to protect his daughter.The rest of this volume consists of a pair of two-part stories. &quot;Unintended Consequences,&quot; co-plotted and scripted by Fionna Avery, is the best story in the volume. Peter Parker takes an interest in Melissa Coolidge, a student on crutches with a sharp wit, a pretty strong vocabulary, and an attitude problem. Peter gets her into his Honors Biology course and escorts her home. After an encounter with some local thugs working for the building's landlord, he meets Melissa's mom and learns that from Melissa that her older brother Jack in is jail because that vigilante creep Spider-Man nabbed him for stealing a car. After sending the landlord a message, Spider-Man talks to Ezekiel and the doctrine of unintended consequences and the fact that even bad guys have families.&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; sets up the big 500th issue of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (if you put Volume 1 and Volume 2 together). Things start going bad when Peter discovers that instead of &quot;Poetry and Science&quot; the school got copies of &quot;Essentials of Cooking With Fowl, Pig and Cow&quot; for his biology students. That night there is red lightning, which Spider-Man goes to investigate. What he finds is every superhero in the city fighting the Mindless Ones, which are invading from the Faltine Dimension. Spider-Man joins the fight. Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four has a solution but Dr. Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, arrives to tell the heroes they have been tricked into bringing back the dread Dormammu. However, be forewarned that we do not get to the big payoff for this one (drawn by John Romita, Sr.) by the end of this one.I got back into Spider-Man because I wanted to use &quot;The Essential Spider-Man, Volume 1&quot; is my Popular Culture class. The idea is that students read those first twenty issues of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and come up with the defining elements of the comics, which they then apply to a current issue of the web-spinner. That meant I had to get current with what was happening in the various titles, and seeing what Straczynski and Romita Jr. was pretty impressive. I gave up about the time of the clone nonsense, so it was nice to see a different tone, better sense of pacing, and more interesting villains. Obviously, if you have been missing out on the fun the last couple of years you should go back to the first of these trade paperback volumes and pick up on what these guys having been doing from the start of what has to be considered a solid version of Spider-Man."},{"Title":"Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5: Unintended Consequences","review":"I was really disappointed when I saw they included the Fiona Avery stories in this collection. I read them when they came out as individual issues and I hated them so much I threw them out so they weren't taking up comic space. The dialogue was forced and it was so cause focused rather than story focused. I even decided not to buy the trade because they included the non-Stracynski issues... Bad decision by Marvel to include those issues."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"As a person whose imagined future plans have almost never included children, my threshold for empathy with a memoir of parental experiences is pretty high--to me, you had a choice and you made it, knowing full well that your kid, like all kids, would one day be a bratty teenager. Maybe that's why this book works--because Paul Collins and his wife didn't have a choice about their son, Morgan, being born autistic.The way that Collins blends a momentous year in the life of his family with a variety of stories about the history of autism and notable autists (including many whose conditions have been diagnosed posthumously, because autism wasn't understood at all until recently) works, too. We feel his pain and his growth, and laugh and cry with him, even as he gently gives us a textbook education in the development of society's understanding of the condition, from Peter the Wild Boy to Rainman and beyond.Quietly, deftly, Collins also seeks to reshape the way we think about autism. For instance, he says, \\"Autists are described by others--and by themselves--as aliens among humans. But there's an irony to this, for precisely the opposite is true. They are us, and to understand them is to begin to understand what it means to be human. Think of it: a disability is usually defined in terms of what is missing. A child tugs at his or her parents and whispers, 'Where's that man's arm?' But autism is an ability and a disability: it is as much about what is abundant as what is missing, an overexpression of the very traits that make our species unique. Other animals are social, but only humans are capable of abstract logic. The autistic outhuman the humans, and we can scarcely recognize the result.\\"And then, of course, we have the moment when Collins sees an adult version of his son at a fast food restaurant and watches the reaction of people around him, then walks a few blocks, stops, sits down on the stoop of a church, and cries. \\"I can't bear the thought that someday, somehow, someone will be cruel to my child. Or pretend that he is not even there.\\" His pain is palpable; you can't help but care about him and empathize with his struggle.Destined to be a comfort to parents of autistic children, this most recent Paul Collins book is a worthwhile and exceptionally enjoyable read with or without such a personal stake. Even more than Sixpence House, this book perfects the genre of personal history and intense research into the arcane that Collins is creating for himself. Give him 200 pages of your time."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"I have taught preschool children with disabilities for twenty odd years. I am always looking for books that I can share with parents to help them on their road to raising their child. This is going to the top of the list. What a gift Mr. Collins has written.For one thing, the total unconditional love Morgan's parents show shines through. It doesn't matter what he can or cannot do - he is a child first. Anything else is secondary. That is such an important view for parents, and teachers, to have.They took the bull by the horns. The diagnosis was devastating, but it didn't stop them from jumping in to the interventions that were recommended. One of the biggest issues I have is trying to get parents beyond the intial shock and denial, and get them moving. TIme is of the essence. I also have trouble sometimes getting them to see that they indeed are partners in this process - what we do at school cannot be isolated, and must be followed through at home as well. His descriptions of how they experiemented, and how they took the ideas of therapists and adjusted them to fit Morgan was perfect. His description of the classrooms and the activities were right on target as well.His explanation of how people with autism think can help me explain to parents why their child might be reacting the way that they do.I was impressed by his experience as a father. Its a rare family where the father actually takes on an equal share of the work in raising a child with disabilities. His POV was enlightening and will give many other fathers encouragement to be involved.I also appreciated the historical point of view. I think parents and professionals need that background to see where we have been and get a better idea of where we are going.Speaking of professionals - the books postive take on the therapists was a breath of fresh air. I have quickly tired of the tirads that parents feel they need to write about, and how they had to fight this and fight that, when for the most part, people in this field are in it for good reasons and are trying the best they can. Its important for parents to question and to look for options. But the positive attitude in this book and the author's willingness to work with the staff, makes all of the difference.In short, this is just an excellent book on so many levels. I highly recommend it to any parent, professional in the field, or anyone who wants more information about autism."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"Oh! You thought that autism only affected \\"Rain Man\\" and only impacted the life of his brother who sleezily hauled him off to Las Vegas. Or maybe you thought that autistics have only been born in the last 14 years. Boy were you wrong! :-)Autitstics have been impacting human life and the course of history for hudreds of years. Paul Collins does a fantastic job of not only chronicling his experience with his young son and his being diagnosed as autistic, he also does a fantastic job of chronicling the existence of autistics who lived before there was such a word.Way to go Paul Collins!Thank you for exposing Bruno Bettleheim for the creep he was and for interviewing Simon Baron-Cohen (a nice man, as far as I can tell).Thank you for sharing your fascination with Peter the Wild Boy.I am an adult with an autism spectrum diagnosis, Asperger's syndrome.I hope your little boy is always treated with respect by the world that so often demands conformism.oddizm"},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoyed Collins' earlier title, \\"Sixpence House\\" so much. Although \\"Not Even Wrong\\" tackles a much different subject, autism, the writing style is the same and I enjoyed it just as much. The thing about Paul Collins is that he is so good at educating his readers on a variety of subjects that you don't realize you are learning until you have finished the book and find yourself seeking out more information. I did not know much about autism before reading this and never had more than a cursory interest in it, but Collins' made it an utterly fascinating subject, both with the massive amount of historical info he provided as well as the way he weaved his own personal story into the narrative. The research he has done here is quite thorough, but it reads like a novel and is never dry or boring. As for the memoir aspect, well, I found myself caring far more about this little boy then I ever imagined. I don't like \\"disease of the week\\" books and can happily say that this not at all one of those. This is just good writing, period. As always, Paul Collins did not disappoint this fan."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism was written by historian Paul Collins, the author of Sixpence House. His son Morgan bounces around exuberantly playing verbal games with numbers and letters, banging on the piano, reading everything in sight, and interacting with his nanny and parents in his own way.Morgan is certainly not a \\"stranger in the strange land of human emotions\\" as the official review claims (once again, the autistic as weird alien stereotype). He's *happy*. He has a great time. He's as enthusiastic as Mandy West in Paul West's old classic Words for a Deaf Daughter and just as oblivious to the fact that according to autism experts, he's actually living in a world of his own and that there must be a real child in there struggling to get out, etc., etc.And his parents! They think he's simply a bright kid with many interests. Who the hell cares if he doesn't answer when you ask his name or play along with dumb \\"look at the funny monkey\\" games when there's a much more interesting talking computerized camera in the same room?In short, the parents don't see anything wrong with the kid, because there isn't anything wrong with the kid. He isn't living in a world of his own. He's just more interested in music, math, reading, and audio equipment than people. A phalanx of experts try to convince Collins that Morgan's in need of vast amounts of therapy to bring him up to \\"normal\\", but Collins sensibly doesn't buy it even after he is made to understand that two-year-olds generally have more interest in the above social interactions.Like Paul West citing stories of famous deaf people, Collins goes back in time to look at historical figures who may have had conditions similar to autism, which the shrinks finally talk him into believing his son is at least sort of, kind of, on the spectrum. He spends a lot of time on Peter the Wild Boy, gets into a bit of Henry Darger and others, and presents us with an endless array of fascinating trivia. Thirty years ago, the obviously devoted Collins would have been targeted, for his thoroughness and thoughtfulness, as one of those too- intellectual \\"refrigerator parents\\" whose cold, remote attitude forced their kids to \\"withdraw into a shell of autism\\". He talks about Bruno Bettelheim, too -- the guy who came up with that, who faked a psychology degree and promoted the theory that all autism was caused by abusive parents. Bettelheim defrauded the psychiatric community and the public for years, while brutalizing hundreds of children at his Orthogenic School.He also finds evidence that so-called Asperger syndrome is not a \\"mild\\" or \\"high functioning\\" form of autism --it is autism. The perceived difference between autism and Asperger originated with different samplings and with the differing attitudes of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger toward their young subjects. Asperger's research was ignored for decades, some of it lost in WWII.Collins looks for (and finds) a way to help Morgan communicate without murdering who he is, using an array of homemade picture cards. He also finds a school with an autistic program where the kids are permitted to learn in an interdisciplinary fashion, related to their particular interests and styles.The book ends in almost a parody of the old sunburst-through-clouds, ohmygod-it's a breakthrough fashion when Morgan notices Collins has left the room and yells \\"Daddy\\" to bring him back. So those who believe in the sickness/cure paradigm get a Reader's Digest condensed version of what they want, and Morgan remains jolly well autistic.The book repeatedly and convincingly gives the message that it's a mistake to try to force we autistics to behave as something other than our true selves. Parents of other autistic kids tell Collins about how their kid went through the pink monkey routine when they were mainstreamed, but did fine in an autistic school where they were allowed to communicate in their own way. Simply letting autistic people be autistic is such a revolutionary idea! But I think it will be accepted, along with ideas such as autistic culture, in the very near future.It is easy to forget that autism is still classified as a mental illness. Part of this confusion is caused by the fact that some psychotic children (made that way by abuse or other toxic life circumstance) behave superficially similar to autistic (cf. Mira Rothenberg's Children with Emerald Eyes). The Journal of Autism used to be the Journal of Autism and Childhood Schizophrenia and the two conditions were constantly being mistaken for each other. Now it is generally acknowledged thanks to Bernard Rimland and others that autism has a biochemical and/or neurological basis and is not a response to child abuse. (I believe it is only a matter of time before multiple personality is similarly demystified.)As of 2010, most mainstream services for autism are still dedicated to the proposition that autism can and must be cured, and that until that day, autistics must be trained to behave as close to non-autistic as possible. But the internet is full of autistic teens and adults, who explain their experiences on thousands of blogs and Youtube videos, rejecting puzzle-piece objectification. And there are blogs by parents explaining that, once again, there is nothing wrong with their kids. They're just different, so their education (not \\"intervention\\") will have to be different.It'll take a while to change, but I believe it will change. And I will live to see it, and so will you. Thank you, Paul Collins, for bringing that day a little closer."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"After reading \\"Sixpence House\\" and finding it delightful, I looked up Paul Collins in the library catalog and saw this book. When I read \\"adventures in autism\\" I gasped. Not their little boy?! But yes, their little boy, whose adorableness was palpable in \\"Sixpence House,\\" was diagnosed with autism around the age of three.This is a memoir of becoming the parent of a special needs child. I say \\"becoming\\" because the change from \\"the parent of the child we love who we thought was normal\\" to \\"the parent of the child we love who is autistic\\" is gradual, marked by milestones of shock and understanding.Paul Collins shares this becoming with us, so honestly, so lovingly. He interweaves his own story with accounts of the history of the diagnosis of autism, of people with autism and of historical people it is reasonable to speculate were autistic. In doing so, he makes a subtle case for the role of the autist in society past and present. Their disabilities are just as frequently remarkable abilities. Their capacity for single minded obsession has led to many scientific discoveries and technological applications that we all depend on.Above all, his deep delight in his son and his unconditional love for him are apparent on every page.Thank you Paul Collins for sharing Morgan with us all."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"I love Paul Collins' books, but sometimes have difficulty explaining to friends what they're all about. \\"Banvard's Folly\\" was about thirteen people whose lives were tied together by a single theme: failure. \\"Sixpence House\\" was about his family's year spent living in Hay-On-Wye, the famous Welsh \\"Town of Books.\\" But it was also about the intriguing discoveries Paul made in the millions of pages that populated the town. Now comes \\"Not Even Wrong.\\" It's the story of the Collins' discovery that their son, Morgan is autistic, and how they come to terms with that. It's also about a famous feral child, quite probably autistic, known as \\"Peter the Wild Boy.\\" And it's about other autists, and society's often misguided efforts to deal with them...By now, you may conclude that these are works that are hard to pigeonhole. But after finishing this third book, I see some common themes emerging in Paul's work. Most apparent, of course, is a fascination with the forgotten corridors of the past. History is mostly the story of our journey down a few well-lighted, well-traveled paths. Every now and then, however, we're lucky enough to have a Paul Collins who loves to explore the dark, musty, mostly forgotten byways. It's often here that he finds a telling anecdote or incident that helps to illuminate his world, and ours.The greatest characteristic of Paul's work, though, is empathy. \\"Banvard's Folly\\" easily could have been done in a tongue-in-cheek, \\"aren't these people a laugh\\" kind of style. Instead, Paul wrote with a real understanding of what motivated these individuals. Empathy is what shines through the pages of this book. Not only his love for his son, but also his caring for the autists he meets in a coffee house or only in the dusty pages of an old archive. This is a man who understands, and who cares.If you want to know a writer of true grace, get to know the works of Paul Collins.--William C.

I read the whole book in 2 days, and found it very uplifting. It included 'historical' information on autism, as well as personal experiences of the author. It made autism look like a learning difference instead of a severe mental deficit (as it is sometimes portrayed). The author's emotions were genuine, and the stories were touching. The reader was left feeling renewed for the fight - if need be - for his own family members or friends. It was such a healing feeling to read the book, I'm seriously considering reading it again."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"As the parent of a little girl with autism, I have read many, many books on the subject. This book is one of the most intriguing ones I have come across. Paul Collins tells about his family's struggle to help their son, Morgan, who has been diagnosed with autism and intersperses his personal life with fascinating tales about Peter the wild boy and other suspected autists throughout history. The similarities between Paul's child and my own child are incredible so this book touched me in ways that many other books did not. My favorite passage in Paul's book was at the end when he writes \\"It's not a tragedy, it's not a sad story, it's not the movie of the week. It's my family.\\" Well said. This book is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"What's that old pop psych principle?-the one about how everyone tends to use their professional skills to deal with what ever life hands them: Teachers will always try to teach their way through problems and engineers will try to engineer their way through. In Not Even Wrong Paul Collins says, \\"My living is that of a historian, which means I sequence fragments and extrapolate a world from them. I've done it every day of my life.\\" It's not surprising then that, when his son Morgan's diagnosis with autism changed this young father's world, he got to work. Through travel, research, and direct examination with his sharp mind and tender heart, he extrapolated a new world which incorporates autism into his family, community and sense of history. Along the way, as he relates tales of those historic odd balls and geniuses who share traits with his son, he humanizes them and affirms their contributions to the world we all share. Collins also covers a range of information on autistic neurology, thinking and sensory perception in addition to some history of the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, all while giving the reader poignant vignettes of Morgan's intriguing intellect, puzzling behavior and first forays into linguistic interpersonal communication. (Pictures! Words!) That sounds horribly dry as I describe it, but somehow this author has made it engrossing.Among my frustrations (A polite term but this is a review of a polite book.) as the mother of an autistic child is the sense that my family has been isolated. And, frankly, for years the books on autism that I only half-read did little to change my mind. But I enjoyed every page of Not Even Wrong. Collins gets exactly right many common experiences, such as the forced transformation of our social awareness, even if he is reticent about the depth of our fear and grief. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves an autistic person and to anyone who wants to know more about autism.Parents of autistic children take note of this great tip from page 212: Church steps are a good place to sit down and cry undisturbed. All these years I've been forcing myself to keep walking!"},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"We can't say enough about this wonderful book about the author's journey through his son's diagnosis of Autism which leads him into the history behind this multi-faceted condition. As parents of an Autistic child, we've read alot of books on the subject, and are sometimes left with a feeling of hopeless & dread for our future. In addition to teaching us much that we'd not known before about the history behind Autism, this book was unfailingly positive, heart-felt without being sentimental, and surprisingly hilarious! We strongly recommend it for any family dealing with Autism or anyone looking to celebrate that thankfully, there is more than one kind of \\"normal\\" in this world."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"Paul's book is by far the most entertaining and interesting work of the numerous \\"autism from a parent's perspective\\" books that I've read. I found myself nodding my head in agreement and laughing out loud as Collins' first hand account of early intervention, his son's fixations and the families frustrated attempts to communicate with the boy. As the father of an autistic 3 year old son, I could certainly relate. Collins' book is much more than another \\"our story\\" tale of a family's struggle to help their son. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the book is the vast historical and trivial information Collins adds from his research into past figures who may have been autistic. This book would be an interesting and entertaining read for anyone. For loved ones of an austic child, its a MUST read."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"I read this book in one night and read it again the next. I found that the historical and literary context that Paul Collins provided was fascinating and fosters a completely different frame of reference for comprehending and accepting the way in which autistic children approach life and relate to others. The book conveys a deeply held belief that the dream of a hopeful future for an autistic child is not a pipe dream and that these children have much to contribute. As a mother of two autistic sons, I already knew this to be true, but I have a profound appreciation and respect for the emotionally compelling and reasoned way that this author makes his point."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"I first became aware of Paul Collins when his previous book 'Sixpence House' was recommended to me. Sixpence House is a book about books for book lovers. It is an excellent memoir that tells the story of Paul Collins, and his wife's adventures in the town of Hay-on-Wye, the 'book town' of England (something like 40 used bookstores in a town of 1,500). Sixpence House is non-fiction, as is 'Not Even Wrong'; but both books, thanks to Collins' great gifts, read more like the most compelling fiction. Collins is an incredibly talented, and observant narrator. In Sixpence House he brings the town of Hay-on-Wye to life so that by the end you feel as if you've lived there yourself. In 'Not Even Wrong' he takes you on a fascinating history of Autism, pointing out famous autists along the way, as he himself discovers the condition upon the diagnosis of his son Morgan. I won't divulge how he effortlessly weaves together the story of what I assumed was going to be the unearthing of an obscure figure from history named 'Peter The Wild' - a ferral boy found wandering the forest in 1725 Germany -with a natural history of autism, but suffice to say it is elegantly accomplished. In fact I would say that sums up my opinon of Paul Collins' writing - elegant. For instance as Collins says, \\"It's not a tragedy, it's not a sad story, it's not the movie of the week. It's my family.\\" \\"Not Even Wrong\\" makes an excellent companion to \\"The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night\\" also a wonderful book. Go start reading 'Not Even Wrong', you won't put it down, and will be more interesting at parties once you've finished it. More books please Mr. Collins."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"This is not your typical book about autism, and I mean that as a compliment.

Opening hearts and minds for understanding and compassion through this remarkable work.Well done."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"You won't find the rage at autism that so many parents have experienced, or the accounts of scientific and medical detective work that other parents have undertaken. What you will find is a collection of stories of people in both relatively ancient (Peter the Wild Boy) and relatively recent (Henry Darger) history who might have been diagnosed somewhere along the autism spectrum, interspersed with his experiences of his son, Morgan.Another way this book is different from a lot of books written by parents of children with autism, is that Collins uses this collection of stories to look at Morgan's life in its totality, thinking what Morgan might be like at age 40, or age 70, instead of focusing on today's trials and opportunities. Collins thinks a lot further into the future than most parents. On the other hand, using history to think about autism, may not be the best way to go, as quite a bit of research into autism and related disorders is currently under way.If you've already read some books about autism, you might think \\"Been there, done that\\" as you read about important people in the autism community like Simon Baron-Cohen and Temple Grandin. On the other hand, this book is unusually free of the anger, drama and tragedy of many books on this topic. Another thing that is useful about this book is to reflect that autism has most likely been around for a long time.The book is easy to read, and is extensively documented if you wish to go further along the path Collins is treading."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"This book was difficult to put down so, even with a 4 year old to look after, I read it in 4 days. I haven't had that experience with a book in a long time! \\"Not Even Wrong\\" is extremely interesting and informative on the subject and history of autism and the author's own personal experience with his autistic son is a tender and heartfelt thread binding it all together. Not only did it give me a much better understanding of autism but it had a profound impact on my understanding and respect for the unique way my own mind works, as well as the minds of those around me. By taking a respectful look at the extreme differences of the autistic mind, it helps a person become more accepting of the subtle differences we all have between us that, if we work with what we've got instead of trying to fit a mold, make us so unique and interesting. Along with his talent for describing history, Paul Collins has put his heart and soul into this book."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"This is my favorite book on autism, period. I adore it.I am a 30-year-old mom with Asperger Syndrome, my 11-year-old daughter has Autism. As such, I have sought books to keep on hand to give to friends who may be interested in reading about autism. I wish I could afford a whole shelf full of this one!Paul Collins writing is insightful and deep and it flows well - leading from one chapter into the next, it's a difficult book to put down. This book talks about the author's expolration of the history of autism, and individuals who have lived or are living their own unique lives. At the same time as he's following these leads to find out more about his autism, his own son is diagnosed. It's a beautiful story because of the twists and turns, and because of the lives of people it illuminates so graciously.I was given an assignment in my graduate Humanities class to recommend one chapter of a book for the whole class to read. I knew immediately it would be this book, but had to think about which chapter. After much deliberation (there are many beautifully written stories that flow together in this volume), I selected Chapter 16. The passage where he sits on the steps of a church to cry after meeting the man with the painted lightbulbs illustrates how this book speaks on what it means to be human, it isn't just a book on autism.Always eloquent, never condescending - if this is the first book you read on autism you'll start with a deeper understanding. Don't bother reading books that bog you down with those who \\"suffer from autism\\" - this book, instead, is about human beings."},{"Title":"Not Even Wrong: Adventures in Autism","review":"This is a delightful read - not about how to fix or cure someone with autism, but about loving someone with autism and doing one's best to help them get along in a world filled with the rest of us.

At least the ones I've read - they're too predictable. Boy meets girl. They fall in love. Something bad happens, love triumphs. yawn. Okay, if it is a lesbian love story: girl meets girl. Still, same basic boring formula.So, why did I read this particular book - when it was obviously a romance? Ummm . . . well, that brings me to another reason I shouldn't be reviewing this book. I know the author, well I knew her, a very long time ago. I googled her name and stumbled across her books and my curiosity got the better of me.The characters are too cookie cutter - they're pretty simplistic and, too obviously, good or bad. I'd rather see more complicated characters. The best of us have our faults and the worst of us have some redeeming qualities - and most of us fall somewhere in the middle.The plot actually was pretty interesting. Widow looks to hire new hired man . . . and ends up hiring a man - and that causes complications. Janet clearly knows a lot about rural areas, farming/gardening. A good editor might have suggested not sharing quite so many details of what she knows about the \\"dirty\\" details farming. (Sorry, I couldn't resist the bad pun.) Still, the plot moves pretty well - although way too predictably. There's humor and good details about what living in a rural area is like.As for the sex, there isn't a whole lot, but I'd guess way too much for the puritanical, not nearly enough for the prurient. shrug. I fall in the former category - yet another reason I read few romances.If you like this kind of book - try it. If you don't . . . um, don't. So this is my honest review - a book that could have been better, but could have been worse. At least I was able write the review in a semi-literate manner. And I have a shift key and I know how to use it.

He is now probably most remembered for his studies (in what is now Turkey and Asia Minor) of St. Paul's missionary journeys and of Christianity in the early Roman Empire, and for his endorsement of the historical accuracy of Luke and the Book of Acts.In this 1895 book, Ramsay begins by saying, \\"The aim of our work is to treat its subject as a department of history and of literature. Christianity was not merely a religion, but also a system of life and action; and its introduction by Paul amid the society of the Roman Empire produced changes of momentous consequence, which the historian must study.\\" He added, \\"It is, therefore, unnecessary to touch on the authenticity of the Epistles; but the question as to the date (of) the composition, and the author of the Acts must be discussed. If the main position of this book is admitted, it will furnish a secure basis for the Epistles to rest on.\\"He states later, \\"I began with a mind unfavorable to (Acts) ... It was gradually borne in upon me that in various details the narrative showed marvellous truth. In fact, beginning with the fixed idea that the work was essentially a second-century composition, and never relying on its evidence as trustworthy for first-century conditions, I gradually came to find it a useful ally in some obscure and difficult investigations.\\"Ramsay stresses the supernatural character of the books he discusses: \\"You must make up your own minds to accept it or to reject it; but you cannot cut out the marvellous from the rest, nor can you believe that either Paul or this writer was a mere victim of hallucinations.\\" He added, \\"when Luke or Paul use such language as 'the Spirit suffered them not,' they refer to some definite and clear manifestiion, and not to a guidance which became apparent only through the results.\\"This book, like all of Ramsay's works, remains in print today as a testimony to its continuing value to students of the New Testament."},{"Title":"St. Paul the traveller and the Roman citizen","review":"Why is a book that was first published in 1895 still relevant to us today?To begin with, Sir William Ramsay was one of the leading archeologists and scholars of the time. Secondly, and most interestingly, he became convinced of the historical truth of the Book of Acts -- of Luke's account of Paul's journeys -- as the result of his direct investigation of the archeological record.As Ramsay himself wrote, he originally began studying Acts as a guide to the second century history of Asia Minor. Because he accepted the established scholarly authorities of the day, he started by believing that the Book of Acts was written a century after the events that it describes. However, he soon discovered that the actual historical data pointed to the middle of the first century as the only possible time of Acts' writing. More importantly, he found that the many small historical details of Paul's travels were dramatically confirmed by archeological and documentary evidence. He thus came to regard Acts as one of the most historically reliable documents of the ancient world.Ramsay's famous book \\"St. Paul the Traveller and Roman Citizen,\\" broke new ground by demonstrating that historical reliability to a popular audience.Is Ramsay's book still useful more than a century later? It is dated in some respects. A few of his conclusions have been superseded. Also, much additional evidence has been discovered. But anyone wanting to understand the relationship of historical evidence to the book of Acts will still find this book to be of use. It was the starting point for my own research, when I wrote my book \\"Evidence and Paul's Journeys.\\" In many ways, my book is simply an updating of Ramsay's work.I would highly recommend \\"St. Paul Traveller\\" to anyone who is interested in the Bible and historical evidence."},{"Title":"St. Paul the traveller and the Roman citizen","review":"THis was not the book I ordered and I returned it.

Second, I was looking for a book with traces of network packets, linking an explanation to raw hex. After reading this book, Stevens' Volume 1, and Eric Hall's &quot;Core Internet Protocols,&quot; I would not recommend Mr. Siyan's book, unless you plan to be an error detective. Like an earlier reviwer, I too spent a LOT of time discovering and correcting errors. While this did teach me some material in a &quot;novel&quot; way, I would not subject the introductory reader to such treatment. Now that Eric Hall's book has been published, readers can look for explanations and packet traces in a practically error-free book, rather than figuring it out themselves.

It's lyrical at times, always well-constructed, and flows along without interruption. It's not abstract enough to be literary, and it's far too genre for that, but it's clear that every passage was written with a sort of loving care that I don't often see in fantasy.The War in the Waste is Part One of the Ever trilogy. The book's description covers the overarching plot fairly well, so I won't double it here. The world is a strange blend of fantasy and industrial revolution (with magic) -- well thought-out and believable both in its strangeness and its familiarity. Many things are still not clear, but there are two more books to handle that. Keeping track of all of the different places and names for things can be a bit overwhelming, but it's clear that Ms. Savage trusts her reader to keep up, and does little to coddle them. It's a trait I very much like.I don't think I've ever read a book like this one. The characters are both charming and believably flawed. Some things seem to happen so quickly that you have to go back and re-read a passage to make sure that you really read what you just read.It's hard to judge the merits of an overall story when Book One is clearly just the first third of the whole thing. I can't comment on the ending, because there isn't one -- it flows straight into Book Two. This is not a problem, just the way it's written.The War in the Waste is a difficult book to describe. It's enchanting, mesmerizing and, at times, shocking. I can't remember the last time I read a book with such lovingly-crafted prose. All I can really say is that if you're looking for something different in fantasy from an author who really knows how to write, you should check out The War in the Waste. I'll be picking up Book Two in short order."},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"This book describes several diverse cultures in depth and detail.

So, this is strictly from memory. What I remember about the book is that from the book I acquired this \\"insightful idea\\" : that as we learn our own culture we become a \\"prisoner\\" of our ONE culture. We become a prisoner because we only know ONE culture. If we only know ONE culture we have \\"no choice\\" but to \\"live and think\\" WITHIN that ONE culture. But, if we know two or three or twenty cultures we can then \\"free\\" outselves from living and thinking and perceiving in ONE way. We will then have choices BETWEEN more than one way of life, we will have choices between more than one way of thinking and we will have choices between more than one way of perceiving the world. The knowledge of more than one culture gives us \\"more freedom\\" of choice. Thus we cease to be \\"a prisoner of culture\\". We become somewhat of an \\"overman\\" because we are \\"free to choose\\" among many cultural possibilities that people with only ONE culture cannot. And, we can become a \\"participant observer\\" among many cultures. We can choose how to live, perceive, and think among many more possibilities which gives us \\"more freedom\\" of action. This \\"insight\\" has freed me to choose \\"the best\\" aspects among many cultures thus enriching my life and giving me more choices about how to live my life.

The structure of the book is at once so simple, so compact, and so sharply outlined, that it never fails to impress the reader by its analytical rigor and logical coherence. The study of three sharply contrasting cultures--the Zuni Pueblos of New Mexico, the natives of Dobu in Melanesia, and the Indian tribes (mostly the Kwakiutl) of the American Northwest coast--form the core chapters of the book. They are bracketed by three introductory chapters and two concluding essays. The opening part insists on the role of custom in shaping human behavior, the diversity of cultural traits, and the coherence of a culture brought about by a dominating principle. The last two chapters make a plea for cultural relativism and for tolerance towards individuals who do not fit into the dominant social pattern.The diversity of cultures and the coherent pattern that they form are presented as the core message of anthropology. The argument is made stronger by references to other social sciences and by powerful metaphors. According to Benedict, all the possible human behaviors are distributed along a great \\"arc\\" which covers the whole range of possible cultural traits. Each culture then select along this arc a configuration of human possibilities that fits its environment and forms a coherent whole. The analogy here is with language and linguistics: \\"In cultural life as it is in speech, selection [from the inventory of physically available possibilities] is the prime necessity\\"--and capsulated in the famous Digger Indian proverb that serves as epigraph to the book: \\"In the beginning God gave to every people a cup of clay and from this cup they drank their life.\\" Another analogy is with psychology and medical science. The dominant pattern of each culture is compared to the categories used in psychiatry to classify human behavior. Schizophrenia, hysteria, and manic depression are not a bundle of disconnected traits, they form a coherent whole and allows the physician to make an informed diagnosis. Similarly, \\"self-torture here, head-hunting there, prenuptial chastity in one tribe and adolescent licence in another, are not a list of unrelated facts, each of them to be greeted with surprise wherever it is found or wherever it is absent.\\" A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.Each tribal society or primitive culture can thus be understood by its constitutive formula. As the author succinctly states at the beginning of each case presentation, the Zuni are \\"a ceremonious people\\"; the Dobuans are \\"lawless and treacherous\\"; and the Kwakiutl are \\"a people of great possessions\\". Each central chapter develops this fundamental principle stated at the outset, based on observations collected by prominent ethnographers--Franz Boas for the Kwakiutl, Reo Fortune for The Sorcerers of Dobu (and Bronislaw Malinowski for their neighbors of the Trobriand islands), and Ruth Benedict herself, as well as various sources, for the Pueblo Indians. The generalization about a culture's organizing principle emerges from careful observation, which should not be biased by hypothesis, thesis, or theory. There is a fine division of labor between the field worker and the armchair anthropologist. Benedict wants the fieldworker to be \\"faithfully objective\\": \\"He must chronicle all the relevant behavior, taking care not to select according to any challenging hypothesis the facts that will fit a thesis.\\" The anthropologist then rearranges this empirical material along theoretical lines. In a process of inference, he detects patterns and regularities in the observed behaviors and customs. In order to grasp the meaning of a culture as a whole, he first has to immerse himself into a sea of rites and practices, of myths and beliefs. But he also dwells in the realm of high theory, and he draws general lessons from his observations.Another way to express the dominant pattern of a culture is provided by the book's author through the categories of Dyonisian, Apollinian, and paranoid cultures. The Dionysian/Apollonian dichotomy is taken from Friedrich Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy--and from Oswald Spengler, who substituted Dionysian with Faustian--, while the reference to the paranoid pattern of behavior is borrowed from Freud. The \\"will to superiority\\" which characterizes Kwakiutl culture could be linked back to the same authors. These categories were in the zeitgeist when Patterns of Culture was written, and the reference to literary works or to critical theory gives a cachet of intellectual sophistication to the description of primitive rites and customs.Like the social character of the Pueblos, Patterns of Culture is an Apollonian work, built around symmetries and written in a dispassionate tone. Upon closer examination however, this well-ordered structure shatters, and cracks appear in the edifice. There are contradictions between the bracketing chapters and the substantive part. In fact, Benedict doesn't fulfill the program she sets forth in the opening chapters, and she spends the last chapters dismantling it. The three monographs are self-standing and could well be read in isolation from the other chapters. But when replaced in the book context, they are at variance with the general messages formulated by Benedict. The appeal to tolerance and the celebration of cultural diversity (\\"the equally valid patterns of life\\" mentioned in the closing sentence of the book) are contradicted by the cruel and wicked ways of the Dobuans, or by the belief, shared by all tribal societies, that only their members are fully human while non-members are rejected outside the purview of humanity.There is a sense of jubilation, of perverse sadism even, by which Benedict describes the self-tortures that the Plain Indians inflicted upon themselves in their Dionysian quest for delirious visions. \\"They cut strips from the skin of their arms, they struck off fingers, they swung themselves from tall poles by straps inserted under the muscle of their shoulders. They went without food and water for extreme periods.\\" Similarly, she insists on the wickedness of the Dobuans that manifests itself in all their social institutions: in marriage and conjugal life, in agriculture techniques, in religious ceremonies and magic rites, in economic exchange, in death and burial rituals. \\"All existence is cut-throat competition, and every advantage is gained at the expense of a defeated rival.\\" People are all the more treacherous that \\"in ordinary converse the Dobuan is suave and unctuously polite\\".Apart from the question whether what Benedict describes really was true--and some descriptions seem to be marked by the seal of fiction--, we may note that the three cultures presented in the book were by no means stable and self-sufficient. As the last of the Digger Indians remarks, \\"our cup is broken now\\". The Pueblo Indians of New Mexico were just a shadow of their former selves. They had abandoned their walled cities and troglodyte housings long before the arrival of the white man, and were surviving on strips of desert. One may suspect that their formalistic insistence on rituals and ceremony, counting the number of feathers in their masks, was somehow directed towards the ethnographer, and for the tourists that were to follow in his path. Their culture was on the way to commodification, and would soon transform into empty forms destined for outside consumption. The Pacific Northwest Indians didn't even have this chance: by the time of Benedict's writing, their culture had already disappeared, and was only known through past observations. There was certainly a bent towards self-destruction in the gigantic potlatch and bonfires of the vanities that served as a substitute for war and exchange. Where intellectuals like Marcel Mauss or Georges Bataille, impressed by the descriptions of Franz Boas, saw the logic of a gift economy or the accursed share of culture, we may detect the last sparkles of a civilization consuming itself. As for the wicked sorcerers of Dobu, we know less about their highly dysfunctional culture, but one may detect they learned part of their treacherous ways from the white man, who tried to allure them into indentured labor.The claim that primitive cultures are \\"laboratories\\" in which the problems are set in simpler terms than in complex societies raises the question of what is really being tested in these labs: if even simple experiences on a small scale such as Dobu Island leads to such grotesque failure, then one can be pessimistic about the fate of our complex societies, where problems are compounded by size and scope. But Benedict's point in describing the bizarre developments of behaviors in alien cultures is to emphasize the queerness of our own. She practices the art of extravagant otherness as self-critique. If the Pueblos are formalistic, the Dobuans mean and treacherous, and the Kwakiutl ostentatious to the extreme, don't we all share these proclivities? The whole enterprise of describing these cultures, in three chapters absolutely crammed with detailed material of the most curious sort--Zuni passage rites, Kwakiutl chants, Dobuan residence arrangements--is informed with concerns rather close to home. The author focuses on topics that were of particular salience to contemporary Americans: marriage and divorce (the later being seen as a normal development), adolescence and entry into adulthood (reference is made to the \\"prevalence of the petting party\\" among young Americans), conformism and conspicuous consumption (\\"keeping up with the Joneses\\"). In the end, anthropology is seen as a moral science, and the detour through other cultures as a way to adjust our moral compass to new coordinates. Looking forward, Benedict writes, with a touch of optimism: \\"It is probable that social orders of the future will carry their tolerance and encouragement of individual difference much further than any culture of which we have experience.\\""},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"Very, very easy to digest. Anyone interested in the history of anthropology or in Native American Indians will find this book a good read. It's a bit dated, but if you can let that go, you'll get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"I had to read this book for my writing about cultures course this summer. While this book is considered to be a classic work in anthropology, doesn't mean that it is easy or enjoyable to read.Benedict wrote this book with multiple writing styles that made it seem like the individual chapters were disjointed from one another. In chapters where she was not writing about what she knew like the introduction, she uses a very rigid, academic, jargon filled style that was near impossible to read even for an anthropology student. I had to read the first chapter four times to get anything out of it. Then you have the second chapter which is a contrasts with the style of the first chapter because it becomes more like prose with almost a poetic quality in portions especially when she tells the story about how the cup is broken.There is a lot of really good insight about the way culture was studied in the 1930s, and its also provides readers with a deeper understanding of Benedict herself, but there are some portions of the book that you just have to dig through and carry on."},{"Title":"Patterns of Culture","review":"To put it bluntly, this book is garbage. The language is so dry and the tone of the anthropologist so condescending, it makes one picture Ms. Benedict smoking a pipe in an armchair of a library somewhere.This book should come under fire because Benedict let others do much of the research for her. This is a theme revisited in many of her works (i.e. &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;). She received much flack for it, as well she should.

It's really about three or four stories all wrapped together. The stories all happen to be about the narrator, Lucifer C. Dye. Dye was born in Montana, but spent his childhood in Shanghai, China, before and during World War II. Story No. 1 is about how he came to be raised by a Russian-born madam running Shanghai's top brothel. Story No. 2 is about how Dye came to be the youngest Sergeant Major in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, largely on the strength of his perfectly fluent Mandarin (Chinese), and his subsequent recruitment into a government intelligence program. Story No. 3 is about how he got booted out of the program. And Story No. 4 is the main story, wherein he is offered $50,000 (it was worth a lot more back in 1970 when the book was written) to help \\"corrupt\\" a town, the idea being that in order to get the townspeople to vote for a reform slate, they have to be really fed up with corruption. That requires making things far worse so people see how bad the corruption is.Of course, Thomas does not tell the stories in that sequence. Instead, they're all mixed together, which ordinarily I find annoying, but each story is so interesting that the technique works here.There's a little bit of violence, but for the most part, the book is really about intrigue, double-dealings, and so forth.

Why he's the novel's protagonist and first person narrator. Born in Montana and raised in Japanese occupied Shanghai, Lucifer's biography is an exceedingly interesting one. For the past decade he has been a spy stationed in Hong Kong.When the ultra-secretive intelligence agency he works for abruptly hands him his walking papers, Victor Orcutt is right there to provide employment for him on the Swankerton project.Lucifer's much anticipated work in Swankerton really doesn't get underway until the second half of The Fools in Town Are on Our Side. The first half of the book is largely about Lucifer's early life and his later tenure as an intelligence agent. Subjects which are both amazingly interesting to read about.This book deserves a 5 star rating for a number of reasons. The narrative is extremely compelling and substantial. There's lots of action including several instances of sudden, shocking violence. As in all Ross Thomas novels, almost all of the characters are imbued with cynical attitudes that are finely honed. In fact, the degree of cynicism found in the pages of this novel is a delight to behold and is probably its most engaging characteristic.The Fools in Town Are on Our Side is one of the author's best efforts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Fools In Town Are On Our Side","review":"Being a voracious reader - and particularly loving books from the suspense and thriller genres - I can't believe that I've missed Ross Thomas until now! But, now that I've found him, I can't wait to read his other books.For those of you who like your characters fully fleshed out; who enjoy complex plots and intricate stories; who like your good guys with flaws and your bad guys flouted in the end - this book is for you. It reminds me of some of the early books from Thomas Perry - particularly \\"Metzger's Dog\\".Take the title of the book: \\"The fools in town are on our side\\" - it comes from Mark Twain's book about Huck Fin who says to Big Jim that, if the fools in town are on our side, pretty much we've got the whole town on our side - I'm paraphrasing.Our hero - one Lucifer C. Dye - was born in the US, orphaned in Shanghai pre-WWII, and raised in a Whore House run by an escapee \\"White Russian\\" - Lucifer's Tante Katerina - and peopled by a \\"United Nations\\" of survivor ladies! In essence, the skills that Dye acquires here, later in the Shanghai prison, on the ship back to the US, in various schools to round out his education, and later in the \\"intelligence business\\" all blend to create a thoroughly fascinating character. As some other Reviewer has written, this book really weaves together 4 different stories into one cohesive whole. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"The Fools In Town Are On Our Side","review":"THE FOOLS IN TOWN ARE ON OUR SIDE is an amazing piece of writing. The late Ross Thomas not only carved out one of the best thrillers in print but he did so with interesting, unforgetable characters and in an entertaining style and spot on dialogue that make the pages fly. No hack writing here, just a nicely entangled plot, sleazy bad and good guys, and the kind of corruption in secret government agencies that make you wonder if there are any good guys out there without dangerous agendas.I read this when it was new on the book shelves and having just re-read it again I'm still nodding and smiling. Talent transcends time.Ross Thomas was one of those unique writers (I hate to say 'gifted' because he worked hard at it so any 'gift' was the result of his efforts and a present for the rest of us). Thomas left us with a wonderful list of stories and none better than this one.By the way, I hate it when reviewers tell you too much about a book before you read it, at times giving away the plot...'and then he kills so and so because of such and such because he or she isn't really who you think they are, and oh yeah, did I mention that he dies?'Buying a book should be like buying a new pair of shoes.

Kemp during WWII, here conducting a British convoy sailing from England to Malta. Featuring merchant ships and troopliners (instead of the more usual naval escorts), they can't fight back so there's grinding anxiety, fear and impotence throughout-although there's a bit of comic relief for the latter malady due to the WRNS on board, women sailors. There's not a lot about the sea and ships' handling. The focus is on Kemp and members of his staff, and their jobs, strife, connivances, and differing worries about their wives back home in blitzed England. Kemp is echt-English (as is the author), stiff-upper lip and all that, don't give up just because your back's broken. This attitude and writing style makes for overly laconic expression of intense emotions as his convoy is shot, bombed, torpedoed, burnt, or sunk.The book is a quick read, a competently written view of war from the merchant sailors' perspective, but not particularly uplifting or inspiring, true to its early stage of the war. I came away feeling a bit beaten up, so the writing is effective in its own way. Perhaps we can look forward to McBooks or someone republishing these very good sea stories ."},{"Title":"Rhymes and Verses: Collected Poems for Children","review":"I discovered the work of Walter de la Mare poem by poem.

His interest in Mantua apparently was rooted in its architecture, but he produced here a pretty reliable account of the city and republic from the early 13th century to the early 18th. In the time of Emperor Frederick II, the Gonzagas were only one of several wealthy, influential families engaged in political and economic rivalry, but the result of the shifting alliances among them was that in 1328, Luigi Gonzaga had himself elected Captain of the People and Captain-General of the City. A century later, having consolidated their power, they became marquises of Mantua, and in 1530 were titled dukes. The first duke's son married the heiress of Nevers and Rethel and other Italian and French duchies were added to the small but growing Gonzaga sphere. Some of the dukes were notable military commanders, others were significant patrons of the arts and sciences, and one - Eleanore, daughter of Duke Vincenzo I - rose to even higher rank through marriage to Emperor Ferdinand II.

It is unusual to read from a teacher who has not only gained intellectual understanding of a particular system, but has also experienced the reality of its practices.The first chapter 'Fifteen Verses of Wisdom' went straight over my head, which shows I still lack understanding in this area. The chapter 'Talks on Practice' reveals the mechanics of meditation according to the system of Kashmir Shaivism. I found it clear and insightful. This was balanced by the chapter 'Talks on Discipline' which shows that Lakshmanjoo has the integrity to give clear guidelines to the spiritual aspirant on how one should conduct oneself on the spiritual path.Finally in his last chapter 'The Secret Knowledge of Kundalini' Swami Lakshmanjoo gives real insight into the mechanics of the mysterious subject of kundalini. To date I have found other material on this subject to be rather nebulous and mere fantasy, based in the vivid imaginations of so called gurus and well read authors. Swami Lakshmanjoo takes this mysterious subject out of the category of fantasy and clearly defines how kundalini functions. His intimate description of the various modes of rising of kundalini, based on his own experience are truly fascinating.This book is a revelation for the earnest seeker on the spiritual path.Can hardly believe I wrote this review 6 years ago (it is now 24 Feb 2008).Having delved deeply into the subject of Kundalini, I still find nothing to match Swami Lakshmanjoo's explanations on this mysterious subject. In my continued research I have found that almost all writings on Kundalini are based on what is known as the \\"Shat Chakra Nirupana,\\" which elaborates on the six chakras in the subtle body. Everywhere you will find illustrations showing the chakra positions along the vertical axis of the spine and the various petals that emanate from each chakra.After reading the last chapter in \\"Self Realization\\" I wondered why Lakshmanjoo made no reference to these commonly recognized lotus petals that surround the charkas. I found the answer in his earlier book \\"Kashmir Shaivism, the Secret Supreme\\", in the form of a small footnote which says: \\"in Kashmir Shaivism the lotus petals are neither experienced nor recognized.\\"This explains why Lakshmanjoo only talks about the chakras spinning with great velocity and power as the energy of kundalini rises from one chakra to another. Obvious isn't it, since the word chakra actually means wheel.In this book Lakshmanjoo also explains the difference between prana kundalini, cit kundalini and para kundalini; subjects unique to Kashmir Shaivism. Based on his own personal experience, Lakshmanjoo elaborates with great clarity, leaving the reader convinced of his total authority on this subject.For those interested in Kashmir Shaivism in general, and Kundalini in particular, I highly recommend this book, and the earlier one: \\"Kashmir Shaivism the Secret Supreme\\" which has two chapters on Kundalini."},{"Title":"Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism : The Oral Teachings of Swami Lakshmanjoo","review":"One of those books you devour in one sitting!

Swami has an enourmous amount of information about so many topics. It is quite clear that he was indeed a master of his cult.But as I came closer and closer to the last chapter, fundamentalism seem to have overcome the loving yogi. So in 90% of the book he is a peace loving, solve it all with care kinda' guy. But in the last chapter he goes mental over meat eating. Throwing curses here and there.It truly shocked me. That this man so full of love could suddenly change into an \\"angry pastor\\" so to speak. No calm solution to help people realize the error of their ways, no, plain old catholic chock-treatment.Final verdict?He is a master of his line, and hands out a ton of information. There is a lot to learn from him - in more ways than one. But for my taste, I did not like the sudden change of personality towards the end.That said, this is sometimes a tactic used by the mystery schools to frighten people away from their books (just check out the old testament). But it would be too risky to poll that trick with only one man left in the world that holds the secrets.He was no doubt a very good man.

Very satisfactory purchase."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"This is a useful, short dictionary, probably worth its modest price.It is by no means a complete reference work on music notation. Instead, it covers most of the basics, and also a more-or-less random, small selection of less basic topics. This is not a guide for reading music; it is a handbook for people preparing notated scores and parts, whether by hand or by computer. It is unlikely to answer all the questions that would come up in notating any reasonably complicated piece of music. It will suffice, however, to notate a simple piece professionally, in either classical or pop/jazz style.All of the entries accurately describe standard notational practice. Precise guidance is often given as to exact positioning and size, e.g. whether a given articulation is centered on a note stem or a note head, what angle of beam to use for different intervals, and where to place dots. The sections on topics like meter, rests, slurs, and ties are lucid and thorough.On the other hand, precise guidance is often absent. For example, correct notation of the treble and bass clefs requires knowing that they are also, respectively, a \\"G\\" and an \\"F\\" clef, and should be positioned in a specific way to mark those pitches. The entry on \\"glissando\\" fails to explain how to notate the precise rhythm of a glissando (in the sense of its duration, and at what point in the measure it ends). The positioning of accidentals in chords of more than 3 notes is explained ambiguously, but not illustrated. No guidance at all is given on how to notate an interval of an altered unison (e.g., a B-flat/B-natural pairing.)Little guidance at all is given on notating wind or percussion parts.By contrast, several pages are given over to repetitive explanations of the various permutations of \\"D.C./D.S./coda/fine\\" combinations. Complete charts of key signatures in treble, bass, alto and tenor clefs use up more pages (even though the pattern is the same in every clef.) Oddities like flutter-pedaling on the piano damper and heel-toe technique on the organ pedals are illustrated. Overall, the choices of what to cover outside of the basics have a random feel.Large print is used, which means less material is covered, but subtle details of notation are easily seen."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"About 95% of everything you need to know about the mechanics of score writing are in this book.

I wish I'd had this 10 years ago.I read this book from cover to cover and learned a lot. It is brief, to-the-point, and doesn't get distracted by addressing theory or orchestration. It's about the notation, pure and simple.The book is small -- fits into your pocket easily. My single complaint is that the binding is rather cheap. I expect sooner or later pages will begin to come loose - an annoyance for a reference text. On the other hand, at under $10, I guess I can afford to just buy another copy."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"This is a handy little book, including many specifics on music notation, well worth the price. While it may not include everything on notation, its convenient format allows quick answers to many questions regarding formal music notation. I am using it in post-grad composition studies as a quick reference. I'd advise it for all music majors, and anyone with an interest in music writing."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"The 'Essential Dictionary of Music Notation' is in pocket-dictionary style allowing cross-referencing and easy-to-find explanations alphabetically. The range of topics covered is large and the amount of detail useful. It allows the book to be useful both to beginners and to professionals. It forgets that most computers can automatically layout pages correctly, for example, and that some of the theory is nowadays irrelevant. But this is good, and often useful to know when writing by hand and when editing.Illustrations depicts the meaning often. For an example, under 'Articulation' it lists the 5 main types of articulation and then divides them into Durational and Forceful. It then tells you in detail what they all do and how they should be written. Although dynamics are obviously listed in this way, the range and detail of the dynamic, I feel, is inadequate.The book covers traditional notation as well as TAB, and specialist requirements for certain instruments. 351 pages - for the price the dictionary is excellent. Portable and full of information, which can be easily and quickly understood.However, the authors don't try to make out that this guide is all you need to know. A larger book would be more detailed. This is well worth it!"},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"I sequence keyboard music and print out for playing enjoyment. I was looking for precise information on notation layout with a view to standardising the hard copies. The 'Essential Dictionary Of Music Notation' certainly fills the bill. It is indeed a great reference, containing information not covered in many related publications. The price is very reasonable and I recommend this product without reservation."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"Not a bad book for the price. If you are currently learning to read music and need some help understanding basic symbols then this is an excellent little book. I teach music and have run across some symbols that are not very exotic, but still somewhat hard to track down the exact meaning and for that this book has been of little use. But it's been great for explaining and diagramming many other symbols and terminology such as \\"D.S. al Coda\\", \\"Compound Triple Meters\\", \\"Caesura\\", and a long section just on beaming.I certainly don't regret buying this book and though I have a degree in music doesn't mean I know all there is about musical notation. I have used this book many times to remind me of notation meanings I never knew or had forgotten, and I can usually find what I'm looking for in the index in the back of the book as long as my notational search is not too mysterious. I often run across very old, even ancient musical symbols while teaching classical guitar, and like I stated earlier, this book won't have those in it but it has quite a bit of the modern notational symbols."},{"Title":"Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation (The Essential Dictionary Series)","review":"I use this constantly in my piano teaching studio.

This one concerns two families on different sides of religious and political disputes in England. Of course the son of one family and the daughter of the other are in love - kind of like Romeo and Juliet in England without the death at the end. There is action and romance, evil plotting and violence, and just when you think the bad guys are all black they do things that surprise you. Not only a good history lesson but a thumping good read. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Oral History Series: Doing Oral History (Twayne's Oral History)","review":"Ritchie covers the topic like a blanket.

Beware, however, that while the author addresses interviews conducted by individual researchers, the book isn't much good for people looking to do that sort of work. Oral history is a more specific kind of work than what your ninth grade history teacher may have led you to believe (go figure!). I still think that a chapter addressing interview techniques would have been appropriate in the structure of the whole book. As it is, the text is written in q&a; format, which annoyed me slightly, but it serves.Verdict: useful for anyone looking to do oral history per se and wanting a guide to the various theoretical and practical issues involved."},{"Title":"Oral History Series: Doing Oral History (Twayne's Oral History)","review":"We first heard about this book on the radio back in early 1990s...it is a marvelous tool to guide an interview of grandparent or parent, or even self, to record one's memories and family history. The book provided a concise outline to follow so that family history, stories, and memories can be passed down on DVD or CD. We have used it with our parents and given copies to siblings and grandchildren, and learned the benefit following the passing of a loved one - priceless! We even plan to do ourselves for our children. Probably the best and most unique legacy to leave!"},{"Title":"Oral History Series: Doing Oral History (Twayne's Oral History)","review":"David Remnick's Lenin's Tomb deals with the fledgling days of the Soviet Union's collapse. Remnick interviews numerous people ranging from coal miners to Stalin's grandson, Yevgeny Djugashvili. Remnick's interview with Djugashvili ends with a toast; Djugashvili's toast is basically an apotheosis to Stalin, and ends with \\"to Stalin!\\" Remnick describes a wave of nausea, but complied with the toast. Remnick's professionalism, however difficult, is an example of the methods and ethics of conducting an interview, and the basis of Donald A. Ritchie's Doing Oral History. Ritchie's manual is structured as an interview, with questions that address the methods and ethics of conducting an oral history interview. Ritchie's manual places interviews in the social sciences and away from journalism. Doing Oral History is a fundamental manual on how to proceed with an interview, and for it to be grounded in method and ethics.Ritchie defines oral history: \\"Memory is the core of oral history, from which meaning can be extracted and preserved. Simply put, oral history collects memories and personal commentaries of historical significance through recorded interviews\\" (19). Ritchie's manual provides not only the legal and technical concerns of doing an oral history interview, but the fundamental methods of conducting a successful interview. The interviewee is the focus, and should not be forced into answers, because forceful interviewers risk inaccurate responses (122). The impulse to ask hard questions must be tempered, and creatively asked; Ritchie suggests quoting from another source, and allow the interviewee to respond to the quote instead of forceful questions. These examples of methodology and ethics while interviewing is the core of Doing Oral History, and the purpose is to provide future researchers with the most accurate interview that can be made; limiting disruptive variables such as forceful questions, and providing a primary source that can be trusted.Not only does Ritchie's manual describe the methods and ethics of doing oral history, but the fundamental reason for it. The sole purpose to record interviews is to deposit them into an archive for future research (111). The future researchers have more liberty to criticize and analyze the interviewee, than the interviewer originally had (122). Researchers that use oral history interviews can analyze them discretely like any source, and not be concerned necessarily with the feelings of the interviewee. The interview itself can be accurately studied, if it follows the methods and ethics of Doing Oral History; this manual presents the methods and concerns of a social scientist, and provides future researchers a source that can be trusted if its methods are followed.Donald A. Ritchie's Doing Oral History is a necessary manual to consult before engaging in an oral history interview. It provides the methods, ethics, and technical advice, to begin an interview. Beyond the methods of the social scientist, Doing Oral History provides the meaning behind oral history, which is to provide an invaluable source for future researchers. Those future researchers will have more freedom to criticize the method, and the interviewee; like Remnick's interview with Djugashvili; instead of challenging the ideals of Stalinism our interviewer records his response to the toast, \\"\`To Stalin,' I said. And May God forgive me,\\" this interview allows later researchers to analyze the nostalgia for the perceived order of Stalinism, during the chaotic times of the Soviet collapse."},{"Title":"Diving Southeast Asia Periplus Action Gu (Periplus Action Guides)","review":"E-mail links, contacts, maps and description of each site plus how to get there and when to go all very helpful"},{"Title":"Crinkleroot's Guide to Knowing the Trees","review":"The Crinkleroot series is a favorite at our house. We purchased the Guide to Walking in Wild Places a few years ago and still refer to it before taking family hikes with our young boys. We've enjoyed reading any Crinkleroot book we've ever gotten our hands on. I understand what an earlier reviewer says about the information being basic, but I disagree with the \\"being dumbed-down\\" description. I honestly feel that the goal of this series is to be a FIRST look into different nature arenas for kids... and for this, I find Crinkleroot books to be MORE thorough than many. These books are SOLID teasers to get kids started at looking at some details on nature-related topics... then we can expand on that information through leading questions with our kids, and they can turn to more detailed photo guides as longer term references later on, too.We just got this Guide to Knowing the Trees out of the library before beginning a leaf collection and identification project on our own. Upon first reading, it got my 5 1/2 year old self-described \\"science guy\\" very excited about trees... looking out his window and determining what were evergreens and broad leaf (even though the terms weren't even all that new to him), etc. Crinkleroot is always a fun character... especially when kids are able to identify him in more than one book. The character brings a story to the information, and we've found that to make chatter more immediate after reading. I found this book to be a VERY GOOD springboard for further tree discussion! I would recommend it as much as the other Crinkleroot books we've enjoyed!"},{"Title":"Crinkleroot's Guide to Knowing the Trees","review":"The Crinkleroot series is meant for young children, ages 3-8. My almost seven-year-old has always been curious about nature, and we found the Crinkleroot series by Jim Arnosky (one of our favorite nature authors) to be a fun way to help her understand her environment.In this primer about trees, readers are introduced to Crinkleroot, an old man with a flowing white beard who claims he was born in a tree, and lives in the forest. Through a series of color illustrations (beautifully done, I might add), Crinkleroot teaches young readers about the parts of a tree, the various types of trees (those who shed their leaves in autumn and those that remain evergreen), and goes on to make distinctions between deciduous/hardwood trees and evergreen/softwood trees.The hand-drawn illustrations may seem basic but for a young child, the visual appeal is high, and accompanied by a nature walk, facilitates a young child's discovery of nature. We took a walk in our park this fall and my daughter was able to pick some of the leaves out and identify them based on the information in this book. The book also covers the importance of trees to nature and the wildlife around it, as well as a brief write-up about how a tree acquires its shape, and how to tell a tree's age.This is a wonderful primer on trees for the curious young mind, and I recommend the other titles in the Crinkleroot series."},{"Title":"Crinkleroot's Guide to Knowing the Trees","review":"A very basic introduction to trees. Definitions are given to easy (common) terms such as saplings, seedlings, limbs, and the trunk. Leaves of 27 different trees are identified. The book is way too oversimplified to be very useful; for example, it states things live in three zones in a forest, the ground, the middle branches, and the upper branches, but it does not give examples of what lives in these zones.I was very disappointed in the content of this book. It is way too dumbed-down. Perhaps it would be useful for the very young reader (2 years old through 4) who has no knowledge of trees at all. I felt that other than knowing (all of) the different leaf identifications, my five year-old already knows this information based on casual conversation and his own observation!The illustrations are hand drawn and charming, and the main character is an elderly man named Crinkleroot who gives a mysterious and weird explanation that he was born in a tree."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for an Interview and Obtain a Job as a Law Enforcement Officer","review":"This book has a narrow focus that addresses one of the most challenging parts of the application process.It has the information you need, but it is only 54 pages which makes it expensive when you add shipping as well.For me this book was worth the cost as I'm trying to give myself every advantage possible, but if you're on a budget, you might want to consider getting a more general book first and then buying this only if you are still concerned about how your oral interview might go."},{"Title":"How to Prepare for an Interview and Obtain a Job as a Law Enforcement Officer","review":"I purchased this book for my boyfriend who had recently graduated from the Police Academy.

The author was able to suprise me at the end of the novel and leave me with the desire to read other novels by her. This novel deals with solving a crime committed against children and a psychiatrist with a strict code of ethics will not divulge the criminal. Needless to say there is a great deal more to this novel which I highly recommend you read."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have to tell you I was very disappointed when I found out Carol O'Connell was not writing another Mallory book. I really fell in love with her, and I almost did not buy this book. What a mistake that would have been. I listened to this book on tape, and I was riveted. Pedophiles, and other perverts are not usually my choice of topics, but this was very well done. I did not guess the identity of the molester murderer until the end. The other little surprises at the end of the book also floored me. I highly reccommend this book to anyone who liked Carol O'Connells previous books, and anyone who likes very intense mysteries. Bravo!!!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I was hoping for another Mallory novel, but I'm not at all disappointed with JUDAS CHILD. A masterful work from an masterful author!

Carol O'Connell has the ability to make us feel like we know all her characters. From the leads to the extraneous clerk at the police station, I felt I knew them all. Midway through the book I worried that the ending would become too pat, contrived and sweet. How stupid of me to second guess this author. The ending was glorious and heartwrenching.

Rouge is detached and yet haunted by the similarities between the disappearance of Sadie and Gwen and the murder of his twin sister Susan. And then there's Ali who is relentless in her pursuit of an answer to what happened to the two girls. O'Connell presents the story using several points of view. The plot is very well developed and results in an ending that truly shocked me. This is an Excellent read. But don't pick it up and expect to read a little and come back to it later.

I cannot beleive how great this book was. The first book I read by Carol was \\"Bone by Bone\\" and I absolutely loved it.From the beginning to the end I was captivated by \\"The Judas Child\\". The characters had depth, the plot had substance and grit, and the style and tone of Carol's writing was precise.There were many different scenarios and characters in the story, that it was easy to get lost.....if you're not paying attention. This book requires you read attentively, not passively. I have seen the negative reviews and they hold no merit. People zombie their way through life and even a book. There is some resistence to this story that forces you to read actively; it's sad to hear that people couldn't understand or keep up with this book. Put some effort into enjoying some good literature. If you can do that, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This is an intensely gripping, suspenseful, tautly written, psychological thriller. The author, a master storyteller, weaves a compelling tapestry of events, as well as a complex plot in which history seems to repeat itself.Several days before Christmas, in a small, bucolic, tightly knit town, two ten year old girls, best friends, Sadie Green and Gwen Hubble, suddenly disappear. One of the local cops, Rouge Kendall, becomes involved in the investigation and manhunt that ensues. The case calls to mind his own brush with a madman, when fifteen years earlier his own ten year old, twin sister, Susan, had likewise been abducted. She was found murdered on Christmas Day, and his family never fully recovered from the blow they were dealt by Susan's untimely and grisly death. A local priest, Father Paul Marie, was arrested for Susan's abduction and murder, tried, and convicted.Enter Ali Cray, a former classmate of Rouge and Susan, who is now a forensic psychologist. Facially disfigured, she carries with her emotional baggage from her past. Yet, she is determined to make sure that justice is done in this case. She has a theory of the case about which she feels strongly. She believes that one of the girls functioned as a Judas child, a secondary target who is used as bait to lure the primary target into a trap. She also believes that Susan Kendall's fifteen year old abduction and murder and the current abductions are linked, notwithstanding the fact that Paul Marie is incarcerated at the time of Sadie's and Gwen's apparent abduction. Should Ali Cray be proven correct in her theory, an innocent man has been paying for the crimes of another all this time.The author serves up a brilliant narrative, imbuing the two abducted girls with personalities that hook the viewers. Sadie Green is the irrepressible, fearless leader of the two. Creative, resourceful, irreverent, highly intelligent, and loyal, she is a kid who thinks outside the box, as a matter of course. Gwen Hubble is also highly intelligent, as well as sensitive and intuitive, but more timid and reserved than Sadie by nature, a follower not a leader. While all in town are hoping that both will be found alive, it is Ali Cray's conjecture that the child who is designated as the Judas child is quickly dispatched by her abductor. She believes that the child who is the primary target will live for a short time, until she too is dispatched, most certainly by Christmas, so as to wreak maximum emotional havoc.The narrative flips back and forth between that which is happening in the town, not only with the investigation but also with some of the townspeople, and that which is being ostensibly experienced by Sadie and Gwen during their captivity. What happens to the girls is absolutely riveting, as well as heartbreaking. This is a vividly drawn, skillfully layered tour de force that is imbued with intriguing mystery and, at the same time, infinite sadness. The reader is sure to remain glued to the pages of this book, until the very last page is turned."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have only recently discovered Carol O'Connell, and I am working my way through her novels.

A young detective, Rouge Kendall arrives on the scene. As a child, his twin sister was murdured at about the same time as these girls went missing...Christmas Time. The story switches back and forth between the detectives and FBI attempting to recover the girls and the killer and The girls trying to escape.I cannot keep telling you of the story-line for fear of getting a little TOO into it and revealing the ending to you, but I can honestly say that this story made me sweat for fear of the character. The ending came as a total shock to me and that is the main reason what I love this author so much. She is a wizard with mystery. You'll see.While to some people, it doesn't seem all that interesting to you here, you have to trust me when I say that this is the most compelling novel. The first chapter is a bit boring but everything after that is definitely page turning, eye-popping material.I highly reccomend this along with all other Carol O'Connell books as she places great care in the detailing of her stories.

This is a vividly drawn, skillfully layered tour de force that is imbued with intriguing mystery and, at the same time, infinite sadness. The reader is sure to remain glued to the pages of this book, until the very last page is turned."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I had never read Carol O'Connell before and Judas Child was recommended to me by an American friend.From the opening chapter of the man lurking in the lane I was hooked. The characterisation is stunning, especially Sadie and Rouge - I fell in love with both. The novels builds and becomes more complex just as you think you know what is going to happen. The characters change and develop - just as in real life no one is as they first appear and everyone is portrayed in their different and various shades.The passages on the two girls are full of bravery and truth and are heartbreaking too - even thought they are best friends one knows they would put their own survival first.The ending is pheonomenal - I did not see it coming and I found it heartbreaking yet uplifting at the same time. I now cannot wait to read all Ms O'Connell's other books.Judas Child is simply the most imaginative and stirring novel I have read in a very long time. I have rarely felt so excited about a book and recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This is the first book by Carol O'Connell that I read and if her other books are only half as good, everyone will well be worth reading. &quot;Judas Child&quot; had me gripped from the very first page. Due to circumstances I had to read this in little installments over about a week but everytime I opened the book it took only a few sentences and I was inside the story again. I had to be very careful when reading because time just flew by. This must be one of the best mysteries I ever read. Up until now I had that pedestal reserved for Elizabeth George and Minette Walters, but Carol O'Connell is definitely up there as well.Just before christmas two children disappear from a small town. At first they are believed to be runaways, but soon this disappearance is tied to a crime that shocked the town fifteen years ago. A man had been convicted, but was it the right one ? A mad hunt for the children starts that involves many parties. Meanwhile the two children are trying to survive in a nightmare environment.The story twists and turns while always keeping your interest. Strong main characters, interesting secondary characters. The children are smart, but not too clever. Everything seems believable. And when the crime is solved, Ms O'Connell has another surprise in stock that threw me off completely. One last twists that beats them all. Absolutely fabulous !"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"O'Connell's Mallory series is good. This book is great. Unlike most thrillers, which mingle in memory with a hundred other books like them, this novel lingers on your mind for years. O'Connell's adult characters are well drawn and sympathetic, but the little girls steal the show. Be warned--you will be late for work, stay up past your bedtime, let dinner burn on the stove, just to find out what happens to these engaging children. The tension is sometimes almost painful, but delicious at the same time. I have never read another book that made me actually want to jump into the pages and help a character. I hate to use a cliche, but this is a must read."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"It is probably better to say as little as possible about the actual storyline for fear of giving anything away and concentrate more on impressing upon everyone that this is one of those books that creeps up on you and grabs you.What I will do is give a basic plot outline that gets the story started. A small town in upstate New York is in complete uproar when two young girls go missing in what appears to be a kidnapping and, if history is any guide, will become a homicide. It looks like the work of a serial offender. To add a little bit of poignancy to the story, one of the police officers to be working the case is Rouge Kendall, whose twin sister was a victim of this exact scenario 15 years ago. We then follow the story from two points of focus. The first follows the investigators trying to solve the case and find the girls. The second is from the girls' point of view and we get to experience their fear and confusion over what has happened to them.My reaction to this book surprised me a little. My feelings for the characters were mixed, ranging from annoyance to outrage and disgust; Carol O'Connell managed to winkle them all out of me. I thought I knew where the story was headed and how it was going to finish but, as it turned out, I was so far off base it wasn't funny.It's pleasing to find a story that can continue to provoke thought long after you've closed it on the last page. This book certainly provided that for me."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Wow! What a page turner! The story gave me the creeps more after I was done reading it and had time to dwell on the story than while I was reading it. I would have given the book 5 stars if it weren't for all the characters and various law enforcement agencies they worked for that really confused me and bogged me down for awhile. I finally decided it didn't matter to the story(which now that I'm done with the book, it didn't), just keep your eye on the local characters."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Wow... after I read this book, I put it down and I was stunned and speechless. Although it took awhile for me to get into it, I am glad I kept pusing forward. The ending is stunning and just when I think she is wrapping the story all up, she throws another curveball. It caused me to go back and read certain parts all over again! I will definately seek out others written by Ms. O' Connell. Superior!!!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"First thing when you want to shell out the usual exhorbitant fee for a quick paperbook read - flip open the front cover, scan the reviewer's quotes quickly for something from the New York Times, the Washington Post, some big credible reviewer, not a two bit hack writer who's scratching backs with a few cliched praises... Not single words, either - publishers can draw &quot;Astounding!&quot; from &quot;...an astounding piece of crap...&quot; faster than Superman can change his suit. But something's gone seriously amiss when it comes to the quotes listed on the mystery-thrillers of Carol O'Connell - there's not enough to indicate how truly superior to the mass of the genre they really are. I don't have a television, so I end up consuming hundreds of mysteries a year - usually drawing the same amouont of cerebral stimulation from the pages as most people get from their evening dose of sit-coms and funniest home videos. But I curled up yesterday with O'Connell's Judas Child and - despite its pedophiles, savage guard dogs and scarred mystery women - I couldn't stop grinning with delight. Sure, strip the the plot down to its skeleton and it isn't particualry original - the same old 'lawmen trying to hunt down a serial killer.' Still, the flesh on those bones makes Judas Child a joy to read. Each character is superbly developed, original, interesting in his or her own right, not mere backdrop for the detective star. O'Connell's writing is poetic and precise, with truly unexpected plot twists and a pure sense of fun that radiates off each page. Judas Child is so good, in fact, that I forced myself to put it aside so that I could savour it for more evenings before I had to return to the mediocre writing of most of those who share her genre."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Remorse, loss and survivor-guilt activate this fine novel. Though the basic plot is familiar: an unknown predator is stalking, planning, and killing----nothing prepares even the most jaded reader for what follows.Fifteen years ago, 10-year old Susan Kendall was callously murdered leaving her family who include her twin brother Rouge, devastated with grief. When two local ten-year old girls go missing, it looks like history is repeating itself. The modus operendi seems to be that the second child (the Judas Child) is tricked into luring the first child (the princess child) to a rendezvous where the killer summarily disposes Child #2 and keeps the Princess alive until such time as would cause the parents, family and friends the maximum grief. (Usually Christmas Day)Ms. O'Connell captures the two little girls Sadie and Gwen brilliantly. Sadie is everything we would have always wanted as a childhood best friend: fearless, inventive, a trickster of the first order, intensely loyal and an expert on every horror film ever made. Gwen is a highly intelligent, sensitive, very sheltered little girl who is not near the coward she thinks she is.The adult characters are each so sharply drawn; any one of them could be considered the protagonist. Rouge Kendall, in his detachment, almost appears Christ-like. The sensuous, horribly scarred Ali is a driven dynamo (Question: is wearing a long slit skirt, barelegged with very high heels in the winter time really sexy? I kept thinking how breezy this type of getup would be and wouldn't her feet hurt?) Dr. Mortimer is so bound in his rigid ethics, is he insane? The wrongly convicted priest is a symphony in complicated disbelief, and the FBI agent, Arnie, has so many facets, he is a kaleidoscope.The resolution of this strange tale is so subjective and strange; the reader will frenetically go back to chapters to redefine what they have read to reassure themselves their senses are in place. You can't ask much more from a book than that."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Every lover of mysteries longs for that elusive book which will not only stump them, but also throw them such a curve that it will take them awhile to figure out what hit them. Carol O'Connell's &quot;Judas Child&quot; is just such a book. I wasn't just entertained by this book. I was compelled to keep turning the pages. It's a wonder that the author's work isn't banned by employers around the country because it was all I could do to tear myself away from the pages on my lunch hour and breaks and get back to work. O'Connell's main characters are intriguing and complex. Sadie Green is more borderline psycho than heroine but I dare you not to fall in love with her after the first few chapters. Just be prepared! The ending is not a &quot;smack yourself on the forehead....should have figured that out&quot; type of ending. Nope! It's a &quot;sit there stunned then flip frantically back through the pages to see what clues you overlooked&quot; ending. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Frankly speaking,in the begining and middle of the story, it seems boreing to some extent. I guarantee, however, you all will have the first amazing experience when you reach the last 5 pages. You will be able to understand what the real bind between real friends."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The Mallory series are great, and this one is simply brilliant. After readng the last words, it makes you keep thinking about the complex issues it raises; this one goes beyond the simple &quot;mystery&quot;; the only &oacute;bjection&quot;is that there are a lot of interesting characteres which simply can't be developed fully in just one book, because the mystery plot overpasses their personal demons. The author's insight and sensitivity are amazing. Unfortunately, it's too perfect in itself to become a serires, more's the pity... Simply GREAT!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I've read all of Carol o'connell's books, and all i can say is she just get's better and better. I tell friends about her and all they say is 'Who'. When will Carol O'Connell get the recognition she deserves. Judas Child is one of the best books i have ever read, the characters were so visual, the plot so intense, the mystery went to the end, and the twist, well you'll just have to read it yourself to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Why is Carol O'Connell not a household name? I am an avid reader of the mystery, horror, and suspense genres as are many of my friends and acquaintances and not one of them has read any of her novels. I am only sorry I don't have a wider sphere of influence to promote her talent myself, though I am doing the best I can. This latest novel, Judas Child, is another example of this writers extraordinary ability to create a totally enjoyable and completely satifying reading experience. I will say no more about this particular novel. Previous reviews have adequately described it and anything I could add would be redundant. I will say only this: I did not rate it with the full 5 stars because I am confident that there are many more wonderful stories to come and I believe we have only tasted the appetizer to what will be a full 7 course feeding frenzy before we are sated."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"An engrossing tale of kidnap and murder, and the varying flavors of guilt of surviving friends and relatives. This is a slightly over-ambitious, but compelling tale. I could not put it down. But a few flaws emerge. I think Ali Cray, one of the main characters of the novel, is never developed well enough that the reader can identify with her, and there are a couple of red herrings that are never clarified. A vanished ransom, and political sub-plot clutter the book to little purpose.But still a very good mystery, with a couple of beautiful surprizes."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Judas Child is simply the best book that I've read recently. Iread 3-5 novels (mystery &amp; classical) per week and O'Connell'snovel left me breathless. I truly enjoyed the pace of the story and pushed forward eagerly to the conclusion. Although I eagerly read toward the conclusion, I was bereft that the story couldn't continue beyond the final page.The characters intrigued me, as do Mallory and Charles in O'Connell's other books."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This was my first Carol O'Connell novel - but will not be my last! The characters are extraordinary and the plot line grips you; if you're like me you won't be able to put it down. If you like Jonathan Kellerman, you're sure to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"While I feel the Mallory character has shown little personal development in four novels, I find tremendous growth among the key characters of this novel. I also had figured out 'who done it' before the end of the book but this was of minor consideration compared to my need to find out what would happen to these people the author had made me come to care about. I would like to read another book with Rogue, Ali and Arnie (perhaps later in their lives) but my favorite character was Sadie's mom. What an amazing woman. And there is a simple paragraph that describes each fathers' solitary search for their child that I will never forget. I just wish.... Oh well, I don't want to give anything away. Carol O'Connell is a masterful storyteller and I hope she continues write beyond the Mallory series."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The author obviously has writing talent, but is this book just too ambitious and too &quot;literary&quot;? Too many characters, subplots, moodswings, and shifts in viewpoints? What is this book trying to be? The portrayal of the psychiatrist and the doctor/client privilege is unforgiveable IF this is a Contemporary &amp; Socially Conscious Thriller, but if its a Modern Gothic Horror Story, where everyone is off his/her rocker from the very beginning, then the Dr. Mortimer Cray character works. Melodramatic. Enjoyed weeping at the end. Odd and uneven book, but still glad I read it."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I love this author anyway, but this is just simply wonderful and one of the best reads ever."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The artful manner of the author's writing is outstanding. She develops characters so beautifully that I was able to immediately understand their patterns of thinking and enjoy their personalities. Carol O'Connell's command of the language reminds me of Joseph Conrad. They avoid literary cliches and create people about whom I'd really like to know more. When I finished the book, I had a big smile and a very warm feeling."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have read all of O'Connell's Mallory books, so was a bit surprised when I read this one. But it has O'Connell's signature style, wit, and highly intelligent prose. Few false notes in characterization, although like her other books, I had the puzzle solved two-thirds through. This is the only negative I can make about O'Connell's books. She's a wonderful writer. I hope she gets back to Mallory in her next work, though--Mallory is one of the most original characters in detective/crime fiction I've read in years!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Kathy Mallory took my breath away in MALLORY'S ORACLE, but Sadie and Becca Green stole my heart in JUDAS CHILD. What a wonderful story and what finely drawn characters. I love this author's ability to give life and demension to the people who inhabit her world. I look forward to reading Ms. O'Connell for many years to come."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I too was disappointed that we wouldn't be seeing Mallory, but a flawed yet strong female character still appeared: actually one grown, and one child reminiscent of Mallory. The child-snatching theme is very timely, but this plot puts a new spin on everything else I've read in this genre. Carol O'Connell writes the most suspenseful novels I've ever read, but her language is so beautiful and the themes so soulful that she is truly in a class by herself. Terrific stand-alone novel, if you're already a Mallory fan."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I was a bit disappinted when I discovered this wasn't a Mallory story but once I opened the cover my disappointment disappeared. I'm ready for more stories about Rouge and Ali and Arnie. O'Connell has brought an excellent group of characters to life. I bought the whole thing - hook, line, and sinker. More, please."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Wow! Words can't express the impact of this book. When I first discovered Carol O'Connell had written another book, I thought &quot;Great! Another Mallory book!&quot; Then I found out it wasn't a Mallory book, and I was quite disappointed. But, I bought it anyway. Some Carol O'Connell was better than none. It blew me away! I'm glad I bought it. I tried to read it straight through, but finally had to turn the light out at 3 am. I might as well have stayed up to finish it, because I couldn't get it out of my mind while I laid there waiting for sleep. I admitted defeat three hours later and finished it up. Now, I have to wait at least a whole year for another Carol O'Connell book! Oh well, maybe I'll read the Mallory series over - again."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The characters are extremely well developed. The reader cares about all of them. The plot is well crafted and had me guessing until the end. I read this book in one sitting. I've read the Mallory books and thought they were great but I like this one even more. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"A priest and a psychiatrist share one trait in common: they will go to any lengths to protect the confidentiality and privacy of their clients. How far they should go is a question of moral debate, especially when the confessor is a pedophile serial killer. For fifteen years, a priest has been locked away in jail after being convicted of murdering a little girl. The town's elderly psychiatrist risks cardiac arrest before breaking the oath of confidentiality that might have changed the course of events. Fifteen years ago, Rouge Kendall's twin sister is sexually violated before being killed. Her abused corpse is found on Christmas Day.Now a decade and a half later, with just three shopping days left till Christmas, two young girls are abducted. Forensic psychiatrist Ali Cray, neice of the town psychiatrist believes that the convicted priest is innocent and a pedophile has roamed free ever since. Rouge plans to learn the truth no matter how many skeletons must be rattled.In a 180-degree reversal from her renowned Mallory series, Carol O'Connell scribes one of the most profound, absorbing, and thought-provoking psychological thrillers on the market today. JUDAS CHILD is a heart stopping work of suspense, starring two endearing children who capture the readers' soul from the start. Most frightening is Ms. O'Connell's ability to make the audience believe that an ordinary person can cloak the soul of an evil monster. This is a special novel that shows the eloquent and insightful writing style of a master.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The first book I read from Carol O'Connell was Shell Game, which was a huge mistake and I would never recommend the book to anyone. In reading the reviews for Shell Game many people said that Judas Child was an excellent book. In curiosity about the author I read the book. and to my surprise the book was very good.Although the author tends to be a bit overly descriptive in small details the story line was good and does have a surprising twist to the story which leaves you with a haunting feeling. she also has a tendency in both of her books to write about things that are just not realistic and that bothers me. For example, the baseball game in Judas Child and in the Shell Game there was the incident in the limosine. they are just things that would never really happen and are really stupid.I have to say I am glad I read Judas Child because after reading Shell Game I had absoultely no respect for the author. and even though Judas child was good I don't think I would ever read another one of her books. she is just too descriptive and it gets very annoying espeacially because the descriptions are so long that in the end you don't really get a clear picture of the scene it becomes too confusing.I gave the book 4 stars because the story line was good and definitely keeps your interest."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Read the Judas child for our book club.. Had a hard time getting into it but finally at about 43% it all came together.. The ending was a total surprise.. Overalla pretty good read."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This is one of the best mystery books I have ever read. O'Connell excels in creating psychologically complex and believable characters. The dialogue is taut and flows well. She addresses dark subjects fearlessly and with amazing style."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Another unconventional female lead has arrived in the form of Ali Cray, and I hope that Carol O'Connell brings her back for more, a la Mallory. She would need to bring Rouge Kendall and Arnie Pyle along for her to spar with once again. There's no shortage of great characters in this book, and it has a number of slimeballs too! At one point I suspected almost everyone of being the monster who abducted the two little girls, and that's the beauty of the book. Is it the work of a paedophile ring? Certainly the killer isn't alone in the knowledge of what's going on. For once however, my main concern is not whodunnit, but how will Sadie and Gwen get out of this deadly situation. I had so much confidence in Sadie, she really was the hero of the story. And what a Mum she had in Becca, I found her to be such a believable character. She and Father Marie will break your heart. I also loved David Shore (who we needed to hear a little more from) and his house Mom Mary, the herbal tea healer. So many interesting women who had only a small role to play in this unfolding story, Rouge's Mother, Marge Jonas, the Mushroom lady, I loved them all. Even the nasty sub-plot of Rita Anderson, you couldn't be without sympathy for her, and of course Gwen's Mother, who couldn't even be accused of putting her career before her child. I'm off to the Library to find all the books by Carol O'Connell that I haven't had the privilege of reading already. Let's hope there are many more to come."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Having exhausted the following formula genres: catastrophic diseases, millenium mysteries, clandestine county rewrites, forensic forays, detective fiction disappointments and horrific horror mainstays that have run out of gas, I asked my librarian to recommend something fresh and exciting. &quot;Judas Child&quot; by O'Connell was recommended. I do not find child abuse or pedophiles amusing but I read the book. It was tremendous, well-written, exciting, etc. So, I read all of her previous books. Her dialogue is witty yet savvy. Why aren't you promoting her books more? Someone needs to contact Putnam to let them know they are focusing on the wrong mainstream authors who have &quot;run out of gas&quot; and are now just churning out disappointing story-lines just to meet deadlines. I hope O'Conner reconsiders and continues the Mallory saga. Her two new characters Ali and Rouge should also be developed and promoted. O'Connell has given me reason to read again!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I can't remember another book that I have started reading again as soon as I finished it, nor another that reduces me to tears as the end unfolds every time I read it. The epigraph of the book should be Ali Cray's grim admonition in the first few pages: &quot;Don't fall in love with the child. She's dead.&quot; The twists and turns of the story debouch into a conclusion so startling that returned to the first page and read the entire book a second time to see if O'Connell had cheated (violated the logic of her story's world). She hadn't. And standing with the priest and Becca Green at Sadie's grave, tears came to my eyes a second time. What an extraordinary book. The Judas Child is kidnapped to lure the real target into the killer's hands. Like a Judas goat leading the herd to slaughter. A serial killer has been murdering little girls for fifteen years, each Christmas. His first victim was the twin sister of one protagonist, the policeman Rouge Kendall. His last is the daughter of the Lieutenant Governor, and the Judas child he uses to snatch her is an amazing little girl named Sadie Green. It would make no difference, I think, if I told you when she dies. You would know I was playing games with you, and you would be as astonished and overjoyed at her sudden 'resurection' as I was. Some of the most vivid scenes of the novel take place in a surreal cellar where Sadie and her friend Gwen are trapped. And the last moments of their confinement are at once a nightmare, a ballet, and a puzzle. There is a certain cruelty about O'Connell's literary persona, a hardness that echoes Kathy Mallory's, and it is not evident here, nor is it replaced by the cloying sentimentality so typical of hard people. The ferocity of the priest, the madness of the psychiatrist, the toothy meanness of the killer, and the terrible relationship between Ali Cray and her ex-lover all play against the sentimental touches. Will this world go somewhere? Hard to say. Rouge and Ali Cray deserve another book, but they've gone their separate ways. Rouge's career is beginning; Ali has put her monsters away. There is one plot that could pull them back together. We'll see. Meantime, this is not a book to miss."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Reading this book was truly a great experience. I will never forget Sadie Green, the child who was in all ways larger than life. The sensibilities of Sadie and Gwen were so true, so poignant - I will be haunted by their relationship for a long, long time. I nearly wept at the end. Becca Green, Rouge, Ali, all of the characters were beautifully drawn. I had first read &quot;Stone Angel&quot;, which I enjoyed, but not nearly as much as this book. I will read the all of this author's output I can get my hands on."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Judas Child was chosen as our book club book for January and I almost didn't read the book. (They would never choose a psycological thriller) Once I started reading I couldn't put the book down and stayed up way past my usual bedtime reading it. This is my type of book, a page turner, twisted plot and surprise ending. Carol O'Connell is definitely on my list of must read authors."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have heard people describing this book as the best ever written by Carol O'Connell and I must agree. It is simply stunning, beautiful writing style, intricate plot, characters you can relate to, all in all just the perfect book."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Not even The Red Dragon by Thomas kept me so captivated as Judas Child. A must read to anyone, whether they're a mystery buff or not. I love her story lines, not mushy and yet hard lined just so. O'Connell is getting better and better. Can't wait to read more of O'Connell."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I've read many, many mysteries, and this is one of only a few that kept me guessing and was so full of surprises.

I have read other books by Carol O'Connell, and I have liked but not remembered them for long. This one is the same and yet wonderfully different. Great character realization, great setting, great storytelling. I will never, never forget the ending to this one. WOW. I want more like this."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I loved all aspects of this book. Her characters were very believable especially the children. From the time that the twins are introduced until the very last scene with Gwen they caught my attention. These are very smart children and the author treated them like that yet they were still children."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"O'Connell plays with suspense until it's almost unbearable. There are hints along the way, but the resolution doesn't come until the very end. An excellent mystery."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have read many of the Mallory series which I greatly enjoy, however, I could not put down Judas Child and had to stay up late at night and finish it. The suspense keeps driving you to turn page after page, change suspects frequently, and the ending blows you away. Can't wait for another one!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"The abridged tape was interesting, and showed elements of O'Connell's suspense and depth of characterization. Perhaps this is the best that could be done in the time available. However, I cannot emphasize too strongly that this wonderful book is far better than the abridged tape. The detail, the plot development, the mood of the book, the character revelations -- all fit well with her previous strong Mallory books. Skip the abridged tape. READ THE BOOK."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I haven't read any previous novels by O'Connell, but I'm sure to catch up. Even after reading as fast as I could, I couldn't get to the &quot;easy&quot;, &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; ending I hoped for. After I finished the last page (late at night), I couldn't stop thinking about it. It took a while to wind down. Good job, Ms O'Connell!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I picked up a Carol O'Connel book by chance a few weeks ago. I'm now completely hooked on her writing and was thrilled to see Judas Child on the shelves. I was disappointed it wasn't a Mallory novel at first but now .... This is one of the most achingly suspenseful novels I have read in years. Ms O'Connell presents a varied cast of characters in a small community with some dark secrets. Two ten year old girls are snatched and the race against time begins. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the book. I could feel time ticking away and was hoping against hope that somehow the good guys would win out. Carol O'Connell makes no promises of nice neat feelgood endings and I was turning the pages anxiously til the very last. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I feel I've just come off a rollercoaster! =]] *--*/"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Carol O'Connell tells a great story, as usual. Her latest, &quot;Judas Child,&quot; is no exception. If you are new to this author, either begin here, or with &quot;Mallory's Oracle.&quot; O'Connell's characters are intelligent, intriguing, and well-developed. Without exception, I have enjoyed immensely each one of her books. May she write many, many more!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Okay, let me start by saying that as noted in other reviews, the beginning of this book is slow. Believe me, it is worth hanging on through the slow start. This is a book that I have read even more than twice because I so enjoyed the twist that the ending brought. The authors' powerful descriptive writing draws you into the characters of the little girls. You invest yourself in them and that is what makes the finale so very dramatic. Personally, I have found that as an author, O'Connell either hits or misses. With Judas Child, regardless of a slow start, she hits it out of the park. If you enjoy mystery and suspense with an unexpected outcome, give this book a read."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Carol O'Connell has a weird way of writing characters. They're all exceptional -- even the dumb ones are empathic geniuses or brilliant would-be photographers or bodybuilding priests with secret Hannibal Lector worlds of the mind. There are probably 15 scenes where a different character is revealed to be much smarter than most of the other characters took them for. It's implausible, sure, but it's great.This is O'Connell's best, and if you like mysteries at all, you should read it. It's one-half Red Dragon, one half The Secret History, and one-half Crime and Punishment.Even more than Mallory, the Rouge Kendall character cries out for a movie and another book."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I'm giving this book just four stars because I'm inclined to agree with the other reviewers who say it starts out too slow and stays that way too long. (I originally thought it might just seem that way to me because I was expecting the intensity of the Mallory series.)I'm so glad I stuck with it. First, although it takes her awhile in this novel, O'Connell creates really great characters, especially female characters. Second, I've read a lot of mystery and suspense novels in my time. It's rare for one to really surprise me, but this one absolutely stunned me.I think the readers who rated it low either didn't finish it or didn't get it. It's easy to see how the latter could happen. You want to find out who the bad guy is and whether the girls are rescued in time. Once you do, you think, okay, that was pretty good, or not. But believe me, there's a lot more to this story--you need to THINK about it. I can't say more without spoiling it..."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This book hooks the reader from start to finish - I stayed up all night to read it. Her characters are very real, her prose almost perfect - O'Connell reminds one of Caleb Carr with her poetic storytelling. The only difficulty is that all the characters are so interesting and yet there are so many that none seems to fully develop - there is almost no room for all of them in the story. Also, I was left with questions about what actually transpired in certain scenes even though I read them over and over again. Despite this, it was a fantastic novel, one I would highly recommend to any lover of the mystery or horror genre."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"What a good book! I'm french people and i have to improve my english language with books. I usually read book for 1 month or more and it's very boring for me. But, with this one i read it in only 1 week and all over the day i did the reading time! What a good book : well writing, frightening, with great characters. Hurry up, another one please!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I loved this book. Sadie and Gwenn complimented each other so well, one with bravery and the other with the ability to think things through. I was in love with Sadie the moment I &quot;met&quot; her. I empathized with Gwenn and her shortcomings throughout the chapters. These two girls touched my heart and my spirit. So needless to say the ending broke my heart. I will be looking up more titles by Carol O Connell."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I pulled this book off my shelf to re-read it today, and couldn't. Sadie makes you fall in love with her... and then you realize how it has to end. At the end of the book you are sombre for quite some time, it hits you like an anvil emotionally, and I couldn't put myself through that again.That is the mark of some **** fine writing, folks -- writing that touches you deeply. Some other folks talk about various glitches here and there where O'Connell botches police procedure or has an incorrect understanding of the patient-client relationship, and yes, O'Connell has a history of being a bit sloppy around the edges, but all that's just annoyances, not something that changes the overall impact of the book. This is a powerful book, one that is well worth reading -- or re-reading, if I can bring myself to bear the experience again."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"O'Connell delicately works in human interest, seemingly unrelated, stories such as the spontaneous mid-novel snowy baseball game to give the reader a break. And it's a good thing, because this is one of the most complex novels yet by mystery-writing's best kept secret. The ending of the tale left me breathless and stumped. Long after finishing it I was still trying to figure out what had hit me."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Absolutely stunning!!!!! You won't be able to put it down and will want to read it again as soon as you're done to see if you &quot;missed&quot; anything."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Just before Christmas two girls, both students of a local academy, disappear, repeating a pattern for which a priest has already done 15 years of a life sentence. This time the police tactics &amp; techniques are very different. By day's end noone can find either child &amp; old fears take over the town. Quickly the FBI &amp; BCI task forces invade the small police station. One of the investigators is Rouge, a graduate of the academy, an erstwhile major league baseball try-out &amp; the surviving twin of the previous snatch &amp; murder. Profiling is a scar-faced woman, also an academy student, who noone remembers. This is one helluva gripper! Scared the willies out of me several times; fascinating people, fascinatingly written. Wonderful, wonderful baseball game &amp; a tangible, vivid world of very real people. Well done! ..."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This is an intensely gripping, suspenseful, tautly written, psychological thriller. The author, a master storyteller, weaves a compelling tapestry of events, as well as a complex plot in which history seems to repeat itself.Several days before Christmas, in a small, bucolic, tightly knit town, two ten year old girls, best friends, Sadie Green and Gwen Hubble, suddenly disappear. One of the local cops, Rouge Kendall, becomes involved in the investigation and manhunt that ensues. The case calls to mind his own brush with a madman, when fifteen years earlier his own ten year old, twin sister, Susan, had likewise been abducted. She was found murdered on Christmas Day, and his family never fully recovered from the blow they were dealt by Susan's untimely and grisly death. A local priest, Father Paul Marie, was arrested for Susan's abduction and murder, tried, and convicted.Enter Ali Cray, a former classmate of Rouge and Susan, who is now a forensic psychologist. Facially disfigured, she carries with her emotional baggage from her past. Yet, she is determined to make sure that justice is done in this case. She has a theory of the case about which she feels strongly. She believes that one of the girls functioned as a Judas child, a secondary target who is used as bait to lure the primary target into a trap. She also believes that Susan Kendall's fifteen year old abduction and murder and the current abductions are linked, notwithstanding the fact that Paul Marie is incarcerated at the time of Sadie's and Gwen's apparent abduction. Should Ali Cray be proven correct in her theory, an innocent man has been paying for the crimes of another all this time.The author serves up a brilliant narrative, imbuing the two abducted girls with personalities that hook the viewers. Sadie Green is the irrepressible, fearless leader of the two. Creative, resourceful, irreverent, highly intelligent, and loyal, she is a kid who thinks outside the box, as a matter of course. Gwen Hubble is also highly intelligent, as well as sensitive and intuitive, but more timid and reserved than Sadie by nature, a follower not a leader. While all in town are hoping that both will be found alive, it is Ali Cray's conjecture that the child who is designated as the Judas child is quickly dispatched by her abductor. She believes that the child who is the primary target will live for a short time, until she too is dispatched, most certainly by Christmas, so as to wreak maximum emotional havoc.The narrative flips back and forth between that which is happening in the town, not only with the investigation but also with some of the townspeople, and that which is being ostensibly experienced by Sadie and Gwen during their captivity. What happens to the girls is absolutely riveting, as well as heartbreaking. This is a vividly drawn, skillfully layered tour de force that is imbued with intriguing mystery and, at the same time, infinite sadness. The reader is sure to remain glued to the pages of this book, until the very last page is turned."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"A prologue that will blow your mind. I am perplexed to why O'Connel has written this book and then returned to Mallory. O'Connel, I am begging you, please give us more of what we need, what we must have, what we pick up and can't put down until we finish. People, read this book and I promise you will share in my desperation, having the same request that I have each and every day, &quot;Please O'Connel, just one more&quot;...."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Having never read a book by Carol O'Connell before I did not have any preconceived notions. Judas Child had me riveted. I did not even want to put it down to sleep. It is a complex book with a myriad of characters, which is precisely why it is so good. It keeps you guessing to the very end. The most compelling parts of the book are those viewed by the little girls. They are at once fascinating and horrific. A must read for anyone who enjoys thrillers."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Although I found the book extremely entertaining, the counterfactual material regarding legal and ethical behavior for a therapist kept this novel from being as good as it could have. This therapist would have been arrested and charged with obstruction or accesory/aiding and abetting, had his license revoked and been sued by the victims families."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Haven't even finished the book yet and I'm already buying all her other novels! The characters are fresh, interesting and you actually care what happens to them. A stunner!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Are there 2 versions of this book? I can't understand how people found it dull. I also was late to work staying up to read it. Yes, you had to pay attention; but a good book will draw you back again and again to see the nuances you missed the first time. There are no easy answers in Carol O'Connell's books, you must make up your own mind sometimes about what has taken place, or what the characters will do after the novel ends. If O'Connell develops another line of books with Rouge Kendall as the lead, I'll buy them just as quickly as the Mallory novels."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I loved this novel. It is the first by Carol O'Connell that I have read. I was pinned to this book. The girls, especially Sadie, are so resourceful and witty. What gumption! I was late for work for staying up too late reading this one! I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a great thriller. Not too scary, not too gross--just the right amount of fear and creepiness! I've got to get hold of more of her novels!!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This excellent novel kept my attention and kept me up until 2am! I was so impressed by the writing and the plot twists. I would recommend this book to any mystery/thriller reader. I have loaned my copy to a friend and when she returns it, I think I am going to read it again. Carol O'Connell deserves to be a household name...she's a much better writer than some who are!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I had read all the Mallory books, and I'm like an addict - can't get enough of the stories, the writing, the insight, the weird and wild characters. Judas Child was a wonderful side trip off the Mallory road, as deep and chilling as any before it. These kids were real, and their story devastating. It stayed with me for days."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I am a picky reader, and don't often run across a book I can recommend as highly as this one. It is sparkling with intelligence, the characters manage to be very real and yet somehow mythic, the plot is extraordinary, and the surprises keep coming all the way to the epilogue. What a treat. I hope more of St. Ursula's alumni will appear in the future."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This book is more than a murder mystery, it also contains science fiction. It is set in upstate New York where St Ursula's Academy is located. Students wanting to attend this school must be very wealthy, it costs tons of money to attend the academy, plus students must be highly intelligent. There are scholarship students attending. These kids must be very intelligent and come from the very poor who must give their parental rights to the school.Two of the characters are Dr. Myles Penny and Dr. Ali Cray. Both were so bland and boring they could fade into the woodword and noone would notice. That was Ali as a child. She certainly has changed, her face is badly scarred, monstrously so, she won't tell how she got these scars. She wears high heeled boots and shoes, she loves heels, long skirts, slit high up on the sides, and is a PHD in psychology. She is a professor and a lecturer and works with abused children. She is also an expert on pedophilia and lectures on this topic. She is aiding the police in their search for the lost girls. She is the niece of Dr. Mortimore Cray, an aging psychiatrist, who knows much about the towns citizens, knowledge he should depart with but keeps to his code of protecting patients.The story begins with the abduction of two ten year old girls. One of the girls is Sadie Green who has a macabre mind. She is obsessed with scary movies, blood type toys, frightening objects and toys. Gwen Hubble is the daughter of the lady lieutenant governor of New York State. The girls are best friends and only children.One of the officers working on this case is Rouge Kendall. He is twenty five. Fifteen years ago his twin sister was abducted and murdered. The family has never been the same. His father died, his mother became an alcoholic for years and is now in recovery.Rouge became a cop instead of going to college. He went into this field to find out who had killed his sister, the closest person in his life. The family had once been very wealthy. Susan Kendall, the murdered sister was a monogyzgotic twin. She had female genetalia, overies were fibrous knows. The pair were meant to be identical twins. More science fiction.The reader meets Becca Green, Sadie's doting and indulgent mother, Marsha Hubble Gwen's mother, Peter Hubble, Gwen's overprotective father, who disapproves of Gwen and Sadie's friendship. Marsha Hubble likes Sadie and encourages the girls friendship.There are members of the police who are searching for the girls before the maniac can murder them as they did Susan Kendall.There is the priest, Paul Marie, who has spent fifteen years in prison for murdering Susan Kendall. Ali Cray says he is innocent. Until the girls were abducted. Susan was killed on December 25, Christmas. The police must find the girls and the killer before Christmas. The murderer seems to love giving this type of presents to parents. The book is interesting in parts, there are so many characters, it gets hard to keep up as to which is who among police, FBI, lawyers and politicians.There are chilling moments set in a large old house. Some young boys broke a window in an old house, therefore police are called. The owner of the house, an elderly woman, is found dead and has been dead for three days.There is sheer evil portrayed in this book, evil that must be stopped.My two favorite characters are Dr. Ali Cray who is a champion for abused children and does much to stand against pedophiles and talks about how these creatures act. To some reason she has studied much about this subject. Another favorite is Rouge Kendall who refuses to forget his dead sister and is trying to avenge her death.Parts of this book are filled with tension, others are not. Some of the characters are good, others not so much, others unlikeable, still others boring. One interesting part of the book is how concerned parents plus others call in the services of a psychic.Good book in parts, the science fiction sections are fanciful but may one day come true. I liked parts of the book, not so much other parts.The book is set in beautiful, upstate New York. There are big beautiful houses set along a lovely lake. Good escapist literature."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have read all the Mallory books and was disappointed that this was not another Mallory until I picked it up and started to read it. It grabbed my attention from page one and I hated to put it down. Only took me a day to read. Loved Sadie, she is a great character and so is Gwen. I wouldn't mind reading more about Gwen when she grows up and how she deals with her past. The secondary characters esp. Becca were good too. Looking forward to reading her new book a Mallory. Hope she writes another book with either Rouge or Ali in it."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Words fail me. The Mallory Series is extraordinary -- I have never read an author such as this, and am an afficianado of the genre. The characters are off-center and extraordinarily crafted, as is every aspect of these books. Incredible humor, incredible darkness, incredible scripting, incredible characters--you get my drift.Not since the first and second books of John Sanford's PREY series has an author so excited me."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I have read about 100 pages into this book and I don't find it particulary gripping or interesting - does it get better?"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I read this book after reading all the recommendations .. and thought wow, okay, lets try this .. I had not read any of her work before.The first few pages were wonderful and I got myself prepared to get thoroughly absorbed. After *finally* finishing the book, I am disappointed - I found this book's writing style jumpy, with hacked-off sentences where one is left trying to guess what the person was trying to say ... and the whole plot is just kind of scattered. The only reason I finished the book was because of Sadie and Gwen - for the rest, I lost track of who did what to whom and why after the first 100 pages or so - I found the storytelling and the writing style too erratic, busy and unflowing.. the plot drowned in too many characters and subplots .. it just lost me completely."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"Wow, after reading the other reviews here I was excited to start this book. Can't believe it's the same book as everyone else here has read. The girls get snatched then it's a long, long, time till much else happens. Anyway, must just be me as everyone else LOVED this book so much. But I did find it DULL."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This was a good book, but it way too long, at least 50 pages could have been cut. The book was a rip-off of a famous movie, I won't give you the title of the movie or you will know what the book is about. There was nothing original about this book, thou I most say all the characters were well written and interesting. The most interesting characters in the book were Rouge, Sadie and David, who should have had a bigger part in the book. This would have been a five-star book, but I gave it only three stars because there was too much useless information which made for boring reading."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This book started well. It had me setup for what I hoped was going to be a real nice read. Unfortunately, this did not happen. There was so much jumping around, I thought I was reading the script for a music video. I was unable to follow any of the characters early enough to really care what happens to them. But, I did care what happened to the two girls, thats why I finally skipped to the end of the book before I even reached the middle. Something I have only done once before in my life. I can't quantify why these characters failed to involve me, but I can't wait for a new Katherine Mallory novel."},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"I liked this book until I got to the end - I felt it a little too drawn out - but it still kept me interested. However, the author does not wrap things up too well. She leaves us too much in the &quot;lurch&quot;. Like what is this whole thing about the priest and Arnie and their eyes? And what about the conversation between Rouge and Mortimer - what was that all about? And what about Sadie?I really HATE it when an author keeps me going and then leaves me FLAT - which is exactly the way I felt when I finished this book! It's kind of like the Grisham novels - he's got you going all over the place - than blam! - Nothing!This is the first novel I've read by Carol O'Connell and it will likely be my last! I only read it because a friend gave it to me a couple of years ago, and I ran out of things to read. What a waste of time!"},{"Title":"Judas Child","review":"This book was poorly written! Instead of flowing from point A to B etc. it flit here and there in a herky jerky unreadable fashion. Full of irrelevant garbage. They could of edited out 150 pages and the book still would of been of questionable merit. Her writing style is best described as BACKWARDS!, cluttered, unclear, muddled.It was awash with cowflop. It was DULL...BORING.... No action, no thrills. No character interaction. The story was boring. The characters were dead &amp; UNREALISTIC, to say the least! I felt absolutely NOTHING for any of the players. It gave me a headache. $7.00 down the drain."},{"Title":"The Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"Completly false, and I am delighted to see this slop falling into the garbage pile where it belongs. Robert Slatzer was never married to Marilyn Monroe, in fact he never knew her beyond the fan/star meeting on the Niagra movie set. Anyone who quotes Robert Slatzer in their bios on Marilyn are only perpetrating the falsehood, and proving they did little primary research. They paraphrased others without testing the validity of the information. This kind of fake, hack writing is a freak of our times and truly a disaster!"},{"Title":"The Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"I ordered this book for my sister-in-law who had read it years ago and said it was such a good book but she couldn't find it anymore. Haven't read it myself."},{"Title":"The Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe","review":"I knew Robert Slatzer and met Marilyn Monroe on several occasions, and contrary to biased opinion, Slatzer's friendship with Marilyn endured from 1946 until her death. He was a true gentleman, and an honest man. I found \\"The Curious Death of Marilyn Monroe\\" to be a factual, fascinating book."},{"Title":"20TH CENTURY CULTURE","review":"Outstanding book. To bad it is out of print. Mini-biographies of nearly everybody, scientists, inventors, thinkers, writers, entertainers, who made a difference in the 20th century, until about 1990, when it was published. Nearly 2000 names from Aalto, Hugo to Zwicky, Fritz. This book has not been more than an arms reach from me for 12 years."},{"Title":"Past Due (Detective Inspector Carol Ashton Mystery/Claire Mcnab, 10)","review":"This addition to the Detective Inspector Carol Ashton mysteries is one of the best. Loose ends in Carol's personal life come together. As always, Claire McNab weaves a tale of intrigue and suspense. I have read all of the previous books featuring the premier lesbian detective, and have never been let down! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Past Due (Detective Inspector Carol Ashton Mystery/Claire Mcnab, 10)","review":"This is Detective Inspector Carol Ashton's 10th outing, and the author seems to have grown bored with the series. Yes there's a murder, yes Ashton is asked to solve it, and yes she does just that. But it all seems so lackluster - as if the author is obligated to write another and just can't seem to get into it."},{"Title":"House of John Procter, witchcraft martyr, 1692","review":"This is an intersting book on a what happen to a John Procter and his family and land after he was killed during the Salem Witch trails. I gave it a lower rating because it does not have the map incuded that the author keeps referancing when he is describing land marks."},{"Title":"Embrace an Autumnal Heart: An Accrual of Southern and Civil War Stories, Including Fatal Shadows : Little Round Top and the River of Death","review":"I am a great fan of J. Earle Bowden and have five of his books in my library. I feel that he has reached his writing pinnacle in his latest work, \\"Embrace an Autumnal Heart.\\"The 448 page novels starts with the excitement of a 13 year-old boy on December 7, 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and changed, forever, the world, awakening a sleeping giant and bringing the U.S. onto the worled stage as a super power.The first seven chapters of the book tell of quickening changes in the life of a boy coming of age in a bucolic setting in Northwest Florida.Then Bowden does some of his best fiction writing. He begins with a realistic rural hanging, tells of some of the Great Depression hardships, the story of a soon-to-be, Florida governor's part in getting the body of an electrocuted criminal's body home to his grieving mother.He tells of now-gone Panhandle leaders such as Judge J.W. Carswell, General Daniel (Chappie) James, country music star, Hank Locklin and others whom Bowden knew personally.The language of the book is classic Bowden, with descriptions and situations written so brilliently that you are actually transported there by the power of sentence structure that can only come from the pen of a master story teller.I highly recommend this book to those who love history and especially those who lived during the last half of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"Embrace an Autumnal Heart: An Accrual of Southern and Civil War Stories, Including Fatal Shadows : Little Round Top and the River of Death","review":"Jesse Earle Bowden's latest book, EMBRACE AN AUTUMNAL HEART, is his bet yet. With the precision of the poet's quill, he captures the essence of life as seen from the J.W. Bowden Grocery Story in Chipola Country of Northwest Florida. He shares his memories of the down-home folks who always have time to invite you in to set a spell. From the backwoods gopher puller who catches land turtles for food, to the picutesque icehouse that provides 50-pound blocks of ice for those who don't have refrigerators, life flows like the currents of the Chipola and Apalachicola Rivers that run through the county.His recollections of World War II from the vantage point of a country boy on the edge of his teens, will trigger your own long forgotten memories of that era.In the historical section titled &quot;Fatal Shadows&quot; he writes from his lifelong study and knowledge of the Civil War. He mined the documented records to trace the lives of his three Alabama grandsires in the Gettysburg and Chickamunga battles. Using tools of fiction to resurrect the torment of the 1860s, he parallels novelist Shelby Foote's masterpiece, THE CIVIL WAR: A NARRATIVE. Bowden's account is a concise presentation of the Civil War that will intrigue history buffs of all ages. In writing nonfiction, he paints picture-making immediacy, and employs tools of fiction to good advantage in crafting nostalgic stories resonating with heart, spirit and universal remembrance.You will chuckle as he reveals the foibles of real Cracker politics, including little known facts about Florida governors of the past half century, many of whom he knew personally.He writes of the horror and anguish of a family member's murder, from the wife discovering her husband's butchered body, to capture and trial of the guilty perpetrators, and be haunted by the callous disregard for human life.EMBRACE AN AUTUMNAL HEART has wide appeal because of its many facets, including nostalgia, the Civil War, Florida politics and murder, all presented in Bowden's distinctive style. The book is a literary enrichent and well worth your time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Embrace an Autumnal Heart: An Accrual of Southern and Civil War Stories, Including Fatal Shadows : Little Round Top and the River of Death","review":"After almost a decade, Earle Bowden returned to writing aboutrural Northwest Florida. \\"Embrace an Autumnal Heart\\" begins withnostalgic rememberances of the author's childhood in the 30s and40s in the community of Altha 16 miles south of Marianna, Florida.His series of stories under the caption Fiction have somefactual basises.My two favorites areThe murder of federal revenue agent \\"Pistol Pete\\" Bowden (no relation to the author)and the story of the truck driver whose load was a coffin with a newly executed prisoner being transported to his home town for burial is a classic as the driver is arrested because the sheriff figured the coffin was loaded with moonshine whisky. It took theGovernor and a future Governor to come up with a solution.Bowden is a master when it comes to simplifing complicatedCivil War Battles. Here he reviews Gettysburg and Chickamauganot only from an overall perspective but also from a regimentaland ordinary soldier's view. Three of his ancestors had served in Alabama units in both battles.Naturally he could not neglect the Battle of SantaRosa island. Ft Pickens is on Sanata Rosa Island and may have been the location where the war actually began. It is a cause celebre in Pensacola and since Hurricane Kathina will not be visted by car for a long time.Other articles deal with memorable local people: historian EW Carswell, Pensacolia born General Danial (Chappie)James and western singer Hank Locklin.Other articles are entaining,either evoking a belly laugh,nostalgia or sadness. All are a social commentary onNorthwest Florida from Pensacola to Madison County and all fromthe pen of an author who knows and is proud of his heritage."},{"Title":"Great Biblical Characters: Illustrated Profiles of People in the Bible","review":"This books combines historically informed commentaries on Old Testament narratives and personages with illustrations of paintings by great artists in the history of the west (e.g., Michelangelo, Caravaggio, Rubens, Rembrandt, Poussin, Chagall). The authors of the commentaries (Bonnet and Xella) are historians of the ancient near east, and their analyses nicely delineate the characters of the ancient cultures from which the biblical stories emerge. The authors are especially sensitive to issues of comparative religion, including the degree to which Old Testament characters and narratives represent types found in other religions of ancient, near eastern culture. There is little commentary on the art works, themselves; nonetheless, I am a college teacher of a course in Bible and Visual Art, and I am likely to use this book the next time I teach the course."},{"Title":"Shiok!: Exciting Tropical Asian Flavors","review":"This is the best book that I have come across on Singaporean cuisine. My wife and I are from Singapore and we have been away from the country for about 7 years. She is a Chinese and I am an Indian. So between us we know what most of the dishes are supposed to taste like and our favourites put together covers quite a list of dishes. Recently, we started to cook more than we ever used to and started to look for books that would help us cook the food we missed most. We chanced upon this book and we have tried a number of dishes. For novices like us, what we churned out were very impressive indeed. The book is well organised and easy to read and follow. The pictures are fantastic. If you have enjoyed Singaporean/Malaysian cuisine and you would like to try a couple of dishes at home, you can't go wrong with this book. If you are a serious Singaporean cuisine fan and you want to cook up entire menus, you can't go wrong with this either. By the way, I must say the the binding of the book is not very good. I hope the publishers will do a bood job with that the next time around. But despite that, I would give this 5 stars. Buy it and cook up a storm...!"},{"Title":"Shiok!: Exciting Tropical Asian Flavors","review":"Glad that there is finally a book that will preserve our unique food culture for our future generations. The only negative thing about this book would be the way the food is presented.The food presentation is just too nice and classy looking. Growing up eating street (hawker) food, presentation is the last thing on my mind.For someone who has never resided in Singapore, it will be hard to truly appreciate Singaporean food to its fullest. The recipes for Roti prata evoked late night memories of driving to Jalan Kayu, Buona Vista South (Next to NUS) or Al Ameen's at Woodlands for a late night fix of cheese, mushroom and egg prata washed down with several mugs of Teh Cino less sugar (as we say in classic Singlish).How bout driving across the island from Choa Chu Kang to Changi Village just to eat Nasi Lemak or Kuay Chap (not in the book!). Just for a quick fact....here in Melbourne, I live on Latrobe street, and interestingly enough, the Changi Village Nasi Lemak store is just 2 doors away. I've never had worst malay food in my life..though they claim to be the Aussie arm of the original.The recipe for Beef Hor Fun brings back memories of the endless circling of Geylang to find a parking space and finishing dinner off with Tau Huay with yaw cha kwai (Sweet bean curd with deep fried chinese pastry).Again, here in Melbourne's Chinatown, I've never had worst Beef Hor Fun. Even the WORST Beef Hor Fun in Singapore still tastes better than what Melbourne has.The reason?In Singapore, our hawkers specialise only on a very limited menu of say.....3 to 5 dishes? For example, my friend, Junjie who runs a Hainanese Chicken Rice store in Kallang, sells only roast or boiled chicken rice, char siew rice or roast pork rice.China Bar in Melbourne has like 30 different items on the menu...all of them tasting similar. That is...similarly like crap. Most of the cooks coming from Hong Kong, I expected MUCH MORE. They ain't doing their country's food reputation any good.In Singapore, at 2 in the morning, I walk 5 mins to the 24 hour hawker centre (S11) in Choa Chu Kang's HDB heartlands and can find at least 20 of the recipes found under 'Hawker Favourites', all available at around US$2 a plate.Here in Melbourne, nothing starts under US$6 a plate...and I get a plate of tasteless food overseasoned with salt or soy sauce, lacking the essential \\"wok hei\\" or \\"Wok's breath\\". So what is this elusive \\"wok hei?\\"Lets take the simple fried rice. Firstly....there are many types of fried rice, so if New York City only has one type seasoned with salt, here is how you can differentiate a good one from a bad one.If you just taste oil, garlic, rice and soy/salt and the other various ingredients....you have a crap plate of fried rice. If you taste a plate with \\"wok hei\\", you can smell it. It has a deeper flavour that will remind you of slightly charred food. Its hard to explain how it tastes.....as its not the charred taste that you are imaging right now. It is a subtle taste.I can guarantee you it is not charred, but instead, been imbued with this delicately delectable flavour through the hawker's skillful manipulation of the most basic of elements, metal and fire.Even in Singapore, not all hawkers possess this skill. Not all foods require 'Wok hei', but for those that need it, it makes a world of difference.For us Singaporeans overseas, all we can do is to try the recipes in these books and tweak them as everyone should. We do this all the time, so we can share with our Thai, Laos and Vietnamese friends in Melbourne the taste of Bukit Batok Bak Kut Teh or Balestier Road's Hainanese Chicken Rice. They do the same for us with their country's recipes and everyone has been enriched ever more by our shared experiences.Thank god I'm returning home in December."},{"Title":"Shiok!: Exciting Tropical Asian Flavors","review":"I have two minor complaints about this otherwise excellent book:1) The quality of the binding leaves something to be desired. The entire cover detached from the book only the second or third time I used it. Thankfully the stitching is good.2) The prep times indicated assume you're a pro. While you can whip up the beef hor fun right quick, give yourself plenty of time when you're tackling the Hainanese Chicken Rice.It's scarcely worth making these complaints, though. This has quickly become one of the most frequently used cookbooks in my collection (the photos may make this look like culinary porn, but the recipes are achievable by mortals). One taste of the beef hor fun and you will be hooked. The Hainanese chicken rice is a solid couple hours of work that will turn your entire kitchen into a war zone, but the end result is absolutely worth it (it's worth making for the chili sauce alone). The dressing for the jaganan is almost unbearably spicy, but impossible to stop eating. Recipes are easy to make in an American kitchen provided you have a well-stocked Asian market nearby, but there's no arguing with the authenticity--if you've traveled to Singapore and find that your most vivid memories are of the food, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Shiok!: Exciting Tropical Asian Flavors","review":"I'm originally from Penang and have been living in the US for over 10 years. There are restausants all over the US called \\"Penang\\"...trying to brand themselves with this city. Definitely a place where the food culture is intense, flavorful and demanding...a port city with a fusion of Portuguese, Dutch, Indian, Malay and Chinese influence.I do a lot of cooking and have a wide collection of books. And I must say this is an awesome book to add to your collection. A must have for all who appreciate and enjoy Thai/South East Asian cuisine.I have tried the mutton soup and Pandan chiffon and they bring back memories of childhood. Some of the ingredients are tough to get but as long as you are near a Thai Grocer...it can be accomplished. Authenthic? Yes definitely. For Beginners? If you have extra time on hand, yes.

With these two themes, Ms. Clark writes an engrossing tale of 4-year-old Lorie who is taken by Bic and Opal and kept for two years. She is then returned to her family with threats of death repeated to her many times before the couple lets her go.Because of the fear Lorie lived with during those two years, other \\"people\\" have come to help her cope with life.

It kept him and his \\"ride along\\" employee entertained through 8 states!"},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"In Search of History, by Theodore H. White is an excellent and well written book chronicling not only the life of this astounding reporter and writer, but also giving you an inside view into the U.S. from his birth in 1915 to the publishing of the book in 1963. In his early years (1915-1938) he details to a full extent the Boston in which he grew up, as well as going into a small extent about New England and the rest of the U.S. In these few fascinating chapters, he details the history of immigration to the U.S., and how the various ethnicities and neighborhoods functioned. For me in particular, who was only born in the last decade, this view of an America long gone and far removed was both fascinating and informative.In the next section, after completion of his education and after receiving employment as a reporter from Harry Luce at Time, White travels to Asia (1938-1945) to detail the three way struggle between the Japanese, Chiang K'ai-Shek (and his Nationalist forces), and Mao Tse-tung (and his Communist forces), with the U.S. supporting K'ai-Shek. While this era in China is all common knowledge and part of history, to see it the way that White writes it is to see it in an entirely new light. An example of this is when White takes the reader into the party conference (Communist), and reveals many details of Communist thinking that are rather unknown in the West. Also, here, as in almost any situation, White managed to ease his way into the confidence of these men of power, and therefore many parts of what he reveals in this book are not well known, such as how close the U.S. actually came to acieving harmony between the Nationalist and Communist forces. However, White's views on the matter of China differed sharply from those of his employer, Harry Luce (then owner of the Time-Life conglomerate), and so shortly after he left Asia he quit.He next found employment from a variety of small papers and went to Europe (1948-1953) to detail the demilitarization of Germany and the reconstruction of the occupied countries. This section provides an excellent look at an era in history that has been forgotten by the majority of Americans. Take, for example, the European Joint Defense Force. This was a proposal under which all of the armies of the European nations would be joined as one. Long forgotten, this book sheds some new light on this fascinating proposal.Next, White returns home to America (1954-1963), where he publishes several books. He next follows Senator John F. Kennedy through his campaign for president up to his assassination. He was an intimate of Kennedy's, and this section of his book provides an excellent look at that era. He tells of the tear-filled meeting between himself and Jacqueline Kennedy shortly after President Kennedy's death in which he wrote the story that was to label the Kennedy years as the &quot;Camelot&quot; era of American history.This book provides an excellent and in depth look at the world from 1915-1963, from White's (a liberal's) point of view. I recommend this book to the casual, interested, or scholarly reader."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"An incredibly broad overview of one man's very exciting career in journalism, Theodore White's \\"In Search Of History\\" puts us at his shoulder as he explores war-torn China and reconstructed Europe, does battle with leftist zealots and right-wing hoods, and apotheosizes the ephemerality of the world and the fleeting cast populating it. Any journalist, or one thinking of a career in journalism, owes it to him- or herself to read this.One might subtitle this: \\"Enough About Those Presidents, Let's Talk About Me.\\" By 1978, he had ceased producing his widely-read and respected \\"Making Of The President\\" books, deciding he needed to figure out what it had been all about. Such a scenario would bode ill except White lived an interesting life he shares here with passion and candor, focusing always on what it meant for him to be a journalist, lighting on telling moments in time and raising questions about his own possible shortcomings and oversights that help lift this above most journalist autobiographies.Starting out a poor Jewish boy in Boston during World War I, White was a Horatio Alger story who made his way to Harvard with a gritty combination of hard work and belief in himself and the country that produced him. Though best-known today for \\"The Making Of\\" series, White had been a reporter for more than 20 years before that, cutting his teeth at Henry Luce's Time/Life, where the focus was always on individual \\"makers of history.\\" Though he fell out with Luce, he held fast to that \\"compelling personality\\" concept throughout his career, latching on to various figures he met with a curiosity so immersive it bordered on idolatry.\\"What frightened me then, and frightens me still, is how very few men it takes at the head of any state to give it its character of good or evil, of freedom, tyranny, torture, butchery or benevolence,\\" he writes, reflecting on postwar Germany but taking in the world.For those disposed to accept this viewpoint, White offers vivid profiles of such unique and complex characters as Luce, Chou En-Lai, Chaing K'ai-Chek, Averell Harriman, and especially John F. Kennedy, of whom White says: \\"Those who knew him well loved him too much...The man I followed wrapped me in such affection that I have never been able completely to escape.\\" Those who note this was part of White's problem have to acknowledge the fact that they, like so many in the last 40 or so years, are drawing on White's own reportage in making their conclusions.What makes White great to read is the apparent absence of anything else interesting going on in his life. He writes a little about women, his first sexual experience and an early wife who kept him working by spending his money. But you get the feeling he was more devoted to us his readers than anyone he knew in his own life. No detail is too small or too squalid for White to bore in on, and stick with long enough to make come alive in our hands, whether it is poverty-stricken children being worked to death in a Shanghai filature or the quality of napery on a French dinner table.Reading him is like having a curtain pulled back on episodes that come off stiff and square in history books, discovering not only the pulsing, bleeding life behind them but something of the poverty of journalism today, at least where imaginative reconstruction and non-doctrinaire analysis are concerned.He also gets into the stories behind the stories, of his fights to get Luce and other editors to publish his view of the world rather than theirs, of the logistical challenges of being at the scene of great events, of helping Jackie Kennedy craft the enduring myth of her husband's Camelot, and his lasting belief in the importance of his work. Jayson Blair and Jared Paul Stern, take note: \\"Contacts are the only bankable capital on which a journalist can ever draw.\\"I wish I could write this review with something other than a ponderous ministerial tone, give some hint of the joy and humor to be found, the marvelous turns of phrase sprinkled throughout this large book like sand on a beach, and properly credit \\"In Search Of History's\\" Dickens-like method of drawing you into the world he inhabits, until you feel like you know as well as he ever did his fellows and his surroundings.Suffice to say this is White's most enjoyable and readable book despite its length, and next to \\"Making Of The President 1968,\\" his best. Along with that other White's book, \\"The Elements Of Style,\\" this is something no writer of worldly affairs can be without."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"Theodore H. White (1915-1986) is widely regarded as one of the greatest journalists of the World War Two &quot;G.I.&quot; generation. TIME magazine once called him the &quot;godfather of modern political reporting&quot;, and he is best known for his classic &quot;Making of the President&quot; series of books. From 1960 to 1980 White covered every presidential campaign and observed the political leaders who participated in them. He became so well-known that candidates from John Kennedy to Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan gave him unprecedented access to the inner workings of their campaigns. White's first book in the series - the bestselling &quot;Making of the President 1960&quot; (which covered the Kennedy-Nixon contest) earned him the pulitzer prize. Yet White was far more than just a political reporter, as this marvelous memoir proves. By 1976 White had grown both tired and bored of covering presidential politics, and so instead of doing another book on the '76 campaign, he decided to write his autobiography. In &quot;In Search of History&quot; White offers a superb chronicle of his remarkable life and career. Born and raised in a poor Jewish slum in Boston, White came from a family of intellectual Jewish immigrants who nonetheless experienced grinding poverty. In his youth White was in many ways a child prodigy - he was both brilliant and energetic. He sold newspapers to help his family pay the bills, attended Harvard University on a scholarship and became fluent in Chinese. In 1938 White, only 23, flew to China to cover that nation's heroic resistance to the Japanese invasion. He was soon hired by Henry Luce's powerful TIME-LIFE magazines to be their Asia correspondent, and for awhile he was Luce's star reporter. White vividly describes his experiences in China and Asia during World War Two, from a devastating famine to his meetings with legendary Chinese leaders such as General Chiang Kai-shek (whom he despised) and Communist leaders Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-tung (with whom he formed a wary respect). He also met the great American generals of the Asian theater of the war, such as Douglas MacArthur and Joseph Stilwell. White seems to have been present at a vast number of great historic events, and among his best descriptions is that of the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri in 1945. After the war White moved to Europe, where he covered that continent's attempts to rebuild and unite and America's efforts to help. In the fifties White began covering American politics, and then in the sixties he both covered and became a close friend of the Kennedy family - thus becoming (as he reluctantly admits) emotionally closer to his subject than he should have been. White's closeness to the Kennedys was dramatically revealed in late November 1963, when Jackie Kennedy personally chose him to discuss the intimate details of the assassination in Dallas and to write a &quot;final word&quot; about JFK. It was White's &quot;Epilogue&quot; (published in LIFE), that created the legend that Kennedy's Presidency was &quot;Camelot&quot; - a word which Jacqueline Kennedy insisted be used in describing her husband's administration. It is apparent from &quot;In Search of History&quot; that White led an extraordinary life and had many adventures (and misadventures) along the way. He is an engrossing writer, and despite the book's length I never grew bored or restless. Among the thousands of journalists of the twentieth century, White almost certainly belongs among the top ten, and this autobiography proves why. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"This is a wonderful tour of the 20C, to about 1970, by a reporter who followed stories as they emerged in the most important places and with the most powerful people. White was entirely self-made, an energetic and talented man who had some luck but mostly worked very hard.Although many journalists came to scorn White for his nostalgic style late in life - rightfully in my opinion - there is no doubt that early on he was a great reporter of courage and idealism. You see him begin reporting for Luce (and Time) while on a fellowship in China, fresh out of Harvard, when he got into the innermost circle of communist leaders after becoming disillusioned with Chiang Kai Shek. There he met Mao, Zhou EnLai, and scores of others who would go on to great power - the reader feels like he gets to know them personally. He then wrote a bestseller on the experience.In a typical move that showed his nose for a great story and a pioneer of in-depth investigations, White then moved to Paris, where he chronicled the post-war reconstruction under the Marchall Plan. He then returned to the US and started his outstanding series on US elections, the Making of the President. After losing a job at Colliers, and at great financial risk, he made his living almost entirely from books.This is a amazing and trailblazing career, thick with historical detail, but this book is also a memoir that lets you in on what made him tick: he witnessed his father beaten down by the Depression, but heard from him that China would have a revolution that would change the world. This was the source of his original inspiration for China. There are many asides that are both charming and fascinating, such as the time he lost his virginity in China, but also about how he works and what he remembers of certain scenes, such as the moment Zhou EnLai got him to eat pork.Warmly recommended, in particular for aspiring writers (like myself when I read it!)."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"This is one of those rare authors that can make an exciting history jump off the pages at you. And White was lucky: he saw some of the most interesting events of the 20th century, up close and with access to the principal players. The latter part of the book, where he describes the inner circle of the Kennedy camp on election night, 1960, is one of the best passages I have ever read."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"This book reviews the authors life from grade school on and details his collision with some of history's greatest personalities. From Mao to Kennedy, Mr. White's travels brought him to the crossroads of history in the bloodiest century. I read the book in virtually one setting and found it hard to put down and treasure the experience to this day, almost ten years later."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"One of the themes of this book is White's belief that history has heroes, individuals who make a real difference, and change things for good. White does not speak or think of himself as a hero, but I believe that many readers of this book will come to the conclusion that White himself was a kind of hero, a hero in serving the American public through first- rate eye-witness imaginative Journalism.In this fast- paced and often exciting recollection White tells of his boyhood on Erie Street in Boston. His father an unemployed lawyer dies when he is sixteen, and the family lives in great poverty. He works hard and goes from Boston Latin School to Harvard. He tells the story of remarkable people he meets along the way including his great mentor in Chinese Studies at Harvard John Fairbanks. White is a person who deeply appreciates other human beings, and one of the best features of this book is his portraits of many remarkable human beings. Among these are those he will meet in his first real journalistic assignment in the Far EAst , General Stillwell, Claire Chenault , General Douglas MacArthur.White has great sympathy for the Chinese people and tells the story of the inept war conducted against the Japanese by Chiang- Kai-Shek, a villian in White's eyes. One of the stories within the stories, and one which alone justifies calling White as hero, relates to the great famine in Hunan province. Singlehandedly White went to investigate this , and it was his reports to Time Magazine and a chilling conversation he had with Chiang - Kai- Shek which led to massive supplies being sent to the province, and the famine ending. White also tells of his visits to Mao, and in retrospect it can be said that he treats him far too gently. Mao has emerged as one of the most evil mass- murderers in human history and White does not even begin to hint at anything wrong with him.White's reporting on China, especially his criticism of the Nationalists leads him into conflict with his boss Henry Luce. White leaves off writing for 'Time' and eventually comes to write the four 'Making the President ' volumes which is what he will be most known for. Towards the close of the book he tells of his special relationship with President Kennedy who he deeply admired, and tells too of the famous interview the President's widow summoned White to , shortly after the President's death when she was deeply worried about his place in history.There are many extraordinarily well- written and moving passages in the book. One of the best is White's description of the Japanese surrender to General MacArthur and how at the very moment of the surrender there suddenly appears in the sky squadrons and squadrons of American planes, a signal of the great American power that won the war.White talks quite a bit about the craft of writing, and distinguishes the journalist limited in vision by being so involved in the factual realities as they are happening, and the historian who can through time and distance order and see things the journalist cannot. Clearly White himself combines both these capacities in this work."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"Theodore H. White (1915-1986) published this 538 page memoir in 1978. I just happened to check a discussion group on autobiographies recently, on Amazon, and someone recommended this book. I'm so glad I ordered it! I plan to read several other of his books - he writes that well and I've learned so much.In part one, White discusses his early childhood, schooling, and life in Boston, 1915-1938. Each part is prefaced by a short unique \\"thoughtful\\" discussion. Part two introduces the reader to Asia, 1938-1945. White was there thru the Chinese revolution as a reporter. This is amazing. Part three is Europe - 1948-1953. Now I know what the Marshall Plan was all about. What insights this man had!In part four White returns to America, 1954-1963. I remember this period but White offers the reader a behind the scenes look at politics and America in transition as Kennedy is elected, assassinated, and Johnson becomes president. In 1960 White won a Pulitzer prize for his book on the making of a president. He wrote for Colliers and Life magazines, Reader's Digest, and others. He knew all the presidents, many generals and world leaders personally, and wrote about them from his perspective.I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't wait for \\"reading time\\" every evening - it is riveting and so easy to understand. Thirty-three years ago when \\"Teddy\\" White published this brilliant memoir of his action-packed life as a reporter, journalist, author and world traveller, he was on his way to being a major historian and player in the political process. He is relevant today. I urge anyone interested in great autobiographies to tackle this lively, honest book as well as Theodore H. White's essays and other books. Some were even made into movies. I'm impressed! Find a hardback copy somewhere and be surprised!"},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"In Search of History is best thought of as Part I of Theodore White's memoirs with Part II coming shortly after with In Search of America. The latter deals much more heavily with presidential campaigns though this book discusses White's aborted effort at The Making of the President 1956 and gives pretty full treatment to the 1960 book that eventually kicked off the series. But it starts long before that, on the poor streets of Boston where White first got into the news, as a newsboy. From there, White made it to good schools and eventually Asia where some fast talk and talent got him some freelancing assignments. He spent a good chunk of his post-college career in China reporting on the civil war there and then the Japanese invasion and World War II. White really exposes how there really was never much of a peace between the nationalist and communist while they fought the Chinese and in many ways it was a three way war. After World War II, White went to Europe where he watched US generals and diplomats enact the Marshall Plan which he views as an unbridled American success. From there it was back to magazine and novel writing in America and then his immersion into presidential politics. The book ends shortly after Kennedy is killed and White has propagated the term Camelot.There are lots of great tidbits in here. One is the decline of major magazines due to television, a phenomenon we are experiencing again with the Internet. Another is an observation White makes in Tennessee about World War II vets breaking the local party boss and demanding fair elections. Although not every election is fair, we do pretty good at this in America and White suggests that part of the reason is that these vets who fought for freedom and democracy abroad came home and demanded the same thing, breaking the backs of many party bosses. It is just a few pages in the book and not deeply explored, but it was interesting. The book also demonstrates some of White's incredible bias in favor of Kennedy, somewhat striking given my own view that White basically becomes a moderate Nixon Republican over his years reporting on politics. This comes out in a few places, though none more so than White basically taking a story Jackie Kennedy has told him and dictating it to his magazine under his byline.White calls himself a storyteller and he is just that. But he is also a fact and theme miner, someone who manages to pull the bigger picture and story out of little events. As with his Making of the President books, White tells a lot about the American story here, while sharing his own."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":".......how a young man's decision to add Chinese to his college curriculum changed forever his life, placing him at all the pivotal points of history in his time....meeting the men with the visionary ideas........and writing of this journey so exceptionally we all experience the intimacies of every moment."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"I really LOVE this book, have read it several times! I can't believe one person was able to do all of these fascinating things and tell about it in such an engaging manner. The material in China in WWII is probably the most fascinating and tells stories about the Chinese leadership that most westerners don't know. The McCarthy era and the Kennedy campaign and assasinations also were riveting."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"Legendary journalist Theodore H. White (1915-1986) always wrote with great eloquence, but never more so than in this superbly moving autobiography. White begins by describing his impoverished boyhood in Boston's Jewish ghetto and his undergrad days (on scholarship) at Harvard in the 1930's. He then writes with great passion about his years as a correspondent in war-torn China (1938-1945), which included working for Time Magazine, reporting on China's Nationalist government (and insurgent communists), and helping to curb a disastrous famine in Honan (Henan) province. The author's attachment to the Middle Kingdom (China) has doubtless inspired several readers (including myself) to visit that enchanting yet oft-tragic nation. White also describes reporting from post-war Europe 1948-1952, and his days as a returned U.S. journalist during the prosperous 1950's and beyond. Readers get a first-hand look such notables as Dwight Eisenhower, Mao Zedong, Chou En Lai, Douglas McArthur, Chiang Kai-Shek, Joe Stillwell, Konrad Adenauer, etc. We also get an intimate look at John F. Kennedy from his 1960 run for the White House through his tragic death in November, 1963. White concludes with a bittersweet account of returning to his once-tranquil boyhood home in 1976 - now deep in the troubled ghetto of violence and poverty.Theodore H. White was one of the top journalists of the 20th Century, and perhaps best known for his MAKING OF THE PRESIDENT series (1960-1972). Very few writers have ever matched his eloquent prose, which is abundant in this superbly moving 1978 memoir."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"White witnessed China in the late 30's and early 40's, the Marshal plan implementation in Europe in the 50's and the Kennedy presidential years. His writing style is engaging. He was friends with interesting people. He had a stimulating personal life. Altogether, a marvellous book."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"Although the book covers the author's whole life as a journalist, by far the best part is when he discusses his experiences as a young journalist covering the war in pre and during WWII. You get an up front view of what it was like to experience the drastic change that occured in China at that time..."},{"Title":"In search of History","review":"Want a amazing history lesson from someone that actually lived and grew up into the changes of these times... what a great reflection of the past as a juxtaposition of our present and near future...We now live in a time when people can admit this is the worst economic time since the depression and not freak out... yet! Never hopefully...T.White is also a great writer and journalist."},{"Title":"Lost in Seward County","review":"On the back cover of Lost in Seward County, a Saiser fan states she is one of Nebraska's literary treasures. I agree. Her poetry typifies what is strong and pure among those who call Nebraska home. Ms. Saiser says in &quot;Re-Entry&quot;:&quot;I have your genes, your no-fooling DNA.&quot;No-fooling, indeed. Everything about this poet's work is served straight up.In one of my favorites, &quot;Taking the Baby to the Prairie&quot;, she says:&quot;I lift this child to grassland,to kingbird,to cedar and sumac,to long roots hidden like a deer in the draw.&quot;Her words bring prairies to life, communicate their beauty simply and effectively. In &quot;Nine Mile Prairie, April&quot;:&quot;The smell of plum brush so sweet it makes some exquisite nerve ache.&quot;In &quot;Not So Much Bottom Line but Bluestem&quot; she speaks of family ties and friendship, what's truly important.&quot;....and I was ashamed how I had a moment beforebeen promoting myself, trying to get ahead,selling myself when what matters is close againstthe ribsand next to the beating noise of the heart....&quot;&quot;Father&quot; tells of tenderness and touching.&quot;....as he showed me in Kramer's mortuarythat grandmother did not mind being touchedand that those dead, and living, are not untouchableif you are not afraid.&quot;And always, Marjorie Saiser paints a true picture of Nebraska, such as in &quot;Holed Up in Valentine, Nebraska.&quot;&quot;....I imagine the Niobrara,lying low in her white banks while this thing blows over.I imagine a Charolais or an Angus, head-down,turning tail to the wind. Out of the snowbankat the edge of the parking lot, a single stalk of dryprairie grassflops like a metronome. Thirty to forty, with gusts to 50.Life blows on.&quot;This poet has won numerous awards. I say, she won them for good reason."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"Andrew Motion made extensive use of primary documents, including the fascinating letters of John Keats, to explore the personal, social, economic, and political context in which Keats created his remarkable poetry. This biography of John Keats ranks among the most carefully researched, best documented, and most detailed available. Andrew Motion's work will undoubtedly serve as essential critical reference work for English majors.However, this highly detailed approach does make this biography rather formidable. I occasionally found myself lost in the details, searching for some path that would lead me closer to Keats' poetry. This is a long biography, almost 600 pages. I enjoyed those sections most in which Motion examined influences on particular poetry by Keats. In retrospect, I should have browsed some chapters, and even skipped some sections, rather than persistently read every page.I have subsequently read a shorter biographical analysis by Stuart Sperry, titled Keats the Poet (Princeton University Press, 1973) that is better suited for a reader that desires to focus more closely on Keats' poetry, rather than upon details of Keats' personal life. The chapters have titles like The Allegory of Endymion, The First Hyperion, and From The Eve of St. Mark to La Belle Dame sans Merci, clearly illustrating the close alignment between biographical study and poetic interpretation."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"Andrew Motion's biography recognizes the historical circumstances in which Keats lived, approaching new historicist tenets while maintaining a clear focus on the poet's individual life and works. He traces political tensions and medical practices of the time to expand upon the existing academic vision of Keats's poetic life; here he is more than a poet. That said, Motion, a poet himself, exemplifies the sensitivity to the writing process when discussing Keats's work. His criticism of the poems is well-rounded, balanced, and aware of the poet's process of composition. Overall, the book is well-reseached and a necessary addition to the scholarship we have on John Keats."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"Considering how short the life of John Keats was, it still amazes me that his biographers are able to create such weighty tomes. Andrew Motion's take on Keats, while long, is very through and readable. Motion argues that Keats, if not overtly political as say Shelley, was a poet who did care about the world of power and politics and was not content with poems on nature, the role of the artist etc. It's an interesting argument and Motion makes a strong case. The chief weakness of the book is Motion's habit of straying a bit too far from Keats and focusing on his friends and acquaintances. Now in some cases that is fine (his take on Haydon on Hunt and their influence on Keats is superb) but the reader can be forgiven if he wants to skip paragraphs and even pages on friends and acquaintances of Keats who did little to shape his life or his work. If not quite up to the magnificent biography of Keats by Bates, Motion's book is very good and, with his different take on the tragic poet, useful, even needed."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"This biography provides quite a lot of information about the later lives of Keat's friends and of his brother George. The portraits of his most of his friends are well-done, and important, since the poet was dependent on them for the constructive criticism he unfortunately never received from the press of his day. Motion perhaps over-emphasizes Keats' political liberalism but this focus helps to locate him in his day and get away from any lingering Victorian ideas of Keats as a poeticizing pet-lamb.Yet to me this biography is not quite satisfying. The affectionate, humorous, spontaneous, brilliantly insightful man who wrote the astonishing letters, Lamia, and the Odes, does not quite come through. Motion's treatment of Keats's social insecurities is a bit heavy-handed; you begin to wonder how could have had the courage to open his mouth in company, let alone be a great conversationalist.Jane Campion has said that this biography is the basis for her film about Keats and Fanny Brawne, Bright Star. I must say that Motion's treatment of their unhappy (at least for Keats) relationship lacks insight. The reputation of Miss Brawne has risen in the last 100 years until she has become almost a feminist heroine, as in Campion's dull movie. But I don't think this conventional and unimaginative girl ever took Keats seriously as a prospective husband. He was poor and his reputation as a poet was doubtful. Her mother had money, and they probably could have married if she had wanted. Fanny was clearly flattered by his attentions---Keats could write a torrid love-letter---but never gave him more than kisses and quite a lot of vexation. Outright rejection might have been more honest, and kinder. Motion attributes Keats's erotic despair to the fact that his mother (also named Fanny) left him as a child, then died when he was 14. Yes, but Keat's last letters to Fanny make for very painful reading. As with most young women of her time and place, she probably knew little about men, despite her apparent sophistication. She seems more like a young woman out of her emotional depth than anything else.Aileen Ward's biography of Keats, The Making of a Poet, gives a better sense of Keats the man. It is out of print but can be found in libraries and probably on-line. That said, Motion's book is better written than the biography by Walter Bate and he clearly loves Keats and his poetry."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"Andrew Motion's biography recognizes the historical circumstances in which Keats lived, approaching new historicist tenets while maintaining a clear focus on the poet's individual life and works.

It was thoroughly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"This is a book for a student of Keats to explore fine details about his life, poetry, friends, relationships, historical/political milieu, etc. It is a very long, thorough, and minutely researched book. That being said, I recommend it more as a reference than a book to be savored and enjoyed. As other reviewers have already stated (and very eloquently, I might add) the book is so heavy on detail as to be quite a weighty tome. Many of the details are not essential but help to make up the thoroughness of Motion's exploration of Keats. Having slogged through it and getting bogged down more than once by heavy details that I didn't feel were getting me any closer to knowing Keats, I felt terribly depressed by the book's end. I'm a fan of Keats, not a scholar, so I suppose I was hoping to gain new insight into his life and work that the book didn't really provide me with. The overwhelming detail, while certainly well-researched and therefore assumed to be factual, left me with a sense of despair over Keats' unfortunate life. I knew a good bit about him before tackling this book, but I was unprepared for just how sad his life was portrayed here. Poor Keats' life reads like a series of heartbreaks, disappointments, and sorrows caused by everything from disloyal and unsupportive friends and family members to bleak finances to his disastrous health. Keats' life and death make for a sad tale and a horribly depressing read, yet this book is an excellent reference for the student (or fan) of Keats who is willing (or desiring) to examine him in great, painful detail."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"I met Andrew Motion at an Oxford function five years ago. He is a very down-to-earth and humorous man. The accolades that go with this book are, for once, not hyperbole. Well deserved praise for a book that manages to keep the mood of Keats relevant in the modern days."},{"Title":"Keats","review":"This is a thoroughly unnecessary biography by a hack writer who forces his opinions and perspective on to Keats's life. Keats was basically apolitical. Read his letters and poems and you find almost no politics. There are already three fine biographies on Keats, one a masterpiece of biography and literary criticism by W.J. Bate. Motion should be ashamed to have written this biography. Keats is the favorite poet of many people. This biography can't keep his genius and great work from emerging in its pages, though Motion tries his best to botch everything. This focus on Keats's politics is part of the almost thorougly discredited New History that treats context and fact as mere bowling pins to knock over. A disgraceful performance by Motion."},{"Title":"The Cooper's Hawk: A Cross Timbers Chronicle","review":"This book will appeal to Cooper's Hawk enthusiasts and naturalists alike.

This book will appeal not only to people interested in tugboats, New York harbor, canals, history, interpersonal interaction, and ships in general, but it will also appeal to those who are interested in social-historical aspects of New York centered around New York harbor starting with the 18th century and continuing through the present.Aside from \\"Tugboat Annie,\\" a tv show from the '50's I believe, Tugboats is a topic few people know about but this book will really enlighten them. This first-hand account is extremely well-written, and clear to the lay person; even one who has never been on a boat will understand it. I believe that many readers will be extremely interested in this book which clearly conveys its subject matter with the text accompanied by extremely illustrative photos, many archival. The book is so vivid that there were times when I just about felt seasick reading some of the descriptions (Not really, of course, but the way that the book is written frequently makes one feel that one is right there on the boat).It is amazing how Matteson has managed to convey the complicated aspects of running tugboats in a way that a layperson can understand. Although the purpose of many non-fiction books is to communicate with the reader, and to have the reader learn something by explaining things in an understandable way without falling into the \\"jargon\\" that only people already within the field are able to understand, few attain these goals. In contrast, this will not happen with \\"Tugboats of New York.\\" The reader will find every word comprehensible, and will not be at all disappointed. Similarly, I can imagine the reader recommending this book to his or her friends. This book, with its clear style and successful communication, can serve as a model for other such books. It will draw people into a topic that they, perhaps, did not know they were interested in. However, by the time they have finished even a few pages, their interest will be peaked. Although a few other books about tugboats have been published, none come close to this one. I cannot recommend it strongly enough. To not read it means missing a uniquely pleasureable opportunity. Kudos to Matteson."},{"Title":"Tugboats of New York: An Illustrated History","review":"This is a perfect example of not just another tugboat book. The author exhibits his first hand knowledge of the marine towing industry and has illustrated his book with great vintage black and white photos that show the story without being just a collection of boat photos more suitable for a calendar. This is the best book about tugboats that has been published for a very long time."},{"Title":"Tugboats of New York: An Illustrated History","review":"As soon as I'd read the New York Times Book Review of this book, I had to have it. Because I was brought up in the New York metropolitan area I was able to enjoy riding the Staten Island ferry to and from Manhatten to enjoy the sights and sounds of the harbor and the tugs going about their business. I also listened in on a short wave radio to the messages relayed through the New York Marine Operator as the tugboat captains got their orders from their bosses on what barge to pick up, where to take it and so on. This book is delightfully written by someone who certainly knows the towing business and who seems to cover every conceivable aspect without becoming excessive. The photographs chosen are of the highest quality and taken by some of the top names among photographers of that era. Many of them are so good, they are \\"suitable for framing\\" as the saying goes. Their rendition in the book are of equally top quality and the captions are full of interesting facts and are not just taken from the text of the book but can stand on their own. Very informative and at the same time, easy to read, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to all, especially to those of us who still carry that little boy or girl inside of us."},{"Title":"Tugboats of New York: An Illustrated History","review":"Clearly a labor of love, this book is part history, part travelogue, part technical and all enjoyable. Mr. Matteson has been driving a tugboat around New York harbor since 1979. He must have been collecting stories and photographs of tugboats for nearly as long.This book begins with some early concepts of tugs that probably couldn't have been built, but which showed the need. From there it went to the first tugs that pulled sailing ships around the harbor. Then on to the Civil War when tugs were converted to gunboats.One surprising thing about this book s the quality of the photographs. Even pictures dating from the nineteenth century look almost new when compared with the quality of picture normally seen. The commentary that goes with the picture is often very insightful, pointing out things that we uninitiated would never notice.This is a fascinating book that describes just one aspect of New York history that isn't wekk known at all. It makes for very enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Tugboats of New York: An Illustrated History","review":"I have never purchased a book on-line because I prefer to see the actual book and look through it.

The evolution of towing in New York is thoroughly addressed, and it is a pleasure to read something that is technically correct and authoritative.My only issue is with the photographs chosen for the book. Many are \\"mood\\", general harbor, or detail shots, and although visually striking, they do not illustrate the tugboats themselves very well. There are very few portrait style pictures, particulary of post-WW II diesel boats, making it difficult to obtain a good understanding of how the tugs evolved over time and to see how the designs used by various companies differed. In a book billed as an \\"illustrated history\\" I would have expected to see a more comprehensive and illustrative selection of photographs or a more extensive series of line drawings and selected deck plans. I must say that the reproduction quality of the photos presented is excellent and a cut above what one would normally find in a book such as this.Having said all of this, I think it is well worth reading, and the writing sets a standard of quality seldon seen in maritime-related books published in the U.

What all amateur and many professional web designers need is to understand that it's not enough to simply throw up a site, with no concept of color, layout, and *real* design theory. New web designers need the basics, yes, but more, much more, and Lynda Weinman is not the person to provide it. (David Siegel is.)"},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"I own several of Weinman's books and I find them all very helpful. The most useful part for me is the non-dithering colors by hue charts (she also maintains these online). Even if the colors in the book don't exactly match what comes up on the Web, I can get a close enough match with the hex codes she provides. Overall I think she produces a very good series. I have to keep my copies under lock and key at work because they tend to &quot;walk&quot; otherwise. I mention Weinman's books in both of the books I wrote. That should be good testimony!"},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"While there's nothing in this book that you can't find on the web already, it's a big comfort having it all down on paper and within easy reach. I must look at this book two or three times each day - I'd be lost without the colour tables and combinations. Every web designer should have a copy (I know some who need it BAD!)."},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"This book is only good from the artistic point of view. It deals greatly with color, font, and graphics, but very little time is spent on the mechanics of page building or anything else practical. Most people allready know what looks good and what doesn't. They aren't born knowing how to make a good web page, and this book won't get them any closer to knowing."},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"Not being an expert in web design, I purchased this book in the hopes of getting tips and tricks on how to make my graphics and text look good on the web. I read the book cover to cover and extracted extremely valuable information from each chapter. From browser-safe color to effects with graphics, this book tells all in a down-to-earth, humorous style that is quite easy to read. Since the purchase of this book, I've purchased all other books by Lynda. Thank you Lynda for your wonderful insight!"},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"I am a college student here at my local University and am currently taking a web design course.

Thanks for the wonderful book."},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"With technology changing so rapidly, now is not the time to overwhelm people with egotistical rantings or attempt to impose your ideas/ways upon the rest of us because you'll be outdated so quickly. It's also sooooo boring!I need information that works, that's useful, and makes sense. Like many of us on budgets and slim on resources, the requirement is &quot;don't waste my time or money because I won't buy your titles again or recommend you to anyone&quot;. Lynda Weinman's book goes the distance in satisfying those requirements.As a newcomer to all of these things of Web design, typography, etc., I must say Lynda Weinman's book has inspired me with well rounded topics all under one cover. The fact that she admits to not having experience before she wrote the book is a blessing and inspired me even more because her thinking was reminiscent of my own, therefore drawing me in and not disappointing.For those people who are struggling with how to get started and stay involved, this book goes a long way. I thank Lynda for saving me a lot of time, saving me from a lot of frustration, providing clarity into topics I wouldn't have thought about, really doing a lot of homework on colors and graphics, and providing additional resources for me to continue learning and thinking.I don't expect to find all the answers in one book because then I leave out one of the greater possibilities; my own creative thought and where it gets interjected into the process as I learn what works. I'm forced to continue using my brain and explore. What a concept in this whiny, do-it-all-for-me-quick-and-easy age of evolution!Thanx much Lynda because you've also impressed the need to study traditional design, network with others, and look beyond the obvious. You don't condescend to people or overwhelm them with ego as other authors do in their guides. This book is a great start and I will continue to refer back to it as well as buy the updates even as I become more advanced.Education is power, learning is the &quot;bomb&quot;!

I was a bit disappointed with DWG 2. The best parts of the book are covered three-fold in Coloring Web Graphics. If you're looking for a good web design book beyond a beginner's level, I suggest Siegel's Creating Killer Websites. I did enjoy Lynda's writing though and recommend Coloring Web Graphics to designers of all levels."},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"The book is more about colors, file formats and lots of other stuff you need to know as a web publisher than actual design, design, design.

Talk about a wonderful combination! With Designing Web Graphics.2 and Web Publishing Unleashed Professional you have all the ammo you need to create truly amazing web pages that work!One of the most amazing things is that before these two books came along, the other 2 books I used every day were: Web Publishing Unleashed 1st edition and Designing Web Graphics.1, I guess I have Weinman and Stanek on the brain. ;-)Still, no other authors in print today make as much sense as Weinman and Stanek.

Lynda covers almost every topic, but at such a shallow level that it will only prompt you to go out and buy more detailed books on the topics that interest you.One thing that's misleading is the title. This book is not about &quot;designing&quot; web graphics; if anything, it's got more basic HTML tips than tips on creating graphics. If you need HTML tips buy an HTML book.

However I find very vague and frankly, I quickly get tired of this self-advertising both her and Siegel make all the time about themselves. Every other line we have to read her tale of &quot;I did this&quot; and &quot;read my other book&quot; and of course, &quot;here is my URL&quot;. Sure it is necessary and honest if one talks about one's experience, but I believe this is too much. I also find that Weinman's objective is on quantity and not quality: a lot of things here are easily DISPENSABLE, even if you are a beginner, not to mention the useless Photoshop and Illustrator classes she gives (if I want to learn about Photoshop, I will buy a book about it). Finally, I agree with someone here that mentioned the (lack of) quality of her own site: I only trust Lynda on some technical info, never because of her (poor) design skills."},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"If you've hacked with graphics without actually understanding what you're doing, this is the book for you.

I take my copy from my desk on trips to the water cooler!)"},{"Title":"Designing Web Graphics 2","review":"Enough debate over whether to buy Creating Killer Web Sites or Designing Web Graphics. I say both books are a waste of your money and your time. These books and a $1.25 will buy you a cup of coffee, if you're lucky and if you don't go to Starbucks. The heart of the issue for both of these books is the personal design tastes of the authors. Neither Weinman or Siegel has a corner on the design market. Nothing in either of these books hasn't been said dozens of times by dozens of different writers already.Publishers are getting fat off the fallacy that you must have design books to help you create wonderful Web sites. Heck, they'd love it if we all kept on buying these overpriced and overrated books. Ever wonder why Seigal's book costs $45 and isn't even 300 pages? Ever wonder why Weinman's book costs $55 and is only 325 pages? I'll give you a hint, its not because the books are printed with fancy colors. Magazines print in full color and charge only a few bucks. The real answer is that there's a wonderful profit margin on a book that is marked up 200-300% over what it reasonably should be priced at and if the buying public (me and you) is dumb enough to pay through the nose, the publishers are going to ensure the shelves are full.Instead of buying in to the fallacy that you need a design book or two or three, I say look elsewhere. I good book that focuses on the core issues of Web publishing as well as design will carry you much further. The book should focus on content, design and execution (which are three ingredients for a great web site). And, NO, you don't have to buy separate books on each of these subjects. Just find one that is comprehensive enough to meet your needs. The most comprehensive guide to Web publishing that I have found is William Stanek's WEB PUBLISHING UNLEASHED PROFESSIONAL. The book is a massive tome at 1500 pages and certainly has everything you need to create truly wonderful Web sites. Throughout the book Stanek explores content, execution and design issues, which are the keys to your success.At any rate, books that focus on core issues will take you further every single time. Keep clear of design-only books and you will be much happier.

The only problem I see is the art work. Every Osprey book I've read so far has amazing illustrations. This one however seems as though it was thown to a random staff member who likes to draw. The illustrations seem much more like japanese anime than anything else. It doesnt seem like any of the images were taken seriously and it was hard for me to take them seriously seeing as I felt like I was watching an episode of Pokeman. This aside, its still a great booklet and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pictish Warrior AD 297-841","review":"This is a typical Osprey book. A great introduction to a specific topic. It has many color illustrations and maps. Not many books written about the Picts. This is a good introduction to the style of warfare in Great Britain toward the end of the Roman Empire. I like these books because they give you a general background and then suggestions for further reading. The book is only 64 pages so it will only take an afternoon to read it. Very little detail, but enough info to get you started and give you the ability to talk about the subject. The following is an \\"About This Book\\" quote from the Osprey website which is not included on the Amazon.com site. It is helpful. \\"First mentioned by name in AD 297, the Picts inhabited Northern Britain from the end of the 3rd century AD to the 9th. They rose to power in the devastation following Emperor Septimus Severus's repression of the Caledonians in AD 208, and dominated Northern Britain for over 500 years, before vanishing mysteriously. The Picts represent a high point of Celtic civilisation, remaining free and unconquered beyond the borders of the Roman world, and rising to become the first barbarians to form a recognisable 'nation'. This title takes a detailed look at their origins, and examines Pictish heroic and warrior society, covering education and training, appearance and equipment, the status of women, and the experience of battle.\\""},{"Title":"Pictish Warrior AD 297-841","review":"A fine book. The author uses a combination of Roman historians, Welsh and Gaelic mythology, and archaeology to paint a believable picture of the fearsome warrior culture today called 'Picts'. He examines their origins as a people, the origin of their name (it may well be a tribal name in their own tongue, rather than from Latin 'painted'), and their history with the late Romans, the Anglo-Saxons, the Gaels, the Norse, and the Scots who finally assimilated them. The text also details the daily life of the noble warrior, the warband on campaign, and the philosophies by which the Celtic warrior in general lived. What little is known of Pictish armor, costume, weaponry, and battle tactics is also detailed. The plates, by Wayne Reynolds are excellent and do a fine job of supporting the text.Plate A shows a Caledonian warrior at the time of Septimius Severus' Scottish campaigns of the beginning of the 3rd Century. The Caledonians are often said to be the same as the Picts, but appear to have been a Brythonic-speaking people (similar to the southern Britons) that were assimilated by the PictsPlate B shows characters from Irish myth recreated as Pictish warriors. These are Chulainn and Scathach training at the latter's School of War, while other champions and students look on.Plate C shows a Pictish boat, like they may have used to carry out piratical raidsPlate D shows a Pictish raid on Hadrian's wall in the 4th Century AD. Several heavily tattooed Picts are shown in combat with Romano-British soldiers. Some of the Celts are also shown fighting naked in the traditional manner, and one is using a lasso to pull a defender off the wall.Plate E shows different Pictish weapons, swords, bucklers, axes, and a spear.Plate F gives us two warriors of the later Pictish period, a noble horse-warrior in scale armor, and a common warrior with a pike and buckler. The illustrator illustrated most of his Picts, even the later ones, with swirling tatooes on at least their lower legs.Plate G shows the 'Law of the Innocents'; a Pictish warrior-woman was killed in battle with Northumbrians, and upon the sight of her child sobbing at her breast, the mother of the Abbot of Iona forced him to pass a law in which women were forbidden from going to war-a custom that had been very common in northern Britain.Plate H shows Pictish pikemen in combat with the horsemen of Strathclyde, while some Pictish horse-warriors ride around the left flank throwing spears at the enemy.Both the text and plates in this book are highly detailed and exciting, and are highly recommended for anyone interested in this fierce warrior society."},{"Title":"Pictish Warrior AD 297-841","review":"This is a typical Osprey book - a primer to a niche subject. In this case, the coverage is nigh perfect. The text states that there is not much written on the Picts because not much is known about them. Thus there is a lot of cross-referencing to Celtic and other sources just to get an idea about the Picts.The illustrations are terrible. There is a great divide beween text and illustrations. The Picts disavowed the use of armour to flaunt their courage and loved to fight naked to show off their tattoos. The illustrations all depict clothed and armoured Picts. The line drawings hint at the missed opportunity to depict some truly magnificent paintings based on the abstract animal motifs."},{"Title":"PHP/MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book is excellent for someone who has zero or outdated programming knowledge. If you follow all the examples you will become knowledgeable enough to tackle more advanced titles on the subject. If you had problems getting the software working ... read the last section of this review. The book covers the basics of HTML, PHP, MySQL and programming concepts such as Variables, Conditions, Functions, Loops, String handling, Arrays etc. at a level and in a manner that beginners should warm to. Rather than a terse explanation of these topics, the author chose to \\"teach by example\\". Sometimes this approach works better ... especially in cases where the meaning of the code can be easily interpreted.The first Chapter on MySQL (CHAP 7) needs some work. It speaks about exporting a table into html and xml (page 281) but does not clearly explain that this exports the results of a query. You will first have to build a query (SELECT * FROM phoneList;) before you can export. There are a few other areas in the book where you have to \\"figure it out\\". For example, the use of \\"backslash-n\\" appears in the text without explanation. Unfortunately, the PHP manual did not clear it up for me. However, hats off to the author (Andy Harris) as other texts are so much more difficult for the beginner (i.e. non programmer).Installation Problems---------------------I had problems getting the supplied PHP software working under Windows 2000. Since I have 2 other PHP books I consulted them only to find that the software supplied by both these did not work either. My Internet search turned up no solution but gave enough info that allowed me to stumble unto a solution. For those of you with a similar problem, try this -Download apache_1.3.23-win32-x86 or latest version (apache.org)Download mysql-3.23.49-win or latest version (mysql.com)Download php-4.2.3-Win32 or latest version (php.net)The Apache and MySQL installers run automatically but PHP requires some work. Once installed, test Apache with http://localhost/ ... you should see the default apache screen. Next you will need to get Apache to use PHP to interpret files with the .php extension. ... Also, remember to replace all \\\\ with / when editing the configuration files.If all else fails, reread the installation info that came with the software and search the net for WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Zassoursky. 180 Pages. The International Publishers, First Printed in 1991. Price $ 21.95\\"Beyond the Cold War\\" is a collection of critical and analytical essays on the state of media in the US and USSR region. The amnioticity and tension between the Soviet block of nations and the United States and its allies is viewed by a number of journalists. Psychological and media war, Political maneuvering, war by proxy and fear of mutual annihilation is viewed analytically. Prior to the Cold War, the images of opposite mass media had been objected by the \\"Iron Curtain\\" and aftermath, the blind folded eyes of the both sides were opened. As viewed by one writer, the American image on Russia was based on the concept of the mysteriousness of the Russian soul. He further states that USA helped the USSR to wipe out Tzar's reign.The first writer brings out the way that American media corrected their perspectives before and after the Glasnost. He mainly tries to highlight the American efforts to bring the Cold War to an end. The history of images of both sides is discussed. The images built up were almost imaginary during Cold War period. This essay is well analysed and manured with facts.2nd writer is a pro-Russian. He brings out Russian attributes of the Cold War. He describes availability of the information of US in USSR and visa versa. The 3rd writer too describes an Epoch of the Cold War and post Cold War. His effort to describe the US and USSR relations is successful. He perceives that even during the Cold War, the US-USSR people were better relations in comparison to the other nations, which he derives with valid reasons.Next writer also tries to describe the roles of Soviet and American television during this crucial period, which he perceives as a successful role. Following the next has tried to describe the image of Soviet Union and United States. His effort to emphasize that the Soviet Unionist images is not primitive, but impressive.Following Writers thinking is based on coverage of electronic media of Reagan - Gorbachev summits. Being a pro American, he points out the defensive role of American journalists towards Gorbachev's move, the fear of being called as manipulated by Gorbachev. Comments of this kind point out the liberal thinking of writers.A Chinese writer points out the images of 3 distinct Newspapers. Giving the information, he visualises this movement positively. Next, 2 Russian writers disclose data collected through surveys and trying to derive at the positive aspect of Perestroika and Glasnost.A Chinese writer has discussed the image of USSR in Chinese mass media. China, being the next largest Communist country perceives USSR as a giant being the fighter against Fascism, stander against American imperialism and the balance of power. China's perception and its international relationship between USSR are analysed with relevant facts.Another Chinese writer has discussed the image of US in China. The given data shows that Chinese mass media have projected US image to the Chinese than the USSR's. In this China imaginations on US as an enemy is discussed and the question whether the Cold War is over is discussed extensively. The writer at one instance view US as an enemy and at the same time he tries to describe that China is a Non aligned country and it has a neutral foreign policy.Lastly, one writer giving the details of conceptions of various newspapers and personnel describes the insight of the various personnel/News papers on Cold War. He perceives that even the real Cold War is over, the mass medial Cold War will prevail.The essays in this book are not in a chronological order, but they contain almost all the details on the Cold War.

I own the 1998 version an I think it is absolutely great. I read one review where a brother or sister purchased a 2005 Edition thinking it would be further advanced or added to, but comes to find out how crucial nuggets and insights had been deleted from the newer version.

If you are new to the Bible, the 1998 edition provided a wonderful starting point to understanding the Bible. If you were a Bible student, the 1998 edition pulled alot of information that you already knew together. I was so enthusiastic about it that I ordered several more of the 2005 edition to give away thinking that the updated version probably had some graphic updates. I was dumbfounded to find that the entire second part of the book had been completely changed!! All the gems that were there have been removed.

The Old Testament is broken down into its various books (historical, poetical and prophetical) as well as its various eras (creation, patriarch, exodus, conquest, judges, kingdom, exile, return and silence) so the reader understands the flow of events from Genesis to Malachi.The New Testament is broken down into the Gospel Era, The Church Era, the Missions Era and the Epistles. The book breaks down Biblical themes into eight subjects and then takes you through the fundamental doctrines of the faith. 30 Days to Understanding the Bible is a very easy read - excellent for a young Christian wanting to know how all 66 books of the Bible tie together.I have the old edition of this book, but recently discovered that there is a new revised and expanded edition of the book that I just ran across and flipped through -- very impressive updates to this incredible book, now even more valuable than before!

Excellent for long-time Christians who want a better understanding of the Bible."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed the reading of this book, \\"30 Days to Understanding the Bible\\" by Max Anders. One thing in particular that I appreciated was the way it was able to systematically layout the Bible in a very succinct and simple manner that helped me to better understand the structure of the Bible. At first glance, an individual will see the Bible as merely a collective gathering of an assortment of books written by foreign authors with unusual names. Instead, the Bible is a culmination of books written with a distinct purpose in mind, each with its own literary form and character, proclaiming many spiritual truths while flawlessly flowing from one time period to another. These books were written by men who were solely inspired by God and each book was written with a single object of affection in mind: a future redeemer, the coming Messiah, and a holy King, to deliver mankind from the bondage of human depravity.The purpose at which I strived to complete the reading of this book is not for selfish gain nor ambition, but to acquire enough knowledge to impart upon those with whom I will be serving and ministering to on the mission field. I have found many basic principles in this book that any new Christian can gain from. I wish I had read this book early on in my life as a new Christian. It accurately laid out the structure of the Bible and categorized sets of books based upon the type, the purpose, and era of which the book was written. While most of these books were placed in chronological order, some were not. Furthermore, \\"30 Days to Understanding the Bible\\" did a splendid job in briefly summarizing each book of the Bible. And, as a teacher of God's Word, a short synopsis of each book of the Bible can be proven to be very useful especially in helping young, new, Christians to understand God's entire plan for mankind.I am thankful that I have read this book and it will indeed remain a helpful tool in my ministry to disciple and teach new believers on the mission field. I hope and pray that I will be able to see the fruits of my labor, but will remain content even if I don't."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"If your looking for a solid foundation to your understanding of the Bible this is it."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"This book is a great overview of the bible.

It manages to simplify withought dumming down. It appeals to visual learners by using symbols. It uses simple tests to help memorize. It covers the entire Bible. It prepares the casual as well as the serious, the new as well as the seasoned, by giving structure to a book that can be daunting to take on, without overview. I specially recommend it for those who are discipling others, as well as to those who are wondering what makes the Bible the most published book and the most enduring spiritual guide in history. Every one of my students has loved it."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"This is such a well organized concise book that lays out the bible in an understandable way.

I recommend this book to anyone with a new-found interest in the Bible or someone who has been away from it for awhile and would like a re-fresher. I liked it so much after working in this book that I bought two more copies: one to do again and one for my wife. Wish I had done something like this years ago. And, you DO NOT have to be a \\"Bible Thumper\\" to enjoy this book. The history and geography lessons alone are priceless. All that is required is a desire to put an immense book like the Bible into perspective; it will make sense after Anders' book."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"I was recommended this book by a dear friend of our (retired Navy chaplain) when I asked him what book he'd recommend to a new Christian. I found the daily chapters the exact right amount of information and presented in a way that made sense. It also approached the Bible as both a complete story as well as the topical items. There are \\"fill in\\" sections in each chapter to help you recall the previous material as well as internalize the new. I find that doing this type of \\"active\\" reading helps me remember much more.Even though i'm not a \\"new\\" Christian, there is always more to be learned and this is the best book I have seen that presents the Bible in an easy to understand way."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"MY SMALL GROUP AT CHURCH READ THIS BOOK.

This really isn't even a Bible 101 class it's more of an 050, Intro to the Bible. But, we use it with our new believers and some of our old ones who just plain forgot how it all works together. Great for small group or individual study. Must be followed up with something more substantial because this only hits the MAJOR highlights."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"Have you ever wished that there was an idiots guide to the Bible that gave context to all of it's parts? The Bible is a beautiful collection of assorted types of literature but it's organization and foreignness often creates confusion. So scholars claim we live in the most biblically illiterate time in modern history. While many have theological and doctrinal opinions and views few understand the book called the Bible. 30 Days to Understanding the Bible by Max Anders is exactly the sort of \\"idiot proof\\" guide many people are looking for. Anders' uses a simple format that explains how the bible is assembled and how each parts fits within or connects to the rest of the parts. The majority of the book covers the Old Testament (due to its size) and lays out a simplistic easy to follow and retain story. Every element is broken down into smaller digestible elements which are repeated and tested throughout the chapter.For instance:The Old Testament is divided into it's parts.17 Historical Books5 Poetical Books17 Prophetical BooksThe historical books are divided into smaller eras (ie Creation, Patriarchs, Exodus, etc). Every era is linked to a picture, a central character, a geographic location, and a story line summary. The story line summaries are one liners that sum up what that era is about. The reader is able to learn piece by piece each book of the Bible as he or she explores the eras. The reader is given pictures, maps, and subdivisons that aid in understanding the bigger picture of scripture and it's events. Each chapter contains simple tests right after new information is given and the tests are repeated becoming slightly more difficult as you go in the short chapters. This creates a stair step approach to learning that build new info onto slight older info. The chapters are short and can be done for about 20 minutes once a day for 30 days.The books covers the OT, NT, and the 10 Great Doctrines of the Bible. I'd highly recommend this to someone who doesn't understand the Old Testament, how the bible is constructed, bais doctrine, new believers, older believers looking to brush up, or anyone interested in making sense of the Bible. It's a fun hearted book and simple enough for a 10 year old but never so simple an adult couldn't glean something from it. It's a great resource for churches, small groups, or missional communities. It's denominational friendly as it is generic enough to work in a variety of churches. Lot's of free teaching material is available for free online as well.I've personally studied the Bible most of my life and I found this book to be the best I've ever seen. I'm thinking about completing this once a year. The book is also a workbook with fill in the blank questions, maps, etc. It feels a little elementary at first but I've noticed that my bible reading has benefited from a more clear understanding of chronology and geography. I've also learned several small facts here or there that filled in gaps in my own understanding after all these years. I'm excited about this resource and would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"This is a great book. I've never been to the holy land but feel like I know my way around now. Great overview of the Bible with hands on workbook to cement the knowledge.

It helped me remember the material so much better than the kindle edition."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"Great resource for those who want to know the bible in a way that is easy to grasp and understand. It is an excellent tool to use in introducing people to the Bible-who wrote it;what are the relevant events found in the old testament and new testaments; the structure of the bible and what are the basic 10 doctrines of the bible.It is a good resource for any Sunday School or individual study. For those who just want to read through the bible in a year,read this book and it will help you to put purpose behind your reading and give you a greater understanding of what you're reading."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"For a person new to the Bible (like myself), Anders provides a very high level summary that really took much less than 30 days. The content was too light, but the exercises does help to remember the very high-level content provided.This book needs more content because the end result is not an \\"understanding\\" of the Bible, but rather a very high-level summary that can be used as a starting point to learning more about the Bible."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"This is a great overview of the Bible.

The presentation is logical, easy to follow and at the end of the book, you have a better understanding of the logical order and chronology of the Bible and the major events and players. It also discusses major doctrines about how to properly relate to God, self and others.Great book!"},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"The Bible is far too complex to read cold -- and 2000 years later, few of us have even a basic grasp of the structure. Real understanding of the book is possible only if you grew up with it.Don't let that scare you off, though. If you want to read the Bible, start by reading this book, which will prepare you well for the undertaking.Warning: The author's evangelical Christian bias is always on display. If you don't share his theology, you'll need some mature understanding of your own religious faith to get anything useful out of this book.Bottom line: If you're looking for a quick way to get the basic Bible story into your head, this is a great starting point. But don't give it to your non-evangelical-Christian kids."},{"Title":"30 Days to Understanding the Bible in 15 Minutes in a Day","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed by this book. Having been raised as a Southern Baptist, I found myself thinking more about the people and matters the author left out of the book than the material he included. Naturally, it is quite difficult to cover the entire Bible in one normal-sized book, but I found this work to be overly simplistic and lacking in its overall presentation of the true meaning of the Bible and Christianity. The author devotes the first two-thirds or so of the book to a presentation of the geography and history of Biblical times, coupled with a quick summation of the poetical, prophetic, and instructional books. Having completed that task, he ends by summing up eight basic principles of the Bible. I had expected to find the real meat of the book in this last section, but I found it sorely wanting in terms of its exposition of Christian doctrine and guidelines. The real meaning of Jesus' life never really emerged from the pages, and the importance of faith, while addressed, was not stressed or explained as much as I would have liked or expected it to be.Certainly, the author's motives are noble, but his desire to make this book accessible to anyone and everyone results in a dry presentation that is not very compelling. This book would be most useful to persons without any kind of religious background, but I fear that it will not bring real understanding to most of its readers, nor do I think it will convince many sinners to seek God. Anyone brought up as a church-goer in a Christian denomination will learn nothing he/she didn't already learn in Sunday School as a child."},{"Title":"How to Write Historical Fiction","review":"This tape was recommended to me.

They are hard to put down once you pick it up. I am reading in chronological order, and am up to The First Fast Draw."},{"Title":"Heller With a Gun","review":"Why did Louis L'Amour have to shoehorn a schmaltzy romance into what could have been a lean, mean Western yarn? That infernal love triangle with King Mabry, Tom Healy and Janice Ryan just ground to a halt the momentum of the story and soured the closing quarter of the book, where this long-simmering subplot began boiling over into the primary plot, that of King Mabry escorting a hapless theater troupe up through Wyoming into Montana in a brutal winter, their tracks dogged by a band of greedy gunmen as well as by roving bands of renegade Sioux Indians.A strength of the story is seeing a seasoned man of the west--King Mabry--saddled with a group of five city-folk from back East. Mabry originally wanted nothing to do with them, meeting them at the Hat Creek Station as he was moseying south and they northwest. But their naivete, Tom Healy's plucking a gold coin from a full pouch in full view of wide-eyed, greedy dry-gulchers, for example, troubled his conscience, knowing they would be easy prey for the hard-bitten men bred by a hard land to hard ways (to paraphrase my copy's cover blurb, pulled from the closing line of Chapter One). And not only Mabry's conscience was stirred--he had an eye for Janice Ryan, one of the singers in the troupe. That coupled with his learning that Andy Barker--a fugitive killer from the Plummer Gang--was hired to lead the two wagons over the wintry expanse, motivates Mabry to follow along and watch for trouble, which invariably arises.The troupe of tenderfoot thespians is led by Healy, who is also in love with Janice. Doc Guilford is a \\"charming old windbag,\\" writes L'Amour. A 17-year-old ingenue, Dodie, and an older woman, Maggie, who is stricken with pnuemonia, round out the cast. Each responds differently to the trials and tumults they encounter on the frontier, though Doc and Maggie are window-dressing and relegated to remaining one-dimensional. Dodie moves from the background to the foreground in a well-done work of character development on L'Amour's part, showing how the struggles of the West can tap into and tease out from people strengths and abilities they didn't suspect they possessed. Tom Healy is the book's best example of that. He's a changed man after his escape from the camp and long, cold trudge through the snowstorm following Mabry's tracks. As doubtful as it appeared early in the book, there's now a confidence Healy has mustered what it takes to make it in the West.An element I always enjoy in L'Amour novels is his opening chapters. Like the pre-credits sequences in the classic James Bond movies, they often have no real connection to the main plot, but set the stage and galvanize the reader for action. This novel features one of the best I've yet read, with Mabry suspecting he's being tracked by a killer that he can't see in the blinding snowstorm. His finding and preparing a shelter and then confirming his suspicions of a pursuer makes for compelling reading. Chapter One could stand alone as a short story.This is a relatively early novel of L'Amour's, first published in 1955. It caught the attention of Paramount Pictures and was adapted into the 1960 movieHeller in Pink Tights. As is often the case, the movie strays far from the source material. The ludicrous title change alone indicates this movie is less a Western and more a \\"romantic comedy with slices of Americana,\\" to quote Robert Weinberg in his invaluable book for L'Amour readers,The Louis L'Amour Companion. Weinberg adds that it's \\"a wonderful film,\\" but that \\"most of the L'Amour novel disappeared.\\" Top billing went to Anthony Quinn as Tom Healy and Sophia Loren as Angela Rossini (the Italianized Janice Ryan role), with Steve Forrest of later fame onThe Baron: The Complete SeriesandS.W.A.T. - The Complete First Seasonplaying the rechristened \\"Clint Mabry.\\"Was I the only reader perplexed to discover no character in the book is named Heller? I kept waiting for this person to show up (with a gun, of course). I looked in vain for the meaning of this term, wondering if it was Irish or theatrical slang. The best I turned up was a dictionary definition of a \\"heller\\" as \\"a reckless person,\\" a description that could be applied to many characters in the book, from those foolhardy enough to oppose Mabry to--in my conclusion--Mabry himself in the final chapter!"},{"Title":"Heller With a Gun","review":"A gunfighter with a reputation again is the hero in Louis L'Amour's yarn that plays out in the wilds of Montana in the dead of winter. King Mabry reluctantly aids a theater troupe against bad guys with robbery and murder planned for their victims amid gun fights and Indian attacks. There's also a bit of a romance plot thrown in for good measure, which adds up to a fine western novel by one of America's favorite storytellers."},{"Title":"Heller With a Gun","review":"I LIKE THIS BOOK SO WELL I WENT BACK IN TWO OR THREE PLACES TO MAKE SURE I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING ABOUT DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF STORY."},{"Title":"Heller With a Gun","review":"to tell you the truth, i didn't like this book. i am not into the whole \\"western\\" books. i had to read it for a project at my school and i thought it was terrible. plain and simple. sorry to all you out there who liked it but u guys r weird!"},{"Title":"Trude Sojka (English and Spanish Edition)","review":"Life offered me a chance to live in beautiful Ecuador for some years and to have the opportunity of sharing some memorable moments with the artist Trude Sojka and her family. Therefore, I take the liberty of writing a personal and emotional review.Trude Sojka is the personification of a phoenix, the bird of rebirth. As a survivor of the Holocust she is a testimony of human resilience and willfulness to recreate a shattered life.Applying different media (cement, ceramics, glass, porcelain, acrylics) Sojka explores several techniques, literally isolated from the artistic world and glamour outside her own self. Her work is best classified as sculpture-painting, with a characteristic thick texture, playing both with the figurative and the abstract. Her fascination for pre-Colombian art is reflected in the incorporation of native themes, motifs, and specially the use of brightful colors. The end result is an artistic work unique in itself, for its originality, beauty, and emotional power.Trude Sojka deserves to be recognized not only for her contribution to Ecuadorian art, and for that matter to worldwide art, but also as an outstanding woman. To be able to appreciate this editon of her art work is a source of pleasure, satisfacion and honor."},{"Title":"Jamestown, New World Adventure","review":"This book is a great example of historical fiction for children. An enormous amount of facts are packed into an engaging story line. It opens as a young colonial family reads the journal of the grandfather, who came to America on the Susan Constant.

If you like organic or natural farming then you will find this book a good read."},{"Title":"Farmers of forty centuries;: Or, Permanent agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan,","review":"First published in 1911, with a preface by Dr. L. H. Bailey, Farmers of Forty Centuries is the kind of book that would be of interest to farmers and historians alike.This book was written at time in society when 'better living through chemistry' was just starting to take hold as mainstream thinking. Reductionist science, pesticides, and fertilizer were gaining strength and agriculture was changing from a point of view that works with the natural processes to a system that conquers and controls plants natural impulses. Taking into account the time when this book was written, and one can see that it is an important book in the history of agriculture and an excellent reference for modern farmers that might have been lost if not for the dedication of people who converted it to e-text.The preface by Dr Bailey, discusses where American agriculture stands at the turn of the last century (1900). It mentions how farming in the North America is very successful, and acknowledged that this is primarily because the population density of the continent is sparse and people have been cultivating the soil for a relatively short time. Bailey mentions that in order to properly conquer the land and turn it to our needs (common attitude of the time)we must be careful not to strip it of fertility. Chemical farming alone will do this over time; however, by examining agricultural practices that have sustained themselves for long periods without loosing soil fertility - then american farming can be even more productive (shame this wasn't taken to heart at the time).The book itself is examines agricultural practices in some of the most densely populated areas of the world at the time in hopes of gleaming some useful information.Given where we are now with industrialized farming, this book might just be what we need to help understand how we can regain some of the waste farmland that now has very little or no agricultural use thanks to poor management practices over the last 100 years.The kindle version has no interactive menus, no way of quick navigation and no pictures. But there are no obvious errors in the text.This book is perfect for both small farmers and large scale agri-business."},{"Title":"Farmers of forty centuries;: Or, Permanent agriculture in China, Korea, and Japan,","review":"Proves the fact thsy newer isn't always better. Useful Information for those wanting a truly sustainable gardening system. The wisdom of the ages shared here."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Bob Dylan is indeed a legend and part of the Bohemian 60's folk-rock culture. For anyone who grew up in the 60's, names like Dylan and Joan Baez were the ultimate in folk music. As most of us know, Dylan eventually made a transition from folk to rock. Through the pages of this book, you will read about his personal relationship with Joan Baez, his marriage to Sara Lownds, and a somewhat discreet marriage to one of his back-up singers, with whom he had a child. The author has completed extensive interviews with those closest to Dylan and also discussed his motorcycle accident in 1966 and heart problems encountered in 1997. Dylan has explored many paths and crossed many bridges in his lifetime, and Sounes has captured much of Dylan's successes, trials and tribulations. If there is a downside to the book, it is the focal point, itself. The author seems somewhat preoccupied with the nitty-gritty events of Dylan's &quot;steamy personal life&quot; as opposed to the legendary acclaim of his career. If this is the aspect of Dylan's life that grabs your attention, you will not be disappointed. There are times, however, when the book reads like a glorified tabloid magazine, only in greater detail.&quot;Down the Highway&quot; will, no doubt, compete for popularity with Clinton Heylin's, &quot;Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades&quot;. Heylin's book, on the other hand, concentrates more on the analysis of Dylan's career as opposed to the juicy little details of his romantic life. The reader will need to decide, which aspect of Dylan's life is of greater interest; personally, if you are a devote Dylan fan, I would recommend you read both books."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This is a worthy but not spectacular biography.It thoroughly traces Dylan's love-life, recordings, concert tours and activities right up to the tour following Time Out Of Mind, but is less penetrating on the content of his work. The claims this author makes - to have uncovered startling new evidence (in the form of a marriage certificate!!) that Bob Dylan secretly got married in the eighties, are not as interesting as Sounes thinks they are.Down The Highway is well written without being stylish - Sounes is no Greil Marcus or Charles Shaar Murray, and nor does he try to be - but his weakness is that he holds Bob Dylan in the sort of admiring regard which is ok if you're a fan, but irritating if you're a biographer. For example, Sounes spends a lot of time arguing the uncontroversial assertion - almost to the point of being defensive about it - that Dylan really is one of the most culturally significant figures of the 20th century. Now whether you like Dylan or not, his significance as an artist really isn't debatable, so this is wasted energy. Sounes is also prepared to defend, in some way or other, every one of Dylan's albums, despite acknowledging that many in the late seventies and early eighties were critical and commercial failures. A more dispassionate writer might just face facts - Even Bob Dylan is capable of an iredeemably bad record. Again, this is something which the rest of the world would not dispute.For all that, Sounes does catalogue all the nasty and unpleasant things Dylan has done in his life (as well as the nice ones), and while this obviously hasn't affected his opinion of the man, it made sobering reading for me. Mahatma Ghandi Dylan is not.But the most interesting and valuable aspect of Sounes' portrayal was that Dylan never, even in the early days, was particularly political, nor did he consider himself a protest singer. His heroes were the same as everyone else's - Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly - he just happened to like Woody Guthrie too. In the end, in making music Bob Dylan was just trying to make a living - his famous self description as &quot;just a song-and-dance man&quot; may not have been intended as ironically as the world suspected."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Punchy prose. Packed with new info. Extraordinary research job. Exhaustive source notes. Great photos. With all that going for it, this stands as the definitive Dylan biography - at least as far as regular readers are concerned. It gives the whole story, just just one part, and does so in a style that is easy and pleasurable to read. Also, Bobby D is placed in historical and cultural context - from the Grand Ole Opry thru to endorsing the Apple iMac. Forty years of history pass by like a July 4th parade - all the characters from the Beats to President Clinton to the Grateful Dead, punk music the lot. This is the first Dylan book I've read that tells me what this guy is like in his private life, and that's always been fascinating and elusive. Never a dull moment."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Lots of good stuff here - plenty of new info and quirky stories. Though the guy doesn't offer much explanation of the songs, he knows how to spin a good yarn and the yarn is compelling. The stuff about the Dead was fascinating - I certainly never knew Dylan tried to join the band. Incredible. And they turned him down! The girlfriends, wives, etc, are a whole story in themselves, and you can't help wondering what they see in this grungy old gypsy character. But they seem to love him. At the end of the day, you're left with an impression of a very likable but eccentric loner. It's telling that none of the girlfriends have a bad word to say about him. If you want a balanced, complete story of the life of this guy, give this a try. If you want deep textural analysis, you might want another book. But I'd certainly urge anybody to read this. It was very entertaining, and actually not tabloidy at all."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Bob Dylan is as much a cultural icon as one person can be in our times, but he is a secretive and lonely person. It is difficult for a biographer to weave together an honest look at such a person without their cooperation. Yet Howard Sounes does a great job of looking past the image and providing his readers with a glimpse of the person behind the legend. Without being able to interview the man himself, he uses Dylan's words from past interviews, legal records, and interviews with friends and associates to piece together a picture of the life behind the legend.Telling the story of Dylan from birth to the year 2000, this book focuses on the details of a life devoted to a musical career. I found particularly interesting the section on Dylan's musical roots in Hibbing, Duluth, and Minneapolis. Also, interviews with some of the few people Dylan befriended over the years give us a wonderful peak at his human side. Finally, producers and musicians tell fascinating stories about recording sessions that add to our understanding of the music on his CDs. The author has interviewed many people who had contact with Dylan through the years so we get much detail, but ultimately are still only on the outside looking in. Usually Sounes takes the high road and refrains from telling salacious details.The book will appeal to devoted fans who love Dylan's music and want to know about the person behind it. If you are new to Bob Dylan and want to understand his cultural impact, this is not the book for you. It is also a very revealing study of the isolating effect that fame can have on people."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Pretty much the same stuff. The only new angles were the availability of legal documents and the like. Much more emphasis on the personal Dylan - marriages, family, money, etc. than the music.Okay - I enjoyed it even though I knew most of it already."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I've heard reviewers saying things like &quot;same stuff&quot;. I gotta tell you that I really don't care one iota whether or not it's the &quot;same stuff&quot;. We're talking about the most enigmatic and elusive artist of the 20th Century...keep these bios coming!! I'm not saying that I believe everything that Sounes has written here, but he's done a heck of a lot of research and conducted a lot of interviews that unveil a good deal of new information on Dylan's family life, contractual matters, and the fact that he was looking &quot;overweight and pasty&quot; at some point during the late 80's. On the downside, Bob Dylan is like peanut butter cookie dough (speaking of pasty): you can only get so much of him. I must say that I sometimes put this book down thinking that I would not like to meet Bob Dylan (I know he's crying over that too!!). That doesn't mean that I'm not going to listen to his music though. I mean, Bob Dylan's contribution to my life makes Sounes' look like a grain of sand. (But God bless him!!) Do I recommend the bio (even though I still have no clue who Sounes is and how he ever became a Dylan scholar)? Most definately. Just don't let HS tell you what and what not to believe. Dylan didn't let people make his reality. Heck, he was traveling with a carnival through Utah or something right? I would also recommend Heylin's revised biography on the Man."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"There are so many Dylan-related books out there, and many of them not terribly good, that I was initially reluctant to try yet another. However, with Bobby celebrating his 60th birthday this year, I was tempted to try this new biography and was impressed from the first by how readable, entertaining and even-handed it is - paying equal attention to the man's life and work and refraining from judging him, or praising him too wildly. I must have read nearly all the main Dylan biogs over the past few years, yet I found new information on almost every page and several passages that changed the whole way I thought about Dylan and his music. The stuff about Woodstock is amazing, and there are really cool people quoted for the first time - like the guy who taught Dylan to paint, Sam Shepard and many girlfriends. The concert descriptions are terrific, and the whole book is a handsome thing with great photographs. Most importantly, I found Down the Highway to be a great read - the sort of book you want to read every night before bed. It is entertaining, cleanly written and lacking in the kind of sloppy slang language that mars other books on the subject. Some of the revelations are so startling that you wonder where the author gets his material, but at the back of the book are detailed source notes that back it all up. When I got to the last few pages I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Not only for its comprehensive approach to Dylan's life and work, but also for its equanimity and control ... Sounes' book is a must-read. First and foremost, Sounes is a good solid prose writer (in refreshing contrast to many Dylan &quot;writers,&quot; and engages you immediately in the world of Bob Dylan. There's lots of yummy details on Bob's romantic life (women will swoon, half in love with Dylan as many of us are) and plenty of captivating stories on Dylan's craftsmanship as a record maker. I've read far too many mere textual analyses of Dylan's songs, so I'm happy to say this one's a welcome reprieve. Sounes is a writer's writer!"},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I'm pretty confused about the amount of praise lavished on this book.First off - this seems like a very BIG book but, when examined, the print size is large and so the actual text probably doesn't amount to half that of Clinton Heylin's Dylan biography \\"Behind the Shades\\".When I started reading this Sounes book I was struck by a certain freshness since it seemed clear that Sounes wasn't what you might call one of the Dylan initiated writers like Heylin or Michael Gray. These people give the impression that they have been huge fans for most of their lives and litter their writings with lots of implicit Dylan references. This can sometimes be tiresome and Sounes gives the impression that he was approaching Dylan from a virgin perspective i.e. taking nothing for granted.However after a while I realised that what I'd taken for freshness was really a complete lack of insight and imagination. Sounes even starts quoting Heylin at one point. There are a couple of memorable observations e.g. that Dylan's wild singing style may have been based on Woody Guthrie's voice as it sounded when he was deteriorating from Huntingdon's Chorea. But on the whole this is a turgid rehash of all too familiar territory. It's especially embarrassing whenever Sounes lapses into direct speech as on page 118 when the young Dylan has been asked to work a certain gig:\\"With who?\\", asked Bob, knowing he would be supporting a name act.\\"With John Lee Hooker\\"\\"Ooo yeah\\", said Bob excitedly.Is Sounes writing for children?I'm left with the feeling that Sounes could have written about anyone - Elton John or Max Bygraves or whoever - and he would have employed the same automatic pilot procedure with no special feeling for his subject. Heylin's biography has its flaws. It's very opinionated but I feel that's the price you have to pay for a book with distinction and wit. He also makes you feel that all those Dylan stories you probably already know seem fresh with all the additional detail he provides. That's the book to read. Definitely not this."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"sounes digs for dirt better than anyone, and after the Bukowski bio and the 1980s marriage revelation, I ordered this shipped next day air.While he gets deep, amazing and revealing facts (Dylan's 30-yr double CD with celebrities covering his songs sold a grand total of 2 copies in Denmark), he has absolutely NO critical facility and relies on Jann Wenner as the only consistent analysis of Dylan's creative output.With the utter VOLUME of writing about Dylan that Sounes drew upon to piece together anecdotes into a fairly revealing portrait, he just WINGS IT when it comes to analyzing the art.This leads to &quot;Blah-Blah-Blah, Bob recorded down in the Groove, blah-blah-blah, It didn't sell too well, blah blah blah, he went on tour, blah blah blah.&quot;Good dirt, some insight, but a self-impressed Sounes could have done more than read a back issue of Rolling Stone to inform him. The man simply has no understanding of the critical process, a sin of MANY a journalist before him.Sounes' personal opinions about the songs on each album are so pedestrian, glib and bland that you can just skip over the two paragraph critical treatment each album gets. Ditto for Sounes' insight-free discussions of Bob's concert performances.Again, good dirt, but YAWN..."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"It seems like the author tried too hard to get this thing done in timefor Dylan's sixtieth birthday.

The writing is ghastly, giving one the feel of a Sunday arts supplement piece that was thrown together too quickly, and with loud music (\\"Like A Rolling Stone?\\") blasting away behind whoever was writing it. Sounes has been given credit for getting people who had been close to Dylan to open up as never before, but to me that doesn't justify this book's relentless juvenile tone, sloppy writing and its just-as-relentless political correctness (in the first hundred pages he uses the mincing journalistic euphemism for \\"black,\\" e.g. \\"African-American,\\" at least six times, as if he were trying to ingratiate himself to Jesse Jackson.) But worse than that, his simpering comments about American pop culture put me in mind of a friend I had many years ago who came originally from India, and who had very strong opinions about America and Americans, even though at that point she had never been to the United States and admitted that her chief source of knowledge about American culture had been \\"Mad\\" magazine. Sounes gives me the same feeling, that he read through a stack of back issues of \\"Mad,\\" and now he knows all about American pop culture. I've read a great many books by a great many writers on the subject of Bob Dylan, from the best (Paul Williams) to the wackiest (Griel Marcus.) This one rates silliest."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"The writer says at the beginning that Bob refused to talk to him for this book so instead he seeks out ex-girlfriends, fired band members, relatives of those Bob supposedly done wrong (e.g. Phil Ochs) and records their mostly negative observations about Bob.

Howard Sounes is just another name on a list of men that invaded the life of this man. What kind of man would take information from every source he could find about a person that he never knew and write a book about it. Howard is the prime example of a man that Bob most desperately tried to avoid throughout his entire career.

I haven't heard from the recepient but I assume it was satisfactory."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"If you want to know how stars are manufactured , read this excellent book.Until Madison Avenue PR reinvented him, Dylan was one of 10,000 ballad singers hanging around New York's Greenwich Village ...Just as Bing Crosby was manufactured by the J Walter Thompson Agency, Dylan was also an invention.While others sang about leftish themes and civil rights, Dylan , like a teenager with acne ,sang about love,love,love and nonsense songs about nothing-&quot;Blowing in the wind .&quot;...Correctly, this book quotes no wit and wisdom from Bob.It does point out how simple it is to create a world star.Dylan was surrounded by real musicians and PR folks to hype him as a personality.He followed fashions in pop music, invented nothing ...Read it and wonder no more about the ways stars are invented in the USA."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I haven't read a book about Dylan since Anthony Scaduto's 1971 &quot;Bob Dylan,&quot; which I enjoyed tremendously at the time-- it was hero worship, for Scaduto and me both. That sort of thing doesn't seem to be done anymore. Our culture today prefers to tear people down, as in the book series &quot;Kill Your Idols.&quot;My life was changed by Dylan's music of the '60s, though, and I couldn't resist reading the new books during the year of his 60th birthday. &quot;Down the Highway&quot; is a bland, by-the-numbers bio. It manages to take someone as fascinating as Dylan and make him boring. I don't read biographies, as a rule, and Sounes' book reminds me why. It may have some revealing detail not available elsewhere about Dylan's second marriage and financial dealings, but that's not what I'm interested in.If you want to read a really interesting book with much more detail (it's nearly 300 pages longer), check out Heylin's &quot;Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited.&quot; It's not a conventional bio -- he leaves long direct quotes intact throughout the entire text instead of reducing them to the mush of the omniscient narrator. AND, Heylin has been inspired by the IDEAS in Dylan's music, as have I, and pursues the meaning at the intersection of the man's life and his art. That is still a worthwhile quest, even though it is not possible to read either of these books and maintain an idealistic view of the Hero..."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I ought to say where I'm coming from (if anyone cares). Almost everything Bob Dylan wrote and said up to 1966, the year of his mysterious motorcycle accident (where did it happen? how badly was he injured? Sounes is good on the difficulties of determining the facts on this point, and his end notes seem like a work of serious scholarship)--almost everything Dylan did to that point was suggestive, imaginative, and many-sided. He wrote and sung with every fiber of his being, even when he was being off-hand or putting his audience on. After 1966, for me, interest diminshes: Dylan makes commercially successful recordings, but he pulls back from the precipice. The existential edge disappears, as does the verbal ingenuity, wildness of imagination, and perfect marriage between Dylan's voice and music and the content of his songs.Sounes writes a decent book, with much new and hard researched information. His prose is adequate--not overly careful or stylistically distinguished. The fact finding has been done responsibly, unlike most writing about Dylan. Sounes sees the mixture of ambition, originality, and intelligence that makes Dylan at his very best still part of the central attitudes and consciousness of many of us. He is not especially sharp on the 1960's zeitgeist. Not interested in aesthetics and with no special purchase on Dylan's artistic achievement, Sounes limns the appalling squalor of Dylan's life after the accident--the philandering, the effort to find himself again and again, Dylan's growing ruthlessness and business acumen. These topics have the fascination of tabloid journalism but ultimately matter less than the dynamic achievement of the seven albums (plus a few songs) Dylan made up to 1966, about which, like the works of the fine and high artists the songwriter admires, interest is permanent.Sounes treats the early and late Dylan with the same even-handedness. This is good if you value two identically, but I think there is reason not to, and if I have to criticize the book, I'd say it lacks the force of interpretation and considered opinion of a profound mind. Rather than the work of a superior distinction, it's the flat and question-begging presentation of a journalist (I should add that many so-called scholarly books are deficient this way as well). I still enjoyed it, though; anything responsibly written about Dylan will in some measure compel.&quot;Biography,&quot; wrote F. Scott Fitzgerald, all of whose books I've been through, &quot;is the falsest of the arts. That is because there were no Lincolnians before Lincoln, no Keatsians before Keats.&quot; At his best Dylan is still the definitive word on Dylan."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Through uneven story-telling, Howard Sounes attempts to capture a sense of the complex artist, musician, poet, and personality that is Bob Dylan in his new book Down the Highway. I enjoyed this book, but found it lacking in many respects. Admittedly, I am a relatively new Dylan fan, one of those who listened to Dylan as a kid, and as a teenage girl especially loved &quot;Lay, Lady, Lay&quot; (from Nashville Skyline), but finally &quot;got&quot; the genius after 1997's Time Out of Mind.I think it is nearly impossible to write about artistic geniuses, because biographer's accounts of such people all too often fall short of being able to convey the genius without sounding both resentful and awed at the same time.In this book, there was much too much attention paid to Dylan as womanizer and less so as Dylan the song-writer. I also took issue with Sounes's inclination to pat himself on the back when he was able to produce a newly discovered tidbit about Dylan never before unearthed; generally, the tidbits weren't worth the billing. But perhaps the biggest insult, nay, the biggest crime, was the lack of attention Sounes paid to the music. To be fair, it would be impossible for any biographer to satisfy all of Bob Dylan's fans when it came to analyzing his music, but I for one felt Sounes was more interested in the chicks than he was in the art, and it broke my heart to read Sounes's dismissive estimation of Nashville Skyline; he allowed there were a couple of stand-out tracks, but neglected wholesale the gorgeous and perfect &quot;Tell Me That it Isn't True&quot;. I told myself, it was more than obvious he hadn't even listened to the album. I would think this thought more than once, especially when Sounes covered other albums like Blood on the Tracks.Sounes managed to make the Dylan-goes-electric period sound like vague remembrances of a high school history lesson, rather than impart to the reader how revolutionary it really was. People felt betrayed by folkie Dylan when he went rock and roll on them (listen to the Royal Albert Hall concert and read the liner notes of the newly-reissued CD and you get much more of a sense of what an outrage it really was, than from reading this book). Any listener will appreciate, after listening to the '66 live version of &quot;Baby, Let Me Follow You Down&quot;, the suspicion and confusion of a concert crowd used to pop music their way, the safe pop the audience anticipated, being turned on its head. Making something that started soft into hard is still a revolutionary concept, and I wish the author had done a better job explaining this period in Dylan's professional life. Jumping forward, due to word count constraints, I am simply amazed that the author didn't credit Dylan with having the best song on the Traveling Wilbury's debut album. Sure, Roy Orbison has the best pipes, always will, but Dylan's warbling of &quot;Congratulations&quot; is the stand-out track on that album.Music aside, the author tended to introduce many peripheral characters, go in depth into the lives of these folks, then, once we were interested, we never heard about them again. At one point Dylan, in later life, runs into Dave Whitaker, an old good friend from early days in Dinkytown, MN, whom we heard a lot about. Why was Dave wandering by the Mississippi River, and what did happen to Gretel? And why the rush job on Sara Dylan's life, post-divorce?Finally, at the book's end, the Duluth concert, there are too many accounts of actress Jessica Lange's reaction; the author, fairly mum about Dylan's appeal to celebrities (save the Beatles), seems to relish the fact that Dylan appeals to the beautiful Jessica Lange, and while that's momentarily interesting, I'm reminded again after reading about her second reaction, that the story is about the chicks and not the music. I mean, I like Lange too, but the concert wasn't about her. The author repeats himself throughout the narrative, the book could have benefited from a good copy editor, but because the story is about Bob Dylan, it still manages to be a good yarn.In sum: Not the last word on the life of this remarkable person."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This book was a book it took me a while to open up. I thought about the things I may find out about Dylan which I don't want to know about. Then I thought, this man, who has wanted his life and personality to be shrouded in mystery, should remain that way for me. Sounces treats Dylan with a certain respect, the respect of a biographer. I don't believe this book is done in the AJ Weberman style of exposing Dylan for what a horrible person he is. He isn't. He's a person like any other, and this book gives us a glimpse of it. He was married, he got divorced- that separation affected him profoundly. Through the review of Dylan's life by this author, a negative side certainly manifests, but it is not without context of course. The joys Dylan experienced (his own private joys) cannot be described and should not be. There are details here to help us understand the context of Dylan's life. Truly this is no \\"No Direction Home\\" by Robert Shelton (widely referenced by Sounes), but it is something else entirely. If you are a Dylan fan who is interested in more than the music, this may be of interest, but not a definitive work of Dylan's life- that can nev er and will never exist. His life is his alone and I'm glad that he has been able to share as much as he has about his inspirations and his striving in Chronicles. Hope to see more of Dylan on Dylan soon."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Another Dylan bio, and not an unusual one in that it once more dwells on the man's many personal faults. I have no problem with that. It doesn't surprise me that the man has used people as stepladders throughout his life, befriending them when it benefits his ambitions and discarding them once they no longer serve his selfish ends. And the man treats people so shabbily that as he knocked on heaven's door with a near fatal heart ailment in 1997, only one of his band-members bothered to contact him and wish him well.What we don't get is the exhaustive, knowledgable background on his music that Clinton Heylin provides in &quot;Behind the Shades: Revisited&quot; which hit bookstores at the same time. That volume bursts with background info on the recordings and still found time to dish up heaping piles of dirt. Sounes offers some surprising news about a post-Sara marriage that Dylan remarkably managed to conceal, and the revelation (true?) that at the lowest point in his career, he asked to join the Grateful Dead (and was turned down)!For Dylan fans, at least those who don't object to learning that their hero's music may be the only truly admirable thing about him, Sounes book is a worthwhile read, but it's more of a back road than a highway."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"The story of Dylan's life is so extraordinary that it would be hard to write a bad book about it, I would have thought, and this one is superb. It is full of new information and, at the same time, there isn't a bunch of self-opinionated twaddle about what the author thinks Dylan's lyrics mean. Thank goodness. There is nothing more boring than a guy who wants to tell you what he thinks Dylan lyrics mean. Instead of cod-analysis, we get the story of Dylan's life in extraordinary detail - the whole deal from growing up in Minnesota to the most recent tours: his women; his best friends; his family; the recording sessions; the shows. It's a real easy book to read and at the end you feel you know a whole lot more about this guy, though he is so complex you get the idea that the whole story might never be unravelled. I guess that's why he's so interesting. Anyway, terrific stuff. Five stars for sure."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I have read this book 3 times. It seems that each time I read it, I find out something new. I am a huge Bob Dylan fan and I love learning things about him. Howard Sounes really did his research for this book and it shows. I recommend this book to any Dylan fan."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Maybe it's the rarefied life that fame brings, maybe it's Sounes's writing, hey - maybe it's me, but I found this book curiously lacking in \\"Zeitgeist\\" , or \\"spirit of the time.\\"It is the early years that stand out most strongly: Robert Zimmerman's childhood and youth in Duluth, Minn. (the Black Country). Both his musical awakening and his early high school friendships and loves are soaked in 1950s and 1960s atmosphere. Actually, the book is OK through the Apotheosis bit, when Bob reaches the height of his fame.Thereafter, as it hauls itself from the 60s through to the 90s, it just seems to become a catalogue of concerts and names, which all resonate - I mean, Eric Clapton, George Harrison, Madison Square Garden, what more could you want? Personally, I wanted a little more analytical thread between this. Sure it is interesting and readworthy but I felt these could have been connected up better.Sounes does do well however, with Bob's records and recording sessions. There are abundant fantastic details about the style of songs, Dylan's preoccupations for the lyrics, the session musicians and recording conditions. His account made me want to listen to all the stuff that I don't know."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I'm 53 years old with three kids, a job on Wall Street, and a life-long obsession with Bob Dylan that isn't going away. To this day, his best songs make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. But who is this guy? And where does such extraordinary music come from? Perhaps recognizing that there are never really answers to questions like these, Howard Sounes largely sidesteps them in this excellent new biography, which doesn't pretend to reveal very much about Dylan's mind or the creative wellspring for his work. What the book does succeed at giving us is a is a thoroughly professional, well-researched and clearly written account of the man's life. Characteristically, Dylan refused to be interviewed, as did, apparently, his immediate family members. However, Mr. Sounes obtained a wealth of material from an array of other people, including childhood and adult friends, lovers, band members, business associates, observers, hangers-on, and the many famous and non-so-famous musicians and singers who have known and worked with Dylan over the course of four decades. Sounes even took in perspectives from individuals referenced in Dylan's songs, like William Zantzinger - the real-life and still-living villain from The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll - and Carla Rotolo, the stigmatized &quot;parasite sister&quot; from Ballad in Plain D. Because he's made a career of fleeing the constraints of identity, Dylan is a resistant subject for biography. Born into a nurturing middle-class Jewish family in small-town Minnesota, Dylan (then Bob Zimmerman), came of age and, following a short time at college, took to the road, and to disguise his embarrassingly conventional roots, invented outlandish myths about himself as a singing orphan hobo. Personally shy, but far less innocent than he appeared, he in fact had an overpowering ambition and confidence in his talent. Heading straight for New York City - the right place at the right time - he quickly &quot;made it&quot; as the angst-ridden folk and social-protest singer we know from his early recordings. He had no sooner achieved fame in this persona than he shed it like a snakeskin, reinventing himself as the seemingly nihilistic rock-and-roll poet who was to help establish the foundation for the emerging 60's counter-culture. However, this too was largely an act, and by the time the world was catching up with him, he had moved on again. At the very peak of the late 1960's cultural revolution in America, when rebellious post-adolescents were reaching out to him as a kind of Messiah, Dylan turned his back again and went conventional, retreating to a reclusive, short-haired, family-oriented lifestyle with his wife Sara and the beginnings of a family that would eventually include five remarkably well-cared-for children. Sounes suggests that this was the least contrived period of Dylan's life and the happiest. However, it wasn't to endure either, and his loving, private relationship with Sara finally broke down in bitterness and divorce. Just as the 60's lost steam and the hippies were cutting their hair and getting jobs, Dylan - forever out of cycle - resumed his scruffy, intense, hip-hillbilly style and hit the road again. His conversion to a kind of fundamentalist Christianity in the late 1970's was the most startling of his metamorphoses, and one which befuddled fans will look to this book in vain for Sounes to shed much light on. The author doesn't disparage it, but doesn't appear to get it either, any more than the fans did. Moreover, he seems to lose touch with his subject to some degree from this point on in the book. But then one gets the sense that Dylan was losing touch with himself too, putting out a series of lackluster albums and abandoning himself to endless and apparently aimless roadtouring and womanizing, not really renouncing his religion so much as back-burning it because it was hurting his career. The biography tries to end on a high note by discussing Time Out of Mind, Dylan's latest release at the time of publication. Receiving critical aclaim, the album indeed displays revived sparks of his old genius, but anyone who has experienced the stark, death-haunted tone that pervades it can't be very cheered by this paradoxical show of vitality. One feels that Sounes is whistling beside the graveyard at the end of his book. I for one believe that the hype that has surrounded Dylan for most his career is justified, and that he will probably be remembered as one of the great artists of the late-twentieth century, whether his work cheers us up or not at this stage of life. While Sounes' book fails to reveal his elusive subject, it is probably the best biographical material about Bob Dylan that has appeared to date, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Bob Dylan is indeed a legend and part of the Bohemian 60's folk-rock culture. For anyone who grew up in the 60's, names like Dylan and Joan Baez were the ultimate in folk music. As most of us know, Dylan eventually made a transition from folk to rock. Through the pages of this book, you will read about his personal relationship with Joan Baez, his marriage to Sara Lownds, and a somewhat discreet marriage to one of his back-up singers, with whom he had a child. The author has completed extensive interviews with those closest to Dylan and also discussed his motorcycle accident in 1966 and heart problems encountered in 1997. Dylan has explored many paths and crossed many bridges in his lifetime, and Sounes has captured much of Dylan's successes, trials and tribulations. If there is a downside to the book, it is the focal point, itself. The author seems somewhat preoccupied with the nitty-gritty events of Dylan's &quot;steamy personal life&quot; as opposed to the legendary acclaim of his career. If this is the aspect of Dylan's life that grabs your attention, you will not be disappointed. There are times, however, when the book reads like a glorified tabloid magazine, only in greater detail.&quot;Down the Highway&quot; will, no doubt, compete for popularity with Clinton Heylin's, &quot;Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades&quot;. Heylin's book, on the other hand, concentrates more on the analysis of Dylan's career as opposed to the juicy little details of his romantic life. The reader will need to decide, which aspect of Dylan's life is of greater interest; personally, if you are a devote Dylan fan, I would recommend you read both books."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"As a fan of Dylan's music and as someone who is interested in his impact on the industry and peers, this was an excellent book. The author tells a good story and covers a lot of ground. I think the first half of the book covering Dylan's childhood through his twenties, in particular, was terrific. Great stories and quotes from friends, family and business associates make Dylan come alive.The book spends less time on Dylan's last 20-25 years, perhaps because his personal life and music has been more controversial and uneven. No person or artist is perfect, but Dylan's music and his passion for his craft are pretty close at the end of the day.The book does leave one wondering, what is the plight of great music going forward? To me, the music we have today,is not personal, earthy or passionate like Dylan, The Band, The Dead. It's largely slick and overproduced. Some of the same negatives, Dylan sought out to change 50 odd years ago...."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Anybody looking for an intelligent, non-partisan account of Bob Dylan's life and times will find this very worthwhile. It is clear from the notes that the biography was carefully rsearched and, while Dylan doesn't always appear in the best possible light, the over-all treatment is even-handed and convincing. Recommended as an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This biography details in a well documented manner Dylan's life through the end of the 1970's. The information here is enhanced by interviews with people who knew or somewhat knew Dylan at the time. The remainder of the book offers glimpses of Dylan's later life as seen through legal documents and other publically known material. That Dylan remains inpenatrable even to this level of scrutiny testifies to the loyalty of those that have entered his life. This is no Albert Goldman trash job and the author clearly respects Dylan's achievements tho goes for the salacious where it is available. For me the skimming over of Dylan's recording career in the 80's-90's as well as other aspects of Dylan's performing during that period detracted from what could have been a more comprehensive and wholistic look on Rock's most enigmantic icon.There are some revelations about Dylan's newly discovered second marriage and relationships with now distant or disgruntled girlfriends.Altogether a good read but not a whole lot new."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I really enjoyed this. The guy obviously did a lot of research, but what made it fun to read for me was that it was just a really gripping and interesting story, well-told with lots of completely new material and fantastic pictures. It also made me laugh at times. Great book about a great entertainer."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Dylan comes across as an utterly unpleasant person in this rather good biography. As I am not the greatest fan of his music (for reasons I will come to later) this did not bother me too much, but I am sure some of other reviewers would have punished Mr Sounes for this when rating the book.Dylan is portrayed as thoroughly self-centred, somebody with enormous sensitivity in terms of his own feelings (which he conveys with great intensity via his music), but absolutely no sensitivity in terms of others' feelings. This includes wives, girlfriends and musical associates, all of whom are discarded with disdain when no longer required. This leaves Dylan a deservedly lonely and disillusioned person towards the end of the book. In fact, when he falls seriously ill, only one of his many former band members write him, a fate which is not unexpected to the reader given how he had treated them. It is hard for the reader of this book to have any sympathy with Dylan, and I think the author does a good job of paiting a picture if Dylan without being judgemental- praising the music, but not the man.In terms of music I find Dylan very variable in quality- all of his earlier recordings contain some great songs, but the weaker songs are always too weak for my liking, and not as good as, say, the weaker songs on a Simon and Garfunkel recording. And some of his songs are incredibly naive in terms of lyrical content, like Sunshine on the Union on Infidels. The author describes Dylan's musical decline well, including his return to live performance form in the middle 90's. I just shudder to think how bad exactly his live performances must have been in the early 90's, because I saw him live in 1996 in London and he was still bad enough.The book has some weaknesses admittedly. The writing is not always of the highest standard and I sometimes got the impression that the author was quoting people simply because he had spoken to them, and not because they had said anything worth quoting. But all in all he has produced a fine biography of Dylan, clearly the fruit of much labour."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"There are parts of this biography that I enjoyed very, very much - especially the Greenwich Village Years. Sounes seems to have his stuff together and weaves a great story. And then this thing begins to turn into a kind of expose' - here's the dirt and good stuff folks. Sounes throws things out that sound as outrageous as any one might expect from say... Miles Davis and then he back peddles and gives us a yeah but sort of discussion. This reminds me very much of the book \\"The Last Gang in Town\\" the story of The Clash where Marcus Gray throws out all sorts of disrespectful conjecture to be sensational and then back pedals. I knew Sounes' book was not as worthy as I first thought when I read his comment that \\"Love and Theft\\" was a 3.5 of out 5 stars release. He then goes on to belittle \\"Modern Times\\". At that point I decided he was full of crap. I'm near the end of the book - 15 pages to go and I'm rolling my eyes. This is the third Dylan book I've read (including Chronicles) and a lot of this stuff sounds like it could be published in The National Enquirer. I need to find another book. I want to understand the man's writing process a bit better than I do now. I don't care about Dylan's alleged indiscretions, I want to better understand his process. I want to understand his craft. You aren't going to find that in this book."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Recommended--with the caveat that Sounes doesn't differentiate between legitimate sources of factual information and easily spotted, self-made mythology: his sources include both diligent research and such notoriously fictionalized utterances as stage patter, liner notes, and casually told anecdotes--all of which he uses as if they were statements out of the congressional record. He also, bafflingly, has failed to remotely begin to understand Dylan's religion, Christianity. He mentions a quote from the Bibical \\"book of Paul\\" (none exists with that title) and bungles a couple of other easily researched aspects of what is, in this country, not exactly an exotically unknown religion. Still, it's a good read, and gives a sense of a very mysterious performer and almost deified American icon."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"The author has been able to interview an enormous number of people who were previously reluctant to speak with anyone about Dylan's life. The result is that, at least for the beginning and middle period of Dylan's life, there is an enormous amount of absorbing material. The book was famous for revealing a publicly unknown Dylan marriage and child.The writing is generally sound, though I miss the kind of playful and insightful language a subject like Dylan deserves.The book does not contain Dylan lyrics. Presumably, Mr. Sounes decided to bypass those in order to spring his revelations without seeking permission from Dylan's management. This prevents the kind of depth analysis that a biography ought to include, especially someone as artistically gifted as Dylan.The result of all this is an intriguing book, well worth reading for its biographical insights but in need of a supplementary work to examine Dylan's artistry as it weaved through the facts of his life.--Lawrence J. Epstein, author ofPolitical Folk Music in America from Its Origins to Bob Dylan"},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Down The Highway bears a great similarity to biographies I have skimmed about other pop-culture celebrities such as movie stars and singers. Usually I don't get very far into those kinds of books before my curiosity is completely sated and I abandon them. I finished this biography of Bob Dylan, however, because the subject of this book has triggered in me a greater degree of interest, spurred by both admiration and irritation. It's not that I have a burning interest in finding out about his love-life or any other of the typical manifestations which go hand-in-hand with wealth and fame. But his songs which I am familiar with(mostly 1966 and earlier)broke new ground and introduced into popular culture potent imagery delivered in a seemingly unique and original style. It is so potent that on first encountering his music, many of us feel \\"Wow! This guy is telling the truth in a song, like I've never heard it before.\\" But really! What is the reality of this music? Is it just entertainment, as Dylan himself has insisted to interviewers? The illuminating thing about Sounes' book for me is that due to the superficial treatment of the artistic side of Dylan, we get a very exterior view of his life. Looked at in this way, there is nothing that exceptional about Dylan as a person that would identify him as being particularly enlightened. This very detailed record shows that, according to those who have had associations with him, he has his good points and bad points like everyone else. He was certainly gifted with cleverness at adapting all kinds of material as the raw material of his music. He apparently used his success to manipulate and dominate other people, and could be remarkably insensitive to them. This does not make Dylan worse than many other celebrities. It merely illustrates that he is no Deity. As a stand-alone document, I don't see that much of interest in the book. It is only because of what Dylan did artistically that these circumstantial details acquire significance. I do think it is valuable because it restores some balance to the cult image that has settled around him, and for that reason is a worthwhile supplement to other sources, such as his own,very interior, Chronicles, Vol. 1."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I have been completely wrapped up in this book for three days and the deep mood of Dylan's troubled genius stays with me. I have always appreciated his music. My opinion of the man is both better and worse as a result of reading this story. Many details of his very hidden life were illustrated here and who he is in relationship with the people around him. He would not have been an easy friend, but perhaps neither would Van Gough. The author does a delicate dance of informing the reader based on interviews, research, and personal experience. He crosses the line in a few obvious places with opinion and theory, but keeps it to a minimum. This is an amazing illustration of a superstar who has tried to keep his personal life to himself, and continue to do his job as a poet and musical performer. I was delighted to find that the story ended with Dylan on the road to the only concert I have ever seen of his, and the concert was brilliant."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This books gives you a good overview of Dylan's life. If you are looking for a book about his music or record sessions, this is not the one to get. But if you want to read about his life, including music but also a lot about personal stuff all of which may not be necessarily true (meaning based on interviews of persons who Dylan may have dropped from his life), this warrents your consideration."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This is an excellent biography on one of music's most engimatic figures. If you would like to gain more insight into the life of times of Bob Dylan, then this is the book for you. A lot of critics have pointed out that this book is not incredibly detailed, but that is because they are already familiar with the Bob's life. This book is more of a primer to Bob's life than an introduction to new theses about Bob. The hallmark of this book is that it is unpretentious. While the writer has obvious respect for Dylan, Sounes does not deify him.Of all the books about Dylan, this is the most complete. If you're new to Bob, then this is the book for you. If you've already read a lot of books on him, don't expect a lot of new material. This biography covers Dylan in painstaking detail from his birth in Duluth Minnesota to his tours in early 2000. All in all its an excellent read."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Not a ton of new info here (just the lovechild bombshell, a major scoop on other biographers), but it is refreshing to read a Dylan book that is not written by one of the Dylanologist club, who are increasingly opinionated and boring...read this if you just like the music and want to know more. If you're a taper interested in very opinionated (though ultimately subjective) analysis, read Clinton Heylin's Behind the Shades. Both are good, though this is infinately more readable for the average person as it's more of a straight-up bio."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I read this book as soon as it came out, and I have to agree with the many people who have said that it's not very good. The problem is that Dylan's early years have already been covered many times, and this book doesn't offer anything of interest that hasn't been reported. That would be okay, but there's nothing interesting here concerning Dylan's music, which is the reason anyone would read a biography in the first place. It seems like the author rushed this out to capitalize on Dylan's upcoming sixtieth birthday. That, and a few boring details of Dylan's private life, will not make this a bestseller, or even a definitive biography. Just one more book that fails to capture the enigma that is Bob Dylan. Listen to Dylan's music if you want to know anything about him, it's all there."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"This book uncovers the following &quot;facts&quot; about Bob: (i) he made up stories about himself when he was young; (ii) he was twice married &amp; divorced, and has several children; (iii) his home remodeling project took too long and cost too much money; (iv) he owns property; and (v) he's been a womanizer. Jeez; Bob Dylan appears to be human -- what a revelation. His music is transcendent, however, but Mr. Sounes neither articulates nor even speculates how this skinny, jewish kid from Minnesota came to create some of the most extraordinary music of the century. Until Bob pens an autobiography himself (&quot;Dear Theo&quot; comes to mind as a model of exposition of an artist's psyche), the only insight into Bob Dylan's psyche that we will have is through his recordings and performances. It is there that we experience his magic. This book doesn't come close."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Perhaps I expected too much. And that is what I received: TOO much. This book needs SEVERE editing. I guess the author felt compelled to mention every person who ever met (or at least saw Bob at a concert).

I have read all of the Dylan bios, and this one is far and away the best for those who want to know the man and his music, but aren't obsessed with picking apart every line of his songs (or his garbage).Sounes talked to everyone who would talk (and he must either be the world's nicest guy or the most persistent, because almost everyone talked except Dylan himself and his former wife Sara). He also used documentary evidence to pin down things like marriages, real estate transactions, etc. The portrait of Dylan that emerges is less shrouded in mystery, but no less amazing. We get very clear-headed assessments of controversies like the motorcycle accident and also a good deal of info about how Dylan's music was recorded. Sounes also does a good job of placing the various characters in Dylan's life in perspective, from the members of the Band to the Beat poets to his NYC cronies from the folk scene.Very nicely done, all of it. I wondered how Sounes would handle Dylan's later years, which have consisted of comebacks and long fallow periods. Basically, he handles it like a real biographer -- he tells the whole tale, up to now. The portrait of Dylan that emerges is not unlike that of many other fanatically driven artists -- eccentric, sometimes quite nasty to friends, family and fellow musicians, but above all dedicated to his art."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Exactly when and where did Bob first drop ...? What did Bob think of Sgt. Pepper when he first heard it? What did Jerry Lee Lewis say to Bob when Bob tried to record a track with him? What was Bob's reaction to John Lennon's murder? When &amp; where did Bob marry his 2nd wife, after she bore him his 6th kid? Did Bob really try to join the Dead as a full-time member after being depressed about his career? Is the cost of Bob's second divorce in the early 90s the real reason for the Never-Ending-Tour? What was the main criteria for the flea-bag motels Bob stayed in during the Never-Ending-Tour? Much, much more in this great new book out by Howard Sounes, who apparently spent years getting people to talk. Sure, if you're a Dylan freak (the kind that used to break into his house in Woodstock in the late 60s... you've read it all before. But this book should appeal to everyone, and I guarantee there are things in here you've never heard before. And it's current through the end of 2000, including the death &amp; funeral of Bob's mother. Check it out."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Don't read this book if you want to think Dylan's perfect.It's a great book, engrossing and thorough, but if you want to read about the perfect mythical Bob, it's not the one you want, babe, it's not the one you need. Check out Martin Scorsese's \\"No Direction Home\\" documentary. Or buy any one of the other books by people who were too star-struck or lazy to look behind Dylan's enigmatic masks.There's certainly enough in Dylan's career, particularly his early years, to justify mindlessly glowing accolades. Musicians usually reach their peak younger than most people, but Dylan's rise was so rapid that even the word \\"meteoric\\" doesn't quite do it justice. Like some harmonica-playing Alexander the Great, he had conquered the known world by the age of 25, redefining what was possible, expanding the horizons of all who traveled with him. To his great credit, though, it wasn't all downhill from there; rather, his career richocheted off in a variety of unpredictable directions.Dylan had a unique talent for zigging when everyone else zagged, and Sounes deftly follows his path through all those twists and turns. When music was ruled by bubble-gum pop, Dylan dared to write about social justice and nuclear holocaust. Folkies then rode his coattails to super-stardom, but by the time they got there, Dylan had moved on again, to introspective and personal songwriting. In the late 60s, when hippies flocked to his neck of the Woodstock for three days of peace and free love, he was a rifle-toting property-owner. In the late 70s, when the music industry found itself awash in cocaine, easy money, and easier women, Dylan became a born-again Christian.Perhaps the book's greatest strength is that it makes these various perplexing metamorphoses sound not capricious but almost inevitable. Rather than sticking to the relatively straightforward upward trajectory he followed in the early-to-mid Sixties, Sounes takes an honest look at Dylan's dozen (or so) dark highways--the late-Sixties withdrawal from the public eye, the messy relationships, the messy divorces, the conversion to Christianity, the mellowing of that Christianity over time, the long struggle with alcoholism.Unfortunately, Bob Dylan didn't co-operate with Sounes. I say unfortunately not because I wonder what information might be missing--I say it because the book sometimes takes a breathless, tabloid-ish, you-are-reading-this-for-the-first-time-right-here, me-against-Bob tone. Sounes is evidently proud of his investigative skills, but he's sometimes so busy patting himself on the back that he gets in the way of his own narrative. Dylan's epic battle with manager Albert Grossman, for instance, could have been a compelling, interesting, and surprising turn of events, but like Reuben Carter on a bad day, Sounes telegraphs his punches, vastly diminishing their impact by letting the reader know what's coming.Still, the book is worth reading, and if you don't mind finding out Bob Dylan has a dark side, you'll be intrigued by Sounes' chronicle of it here. There are better tell-all biographies of Sixties rock icons--James McDonough's Neil Young book \\"Shakey\\" was, for my money, more illuminating--but I don't know if there's a better one about Dylan."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"There are many biographies of Bob Dylan as well as a number of analyses of his music. None really do a complete job of capturing the man, not even Dylan's own memoir \\"Chronicles-Volume One.\\" Some people are full-fledged members of the cult of Dylan. They attach extreme significance to every word uttered from his mouth. Every action he takes is fraught with meaning. I don't feel this way but I do appreciate the greatness of his music and his incredible importance to the development of rock music as we know it today.Down the Highway is an interesting book filled with vital information. I learned many things I did not know before, things Dylan simply will not talk about. Indeed, he did not speak to the author of this book. The book is chock full of information on Dylan's formative years, his early girl friends from Minnesota, Echo Halstrom and Bonnie Beecher, his relationship with his parents and brother and his relationships throughout life. I also learned a good deal about Dylan's recent years. One thing that is fairly neglected, considering who he is, is the music. The book concentrates on his life and not on his songs. This is understandable since the book is lengthy as it is. There are other sources to examine the songs in detail.But all the seminal events are here, the dramatic break with the folk community in 1965, the mysterious motorcycle relationship in 1967, the retreat to Woodstock and recording with the Band, the reclaiming of greatness with \\"Blood on the Tracks\\", the breakup of his marriage to Sara, the \\"born again\\" phase and on and on. The book does not whitewash his considerable flaws including his tendency to treat people around him like dirt. His treatment of Joan Baez, throughout, is particularly shabby. His womanizing ways are also paramount. It is unfortunate that Dylan himself, and a number of the people closest to him, did not cooperate and give interviews for this book. Nevertheless, hundreds of men and women, many who knew Dylan well and many who were present at the seminal events depicted, did cooperate. This makes for an interesting and engaging book and there are surely some facts revealed, such as Dylan's secret second marriage and the adult lives of his children that many will not be aware of. Therefore, I recommend it. For those interested specifically in Dylan's music, there are other sources."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Well, it seems to me this guy has done something special. First off the bat, you've gotta remember how much has been written about Dylan over the years - I mean a stack of books, countless articles, TV profiles, the whole deal. So to come up with something new would be real tough. Yet this book is full of new info - I mean every chapter, every paragraph almost. I've heard the author (a limey) criticized because some of this new info is of a personal nature - about Dylan's girlfriends, secret wife and all - but having read the thing I don't get any feeling of sleaziness or tabloid-writing. The fact is this is just great new stuff, stuff that tells us about what the man is like off the stage. To me there are two Dylans - two sides to every artist, right - the guy up on stage performing and the guy off stage. Well, we haven't known a whole lot about the off-stage guy because he is so famously enigmatic, such a mystery man. That's why he's interesting surely, and that's why I felt intrigued to know more. I like a biography that goes behind the scenes - that tells me how the musician/ writer/ painter/ movie actor lives off camera. The &quot;Life,&quot; that's what a want. Not just &quot;the work.&quot; Because everybody's biography is comprised of the work and the life. How could you expect to understand Picasso, for instance, without knowing about the women he used for inspiration. I mean, these things go hand in glove. There's nothin worse than reading a bio that just goes from album to album to show to album, dum de dar de dar. This bio of Dylan gives you all the stuff about the work, sure, all the albums and all, but then you go behind and find out what sort of father he is to his kids (great), what sort of boyfriend he is to his gal-pals (that's a whole story), how much dough he's stacked up. And a lot of it goes to the heart of the man - not just the love life stuff, which as I say is never sensational, just factual, but also the business stuff - the details of the agreements with Albert Grossman, the legal battle with Victor Maimudes, the wrangles with CBS over the years. This is all fascinating stuff and you come away feeling you understand the guy much more than you did. Gee, you can't ask for more than that.As to the writing of this book, this author was a reporter as I understand it, and I've read his book about Bukowski. To me, both read much the same - they are written in this terse, fact-based style, short-sentences, not much comment. Some folks might not like that. Some folks seem to like a lot of flowery language, comment and opinion - nothing wrong with that if that's your taste. I must say, it's not mine. I already know pretty much what I think about the songs - I don't need some guy telling me what he thinks. I expect a biographer to have gone out and discovered stuff I didn't know - facts I didn't know. I can discover comment about Dylan by walking down to the corner bar at 10.:30 and buying the first guy I see a beer. I mean, opinion comes pretty cheap in this world. Switch on CNN and see what I mean. This book, though fairly hefty, is not a huge lump of opinion. It is economic, pared down, terse, sharp. You can see that he cut everything out that was not essential. Even the way it's arranged - just ten chapters. The first five up to the motorcycle smash and the next five from then to now, shows how he has kept things neat and tidy. I read another Dylan book where there seemed to be like 40 or more chapters. I mean, it was a mess. This is orderly. And the writing is fine, in that terse, reporter's style. Only at times does he let himself go a bit and give you a flight of description, and when he does that's a good change of pace. For example, those pages about the 2000 tour, or whenever it was, the last bit in the book, is terrific. So is the opening chapter with the 30th Anniversary show. Real descriptive and fun. Funny, too, by the way - which Bob is himself - and a lot of folks forget. I chuckled a lot reading this. Some nice dry limey humor in here. I mean, the thing is real entertaining, and gives you a feel for what it is like to see the great man on stage.There's been a heap of books about Dylan and I'm sure there will be many more. I don't know what the best of them is. Words like definitive and exhaustive are just for dumbo reviewers. There ain't nothing definitive until we are all dead and gone. Everybody with a brain knows that, surely. But this has to be one of the best and one of the most unusual - an important book, fresh, sharply written, and coming from an outsider who was never one of the well-known Dylanologist crowd. Just a journalist/ author doing a job. And a fine job it is, by my way of thinking. Something special indeed."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Down the Highway\\" not because it is a well-written book (it isn't) and not because Howard Sounes has any insights into the music of Bob Dylan (he doesn't). I enjoyed the book because this is the first biography of the man that gives the reader a feel for what it's like being Bob Dylan on a day-to-day, year-to-year basis. The three years of research that went into the biography focused more on \\"digging the dirt\\" on Dylan rather than Clinton Heylin's (much better executed) book \\"Behind the Shades.\\" That book focuses on Bob Dylan's performance art (in the studio or live) in a very thorough yet opinionated manner.There's a lot of new information in Sounes's book, like Dylan's second marriage and love child, his illness, his finances, court cases, his various residences, relationships, family, etc. This is all very fascinating stuff to learn about and appeals to the side of me that leafs through the tabloids when I'm in line at the grocery store. On the other hand, the book is written in a stilted, un-engaging style that has me guessing that English is not Howard Sounes's first language. He has an annoying way of analyzing Dylan's songs by paraphrasing them. Here's an example concerning the song \\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" from \\"Blood on the Tracks\\": \\"Bob sang of the sun \`sinking like a ship' and his voice brimmed with emotion as he wailed that this was just like his heart when he kissed his lover's lips.\\" (p. 283). Contrast that with Clinton Heylin's peremptory but outstanding musical commentary from his various books and it comes up pretty lame, indeed."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"The enigmatic, mysterious Bob Dylan: who can really know this guy? Sounes does an excellent job of fleshing out the man behind the music, probably about as good a job as anyone could have done. He balances the personal life of Bob (at least what can be known of his personal life) with his artistic life, and presents a full-bodied, complete picture of the man and the legend. Dylan is a man of contradictions (a born-again Christian who remained sexually promiscuous, a person who would treat people insensitively and then feel badly about it but not enough to apologize, a protest singer who was reluctant to get involved in causes), but that's what makes him Dylan. Although familiar with Dylan's music over the years, plus reading many articles and interviews with him, this is the first book-length biography I have read about him, so I may not have the perspective that others do who have compared this bio to others and have found it lacking, but speaking for myself, I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"Down the Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan","review":"Some hundred years from now someone will sit down and make a life out of a 20 volume biography of Dylan. Not that he really deserves 20 volumes, but given his timing, talent & able manipulation of the culture, it's inevitable.

Read some of the others too, while waiting for the full, authorized 20 volume edition. But this one should be on your short list.

The distinctive sound of \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" was created partly by chance after drummer Kenny Buttrey asked Bob what he heard in his head for the drum part. \\"Bongos,\\" Bob replied, with a faraway look in his eye. Buttrey asked producer Bob Johnson, and received the equally strange suggestion that he play cow bell. Determined to prove how nonsensical the suggestions were, Buttrey found a beat-up cow bell and pair of bongos that looked like a souvenir from Tijuana, the skin attached with thumbtacks. (He had to run a cigarette lighter under the skin to tighten it and get a tone.) The young Kris Kristofferson was working as a janitor at the studio and Buttrey asked Kristofferson to hold the !bongos and cow bell next to his drum kit during the take. Without having worked out any drum part, the drummer got the signal they were going to record and he improvised a distinctive tick-tock introduction on bongo and cow bell that blended perfectly with the shimmer of organ and Pete Drake's steel guitar.

Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read.

Although the sailing details are interesting, for me the best part of the book is reading about the clashes of the levels of society back then. The narrator of the series is Edmund Talbot, who is \\"high society\\" with connections. In fact, he's partly jokingly referred to as \\"Lord Talbot\\" because of his airs.

Some react against it, some seek to extend and refine it, and some seek to preserve it. Either way, they must respond to some claims, going back to Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, and other early feminists, such as:-many of the behavioral differences between men and women are socially constructed, not biological-the path to sexual justice lies in the diminution of gender roles (i.e. \\"seperate spheres\\") in favor of free choice-most fundamentally, men and women are of equal moral worth.Moderata Fonte existed before the feminist movement as we know it. As a result, she did not think in the same terms as we would about sexual justice. For example, she never challenges the idea that differences between men and women are intrinsic, as far as I can tell. Similarly, she does not attack gender roles: rather, she asserts that the woman's proper gender role as homemaker, mother, and teacher is undervalued by patriarchal society, and the man's gender role as conqueror and ruler is overvalued. She does not claim men and women are moral equals: she claims women are superior.The book is written as a three way dialogue. Sometimes, the conversation drifts (realistically) to other topics, unrelated to Fonte's main point.

At times whilst reading the book, I found the incompetence of the investigation to be literally jaw-dropping. This wouldn't be so bad except with each missed lead, failure to follow-up a clue or police pursuit of a red herring, more innocent women were being gruesomely murdered. Some facts that stand out from the book are:-Peter Sutcliffe was interviewed 9 times by the police and let go to kill again.-There were 3 different files for Peter Sutcliffe in the police investigation, each with a slightly different spelling of the name and therefore each assuming him to be a different man.-Sometimes, when police were questioning Sutcliffe, the officers interviewing thought they were questioning him for the first time, unaware that he had been questioned by police several times before.-In 1979, a junior detective, after questioning Sutcliffe fingered him as a prime suspect and wrote a report explaining his suspicions and recommending Sutcliffe be brought in for further questioning. The report was lost in the mountain of paperwork.-The descriptions given by the survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks were largely dismissed by the police as 'unreliable'.-West Yorkshire Police were warned that the 'Wearside Jack' letters and tape with the Sunderland connection were most probably a hoax, yet continued to pursue this line of enquiry for 18 crucial months whilst the real Ripper, with a West Yorkshire accent went on killing.-By 1980, the then Prime Minister Mrs Thatcher, was so incensed that the Yorkshire Ripper was still at large after he claimed his 13th victim, that she threatened to go to Leeds and take personal charge of the investigation herself until the Ripper was caught. She was talked out of this by the Home Secretary.-A Home Office task force despatched to West Yorkshire to help with the investigation worked out after only 2 weeks on the case that the killer lived in Bradford, something West Yorkshire Police hadn't been able work out after spending 5 YEARS on the case.-Even when Sutcliffe was finally caught, the police didn't search Sutcliffe properly allowing him to hide a knife in the police station and didn't discover his special garment or 'killing kit' until 2 days after his arrest. This garment was worn when Sutcliffe went looking for prey and proved that Sutcliffe killed for sexual gratification and could have thrown out his plea of schizophrenia in court, yet the garment was never produced as evidence during his trial.In criticism of this worthy book I would say that it was a little too long and could be dry in places. For example, why spend an entire chapter on the career of Detective Inspector Dennis Hoban of Leeds CID, someone who didn't seem to have much to do with the Ripper case and died 2 years before the Ripper was caught? Or why describe in detail all the banking procedures for trying to trace the 5 note clue? I found those particular pages bordering on the tedious.The only other question mark I have is why was the author totally disinterested in Sutcliffe himself? Although I acknowledge that the book is about the police investigation and not the murderer, I don't think you can discount the killer entirely from the picture. In the book, Sutcliffe is a shadowy figure who is finally collared at the end and doesn't seem to have any motive for his depraved crimes other than he is 'wicked beyond belief'. Call me fussy, but I would have liked a little more explanation than this.However, I don't wish to detract from the book as overall I found it to be very interesting. Bilton brings to light some important new evidence, notably the warnings that the 'Wearside Jack' Sunderland connection was probably a hoax and the 'killing kit' that Sutcliffe wore when cruising in his car looking for victims. At times the book is disturbing, especially the descriptions of the modus operandi of the Ripper. Another thought-provoking aspect of the book is that the police, the organisation that the public put so much faith in when confronted by such a public danger, can get such a big and important investigation so wrong year after year.The book ends on a more optimistic note by pointing out that with today's technology, a similar killer would be caught very quickly. DNA testing, computers, geographical profiling and CCTV mean that people can't hide from the authorities the way that Peter Sutcliffe could in the late 1970s."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"Investigative journalist Michael Bilton, over the course of many years of intense study & exploration, has done a superb job in investigating, collating and then detailing the facts behind one of the worst serial killers of modern history, the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe.Sutcliffe terrorized Northern England for a period of approximately five years between 1974 and 1979 brutally killing thirteen young women, and assaulting many others before finally being caught and sentenced to multiple life sentences. Bilton has conducted probing interviews with many of the key detectives, medical examiners & legal practitioners involved in the investigation. Additionally, Bilton clearly details how the investigation became hopelessly bogged down by the sheer volume of information flooding into the police, the lack of proper cross referencing of the intelligence, and how clashes of ego's and pride between senior police officers in various jurisdictions further hampered the investigation. His book also clearly outlines the impact of computer technology and DNA related forensic science on 21st century criminal detection, and how these tools could have greatly benefited the Ripper investigation if they'd been available in the mid-1970's.Bilton's book does get laborious and slow in some places, however the slow nature of the pace is often a reflection of the frustrations and plunging morale of the officers pursuing a faceless monster for many years. The book not only chronicles the damage inflicted by the Ripper onto his victims and their grieving families, but how the investigation took a crippling toll on the personal lives of the police officers involved. For enthusiast's of true crime stories, Bilton's attention to detail is excellent, and his book is easily the most comprehensive and well researched publication on the Yorkshire Ripper murders.( October 2005 Update - UK police have charged a 49 year old Sunderland man over the infamously misleading audio tapes & letters sent to Chief Inspector George Oldfield at the height of the \\"Yorkshire Ripper\\" investigation. Oldfield took the tapes as being genuinely sent by the Ripper, and the investigation went off in entirely the wrong direction by seeking a man with a Geordie accent...which Peter Sutcliffe did not possess. The Sunderland man will face court shortly )Recommended reading for crime fans !!"},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"Wicked Beyond Belief by Michael Bolton is an expose of The Yorkshire Ripper through the eyes of the police and investigators who worked on this biggest manhunt in British History. Anyone aspiring to become a police officer or an investigator should read this book. It is crammed pack with investigative methods and forensic procedures. Not only was The Yorkshire Ripper one of the worlds most chilling mass murderers, but he got away with murdering and attacking women over a period that lasted ten years because of bad policing.The case of The Yorkshire Ripper is a three act story. It is about a serial killer who brought the middle of England to a stand still at night, the citizens gripped in fear for years on end and afraid to go out alone. It is also equally, if not more so, about the establishment of a single Yorkshire police body that combined the talents of different police squads from the towns where the Ripper was at work. It is also about the mistakes that where made during the Rippers legal hearing which led to his convicted and \\"diminished responsibility\\" on the grounds of insanity.The Yorkshire Ripper terrorized Leeds, Manchester, Brandford, Halifax and Huddersfield. He may have murdered more than thirteen women and attacked scores of others. The total number of murders and assaults will never been known. The Yorkshire Ripper picked up prostitutes, hit them with a hammer over the head and left them to die, or as in most cases - he mutilated their bodies using special killing instruments that he shaped from screwdrivers which he always drove around with. He did not take any souvenirs but he did mutilate the woman in a sexual way. This led many detectives working on the case to believe that he was mainly only interested in killing prostitutes and so a huge manhunt began which involved questioning prostitutes, setting up monitors in the red light districts and trying to trace a car that matched the killers tire prints. The Yorkshire Ripper was not long before he started to turn on teenage girls, female doctors, secretaries, school teachers and women walking home alone at night.Trouble for the investigators was brewing since the beginning. The fact that the murders had taken place over various different police jurisdictions meant that the crimes where not linked until at least three women where murdered, but there was also scores of other near-fatal attacks that where never connected. They had the killers name already in their database of suspects to go through and several photofits of the suspect from witnesses. The Yorkshire Rippers car was also on a list of another 140,000 vehicles to be checked. Later as the evidence against the Ripper began to mount up they eventually zeroed in on their man on no less than seven different occasions. Unfortunately bad management and organization in the incident room left the prime suspects file go unnoticed for years. Hundreds of thousands of homes, vehicles and businesses where searched and suspects vetted. A punters 5 became the center of the enquiry and a letter and voice tape recording from the Ripper drove a media blitz upon the people of Yorkshire. LOOK AT HIS HANDWRITING! LISTEN TO HIS VOICE!Read about detectives cracking under the stress and having heart attacks - learn what new victims emerged after the trial - listen to detectives talk about their conversations with the Ripper during routine interviews before he was captured - read about how his friends fingered him out to the investigators only to be ignored - Learn about the never-mentioned-before \\"KILLING UNIFORM\\" that the Ripper wore while stalking his pray. Read about how this demonic device never found its way into the courtroom as damning evidence which suggested that the Rippers claims of insanity where a hoax and that he planned his sexual murders meticulously.The book is slow to start because it goes into a lot of detail about the areas where the attacks took place and the investigators, including their family background. So it is very slow to start, but around 250 pages in it really starts to get cracking. There is still much that the detectives on the case are not talking about and the Yorkshire Ripper himself has also told a lot of lies. However the end of the book does give the whole chain of events from the Rippers own mouth so you get that side of the story too. Overall a very good book but it is long slog to get through the detectives backgrounds before the case begins."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"Michael Bilton, Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper (Harper, 2003)Michael Bilton writes in his preface to Wicked Beyond Belief that \\"I have no intention of pillorying anyone for mistakes made.\\" Intentional or no, however, this fascinating police procedural excels in its quest to create a piece of nonfiction that could never be marketed as a novel; there's no way the reading public could get through it and say \\"this is believable.\\" The only way it's possible is to get through this book and realize that it is, in fact, a piece of nonfiction. Truth is stranger, etc.Peter William Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was convicted of thirteen counts of murder, and seven of attempted murder, in 1981. There are placed in Britain where the mere mention of his name sends shivers up the spines of folks old enough to have been around who were living in Ripper territory. Many cases of murder and attempted murder, still unsolved in the area, are believed to be Ripper attacks. While Bilton touches briefly on the things no one's still sure he did in the last chapter, Wicked Beyond Belief covers the time period from the discovery of the first body in 1975 to Sutcliffe's 1981 conviction. Anyone looking at those dates has to wonder: how did a serial killer, especially one who took so few pains to conceal his identity, manage to operate for so long? The answer is police inefficiency. No matter how you dress it up, Peter Sutcliffe remained at large for five years because, for the most part, Peter wasn't talking to Paul. This is not a book about Peter Sutcliffe, per se; those with more prurient tastes, while they will find some description to revel in here, are gently steered towards David Yallop's Deliver Us from Evil. This is a book about the police who attempted to catch him, and how small errors and inefficiencies, with more than a few bits of luck and coincidence, turned into the biggest cockup in British police history.Through the book's almost-five-hundred pages, you will find yourself wondering again and again how certain things could have been missed, why person X wasn't doing thing Y, and why, most of all, one of the biggest manhunts in human history was so woefully underfunded. Bilton addresses all these questions and more, though even twenty years on, it is impossible to actually answer them all. You will find yourself sympathizing with some of the police and finding others to be incompetent morons who should never have been allowed near an investigation. You will likely find yourself wondering why the public didn't take matters into their own hands and simply lynch every white guy of the requisite age who had a beard. It is only that we know how the story ends that makes this tale readable; had this book been written with the Yorkshire Ripper still at large, it might have caused a revolution.This, of course, is exactly what one should expect of a true crime book. Bilton devliers. ****"},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"I remember the time of the Yorkshire Ripper. I was 12 yrs to 17 yrs old and at school we felt a kind of juvinile morbid delight every time there was a new killing. I remember seeing Sutcliffs photo for the first time and thinking how he looked just like the photofits I'd seen on the telly and wasn't it strange that someone who looked so like the photofits wasn't caught for so long. Also I remember the taped voice and really BELIEVING that it was the voice of the Ripper.It was strange how for some people The Yorkshire Ripper cast his shadow over the whole of England not just the Northeast. It was facinating reading this book and seeing all the behind the scenes incompetence from the upper echelons of the West Yorkshire Police. At one stage they tried looking at over fifty thousand vehicles for tyres that matched trackmarks left at murder scenes but the top brass never prioritised the search. The upper brass cancelled the search after thirty thousand cars had been checked- many of them women owners etc. who could have been checked later. A Detective Constable called Laptew handed a report in which virtually fingered Sutcliff but, because he got his bosses back up at the same time, the report was filed and ignored and then \\"lost\\" when there was an enquiry. The incompetence of the upper ranks of the police was beyond belief. For me, this is what made this a great book. I felt very sad reading about these poor desparate women and their deaths and still have a kind of morbid fascination (I think we all do)for the killings but the overiding factor in the book is the police manhunt and their incompetence though the author is very kind to them- he probably made promises to get his research. The police manhunt takes place in a different world than today with no computers etc. so no national pooling of information or experience. You just get the feeling that although the book says that Hoban, Oldfield and Holland are good coppers, they reached their exalted positions through politics rather than brilliance.I read this book in just a few days.A fascinating read."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"An incredibly detailed and almost exhaustive account of the hunt for Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper. The most expensive and intensive investigation in British history.The book offers in agonising detail the heroic efforts, bad judgements and fatal mistakes made by the Ripper Squad during Sutcliffe's reign of terror. These accounts are dealt with fairly, horror when horror is needed, praise when praise is due. One can't help but \`feel' for those involved in, and scarred, by the hunt.As a reader of numerous Bio's I didn't find the book a slow starter at all - the information given was the exact amount required. Also, i lived in 'Ripper Country' during the terror and the book accurately portrays the fear that gripped the area.On the downside, I felt the book aimed towards those who believe Sutcliffe was never mentally ill and offers many arguments (strong, yet flawed) as to why. Rather than leaving personal opinion in the hands of the reader, \`our' minds are made up for us during its concluding chapters.Aside, excellent and most informative journalism."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"I read David Peace's four novels based on the notorious Yorkshire Ripper case. The use of fiction allowed him to speculate, but his elliptical style and shifting point of view made it difficult to sort out what happened. The novels are reminiscent in style to those of James Ellroy, who did a hallucinatory trilogy set in LA and the Cold War. I bought Wicket Beyond Belief to see if I could get a better factual handle on this mass murderer who escaped detection for far too long. The reality is somewhat mundane, the real criminal less interesting than the fictional, but it was useful in setting forth the police blunders and carried the story through the killer's incarceration and deterioration in prison. You will not feel much sympathy for him."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"This book would have been perfect. I am slowly getting through the text by absorbing the information. The author, Michael Bilton, does allow us an in-depth look at being a Yorkshire policemen when they didn't have computers or databases during the crime spree. What bothers me is that we don't know who Peter Sutcliffe is as a person? What makes him tick? Now I believe Bilton does a servive in painting an honest portrait of policemen and women who served the Yorkshire community during this crime spree. Much like the Green River Killer who killed for years before being caught, I think the police are their own worst critics by blaming themselves for not catching him sooner rather than later. They did everything possible and there were mistakes but they are human too. Yes, the police can be both the enemy and your greatest ally but they did work under a different time and they should be grateful that they did catch Sutcliffe before there were more victims. I kept looking for Sutcliffe's picture until I realized it was on the cover. I wished there was one photo for each victim (living or deceased) to help us understand them. Sadly, most women even in the Green River case were mostly prostitutes and runaways. Sutcliffe had this insatiable anger and hatred of women and attacked them viciously. There is no excuse for his behavior but we have to know his upbringing in order to understand what can prevent future criminals. So I think this book is very good but you have to digest it slowly. There is a lot of information about so many people but he does a nice job in giving a chronology, a map, and helps us with an index."},{"Title":"Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper","review":"My son likes the book, but says there is too much regarding the trial and not enough info about the life and character of the Ripper."},{"Title":"Cooking With Pooh: Yummy Tummy Cookie Cutter Treats : Cookie Cutters (The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh)","review":"A refreshingly simple entry into the cookbook publication industry, this book brings affordable gourmet cooking to the masses by focusing on a single inexpensive and abundant ingredient.

The book presents a wonderful insight into the lives of three poets in particular, William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and Marianne Moore, and is enlightening as to the ways in which they responded and reacted to the increasingly science and technology oriented society they lived in. Since this trend towards a reliance on science and technology has only escalated since the 1920s and 30s it is interesting to compare their position to our own.

Thirkell's strength lies in her acutely observed characters, and amusing plotting. The fictitious locale of the novel is taken from the series of novels by Anthony Trollope known as the Barsetshire novels or chronicles, starting with The Warden and Barchester Towers, two classics of English literature of the 19th century. Although Thirkell's writing and depth of characterization don't compare with Trollope's, her novels are witty and amusing in their own right, a sort of minor 20th century Jane Austen. This is the countryside of P.G. Wodehouse and of Agatha Christie from a different perspective. One of the great pleasures of reading Thirkell's novels, however, lies not just in the work at hand, but in encountering characters one met in prior novels and following their changing lives, in seeing a character with whom one became acquainted in a novel from a different perspective, and in seeing the characters of her novels face the real challenges of life in England as it went through World War II, and in the years following. To some degree, the Thirkell novels about Barsetshire life in the 20th century are addictive, and one is always on the look out for further titles in the series, which are currently being published in the U.S. by a small New England press, Moyer Bell. I highly recommend this novel, and the entire series."},{"Title":"August Folly The Barsetshire Novels","review":"It was through this delightful book that I discovered Angela Thirkell. Since then, I have gone through several Barsetshire periods, during which I read nothing else. Thirkell's Barsetshire books are addictive both because of their delightful humor and because the reader meets the same characters again and again.Much as I enjoy Thirkell's work, however, few of her other novels measure up to the standard set by August Folly. (The Brandons is my other favorite, and Wild Strawberries and Before Lunch come close.) I have found that August Folly is excellent for reading aloud as well, with no overly long passages to obscure the wit and light-hearted plot."},{"Title":"August Folly The Barsetshire Novels","review":"A great example of her enduring stories.

As I am currently (and slowly!) working my way through Anthony Trollope's Barsetshire novels, I love the idea that Thirkell is picking up the same mythical Barsetshire places, families and even the gentle humor and social satire of Trollope. I agree with other reviewers that although she's in the category of Austen or Trollope for social comedy she's not at their level, but her writing reminds me more of Wodehouse (but not quite as farcical) or E.F. Benson's Lucia novels (but not quite as brilliantly snarky). I really enjoyed her light style and fond recreation of life between the wars in the English countryside, complete with summer theatricals, first loves, and other minor village intrigues.

Though Illustarted, it is NOT a picture book.I mistakenly thought it so.The books dimensions are1.69 x 9.40 x 7.12 ,whic are that of a normal harcover book. That said, this is an interesting volume on the creation of the famous chapel at Vence. Matisse was ill, and a young nurse kept him company though the long bouts of insomnia accompanying his illness. Later, she joined the domincan sisters.Matisse felt a huge debt to this woman-later nun, and a serious of circumstances led to the creation of this magnificent chapel. There was a domincan friar,Fr. M.A Courtier,who after being stranded in the USA during WWII,set about bringing modern art together with the sacred.{he edited a journal called SACred art}. A young architect,Br. L.B. Rayssiguier, was designing a new chapel for the NUNS at Vence, and approached Matisse to ask his advice. The majority of this book is the correspondence between Matisse and Fr Courtier and Brother Rayssiguier. The photos show the chapel in many stages of development{though not nearly enough color photos of the remarkable stained glass windows, nor of the marvelous stations of the cross} Still, it was an interesting read,that 50 years ago, the giants of art were in competition to design great works of religious art,whatever their motives.Along with the Rothko chapel{a comparison drwan in the preface},this stands as a monument to a genius,and the letters bewteen Fr Coutrier and Matisse are filled with anecdotes and observations. The Menil Foundation has done an excellent job in the production of this volume."},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","review":"\\"Religions of Rome, Volume 1: A History\\" presents a millennium of Roman religion, following the place and practice of religion in Roman society from the primitive village to the Christian capitol, the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD. This is an impressive collaborative effort by Mary Beard, John North, and Simon Pierce. The prose is dense with information but always interesting and articulate. The authors provide a fascinating window on how religion and its place in society adapted over many centuries and, therefore, valuable insight on how religion functions in human societies, not just ancient Rome. They only occasionally quote a primary source, as primary sources are found in \\"Religions of Rome, Volume 2: A Sourcebook\\" and are referenced in footnotes by chapter number in bold font, so readers can easily locate the document in Volume 2.The history is arranged chronologically into eight chapters: Roman religion before the 2nd century BC, changes brought about by Rome's becoming the dominant power in the Mediterranean in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, religion of the late republic in a state of reputed decline, Augustan reforms and the religion of the early Empire, the boundaries of acceptable practice of religion in three centuries of Imperial Rome, alternative cults in the principate, the dissemination of Roman religion outside of Rome in towns with Roman status and without, and the relationship between paganism and Christianity in Rome of the 4th and 5th centuries AD. There are no accounts of Roman religion written before the 1st century BC, so early Roman religion is somewhat conjectural.The authors don't offer much detail of the particulars of religious ritual. Their focus is on how religion related to Roman society as a whole, the social and political role it played. I found the chapter on acceptable practice particularly insightful, as it describes the ever-changing concepts of what is \\"religio\\" versus \\"superstitio\\" and religion's role in the evolving view of \\"Roman-ness\\", or Roman identity. The co-existence of traditional religion and various foreign cults, including Judaism and Christianity, in the Empire is discussed in some detail and is also especially interesting. The politics surrounding the Christianization of Rome and Christian theological disputes are not treated in detail. Emphasis is on the degrees and ways in which Christianity and paganism co-existed in Christian Rome."},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","review":"This is a very worthy tome on the cultural history of religious life in ancient Rome. I suspect the target market comprises academics and university students of ancient history - and it is perhaps for this reason that I found the text dry, though informative and, no doubt, reliable. This is a valuable addition to my library (if it can be called thus) on ancient Roman religion. I do not give it 5 stars because I would have preferred more discussion on the individual Gods themselves (dealt with within their own topic areas)."},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","review":"The perfect match to the source book this book is also a winner, exploring the diversity and intricacies of Roman religion."},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","review":"There is plenty of beef in this book. When one looks at the recent religions of Rome, one can easily overlook the older religions. The newer religions are logical evolutions of the older. Attis and Cybele are obvious models for Jesus and Mary. The older Mithraeums were obvious locations for the newer cathedrals. Indeed, there is nothing new under the sun."},{"Title":"Religions of Rome: v. 1","review":"It would be news to the pagans that Christianity was just another pagan cult. They knew it wasn't which is why they persecuted them. Have you read Robert Wilken's The Christians as the Romans Saw Them? I thought not. Next you will argue that Aztecs were Egyptians since they had pyramids."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I will not review the general plot or story, that has been done elsewhere.If you like good books, read it. It's a human story about people, prejudice, xenophobia, politics, etc. You know, like real life, almost. Never mind that it's classified as \\"science fiction\\". Don't let that label put you off.For the \\"True Fans\\" dissing this book and pointing you off to other True Science Fiction like Ender's Game (manipulative, boring, and an ending you can figure out halfway through the book), the works of Anne Mcaffrey (\\"Hey, wanna play Dungeons and Dragons? Bring over some pop and chips, too!\\" What are ya, twelve?), Dune (actually, yeah, it's a good book, too, but for different reasons), and perhaps most laughably, Battlefield Earth: get rid of that favourite plaid shirt, move out of your parents' basement, and go pick up a hobby that forces you to get outside and perhaps interact with other people.Yeah, you heard me. Spaceships and intergalactic wars and other such mind-numbing, escapist sci-fi dreck are fine once in a while, but Left Hand Of Darkness is not one of those books, and can not be compared to the likes of any of the myriad glorified biffy accessories churned out by L. Ron Hubbard Industries Inc. or the latest formula Orson Scott Card blather.Yeah, go read it. Take your time, it does move a bit slow at the beginning. In fact, I put it down the first time I tried to read it. But then again I was only twelve years old at the time, and I think something shiny might have distracted me. Once you get into it and realize that it's an adult novel with grown-up themes, the author draws you in with her take on an really different-seeming society that turns out to be not much different than our own (apart from the gender thing), what with the warring factions etc. As for characterization, the two main characters are well-drawn and fully fleshed out, and long after finishing the novel you begin to appreciate their bravery and dedication, especially Estraven's.Just go read it and ignore the whiny sci-fi fans (oh how we hate that term -- boo, hiss!)"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Having been a Sci-Fi fan for many years now, it is with some shame that it has taken me this long to get around to reading anything by Ursula Le Guin. It will not be the last.This is good old fashioned Sci-Fi, not necessarily the finest of narrative styles that I have encountered, but a fascinating idea upon which to hang and explore a story. At its heart a first contact story, but instead of between mankind and aliens between to long seperated sub-groups of the human family. The visitor is a single resentative/ diplomat, recognisably human who has been sent to extend an invite to join the Ekumenical, a loose confederacy of human worlds dedicated to the exchange of knowledge and experience. The world to which he is sent to make contact is Winter, populated by a race of Humans who are hemaphroditic, the result of a genetic experiment by a previous civilisation.What results is a fascinating exploration of the biases and misconceptions that both sides hold, and ultimately how despite both parties inherent differences, how they still share a common humanity."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This novel stands as a monument to what a future-history novel can be, as opposed to what they usually are--which is to say, pretty silly. (And I say that as a life-long fan of speculative fiction in all its guises.)LeGuin grew up in a household of anthropologists, and her science fiction novels all reflect a mind fascinated with the most essential questions of what it is that defines us as human, and what it is that defines our cultures. Each one of the great Hainish future-history series, a very loosely collected string of novels set in a galactic diaspora a long time from now in a galaxy very much at hand, explores a single aspect of human relations; as a science-fiction writer, LeGuin is able to create a world that serves as a custom-built laboratory for the examination of that trait. In The Disposessed, she explores the relationship of ownership to power. In Four Ways to Forgiveness, she explores... well, you know.Here, the topic is simple: gender and sex. LeGuin posits a world, Winter/Gehenna (a Hebrew word for hell), in which the local variant of the human gene stock live in an androgenous state except while in kemmer, when they are briefly metamorphosed into either female or male form--the transformation is determined by environmental forces, rather than personal predilection, so the individual may kemmer as a female in one cycle and a male in another. Now think about how profoundly that would alter everything about human culture. Even in our modern world, where we like to pretend that individuals are not defined by their gender, we can't get past the simple biological facts that define the differences between the genders, not even to mention the social mores that enforce sexual roles.What makes her work particularly amazing is that, in exploring huge issues, she tells stories of enormous specificity with compelling characters. In this novel we follow two, in particular--a native of Gahenna named Estraven and an off-worlder, a male observer for the Ekumen (the 'federation' of star-faring civilizations) named Genly Ai. He and Estraven struggle with both his own preconceptions of gender and love, and Estraven's. The story takes them on an amazing journey of mutual self-discovery that is both touching and eye-opening.Read this book and you will never think about questions of sex and gender the same way again."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Before I get to the main part of my review, I'd just like to point out that the reviewer who claimed that LeGuin is not an SF writer is dead wrong on many, many levels. Beginning with what he thinks \\"sci-fi\\" is. It's not all weird aliens and space battles. In fact, most good SF (not 'sci-fi', an important distinction) is about ideas and explorations and What-if questions.In this way, Le Guin is one of the greatest SF writers of all time. And she's shelved with the SF writers because she's published by an SF publisher and has, on many, many occasions, said that she is indeed an SF writer. She also writes fantasy. If you asked her, she would tell you she does write SF and to think otherwise is to misunderstand her work and the genre of Science Fiction as a whole.Now, on to my review:This is the first book of Ursula K. Le Guin's that I have read. I decided to start with the classics and work my way up to her newer stuff. Now I understand why this is a classic work of science fiction. It is truly wonderful.In the beginning, I wasn't really drawn in. I felt a little out of place, untethered, for the first chapter or so. I knew what the book was about, vaguely, and so had a little outside grounding. The second chapter, which is a folk tale (or oral history, however you want to look at it) from the world of Gethen, or Winter, piqued my interest more than the first chapter.It wasn't until chapter three, when one of the main characters, Mr. Ai, has his audience with the King, that I felt the pull of the story on me. After that, I was hooked. I had sunk down into the world Le Guin created and it took much to pull me out again.Mr. Ai I found to be a maddening character, and as we are seeing things from his point of view for most of the beginning, I really felt that I was getting to know him. The characterization is excellent, obviously, because I found Ai maddening, but only in the way that characters who feel very real can be. His misunderstanding with the book's other main character, Estraven, is interesting because it is Ai's failure to understand people differently gendered from him (be it women in his own culture, or the fluid-gendered people on Gethen) is one of the central themes in the book. I want to beat him over the head for it.I enjoyed being in Estraven's POV much more, and I like how his voice is so different from Ai's. It was a real jolt to come to the chapter where he finally shows us his version of the events that have transpired. But a lovely jolt, because it came at just the right time for me.On the surface of it, Left Hand, like Dune, seems to be skirting the edge of creating a world where these is only one ecology -- that of a perpetual winter. Also like Dune, this is not the case. Le Guin gives us a very plausible world in the midst of an ice age. Still habitable, but human life limited by the environment. The world of Gethen is just as much a character as Ai and Estraven, and just as intriguing.This book has all of the elements of great fiction: Story, Idea, Characters, excellent Prose.My edition also came with an essay by the author that talks about how science fiction isn't necessarily about predicting the future. This book certainly is not, according to the author. It was very much a comment on the present, and still is. One would hope that in the future there would not still be men like Mr. Ai. Or, at least, that they would not be chosen as people to make first contact with alien societies. Ai strikes me as the kind of men found in abundance in late 1960's America, and still found in some corners of 21st century America. It works extremely well in this setting and exemplifies one of the things SF does best."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Although this is not my favourite Le Guin text, she proves yet again the strength and dexterity of her talent as a writer. As with any sci-fi book, it does take the reader a good few chapters to acclimate to the new world with which we are introduced. The beginning and middle of the book did drag slightly, (I'm not a huge sci-fi fan) but the ending and conclusion of the book had me mesmorized. I did not want to put it down until I knew how it would turn out. Don't let people lead you to much before reading this book, as the path of discovery is equally important for the protagonist and reader. Have fun, and enjoy it.vp"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Loved this book. I've read it several times over the years, and recently had to repurchase as I had loaned out my copy a few years ago.Ms. Le Guin's perspective on Sci-Fi (and in my opinion a true perspective) does not focus on big laser fights, shiny spaceships, or bursting cyber-corsets. Not that there isn't romance, adventure, etc.She uses the frame of an alternate reality, removed by space, time, and history, to explore the alien worlds lying beneath the surface of humanity. A socio-cosmic micro-(or tele)scope.Also check out the collection of short stories, &quot;Worlds of Exile and Illusion&quot; which are also set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as Left Hand of Darkness."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The very best example that SF can always give some EXTRA, in comparison to the mainstream literature. This is deeply profound, human and phylosophical fiction. Rarely good fiction. It makes you, in very smooth and aesthetic way - to think about the issues which only seem far away from our nature or place of living. The problems of human's divided enthity are given in a very deeply pre-cognited manner, with such sharpen sense for human nature, that is simply astonishing. And, Le Guin's style is, like always, superb and suttile. It brings you &quot;in&quot; quietly, but after that, you just can't get out of it. Great matters to engage your mind with... Just excellent!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"As Leguin wrote that Genly Ai, the protagonist, sat down at her desk, so too will he sit next to you as you read The Left Hand of Darkness. Ai and his companion become so real as they embark on a torturous journey to free themselves and their souls against all odds. A first-rate political and sociological drama that makes the reader ponder their existence on this world by submerging them in life on another. A must read for the journeying soul."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The lesbian and gay book group at the NYC LGBT Center read this book and discussed it on March 2, 2010. I guess that science fiction isn't very popular since we had such a small group show up for this book.Those who did read the book found that it was difficult to get started, but about half way through, it turns into a very exciting action/adventure story as the earthling and the alien cross the ice. The alternating chapters between the earthling and the alien use a very interesting (and finally revelatory) point-of-view structure to present the story. And it has a very satisfying and moving ending.There were the general complaints about hard-to-remember alien names, too many foreign-planet and foreign-society concepts for no reason, and a slooooow start. A more specific complaint was that the gender-bending didn't seem to bend the alien characters very far, and the plot didn't clearly depend around the genderless aliens, it was just a minor subpoint with a few interesting observations. Years after Le Guin published the novel, she admitted in an interview that she should have made the aliens more feminine since their maleness makes them too similar to the earthling.I'd say read it if you're into science fiction or want to think about gender, but not for easy fun reading. It's ultimately satisfying if you slough it through to the end. An OK book for general or gay book groups, but not recommended."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"First off let me say that I am willing to grant this book two things, regardless of whether or not I enjoyed it: I can tell LeGuin is a great author and I understand why this book won the Hugo and Nebula. The world-building skill illustrated in this book is very impressive. In fact, my favorite parts of the book were the little interspersed \\"myths\\". Also, the idea behind the Ekumen was great. The political intrigues on Gethen, while interesting, we kind of hard for me to follow and I just didn't really care. I also didn't come away from this book feeling either way about any of the characters. I realize the narrative in this book introduces itself as Genly's \\"report\\" to the Ekumen, but even bearing that in mind while reading it wasn't enough to get me actually enjoying the book. In fact, the only reason I finished it is because I don't like \\"quitting\\". Maybe I went into this with inappropriate expectations, but the story and the writing style ultimately just did not draw me in. I will not give up on LeGuin, however. Next I'm going to try some Earthsea books as I hear they're pretty good."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book as a gift. I really didn't care much for it at the time (the mid-80's). However, as time went on - and I reread the book (many times) - I grew to love the concept that Ms LeGuin conceived. A society that has no bias of gender - where rape does NOT exist - where anyone - and I do mean ANYONE has the potential to be one's lover. THAT is what I call a facinating concept. As I said, I've grown to really appreciate this novel - and I wish that she'd written more about the people of Gethan."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Add this book to the Earthsea Trilogy and the oft-anthologized The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas, and you can make a case that Ms LeGuin is one of the top ten sci-fi writers of al time, males and females included."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Genly Ai, the envoy from a confederation of worlds from all over the galaxy, tries to convince the governments of a cold and rather barbarous planet to join their ranks. The first half of this book is all palace intrigue, which drags at times, but it's the second half, featuring a tedious trek across a glacier that really tries the reader's patience. Still, there's no denying LeGuin's achievement in creating a whole new world, with its own language, weather, food, societies, religion, even its own unique ... Not since Herbert's Dune has such a complete, functioning world been created for us. Too bad LeGuin didn't know what to do with her world once she'd created it. There's no action, little enough real character development, maybe a certain sense of adventure, but after all Jack London covered treks through bitter cold weather very satisfactorily many years ago. Most entertaining is the scene where Genry visits a cloistered sect that practices divination; here LeGuin uses suspense and elegant prose to create a very powerful effect. Apart from that chapter though, there's not much to get excited about. Students of the sci-fi genre should be intrigued by the subtle way LeGuin builds her new setting, but action/adventure fans will likely find this book a chore to read simply because so little actually happens. A bit more plot would have perhaps deflected attention from the love story that LeGuin seems so anxious to tell, but the end result would have been much more enjoyable reading for the mass audience."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"One of the earlier science fiction books I read. For me the basic question it forced is &quot;how much of the differences in daily life are due to genes, to social conventions, or simply to expectations ... and what do those differences *really* amount to?&quot; I enjoyed reading this the first time, causing me to become an instant LeGuin fan. I enjoyed reading it almost 20 years later. It still works."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I enjoyed this book enormously, but not primarily because of any &quot;social commentary&quot; aspect. Le Guin creates a society complete with a convincing mythology, religion, and value system; and also one of the most beautiful accounts of the development of intimate friendship that I ever recall reading. Trying to comprehend the depths of another society, the depths of another mind -- it was this that appealed to me the most. The book is well-written and emotionally charged without spilling into sentimentality"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"It's quite a while ago that I read this book, but I still remember that it was very boring. It was a real disappointment, as I'd read other works of Le Guin with much pleasure. I don't understand why it has won 2 awards. Am I missing something? I had problems getting into it in the beginning, then a very boring trek with elaborate descriptions of snow. I can't even remember how it ended. And where's the SciFi? hardly any. I gave 2 stars in stead of 1 because I think it was well written. I mean her sentences are OK, but it's their contents I not satisfied with."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I am a big science fiction fan, but I am forced to review Left Hand of Darkness in a negative light. I just can't see why this book received the great reviews it did; it was such a bore. I expected the 2 Gethen factions to go to war, at least that would have made this novel interesting. I like action in my science fiction; this book was worse than 2061 in terms of action and pace. The most annoying aspect about this novel was the tedious trek by the 2 protagonists to Karhide. That journey used at least 1/3 of the novel space! I thought I was getting my incisors ripped out when I was reading it. The only group of people I would recogmend this book to would be anthropologists due to the cultural emphasis Le Guin puts on the Gethenians."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is one of the few Science Fiction books that might actually qualify as art. And like all true art, this book requires contemplation - it is an event.There are many characters and ideas in this book that will quickly turn off the closed-minded, that some will find disturbing, but if you have the courage to see, it contains grandeur, wisdom, and some of the most beautiful imagery to be found in the genre.In an age when technical yawners and brain-dead shoot-em-ups are the norm, some of the reviews I've seen for this book should not be a surprise - many of those weaned on today's science fiction will not have the intellectual jaws necessary to masticate this one."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The majority of people that contribute amazon reviews are devotees of the book, inflating the star rating beyond what it deserves. My three star rating may not make much of a dent, but hopefully it will give a more balanced look to those straddling the line about buying this book.The Left Hand of Darkness was a good, solid book, but it did not elicit tears at the end or change my life in any tangible way. Simply put, I enjoyed the story. It is a fast read, with an imaginitive setting and a few interesting characters (unfortunately, the main character - Genly Ai - does not number among them).This is not a sci-fi book as much as an exploration of a &quot;what if&quot; scenario that happens to take place on another planet. A fun, rainy-day Sunday book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"There are many different ways one could look at this book; in this review I'll look at it as contrasted to Frank Herbert'sDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1).--The first major difference, is that Dune was authored by a male author and The Left Hand of Darkness (TLHOD) by a female author.--Dune took place on the desert planet Arrakis. TLHOD took place on the cold planet of Winter.--Dune focused more on ecology, politics and some action/war. TLHOD focused on \\"neither male nor female\\" sexuality, legends and traditions of the locals, reasons for the inhabitants of Winter being \\"anti-war\\" and also a few political themes.--In Dune, control of the planet was achieved by militaristic means. In TLHOD, Genry Ai, the main character, was trying to integrate the planet into the rest of the Universe by purely diplomatic means.Such significant differences as these helped make TLHOD a very enjoyable read and not just another \\"planet-building\\" novel. The story reads as part-travelogue, part-folk tale, part-essay, part-adventure. My favorite parts being the chapters where the two characters are out on the northern ice.There are also many great quotes in this book, one being (from page 215):\\"In the city, rain is an inconvenience; to a traveler it is a catastrophe.\\"This edition of the book does have a small appendix at the end, explaining the unique time-and-date system used on Winter. Unfortunately there is no map of the planet (would have been most helpful in visualizing where cities/countries are in relation to each other) and there is also no glossary, although most of the alien terms can be figured out with a little thought along the way.Just as light is the left hand of darkness, so is The Left Hand of Darkness the antithesis of Dune."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book is a testament to why I should never go to a bookstore by myself.I went to [insert name of large bookstore chain], wishlist in hand, with the intent of purchasing one or two volumes contained therein. Couldn't find what I wanted, but I found this (and two others not on my list) instead. Sigh.By the way, I left my wishlist sitting on the checkout counter.Cover blurb: \\"On the planet Winter, there is no gender. The Gethenians can become male or female during each mating cycle, and this is something that other cultures find incomprehensible.\\"The Ekumen of Known Worlds has sent an ethnologist to study the inhabitants of this forbidding, ice-bound world. At first he finds his subjects difficult and off-putting, with their elaborate social systems and alien minds. But in the course of a long journey across the ice he reaches an understanding with one of the Gethenians -- it might even be a kind of love...\\"I understand the purpose of cover blurbs is to tease and tempt and lure the reader into purchasing the book. And the blurb quoted above is accurate as far as it goes, but overall it presents a distorted view of the nature of the storyline.Genly Ai is First Envoy of the Ekumen, sent as a preliminary ambassador of sorts to the Gethen, to introduce them to the idea that other worlds exist, and to invite them to join the Ekumen, a loose economic alliance of industrialized worlds. He is championed by Therem Harth of Estraven, a Gethenian of prominent position who believes in Ai's purpose and promotes his cause. But politics, regional rivalries, and a mad king come into play, and soon both Ai and Estraven are outcasts whose lives are at risk.Le Guin paints a believable picture of an alien world, harsh and relentlessly cold, but full of the beauty of ice and the joy of its people. The story is told from multiple perspectives, first Genly Ai's, then Estraven's, with occasional forays into third person omniscient accounts of Gethenian mythology and folklore. It's a wonderful, moving and clear-eyed look at humanity, including but not exclusively focusing on how sexuality shapes culture and custom and politics."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Le Guin has created book that takes the reader to another world using imagery to paint a vivid portrait in the mind of the reader. A race without gender, such as the one that Le Guin shows us, has infinite possibilities and infinite flaws. A world blanketed by a never-ending winter that is hostile even to its inhabitants. An envoy sent to offer alliance and to be patient for acceptance.The main character, Ai, is this envoy. He is faced with an almost impossible task, he has to first convince a genderless race to accept him a male, and he then has to persuade them to accept his proposal for alliance. Ai spends his first year overcoming such prejudices and delays, and is faced with more years containing the same tediousness. He then meets Estraven, a native willing to look past the handicap of Ai's gender. Together they must succeed with Ai's mission, and they must learn to love each other, much as we must look past prejudices."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"IT is so sad that everyone I know thinks of Ursula Le Guin as just an SF writer, if they have heard of her at all. Especially when she is probably one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.A literary classic is, by definition, a work that has pushed the boundries and created a new demension in literary understanding. LeGuin more than suceeds here by daring to lay before us themes that are alluded to in the sixties(but not excepted as open topics of conversation until much later), and weaving them into a convincing and powerful story.I once heard that this book was one of the top five bestsellers of all time on college campuses. I doesn't surprise me in the slightest, but I haven't met an English Lit Prof who admitted to reading it yet!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness is one of those science fiction books that belongs on every fan's \\"must-read\\" list. It's easy to see why it has gained the status of \\"classic\\" (and won both of science fiction's major awards): at the time it came out (1969), gender roles, women's lib, etc., were big deals, and this book delves head-on into those issues. What is interesting, to me, is the book was written by a woman, and it is told (mostly) first-person from a man's point of view. What's remarkable is that Le Guin writes the man well - better than most men do. Science fiction is often criticized for having flat, one-dimensional characters, particularly as regards to women. Many of its writers are often taken to task for portraying women innacurately and uninterestingly (Asimov, Clarke) or from a sexist point of view (Heinlein.) Consequently, many women writers who attempt to portray a man (and this trend is by no means restricted to science fiction) are often too sympathetic towards the women's cause - playing the \\"sexist\\" card - or end up portraying the man in exactly the way that they often claim the women are portrayed. What's remarkable is the Le Guin avoids all these pitfalls. Another of the book's strengths is that Le Guin has created a whole world - complete with a set of customs, language, and the like completely different from those of earth - an accomplishment comparable to the master creations in other classic science fiction novels (Dune, The Mote In God's Eye.) Le Guin is, principally, a philosophical writer, and the parts of the book that delve into the issues (of sexuality, ethical relativism, etc.) are its strong points. That said, however, her hand is less adept when she turns it to action. This type of writing is not her strength, and many of these sections come off as dry and boring when they are supposed to be exciting, suspenseful, and fast-paced. Particularly, the last section of the book (the winter trek) can be trying, and is, in my opinion, a mistake. Le Guin is much better when she sticks to the philosophical and ideological issues instead of trying her hand at action. Consequently, though all serious science fiction fans need to pick this one up at one time or another just to be able to say they've read it, those who prefer the genre's idea-exploring side will find it a much more satisfying read than those who go for good ol' rollicking action adventures."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I am not one for radical science fiction novels. Most of them are either too confusing, too flat or just too plain weird. So, when my English instuctor practically threw this book in my lap one day and told me, &quot;Here, Erin. You'll love this!&quot; I wasn't exactly thrilled.Little did I realize how amazing this book actually was. I spent three months reading the first two pages and two days reading the rest. Not only does this novel bring out vivid characters and a harsh, daring plotline, but a provoking of thought as well. It makes you consider different aspects of our own society and how we are born into its plain.I'm rambling. If you love science fiction, this is the book for you. If you don't, pick it up and try it anyway. You might be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is probably the most beautiful book I ever read. We talked about this in a university class, but I've read more by LeGuin since then. Her unique viewpoints (report/myths/diary entries) add to a well thought-up and convincing story about life, friendship, society and sexuality. Don't expect gun-totin' space battles though, this book is not at all about that. It's about humanity, not about technology."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The wonder of this story is how well it has remained current, up against the sexual upheavals since its publication. For a story almost as old as I am (and I remember Univacs), it never loses its ability to make one ponder, question and rethink everything related to the roles placed upon us by our gender. More than an exploration of &quot;who's the female this time,&quot; this work truly defines the words &quot;speculative fiction&quot; - the words are familiar, the concepts are not - and that is where the fun begins. It's not about heterosexuality vs. homosexuality, but the roles intrinsic to gender and how they shape us as people. It'll make you think twice about buying those blue striped sheets when you find out that baby somebody is expecting is a boy. Or the itchy, frilly dress if it's a girl"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When I read a book, I look for two main things. Story and narration. Is it a compelling story with well written characters. Does the plot hold up and is it well constructed. Narration is the pace of the story. Does the dialog sound real? Does it get bogged down in too much description that doesn't move the story forward, or do I end each page eager for the next one?For this book I give story a 3.5 and narration 4I've been on a si-fi kick lately. I've decided Si-fi is hard to write. And authors that do it well, need to get more credit. The author has to build a whole new world while developing characters and moving the story forward.I have been quite disappointed lately in some of the &#34;great&#34; sifi books. Either no story, or way too much description. This was much better.I didn't really see any deep feminist undertone to the book like I was expecting. There was some narration on how life is different on this planet without sex being such a major roll in culture. But it was not too deep, nor did it play much roll in the story. Over all I liked this. I would give it a 3.5, but I'll round up to 4 since science fiction is hard to write."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I read this book for a Coursera class: Fantasy and Science Fiction. Among all of the book selected for the class, this was my least favorite. While Le Guin was able to construct a complete culture and history of the people of Gethen, the androgynous society was not engaging to me. However, I cannot deny that the concept was highly original, especially for 1969, and the reader is left with many questions to ponder."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"One might accuse this book of being subtle. The sci fi minimial. What interested me most was the interaction of an envoy from another planet with people who never thought there was life anywhere else, the politics of convincing etc. The book might seem slow in the beginning then gets slower, then becomes similar to reading about the Shakelford Exbidition in Antartica, but ends with a satisfying and somewhat uplifting denoument.

The characters and philosophy carried the entire story; it wouldn't make a great movie. Some say that LeGuin fails in creating an androgynous race, but I disagree.

Very deep and profound, but a bit slow, IMO.Word Ninja"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I heard the book as an unabridged audio tape, but had trouble sticking with it. The symbolism was deep and the writing good... however, my definition of great Science Fiction is Robert Heinlein's 'Stranger in a Strange Land' or Frank Hebert's 'Dune' or L. Ron Hubbard's 'Battlefield Earth' . Maybe a world without sex roles or biases would fascinate some, but this just isn't great science fiction."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I began reading \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" in the hopes that it would live up to the stellar reviews left by other Amazon users. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. While Le Guin's conceptualization of gender on the planet Winter is innovative, I found the plot and character development to be mediocre, at best. I have no doubt that \\"Left Hand\\" was ground-breaking when it was published in the 1960's; however, a modern reader will likely be unimpressed. I suggest reading the Chronicles of Earthsea for Le Guin at her best."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I was forced to read this novel for my women in literature class. Actually, as I write this now, I am studying for my final. Anyways, I wasn't exactly excited to read this to begin with, and now I realize that it was with right reasoning. While the basis of the novel, the analysis and investigation of a world with one gender, is interesting and suggests cultural issues surrounding gender roles and gender equality, Le Guin spends so much time developing minor characters and minor cultural concepts (language, religion, hierarchy) that the plot is second-hand (no pun intended)...so much to the point that the plot is almost lost. If Le Guin had delved more into the plot rather than develop bizarre characters and other minor details, then the novel may have been more interesting and inviting. Sure, it touches on interesting topics, it could have been done so in a more engaging manner. Plus, she gives characters such crazy names that it's hard to remember who's who. Bottom line: Don't waste your time with this story, if you want to investigate gender roles, do so on your own time and look for other novels. Supposedly it beat out Vonnegut for the Nebula Award in '69 and I have no idea why..."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The premisse of this book is thought provoking. What if gender did not exist? If everybody was genderless in most of the time, but male or female once a month, never sure which sex it's gonna be, since it depends on the sex of the partner. How would it change character, politics, friendship?Le Guin has an excellent writing style that begs to be read out loud. She has also created a couple of interesting natives for the protagonist to deal with, and a well developed plot (yes, folks, there is a plot, don't believe those who couldn't find any) in which the premisse gets a chance to be exposed.But the whole would have been more effective and provocative if she would have stopped calling every hermaphrodite &quot;he&quot;, &quot;son&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, etc. Now, as it is, in the tension of the plot with all the he-ing you sometimes forget about the ambivalence of the natives. And what whould have added to the tension between the genderless natives and the male visitor, would have been when the man would have behaved a bit (more) manly.Then why 5 stars? ---- It's a good read. That's the first a book has to be. It sets your mind and soul in motion too, and there is a wonderful underlying serene, thoughtfull atmosphere throughout the book. But most of all - I was moved. That doesn't happen often. The book hasn't suffered from the time that's past since it received the Nebula ('69) and the Hugo Award ('70), and it will survive the next decades without any doubt."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula K Leguin of course the writer of the Earthsea Trilogy, this is one of her earlier books. I listened to the audio version.The novel covers the experiences of a \\"Mr. Ai\\", called as such by just about everyone he meets. He is more or less an Earthling emissary (mostly like you and I) sent to a faraway planet to check it out, and the book reads in the 1st person as if it were a journal being read after the fact.Mr. Ai spends a great deal of time talking about and visiting Karhide, the name probably being uttered at least every other page in the novel. An icy country where humanoids live in a completely nongender sexless state, going into \\"musk\\" once a month- where they morph into either a man or a woman at random.....do their duties... then turn back. Somewhat like elephants sex-wise and common alien theme, echoed by Mr. Spock and Zoidberg of Futurama, etc. Ai is sent as a scout representing the Good Galactic Empire (I forget what it was called properly).... a unified multiworld entity loosely resembling the original Star Wars federation before it was corrupted. All on his own and with nothing but a sort of transmitter hooked back to home base, he meets with the Karhidians and other peoples, charts how they differ from himself and extends the olive leaf. In the course of doing so he alternates between being pampered by politicians in luxury and being imprisoned, chased by the law, subexisting in poverty, etc.He strikes up a friendship and eventually spends a great deal of time on the run with a manwoman called Estroven(??), a name sounding all to much like Estrogen.....Despite its rather suspenseful title, I found the book not particularly exciting, but interesting enough to keep you reading. It suffered a bit from the 'past 1st person' tense in my opinion and the events were read off rather mechanically without seeming to have much realtime action or suspense. As in, having the air of someone reading off their own diary from 20 years ago, reclining in a musty old library. There were also somewhat confusing changes in 1st person as other characters took over as narrator and Mr. Ai became known as \\"The Envoy\\". The phrases \\"Mr. Ai\\", \\"The Envoy\\" and \\"Karhide\\" took up a goodly chunk of the book's text, though it could have just been my imagination.All in all I found it a passably decent story, but not as good as the Earthsea ones and probably not one I will read over again."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The author of this book can boast a number of awards to shame any living writer and the book itself has reaped two impressive ones.Still, I cannot avoid the feeling of its uselessness.The plot meshes the description of the clash of an alien envoy with a local culture with the narrative of a complex political intrigue inside the same local culture.Both are finely drawn but utterly lacking interest. Ms Le Guin deliberately keeps the story's profile low so that even the adventure filled escape of the main hero from an hostile country highlights the majesty of the landscapes of the planet he has landed on.Unfortunately both the impressive landscapes and the political intrigue are not interesting enough to be stretched for 300 pages and what she achieves , more than a believable matter of fact report of a first approach of two cultures, is an unavoidable sense of dullness.Chapeau to the writer's skills, which are many, but, sorry, I still think a book has to be entertaining in the first place."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin is just a science fiction/fantasy writer in much the same way that Moby-Dick is just a story about a whale. Her work transcends genre. In her novels and stories, she bends time and space and other elements of reality to suit her purposes -- in The Left Hand of Darkness bending gender to explore common elements of humanity. Any fan of great storytelling and lucid, beguilingly simple prose will love her books. The Left Hand of Darkness is her best. She brings an alien world to life -- populated by hermaphrodites -- to ask and only partly answer big questions regarding what is best in humanity. LeGuin does so with a story of two people thrown together for an epic adventure in a hostile setting. The novel is a great read, a must-read.This particular edition is an excellent reissue of the novel. The print is of good size and readable, unlike prior paperback editions of this book. If you read this novel years ago, re-read it. It is a standard that should be re-read every decade or so. Just as someone once said you never paddle down the same river twice, the passage of time and gaining of maturity made this novel all the more satisfying the last time I re-read it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"If you like reading science fiction at all, you should read this book.I will warn you, the way Le Guin writes makes for a very detached and fluid atmosphere, but in the end, it added to the book more than detracted. It took me a while to really get into his story, but small things drew me in as I began to want to know more and more about the protagonist, Genly, the culture of this planet and the politics which play a large role to the plot. In the end though, I cared more about Genly and his journey than about the Ekumen. The things he discovers about himself, humans and our preceptions of the world are the things in the book that I loved."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago, and 2 worn out copies later, have lost count of the number of times I've re-read it.It is an extraordinary book, which for me, raised a whole number of questions about how our society was formed, how it works and how it fails to work. As a femail scifi reader this was one of the first books I read that called me to question. So many stories were 'hard core', being about technology and the impact it was likely to have. Nothing wrong with that, but this is so much more.For me, one of the key moments in the story is when I realised that Genli was a man. I guess being female, and identifying with the character, it simply hadn't occured to me that he was a him! This made the story spring into relief - an impact that was barely less striking for the second and subsequent readings. It takes a scifi book to tackle a subject of gender impact from such a novel angle, and causes the kinds of questions other more books more obviously about this cannot raise. It cleverly puts the reader into a position of observer of the difficulties of dealing with gender issue that are quite different from those we experience, and thus causes similar questions to be raised about our own gender issues.And contrary to many other critics - I do think it is a good read as well!This is a book that should be on the reading list of every school."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"On the surface, \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" appears to be a cold, clinical, obscure science fiction novel, but on further inspection it turns out to be an endearing story about diplomacy, friendship, understanding, and cooperation. If, as Le Guin states in the introduction, all fiction is metaphor, then this novel could be a model of the potential for world harmony.A man named Genly Ai, for all intents and purposes an Earthling like us, is sent by a sort of interplanetary art and commerce forum called the Ekumen as an envoy to the isolated wintry planet Gethen to convince the Gethenians to join the other planets in open trade and communication. The first nation he visits, Karhide, responds to his request with skepticism and hostility, and he doesn't fare much better in the neighboring Orgoreyn, where he is arrested and sent to a prison labor camp.The Gethenians are human, but they have one unique remarkable attribute: they are androgynous, \\"hermaphroditic neuters,\\" and each one is able to exhibit either male or female sexual characteristics for the purpose of reproduction. This allows them a society that is free from traditional gender roles, so they have no concept of masculinity or femininity. Their civilization seems somewhat primitive compared to those of other worlds; one is unsure whether their physiology is a result of evolution or de-evolution.Genly's closest Gethenian ally is a man named Estraven, the exiled ex-prime minister of Karhide who escapes to Orgoreyn hopefully to help Genly on his mission to convince the government to link with the Ekumen. The best section of the book is the description of Genly and Estraven's difficult journey through hundreds of miles of barren tundra, where the term \\"male bonding\\" takes on strange new dimensions due to Estraven's physiological peculiarities.I loved the icy imagery of the weather, the cities, and the landscapes, the depth of the Gethenian philosophies and the richness of their culture, and the tightness of the plot, which achieves a satisfying closure. This is an excellent work of science fiction that delights in pure storytelling rather than making the reader slog through a morass of technical details."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Never mind this novel's copywrite date... although science has advance since the writing of this novel, the art of science fiction has not. Le Guin is the undeniable master, and this is the only science fiction novel I can honestly say I've reccomended to everyone I know. This is was literature should be - about people, regardless of race or planetary orientation.Definitely one of the best novels I have ever read, in any genre."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I had no idea how to review this book, so I wrote Ms. Le Guin a letter. I thought I would include part of it as my review. She responded to me, and it was a real thrill. See the letter below:Ms. Le Guin,I am a 33 year old school teacher in Edinburg, IL. I teach English to middle school students. I occasionally teach college composition classes as an adjunct faculty member. I am also an avid reader and a struggling writer. I have always believed that in order to write good fiction one has to read a lot of good fiction and a lot of bad fiction. I have done both. I began a quest to read all of the Hugo Award winners to give myself an impression of what many consider to be good writing. That is when I discovered your novel THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS. It was sitting quietly in a used bookstore with a tattered cover and a well-read spine.As I began to read it, I have to admit that at first I wasn't particularly impressed. It seemed an odd world, and I was having a hard time getting into the story. This did not last long. The greatness of the book began to emerge. I began to read at a quicker pace. I became so enthralled with the culture you had created that I could think of little else. You took me to the places that you had fashioned and made me live as one of your characters. I remember your descriptions of the snow and ice. I actually felt cold most of the time I read your novel. Perhaps this degree of identification is unusual, but your work moved me so much that I can only describe it as awe-inspiring. I truly felt that I was in the presence of a true master. I cannot say for certain why the book is so wondrous. I have tried to analyze it many times in my mind. I am a huge fan of writing reviews but have put off writing one for this novel because I honestly do not know what to say. Long after the last page was read, I kept thinking about it. I am still thinking about it today. It is everything I want to accomplish in a book of my own one day. It has a timeless quality, and a sort of class that sets it apart from many other works. The magic of it is that I cannot put my finger on why I like it so much. I have wasted many hours reading bad books, and I have spent many hours reading books that can only be described as wonders. Yours is among the wondrous. Yours is beyond them. The experience of the novel touched my life, and it truly taught me what good character development is. It taught me what good setting is. It taught me that no matter what we write about it comes down to humanity. The problems we all face each day are paramount in our minds. The solutions, though sometimes out of reach, are what we all strive for.I am sure you have received many letters about your works over the course of your career, but I humbly submit mine. I felt that I could never put to rest the feelings that THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS evoked from me unless I wrote to thank you personally. I am glad for the opportunity. I hope that it does you good to know that you have encouraged a humble teacher to continue to strive to create a story as great and wondrous as yours. Perhaps one day you will read something of mine and be able to know that you had a hand in my inspiration. Thank you so very much."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"After reading The Left Hand of Darkness, I feel let down. I was looking forward to reading a philosophically-rich book detailing the struggles, frustrations and (hopefully) triumphs of a envoy dealing with an alien world and its social structures. After finishing this novel, I was reminded of the context of when this novel was written, and the largely stiff male readership that SF had in a wholly different era of the 60's when such concepts as gender equality and racial struggles were still being resolved. I could see how this novel might have been groundbreaking in its own era. For the modern younger generation, though, or any enlightened individual for that matter, there isn't much in this one that will warrant trudging through its 300 pages.Although I only awarded two stars overall, I will say that I loved the mythological interludes and certain sidebars. This is the first novel I've read of Ms. Le Guin and believe that to be her strong point as an author. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough of it to propel me through a main story which severely lacked momentum. She can really lay down some excellent myth, however, in a style that is gentle and poignant, and I really do look forward to reading other works by her. It's possible this wasn't the right book at the right time for me for me to have read.The gender-bending aspect of the Gethenians, which really should have taken front-and-center, seemed to receive a 'once over' treatment instead of really getting down and dirty with details of a sex-shifting society. Perhaps Ms. Le Guin wanted to take the high road or didn't feel completely comfortable with the territory she had created here, only wanting to scratch the intellectual surface of it. It doesn't really seem her style to write of sex or passionate feelings, she seemed to blush or veer away any time one of the characters went into 'kemmering'. She strikes me as a writer who lives in the mind, and not in the loins. In any case, as a reader I felt somewhat left out in Winter's cold by Genly Ai's detached, over-intellectualized, and remarkably passionless attitude toward the sex-morphing of the Gethenians.While the author did seem to attempt to create political intrigue and tension, it just wasn't fleshed out enough to carry the action. It seems there was plenty of prima materia to work with: two (or more?) competing nations, an outcast clan of fortune tellers, and so on. So much there to work with, and yet somehow I was left with a feeling of emptiness about what could have been.I limped through this book. But yet I am encouraged by what I've read and look forward to reading other works by Ursula Le Guin."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I recently decided to upgrade my reading selections by focusing on more widely acclaimed classics and award winning literature. Through this effort, I identified Ursula Le Guin's \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\". I was surprised to see that it was a Hugo and Nebula Award winner, as I was not familiar with it.I am an avid science fiction fan and am familiar with Le Guin. As a young reader of LotR, I opted against reading Le Guin's Earthsea novels, thinking them to be among the cheap ripoffs of Tolkien. I was unaware that she had written science fiction, and award winning science fiction at that.This is a very good novel, though as some have pointed out, not heavily into the science aspect of \\"science fiction\\". It is, however, very well written from the standpoint of the interpersonal relationships contained therein. The story revolves around a loose trade confederation of worlds called the Ekumen. An emissary from the Ekumen is sent to a planet for the purpose of recruiting the inhabitants into the confederation. The world consists of two primary nation-states, locked in a battle for supremacy. The interplay between the Ekumenical emissary and representatives from the two nation states are the underpinnings of the work.The World created by Le Guin is fascinating and believable. The personal and political conflicts are believable and complex. There are many intricacies contained in the book that add greatly to its enjoyment. I've seen it labeled \\"political science fiction\\" and the tag fits nicely.There is depth and philosophy to be considered, though not to the extent you might find in some of the works of Frank Herbert or Philip Dick. It was very worthwhile read and one that gave me a new appreciation for Le Guin."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A Masterpiece of \\"social science\\" fictionUrsula Kroeber Le Guin has written novels, poetry, children's books, essays, and short stories, most notably in the fantasy and science fiction genres, and it is as writer of the last of these that she is best known. She was first published in the 1960s, and her works have explored eastern spirituality and ecology as well as anarchist, ethnographic, feminist, psychological and sociological themes. She has received several Hugo and Nebula awards, and was awarded the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Grand Master Award in 2003. Le Guin was raised in Berkeley, California, the daughter of the anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber (her father was granted the first Ph.D. in Anthropology in the United States in 1901 by Columbia University) and the writer Theodora Kroeber.Much of Le Guin's science fiction places a strong emphasis on the social sciences, including sociology and anthropology, thus placing it in the subcategory known as soft, or \\"social science\\" fiction. Her writing often makes use of unusual alien cultures to convey a message about Earthly culture. Perhaps the best example is her exploration of gender identity through the hermaphroditic race in \\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" which forms an important part of the canon of what has come to be called feminist science fiction.\\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" (\\"LHOD\\") is the account of the efforts of an Earth human named Genly Ai, a representative from a galactic federation of worlds (the Ekumen), who seeks to bring the world of Gethen (also known as 'Winter' for its globe-spanning frigid climate) into that federation. The inhabitants of Gethen/Winter are androgynes, biologically hermaphroditic humans. For twenty-four days of each twenty-six day lunar cycle they are biologically neuter, and for the remaining two days are either male or female, as determined by the presence of a prospective partner. Thus the mother of several children may be the father of several more (families on Winter are large) and humanity is not categorized into protecting (\\"male\\") and protected (\\"female\\") halves. This is a situation that makes Genly, an Earth male, more than a trace uncomfortable and his proneness to ascribe all of the negative, supposedly \\"feminine\\" traits of obliqueness, inconstancy and untrustworthiness to his multigendered hosts is painfully evident.The story opens in the feudal kingdom of Karhide, one of Gethen/Winter's many nation-states where the two primary characters, Genly of the Ekumen and Estraven, the prime minister of Karhide, are introduced. Karhide is a barely governable feudal monarchy (\\"a bloody family quarrel rather than a nation\\"), ruled by a highly eccentric and ineffectual king whose chief interest is in preserving his royal prerogatives against rivals for the throne. Genly, dissatisfied with his rebuffed attempts at enrolling reactionary Karhide into the Ekumen, leaves the capital city hoping to explore the older mythology of the country-folk and to learn more of the ancient Karhidish religion, its priesthood and its highly accurate practice of prophecy (\\"foretelling\\").Satisfied that he has seen enough of impoverished Karhide, which he believes is too backward, anarchic and irrational to understand much less accept Ekumen membership, he leaves for Orgoreyn.In the second part of the book, the account unfolds in the centralized, efficient and totalitarian state of Orgoreyn, where Genly is accepted as a means to an end by an Orgota political faction. When Genly first arrives in Orgoreyn, he is pleased with the state of the country, believing it more progressive and less hidebound in tradition than Karhide, and more ready to accept the Ekumen. Gradually as Genly sojourns in Orgoreyn, he begins to feel as if he is not seeing everything, as if what he is seeing is an officially approved but profoundly dishonest misrepresentation of Orgota life.The differences between these two states, roughly paralleling those between contemporary superpowers on Earth, and the reactions of Genly, Estraven, and other characters in the book provide insights into the motivations of Genly and the inhabitants of Winter.During the third part of the book, Estraven, whom Genly has misjudged as a traitor, saves the envoy from imprisonment and death, and they travel together across the glaciers and ice deserts forming the borders of Orgoreyn and Karhide, creating an intense friendship between the envoy and deposed prime minister that transcends gender and culture.Le Guin creates believable worlds populated by strongly sympathetic characters, making these worlds credible by the attention she pays to the ordinary transactions of everyday life (\\"a common eating utensil on Gethen's tables is an ice-pick with which one chips away the ice that forms on one's mug of ale\\"). Her interactions between characters are sympathetic to human expression from the myriad of \\"un-Earthly\\" perspectives she creates, and she adroitly explores a wide array of political, ethical and cultural themes. This story is a testament to the universality and the indomitability of the human spirit regardless of the nature of the environment, the outlandishness of the society or the cruelty of the political system: people are people no matter how odd the culture or how \\"alien\\" the appearance.While LeGuin is one of my favorite authors and \\"LHOD\\" one of my favorite and most re-read books, I find the first several chapters to be quite tedious. It does take some intestinal fortitude to force oneself through a dry, slow and frankly uninteresting beginning, however the character development and plot quickens, and the reader's perseverence is rewarded: the book is more than well worth the effort. I'd suggest \\"LHOD\\" for the more patient reader and for readers with a relatively mature mindset about issues relating to gender. In summary, a masterpiece, but perhaps not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I generally don't like LeGuin's work. She's really hard to read &amp; it barely seems worth it. Still, I liked the estravan character &amp; the world building. It is mostly an anthropological/Taoist book so sf fans who've heard good reviews maybe disappointed. Of course they may not since they love other mystical books like Dune. As for me I doubt I'll buy another one of her books, but maybe I'll read some of her stories when they're in Asimov's magazine."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness is the Hugo and Nebula Winning novel by Ursula K. LeGuin, and is widely considered to be her finest work. It is a novel of first contact on the surface, but its deeper purpose was in exploring gender roles in society. It tells the story of Genly Ai, a human representative of the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Genly is tasked with extending an invitation to the world of Gethen to join the Ekumen. His ally in this is the Prime Minister of Karhide, Lord Estraven.In a political shift, Estraven is ousted and must flee to the neighboring nation of Orgoreyn. Genly is rebuffed in his mission by the King of Karhide, so he then decides to take his offer to the government of Orgoreyn. Orgoreyn , however is esentially a communist oligarchy, and Genly is caught in between opposed factions here as well.The plot struck me as rather mediocre. The characters outside of Estraven and Ai were rather dull as well. World building is the strength of this novel. The novel is considered a major work of feminist science fiction. I'm not sure I agree with that. The key element of the story is the nature of the Gethenian people themselves. They are androgynes, a people possessing the potential to manifest either sex, but normally they are nueters. For 2 days every month they go into a state called kemmer, in which they take on sexual characteristics of one of the genders, and more or less go into heat. The result is Gethenians can both sire and bear children. Because of this traditional gender roles such as developed on Earth are not present on Gethen. Its a very interesting concept, but not one that I really look for in my SF reading. LeGuin also inserts several short chapters in which the mythology of Gethen is explored.This book wasn't to my liking. I found it very hard to get interested in. Not until the last third of the book did I find myself enjoying it. Combine that with an uninspiring plot, a mostly bland cast of characters, and the fact that the only truely groundbreaking element of the story was a commentary on gender roles, I was underwhelmed. I certainly see why people hold the book in high regard, but personally, it didn't do much for me. I will stick with the Earthsea trilogy as the signature LeGuin work.6.5 out of 10"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I actually had to read through this whole book for an english class. Otherwise, I never would have been able to slog through this unbearably boring novel. The book was universally despised by the whole class. Some have declared it profound and thought provoking, but in actuality the book is filled with superficial new-age philosophy and pop quasi-spirituallity. Mix &quot;Siddharta&quot; and the screenplay for &quot;Plan Nine From Outer Space&quot; and you get a good idea what this book is about."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"If you pick up a LeGuin book expecting weird aliens and space battles, you'll be disappointed. She doesn't write sci-fi, what she does is to say to herself, &quot;what if the world was THIS way?&quot; and then explore that idea. Since her novels don't fit in any other genre, people put them in the sci-fi or fantasy slot. But that misses the point.&quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; is LeGuin saying &quot;what if people were hermaphrodites? What would be the same and what would be different about society?&quot; (Just as &quot;The Disposessed&quot; is her saying &quot;What if people had no concept of ownership?&quot;) LeGuin also has a fascination with Arctic and Antarctic exploration, so she makes her world a cold one and has her protagonists escape death by sledding for months across glaciers.This is definitely not a book for people who want to be entertained without having to think, or people who have no interest in the dynamics of human interaction. I have read everything she has written, but this one remains my favorite. LeGuin is one of the best writers in America. There is never a point in any of her books where you say &quot;wait a minute, why did he do that?&quot; Her characters are always fully brought to life and consistent. Her use of descriptive language borders on poetry. I saw and felt everything the characters experienced, and it made me think about my own assumptions about being male or being female."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have normally been very impressed with the books that have been awarded the Hugo and Nebula awards. The idea of a young planet deciding whether or not to join an interplanetary federation was intriguing.Unfortunately the really fascinating points of such an idea were never fully developed. The story instead revolved around personal struggles of a few individuals rather than how a planet would react to such a monumental event.The ambassador's civilization will always remain a mystery, and I felt that was an important element missing from Winter's decision to join with them.The single sex aspect of the people of Winter was probably the best part of this book. That conflict and the hypothesis concerning the connection between that and war were something worth thinking about. I am not sure, though, that it makes sense when taken in context with their views on politics.Overall, the book might be worth exploring to you if you are tired of normal sci-fi and interested in thinking about some abstract concepts (and in particular, how you would approach them)."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"What would life be like if the most important facet of your identity just didn't exist? This is one of those books that totally blows your mind! I once heard someone say that the most interesting phrase in this book is: &quot;The King was pregnant.&quot; What sounds like a bizarre, impossible statement to us is standard in this strange society that Le Guin has created. Previous reviewers have complained about the lack of story - it's not the plot that's important in this book. It explores issues of gender, of love (can there be romance without gender?), of estrangement, of sociology. Fantastic."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Left Hand of Darkness was fun to read over 20 years ago and to re-read just this week. For the fan of good and intelligent SF, this is a must. It is well written, it can be read quick, it is philosphical, it makes you think about your own life and that of mankind.I enjoyed it very much. When it would be written and published just recently instead of a stunning 30 years ago, I am sure it would receive Hugo and Nebula Awards again (I would certainly like to vote in favor).It is a nice touch that LeGuin writes from the perspective of a proud black man, trying to understand creatures that don't care which gender they are. It makes you think about the intelligence of all those macho man in our society, who over and over have to prove their masculinity. So, male people, please read this book and start thinking! :-)I am sure she investigated the snow stories of the eskimos, who have lots of words about snow, water and wind.This book is also a small lesson in diplomacy, courage, sacrifice and honesty. It is not just an SF story about space ships, space battles, fierce fights, high-tech gizmo's or grand theories. It is psychological, philosophical, political, ethical, emotional, and it is all SF, weird as SF can be.I am re-reading City of Illusions now, also by LeGuin. I like it! After that, I will read (for the first time) Rocannon's World and Planet of Exile. I am sure I will like them too."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I recommend this book to thoughtful readers who don't normally browse the science fiction rack at bookstores. It is an engrossing work of literature that just happens to fall under the sci-fi umbrella. I liked Le Guin's technique of occasionally inserting chapters in the form of anthropological monographs, and I feel it worked well, especially when they quoted mythological tales collected from the peoples in the story. These tales [of course invented by Le Guin] really packed the sort of Jungian wallop that our own myths often have. But these digressions are brief, unlike the lengthy chapters on cetology and whatnot in Melville's MOBY DICK, and serve to enrich the story rather than distract from it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Simply The Left Hand of Darkness is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read. If you ask is any book exists equal to this book I admit &quot;Dune&quot; is good also. But I think Le Guin is best writer in the field. Her Earthsea triology in Fantasy field and her other books like &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; are just good. Her books are not to reading, they are for to thinking and that is what I love them."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula K. LeGuin has been on the top of my list of best science fiction novelists. This novel is one of those extraordinary ones that pushes the limits of one's own understanding of what life and love and companionship is all about. She is a masterful storyteller, drawing the reader into the characters and into her worlds.I also recommend &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; and &quot;Rocannon's World.&quot; All are fine examples of her awesome talent."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"i liked the boo"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Human encounter with an extremely human like race of aliens, except that they are hermaphroditic"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I intend this review title as a double entendre, because of course it's the subject of the book as well: how gender-changing is, and isn't, life-changing. In my case, the book soaked deep into my psyche, because when it was written, I hadn't yet encountered any of the premises it introduced.Eventually, I became an anthropologist. At the time, I read a contemporary book,The Mote in God's Eye, co-authored by my father, with equal excitement and fascination - but Hand deeply influenced that reading, and left me deeply engaged and bothered. That botherment gestated for several decaeds, until finally I had to act. So, I've written a sequel to Mote that re-addresses core issues raised by both books (who is an alien? in what context? is biology destiny? what happens when gender is not fixed in ways we expect it to be?) for a 21st-century audience.So, if any of you loved Hand as much as I do, I'd really appreciate your thoughts onOuties (The Mote in God's Eye)."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I read this Left Hand in the 70's and I bought this copy for my 20 year old son.The book influenced my thinking when I was I twenty-something.

However, I was a bit apprehensive about reading it, for it sounded a little like a hermaphrodite's dream. However, this book delves into the nature of sex on this world extremely tastefully. No where does it get cheap and degrading to any of the characters. I recommend this book to everyone, even though over a thousand have already done so."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"So like the title says this novel was longer than it really needed to be. There are no sub-plots and the secondary characters come and go. Although the myths are nice they really don't add anything to the plot and the plot is very simple: diplomat comes to alien world (Winter) to convince them of joining a intergalactic union. The main conflict is the aliens don't trust the diplomat (Genly/Genry) and at one point they imprison him. He gets rescued and then it turns into a survival run. Now you can see that such a plot could never stretch 300 pages, which is why I think the myths and Genly/Genry went roaming around Winter for the first part of the book, because no one is going to pay full price for a 100 page book. It's not a bad book, I like the meaning behind it about the loyalty to humanity over one's allegiance to their own county and even race, but I really hate slugging through 150 pages of fluff.And the kemmer thing was interesting, but the author doesn't explain it until chapter 6, yet she mentions it many times before then. I got the idea it was sex, but that was only the tip of the iceberg. It would have been nice if the author had put the chapter on kemmer sooner rather than waiting.This was my first book from LeGuin and possibly my last. It doesn't make me want to go out and read more of her stuff even with the interesting themes. I might be denying myself some excellent reading, but to me excellent reading shouldn't be forcing yourself to read pointless fluff. I mean the book opens up with a detailed description of a parade, which shouldn't have been possible given that this is written in 1st person and no way Genly could have seen the entire procession of the parade considering he was in front of the very parade."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"For a book that has won both a Nebula and a Hugo award, this work was gravely disappointing. Le Guin earned a star for having an interesting concept and creating some semi-interesting cultures, but beyond that this novel is deeply lacking in the story and character department. The story began alright and then became very dreary without that much pay-off in the end. Le Guin is a good writer and it makes reading this book bearable (otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish it) but it is still very lacking. The main character, Genly Ai, is not interesting at all nor are the other characters really all that interesting. I recommend that this book be avoided."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I enjoyed Left Hand of Darkness, especially the first two thirds where Le Guin spends her time on the legends, history, culture and biology of the world. Once all these pieces are in place the book peters out with a long chase through the ice and a rather cliched tragic death scene. Were it not the for the last eighty pages, I would have rated this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Than this is YOUR BOOK!If, however, you want mechanical plot twists with stereotypical cardboard cutouts spouting pop psychology and zapping faceless, bloodless aliens, go find the lastest un-thrilling plot machine about soldiers/settlers/adventurers in space.However, if you want to know what a great authoress can do within the confines of a genre, check out this amazing book. Astonishingly, the most beautiful and entertaining section is a long, often uneventful walk over a vast plain of ice. The character interaction and writing is so beautiful that you just can't stop reading. It's gorgeous and heartfelt. I always wonder why the bookstore places LeGuinn in Sci-Fi Fantasy, when so many chick lit books of vastly inferior artistic merit are piled into the Literature and fiction section...But, that is off-topic. This book is a gorgeous masterpiece. Not only is it a classic, but it's also a joy to read. Someday we sci-fi/fantasy authors will apply the lessons of LeGuinn. Also, be sure to check out \\"The Lathe of Heaven\\". \\"Lathe of Heaven\\" is a great gift for the aggressive activist in your life."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is a fantastic piece of science fiction. Ursula LeGuin imagines a whole new future civilization and new cultures that interact in realistic ways.

Truly astounding"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Just wonderful, but what else can one expect from Ursula Leguin. Like the best in speculative fiction, she creates a fantasy world, in this place the planet of Winter, and takes you there as if it was real. But more than that, she creates wonderfully believable and likeable characters. A true pro, I heartily recommend this book to spec fiction and literary readers alike."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"In her introduction, the author makes some compelling statements about the nature of science fiction as descriptive and not predictive. Her work addresses the real world using the metaphor of the future, of science, of alternative biologies and cultures. What are the elements of her story metaphors for? \\"If I could have said it non-metaphorically, I would not have written all these words, this novel.\\"Right now I am trying to decide which of the two viewpoint characters serves as the best metaphor for the novel as a whole. On the one hand, we have Genly Ai, the envoy from an interstellar community of worlds that has just decided to invite the desolate planet Winter to join, after years of secret observation. Genly arrives alone and unarmed, bearing only words and ideas: the possibility of flight, travel between the stars, other shards of humanity living on distant worlds. Likewise, this book comes in peace, bringing you not action and adventure but an invitation to participate in a thought experiment, possibly expand your horizons.On the other hand is Estraven, a member of this alien race of humans considering Genly's message. As Genly's main point of interaction with the inhabitants of Winter, he brings to life the alienness of all his kind. In the same way, a novel brings to life ideas that perhaps can only be expressed in story. Estraven is still recognizably human, but his people's sexual androgyny renders him somehow fundamentally estranged from the familiar. Echoing Estraven's interactions with Genly, this novel does not offer any straight answers, but time spent getting to know it yields a measure of understanding and even affection.I'm afraid I can draw no conclusion from my perhaps pointless exercise, except that you'll have to read this deservingly classic science fiction novel and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A double award-winner (Nebula and Hugo, and Mrs. LeGuin will receive the Grandmaster Award this year), this 1960s novel stands as one of the most respected SF tales ever because the depth of its alien society; so human in so many ways (the residents of the planet Gethen are actually termed \`humans'), yet so far away in their sexuality. The people of Gethen are androgynous most of the year, with a monthly period where they can change into either males or females for mating. LeGuin crafts a fascinating view of how this one change in physiology creates a unique society. The depth of the culture rivals that of that in _Dune_.The plot follows an envoy from an alliance of human planets trying to convince Gethen to join the union, who then runs afoul of Gethen's cultural differences and twisty politics. The story moves slowly, allowing a close examination of the alien culture, and reaches its height with the growing friendship between envoy Genly Ai and exiled politician Estraven. In an interesting departure from the customary use of point-of-view, LeGuin switches between two different first person narrators. It's a daring device, but LeGuin makes it work after its first confusing appearance.If you have any intereset in science fiction, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK. It's one of the basic texts of the genre."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness is rich with themes on cultures, trust, the nature of truth, the roles of the sexes, and much more. The book is not dry at all - LeGuin incorporates beauty into language like no other author can accomplish. And instead of strong declarations of what's right, the book merely asks questions and states the ideas, leaving the reader free to believe what they choose.I enjoyed the gentle pace with beautiful prose, moist philosophy, and watching the well-developed characters. If you expect a great adventure story, you will be disappointed. This is a window into the world of Winter/Gethen, the lives and works of Genly Ai and Estraven, and the insight it offers for our own world.The last part of the novel was slightly inferior to the rest, but I wasn't disappointed. I read this 300 page book in two school days, and it's the best thing I've read since Anna Karenina."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"\\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" by Ursula K. LeGuin, is a science fiction novel that takes place in humanity's future. In LeGuin's universe, the various offshoot races of humanity have discovered each others' civilizations on many different worlds, and have united in a sort of commonwealth known as the Ekumen. \\"Left Hand\\" focuses on the mission of Earth-born Genly Ai to the planet Gethen, where he serves as the Ekumen's first formal envoy to the planet.Like any ambassador/explorer, Ai faces a degree of culture shock. But his experience is complicated by an extraordinary Gethenian quality which makes them unique among the human races: they are hermaphrodites -- each one with both female and male potential -- and have a remarkable sexual cycle that has radically shaped their culture.The sexual element in \\"Left Hand\\" may sound like a sci-fi \\"gimmick,\\" but it is not. It is, rather, one aspect of a complex and brilliantly realized total tapestry that is the world of Gethen. LeGuin adeptly weaves together geology, anthropology, folklore, politics, history, sociology, and alternative theologies as she creates a totally compelling and believable world. And as important to Gethen as its people's unique sexuality are the harsh climate and landscape: the world is in the grip of a fierce ice age.LeGuin constructs this story with superb intelligence and artistry; one technique she uses skillfully is the incorporation of multiple narrative voices. Again, this is no \\"gimmick,\\" but is a well-woven part of the whole novel.\\"Left Hand\\" is many things: a brilliant feat of the imagination; a political thriller; a harrowing tale of adventure and survival; and a deeply moving personal drama. It is a book written with keen insight and profound compassion: a book which daringly asks what it means to be human, what it means to love, and what it means to have a vision for humanity. Not only is \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" one of the essential classics of science fiction, it is also, in my opinion, one of the great novels of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"There's an awful lot to absorb here. Among the numerous issues involved, I found the idea of politics and power as an obstacle to advancing society sadly relevant to our own world. Trust is also a major theme, and also relevant as it increasingly disappears from our society and is replaced with barriers to meaningful communication. One particularly effective scene involves prisoners in a prison camp. When they are stripped of everything that contributes to their individual identities and sense of purpose, the author comes harrowingly close to placing the reader in the camp to experience the hopelessness with the prisoners. Yet as dark as the story at times becomes, it also reaches extraordinary levels of brightness and beauty. Again, the reader can experience the vastness and peace of the landscape through the author's flawless descriptions. The overall tone here is dark, with patches of light. This fits perfectly with one quote in the book-&quot;Light is the left hand of darkness.&quot; After reading this, I was left with disturbing questions of the truth of that view. Powerful writing."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"What a book! I just read &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; for the first time, but I know it won't be the last. What I loved most about it were the characters, especially Estraven, the beautiful, powerful descriptive language that Le Guin uses, and the way she keeps a subtle tension humming throughout. There is always a wonderful sense of more going on than what is on the surface. Reviewers that focus on the anthropology miss the big picture. As an immigrant I especially enjoyed Le Guin's presentation of the obstacles that the uncharted cultural waters of etiquette and commmunication in a different society poses to a newcomer. But finally I feel it is less about differences (between cultures, species or genders) and more about simiarities: about the universal experiences of loyalty and treachery, trust and deception, belonging and exile, fear and courage, loneliness and friendship: the painful and beautiful truths that all human beings share."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula K. Le Guin is best known for her Wizard of Earthsea series, but this is her best, most imaginative work, one of my favorite books of all time, and winner of both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1969, the year it was published. Its vividly imagined culture and exploration of gender and identity is still astonishing 50 years later.The Left Hand of Darkness is set on a planet called Winter, where there is no summer, no gender and no war. Genly Ai, an envoy from Terran (a stand-in for Earth) visits in an attempt to persuade Winter and its natives (called Gethens) to join the League of All Worlds. In the process, he falls afoul of Winter's complex diplomatic customs and political intrigue. In danger of his life, he must make a perilous journey across the wilderness of ice with a Winter native, Estraven, an ally that he neither understands nor entirely trusts.Just a quick warning -- the book's exposition is a slow, but once you get past the first few chapters, the pace picks up. The investment of world-building at the beginning does pay off.The book's title is from a Gethen poem, which begins\\"Light is the Left Hand of Darkness...\\""},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Le Guin is a master of writing; her chosen genre is science fiction, but more with the focus of exploring man's relationship to each other than to explore future possibilities. Nevertheless, Le Guin can create new worlds and new cultures that are unsurpassed by any other science fiction author.The Left Hand of Darkness is set on Gethen, or Winter, a planet that has arctic conditions most of the year. An envoy, Ai, from the Ekumen of Worlds is sent to explore whether Gethen would join the Ekumen and engage in intellectual exchange of ideas and technology. Gethen is also unique in that the people are unisexual, changing to female or male form on a monthly cycle called kemmer. How Le Guin handles a unisex race is one of the amazing parts of the book.Ai sets out to live on Gethen, first in the country of Karhide. He attempts to convince the (somewhat mad) king of the value of joining the Ekumen, helped by a counselor of the King, Estraven. But Estraven is undermined by another court counselor and is banished, and Ai is in terrible danger and doesn't realize it. As Ai explores the rest of Gethen and its varied societies, he is helped again and again by Estraven, whom he at first mistrusts. Their heroic trek across the Ice of Gethen reads like the best arctic explorers adventure from Earth.This is an exciting book, though the beginning is slow, as Ai begins to understand the strange society of Karhide and Gethen. As the adventure unfolds, you will not be able to put the book down. This is a classic that should be read by anyone who loves science fiction, and is a book that can be re-read many times with great enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book won the 1969 Nebula Award and the 1970 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year. I recall first reading this book when it first appeared and being stunned at the originality and the beauty. I have read every Hugo and Nebula winner (and most of the nominees) and this is still near the top. In this classic novel, all of the action takes place on the planet known as Gethen or Winter, a frozen world set in Le Guin's Hainish universe. All of the humanoid inhabitants of Winter are exactly the same as the humans of Earth except in the means of reproduction. They are all of a single sex and can assume either sex when in &quot;heat.&quot; If one person of a couple becomes female, the other automatically becomes male. The culture and society of this world is shaped not only by the harsh environment but by this sexual structure. A main portion of the novel is concerned with the trek of a human ambassador and ethnologist, Genly Ai, across Winter's surface with a Getthenian. The man from Earth and the manwoman from Winter grow to know and understand each other. The novel not only raises issues about our perceptions of sex but the problems associated with cultural chauvinism. It is a book that all serious students of science fiction literature should read. For those earlier reviewers who awarded this book a low rating because it wasn't &quot;classic&quot; science fiction, you have to recall that psychology, sociology, and anthropology are all sciences (remember that the author's father, T. Kroeber, was the first Chairman of the Anthropology Department at U.C. Berkeley), just like physics, chemistry, or, in my case, biochemistry. And to the reviewer from Washington, D.C., (of March 3, 1999) who complained that Genly Ai was too uninteresting as the main character. Perhaps that was the point. Have you forgotten your Heisenberg?"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I don't think it's necessary to resort to hyperbole when describing this book. In a word, it's beautiful. The language is intricate and delicate, as is the structure of the novel, the careful building of a mythology and culture from the ground up. The fact that it's a relatively short book is a reflection on Ursula Le Guin's formidable power as a writer: what she accomplishes in a short space is rarely seen in a much larger and weightier novel.Perhaps the most striking thing about it is the apparent ease with which legend is woven into the fabric of the story, so that the world and its people reveal themselves slowly and naturally to the reader. This many-threaded structure allows the reader to draw conclusions from mere hints, relating the obscure myths to the concrete story at hand. Much is implied without being stated outright, but this never obscures the story; if anything, it makes it stronger, clearer, and deeper.Every book has the odd quirk, and \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" isn't without its own. Although thoroughly modern in sensibilty, it was written in 1969, and in one minor way, that does show. To the modern reader, the amount of attention afforded the \\"unisexual\\" society described here feels a little bit out of proportion. Obviously our comfort with gender ambivalence and androgyny has increased over the last three or four decades; at any rate, I found no difficulty in thinking of the characters as simultaneously male and female -- it's especially easy to do when the writing is so compelling.As with many of Ursula Le Guin's other novels, the characters are a bit abstract. This is a result of the author's focus, rather than insufficient characterisation: Ursula Le Guin is definitely an ideas writer, and a language writer, rather than a character wrtiter. It's not that Genly Ai, Estraven and others are not believable; they are. It's just that Le Guin's characters are almost always created and harnessed to serve the story's ideas, rather than the other way around. The focus isn't on the life and times of an individual human being, but on the big ideas involved, and on their implications for mankind as a whole. There are virtually no attempts to dissect and examine any individual; as with the story itself, much remains hidden, hinted at, unknown.This is not an entire world, it is a single tale, woven from fragments of myth and narrative, but only the relevant ones. You come away satisfied with a beautifully crafted, intelligent, thought-provoking story -- but also, with a sense of having visited a place that keeps its secrets, with people who will keep theirs."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The raging reviews over the billiance of this book and the fact that it won both the Hugo and Nebula awards are what tempted me to buy it at first. I had found the first several chapters to be extremely dull and somewhat trite... It took me a week to drag myself through the beginning. However the character development and plot quickens during the confrontation of the envoy, Genly Ai, and the prime minister, Estraven. After that point the story does get quite interesting and one does become genuinely concerned for the principle characters (I know that I did). Le Guin had made it a point that the characters be as real and as flawed as people are in actuality despite the incredulous setting of their world.By the end everything makes sense...from the stuffy beginning to even the title of the book itself. This story is a true testament to the universality of human spirit (regardless of the most harsh nature of the environment). Likewise, it reinforces the notion that all people ARE people no matter how odd the culture or how &quot;alien&quot; the appearance. The world she has created feels so REAL even though it is so different!This book is by no means among my favorites... However, I am glad that I did take the time to read it and that I didn't give-up in the beginning. I'd suggest it for the more patient reader and for people with a relatively mature mindset. This certainly is no action adventure afterall."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The story of human civilization out in the future, sprawled across the cosmos and actually doing quite a bit better than most of us anticipated. There is one unique little world out on the fringe of everything, weather included, called Winter. It is the Siberia of planets, and the people are tough as nails with the little quirk of being kind of hermaphroditic. This is the story of an Observer who becomes involved in the life and politics of the planet, and is a study of human nature, of affection, of emotional paralysis, of tragedy. Science fiction is the backdrop used to make a study of human nature at once more vivid and less biased. It is flawlessly written, and while it is sometimes slow for the 21st century eye, it is a classic example of still waters running deep. And like many agnostics, LeGuin thinks more about God and eternity than most religious people, never hiding her inverted doubts that maybe there is a God, and allowing this undercurrent of uncertainty to play out in the book. Again, it is a masterful book, but it is not likely to be made into a video game any time soon."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Left Hand of Darkness is one of those books that draws you in and makes you forget it is only a story, a work of the author's imagination. But, as the Gethens say, Truth is a Matter of the Imagination, and in fact, Le Guin's imagination reveals a lot of truths about us.Le Guin declares this book to be a thought-experiment, meaning that it is an exploration of an issue conducted by setting it in a story and letting it run: in this case, to find out what effect sexuality has on our social relations. On one level this experiment fails, because Le Guin herself points out another, more plausible, reason for their social organization and lack of war: the climate. As Genly Ai tells us, the marginal people, the ones struggling to survive, cannot afford to mobilize for war. In fact, this same situation occurs on Earth amongst those that Ai calls &quot;the marginal peoples.&quot; In their interpersonal relations, their emotions and their expression, however, Le Guin makes a convincing case for the influence of sexual roles.But it's also fun to read. This is a fascinating book to read, and the tale is sensually and subtly crafted. The characters are real and complex, and besides the other-worldly setting, there is nothing to disrupt the reader's suspension of disbelief. The ultimate test for a novel, however, is whether, after reading it, we look at our world in a different light. Left Hand of Darkness passes with flying colors."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"(The Left Hand of Darkness is already highly awarded and doesn't really *need* another review, certainly not from an amateur, but I'm writing one anyway.) This book explores several deeply human themes, in the author's beautifully tragic way-- among them, the themes of sacrifice and dualism (or perhaps more accurately, unity at the heart of dualism.)Le Guin's characters are harsh, fallible, heroic, and at essence, human...and once immersed in the painstaking detail of the book, the people of it became knitted close to my heart. The word \\"transportation\\" comes to mind: it is so smooth and believable a transition that in surprise you may find yourself on another planet, amongst aliens in the middle of an Ice Age. She is a miraculous, meticulous architect of worlds and culture; indeed did she create these people, on this world, or did she discover them on a visit with her faster-than-light ship? I'm not sure it's legal to copyright an entire existing world, Ms. Le Guin! For it does exist, although admittedly the rest of humanity may not discover it for another five thousand years or so. Not only do her characters and themes lend depth to the book, but every so often one gets the sensation of a fine undercurrent of musical quality to her words, which may echo in one's head long after finishing the book. I hope many other people read this book and enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I had high hopes at the start of this book: I was interested in the characters, enjoyed Le Guin's writing style, and found the plot compelling. But then, somewhat abruptly, the book effectively took a very long hiatus from the plot to explore the two main characters, the culture of the alien world Le Guin has created, and, at great length, gender issues in this hermaphroditic culture. As Lincoln put it: \\"People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like.\\" It's a well-written and thoughtful book, certainly, but I am not among those who like this sort of thing."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"There is not a lot to be said about Left Hand of Darkness that has not been said at least once by the 97 others to review it. So, I am not going to say how much I enjoyed the book, how provocative the idea of a hermaphroditic society is, how evocative the landscapes are, and how moving the bond that developed between the two main characters. Rather, I am going to let those fans of Julian May who have not read Left Hand of Darkness know that here is the model for everything we love and adore about May. Like May, LeGuin is adept at changing view-points (a rare feat; most writers who try to give multiple first-person perspectives, or interrupt the narrative with asides, fail miserably). Like May, LeGuin has phenomenously captured the male character. Nobody can read May's Rampart trilogy without being astounded that a woman wrote it. The same is true of Left Hand of Darkness; perhaps even more so because reflections on sexuality are a critical element of the story. And, like May, LeGuin creates a world so effortlessly convincing that one almost believes it's right next door. It's the apparent lack of effort that stands out here; LeGuin is able to accomplish in a couple hundred pages what it takes other writers (see Wingrove or Jordan) half a dozen books to achieve. About halfway through I became convinced that May and LeGuin must be the same person . . . .I do not give out five star ratings lightly. Only one other fiction review has ever received a five-star rating from me, and that's one from Julian May. I wrestled long and hard over whether to accord Left Hand of Darkness the Ultimate Rating. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the only complaint I had about the book was that it was over too quickly. Surely that, as much as anything else, merits five stars."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is one of those rare novels that I read over again every few years - and always find some new and interesting aspect overlooked before. Like any truly good SF story, is not an exercise in conjectures about man's future but rather a metaphor for mankind's present, a point she makes with much more skill and clarity in her own introduction to this book. Thus the novel's planet Gethen, with an incredibly cold, inclement climate and inhabited by people who are hermaphroditic, is nothing more than a metaphorical situation that prompts readers to think about human life on our own planet. Indeed, one of Le Guin's sharpest criticisms of our own society can be found in the musings of a non-Gethenian on the nature of interpersonal relations among the people she enconters on this rather bizarre planet: \\"One is respected and judged only as a human being. It is an appalling experience...\\" Through the voices of her characters, Le Guin makes many similarly thought-provoking points about aspects of human societies - she highlights the more disturbing or contradictory aspects of, among other things, religion, sexual relations, governmental structures and political philosophies. For the latter point, her observations on patriotism (that oft-used euphemism for nationalism) are extremely pertinent: it is succinctly and quite correctly described as fear of the other rather than love of one's country (its irrational nature is best summed up in the question asked by one character: \\"What is love of one's country; is it hate of one's uncountry?\\"). \\"Left Hand\\" is, of course, a novel, not a socio-political treatise, so all of these rather weighty topics are well-integrated into a very engrossing and beautifully written story."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The LHOD is not just a novel. That's \\"a blessing and a curse\\" or \\"a blessing or a curse\\" depending on you. Every review here seems accurate and spreading truth as known to its author. Delve into LHOD if you are tantalized by humanity, gender, sexuality, culture, etc. and enjoy pausing during a story to challenge your knowledge, views, and prejudices on those topics. If that's a go for you, then the negatives noted in reviews here won't matter. On the other hand, if you require perfection in story writing and have limited time, maybe you should look elsewhere. For me, this is one of my favorite books and I'm a much better person for having read it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I admit that when I first read it, I had stopped very early in out of boredom. I later picked it back up when I had nothing to read. I should also point out, I do not like any of her other books.This is not action, or adventure, or anything like that. It's a very character driven story about a man who visits a genderless planet of Human offshoots to convince them to join an alliance of interstellar life.He suffers various problems such as getting them to believe he is an alien, or that life exists elsewhere, or just getting past the fear of the idea itself.The book does well at creating many minor characters, developing them, and developing character interaction as well as creating minor mystery. It's not a book you can just read through, it's one of those books that requires thinking and makes you think more about it as you go.It's also impressive in investigating gender differences, and inequalities not only far beyond the time it was written in, but really more than is done currently in literature.Be warned though, the pacing is slow. This is not an action adventure book, there is no lets go do fun missions that many ready scifi for."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Anybody who gave this book less than five stars should be ashamed to show his face in public. With its beautifully controlled prose, irresistible narrative, complex and believable characters, and extraordinarily ambitious themes, &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; is by a large margin the best book ever to win either the Hugo or the Nebula, much less both. It's more than just a great science fiction novel, it's one of the finest novels of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is one of the first books I have ever enjoyed that had a culture which is effected by the fact that the people change gender, making for some interesting characters and character interaction. Add a very harsh planet and a first contact with another race(us)and you have a great book. Not an action book, but a thinker's book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have read hundreds of science fiction books, but out of all of them there are only three fictional planets described in such delicious detail that I find myself wanting to go there. One is Dune, a second is Majipoor, and the third is Winter.Winter is a strange place-- the natives are genderless most of the time. Now and then each one becomes either male or female for a while, then reverts to neuter. A 'normal' human, male or female *all* the time, is both obscene and fascinating.I don't think it's giving away too much to say that the primary plot line revolves around this question: What happens if you fall in love with your enemy? That's a vast oversimplification, but it captures the mystery.The emotions are subtle but raw. The detail is breathtaking. The ending is heartbreaking. The underlying philosophy, as always with LeGuin, is the heart of the story. It's an unforgettable book, and one of my 'top six science fiction works of all time' picks."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"\\"My landlady, a voluble man.\\" \\"The king was pregnant.\\" These are just some of the shocking and brilliant sentences in Ursula K. Le Guin's masterpiece. This book will always be considered her masterpiece, not only for its innovativeness (it changed the genre forever), but for its musical and otherworldly prose, and for the deeper meanings that it holds. She takes the genre to a whole new level, seeing what would happen if certain things were different, twisting and shaping things to see what would be the outcome, if, for example, there were no such things as gender. Always, Le Guin's work is influenced by her father, Alfred Kroeber, who was and still is a highly regarded anthropologist. The character of Genly Ai fills the role of anthropologist in a strange society he's not used to. Genly Ai is from a different world, and for him to come to Gethen and become involved with the non-gender people there is an experiment in science, culture, questions of gender,and aggression/domination. The society of Gethen has never had a war...there are no dominant halves, submissive halves according to gender. Everyone is supposedly equal. Le Guin is not afraid to shock the reader, and to show a third side of the coin that we've never seen before. This book will challenge you culturally, and challenge all your norms and concepts. This is an all-around brilliant novel, one that is worthy to take its place forever among the most honored books."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I was very excited to start reading this book. I heard about it only recently from a friend of similar tastes.I also found the title dark, mysterious, and potentially profound. Then I found out Le Guin is the daughter of a famous anthropologist I learned about in college!I was therefore disappointed when I couldn't really get into the book. I was frustrated. There were all these references to places and such without full explanation, I couldn't connect with any of the characters, there were no maps, there were no pictures to aid the reader's challenges in conceptualizing an androgynous human race, and the plot seemed a little here and there without an overarching direction. Just something about the writing style was blaah, and really not what I so hopefully expected.I didn't set this one aside--not only because I am a determined individual or because I paid good money to read this book--but because it is summer and I have a lot of free time. My efforts were more than compensated for. By the time I finished the novel, my opinion of it had changed completely. A connectable series of events had revealed itself, things and places had started to make sense, and I had come to care very, very deeply about the characters. And it's true: this book is profound; it is an intellectual read. I can say it is most certainly of interest to anyone who has willingly studied anthropology.So it's not one of my absolute favorites, but I'd quickly recommend The Left Hand of Darkness to fans of good, thoughtful science fiction. I have the feeling that if I read this book again I would enjoy it even more--right from the start."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"\\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise for me. I do not read science fiction often and had to abandon my last attempt (\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Galaxy\\") for its utter stupidity, but this book was a sci-fi of a completely different sort. It wasn't just another novel about green aliens or space travel, it was an extremely clever and deep exploration of gender.Genly Ai is an emissary of the Ekumen (a union of human worlds) to planet Gethen, or Winter (called so for its extremely cold climate). His mission is to convince inhabitants of the world to join the rest of humanity in exchange of ideas and technology. However Genly is met with some reserve as the decision to join is hindered by alien to him intricacies of Gethenian politics and culture. What makes Gethen so unique and thus so hard for Ai to understand is that it is inhibited by the race of ambisexual (hermaphroditic) beings. All Gethenians have an ability to be both male and female. Most of the time their sexualities lay dormant and awaken only a few days a month during a period called kemmer (mating period). At the time of kemmer each Gethenian can become either male or female. The choice of gender is always incidental. Between the kemmers Gethenians are asexual. This sexual peculiarity makes Gethen quite a subdued race - its inhabitants are not assigned any gender roles, they are not sexually driven or sexually frustrated, they are less violent and ambitious. As the story progresses, Genly learns to understand this strange world a little better and even finds love.I was extremely impressed by Le Guin's imagination. The world of Gethen was thoroughly detailed and very well realized. Everything about Gethen - the direct effects of Winter's climate and Gethenians' ambisexuality on the social and political order, science, philosophy and even folklore - were developed in the most remarkable way. I was also amazed at how skillfully Le Guin presented romance in the story, because as you can imagine a love story between a man and an ambisexual being (or between two ambisexuals) can go horribly wrong in less talented hands.My only reservation about the book was the language. It took a few chapters to get used to a huge amount of Gethenian words, names and concepts. At times I had to reread some passages to understand them, because they seemed a little too densely written (my recent obsession with YA literature might be blamed for the softness of my brain too I suppose). But this wasn't so overwhelming as to spoil the reading experience for me.Highly recommended to those who enjoys quality science fiction."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have been wanting to read this sci-fi classic for a while so I finally brought it on the plane with me. This is a very good book. I can't say it was the most enjoyable read, but it is an exquisite read...kind of like a work of fine art. In general it was hard to decide if this was a 4 or 5 star book. It wasn't personally my favorite book, but it was a very well put together book and a book that asks a lot of very deep questions.Genly Ai is an ambassador to the planet Winter. Winter is a planet that has the unique distinction of being the only planet where the humans are both genders at once or have no gender at all depending on the moon cycle. Genly's goal is to bring Winter in contact and into trade agreements with the rest of galactic civilization. He starts his quest in the somewhat uncivilized nation of Karhide; where he is eventually driven to the countryside. Next he seeks to win over the more civilized and lawful nation of Orgoreyn. But which nation is really the more civilized of the two? Estraven, who starts the story as the chief adviser to the King of Karhide, ends up being Genly's companion for much of his journey...and at points the story is told from Estraven's viewpoint.The story starts out a little slow and it has a lot of throwing around of terms that are unknown to the reader (as many sci-fi books do). Maybe a third of the way through the book the story really picks up and starts to get interesting. This is not the easiest book to read. The detail is meticulous and the reader must concentrate and really pay attention to what they are reading. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wouldn't pick this book up for a fun/quick read.The plot is well-woven and the worlds Le Guin build's are amazing. She has extensively developed language, culture, policy, and structure of the societies on Winter. The detail she took with this world building is just fantastic. The other amazing thing is that in this well woven story she manages to touch on a multitude of issues humanity faces now and will always face. Much of the issues she delves into are of a political nature, but many of them are also of a personal nature. Probably the most interesting issue she deals with throughout the book is how society would be changed if everyone was both genders or did not have a gender.All in all it is an interesting read and the book is well done. Given how long ago the book was written it has aged pretty well. Some of the writing style is a little archaic, and as I had mentioned it is definitely not an easy or particularly fun read. Still, it is a good book for everyone to read because the ideas presented in it are intriguing and it is just such a classic work of sci-fi. Did this book make me want to run out and read everything by Le Guin? Not really, but if I am in the mood for a heavier sci-fi read I might consider it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is a strange book.To my eyes, read for the first time in 2008, the book struggled to establish emotional resonance.What I liked about it: the questions it raised about gender identity by creating an utterly new perspective, a world peopled by an androgynous species of individuals who can assume either sexual identity and do so only on a once-per-month basis by entering \\"kemmering\\". Each individual can sire or bear children interchangably. How this might impact a society is an interesting question, and one the author explores admirably.What appealed less was the prevalence of political angling. The author spends a good deal of time describing the schemes of national officials vying for political advantage, disproportionate to the emotional impact. Frankly, these parts bored me, along with some lengthy descriptions of icy terrain. I had to skim through these parts.The book felt like assigned reading, although it was freely chosen: it had the dry feel of a creation whose impact and relevance has already peaked. However, the real value to me was the inclusion of some profound and deep insights about the human condition, often woven in as dialogue from a character's lips or as musings of the narrator--sometimes making better philosophy than fiction. Overall, I don't begrudge the time I spent reading this book, and I admire what the author has done: creating a fictional race of others different from ourselves, and making them real enough so that we can see ourselves freshly through their eyes, is not an achievement to take for granted."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I'll admit to focusing my attention in completely the wrong direction, and taking issue with this book for its absolutely abusive use of special relativity. It's completely unfair to take advantage of time dilation to create \\"time jumps\\", where people can travel between planets without aging much (that is physically correct), but still allow the use of an ansible to communicate with remote people \\"instantaneously\\" (incorrect - in special relativity \\"simultaneous\\" and \\"instantaneous\\" are subjective. If you think you're communicating with someone instantaneously, someone else in a different reference frame would think your conversation parter is actually answering your questions BEFORE you ask them.)But it's science fiction, so it'd be unfair to condemn the book just for that. As a sociological meditation, I found the book intriguing. It posits a race of hermaphroditic humans. Reading the book then becomes an exercise in trying to understand a character not as being male or female, but simply as being a personality. Gender is so steeply ingrained in our minds' processing of all social interactions, that forgetting about gender is nearly impossible. But to the extent that I was able to do it, it granted some insight, I think. Maybe, many years from now, I'll be able to think of a person's gender as being only a secondary or tertiary way to classify them - the primary way having become certain personality traits that seem to characterize them most. Still, I doubt it's any time soon that I'll be able to think of men and women in the same way. (It's not like I particularly want to treat my girlfriend the same way as my best friend anyway, but it's at least amusing to think about it.) I think one the the best things that can be said for science fiction is it invites us to enter strange, alien worlds. This forces us to adapt our minds to thinking in unfamiliar ways. When we return to real life, maybe things look a little different, and old prejudices shrink. Maybe.As an adventure story, the novel was pretty good, although it wasn't the adventure that was its greatest strength. There's a fair amount of politics, which I always find confusing and not truly necessary to follow to get the point. But I did like that fact that the story was about an alien coming down to a planet, telling people about all the wonderful riches of technology, culture, and interstellar brotherhood that they would like to share, and all the while the people on the planet only care about using the alien to get one step ahead of the Jones'. They all completely miss the point, too narrowly stuck in their provincial, planetary thinking to see the greater picture of what's being offered. And the more I think about it, the more I see a lot of truth in that.Finally, LeGuin is a wonderful writer. The opening scene, introducing the planet itself (ironically, the only hot day described on a frigid planet in the midst of an ice age) and a parade put on by its inhabitants, is very beautiful. The attention to detail and scene gives way later in the book to focus more on plot and character than on background, as it probably should, but occasionally this slower, picture-in-words type style returns for a few indulgent pages.So I recommend this book for all these aspects. While I don't think it's a true masterwork in any area, it's a very high-quality piece of writing from a variety of dimensions, and it was well worth my time to read it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Although I was expecting a little more from an award winning book, I found this still to be a good read. It was a little slow at parts with too much concentration on details not necessary to the plot line and some unfinished threads. The basic plot is good and thought-provoking and the characters are sympathetic and relatable. Would have liked it to be a little longer with regards to the ending, but it did leave you to think what the possible futures of the persons involved would be."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The greatest science fiction stories really aren't about the future at all, but about the present. A lot of readers will disagree with this statement, and they have the right to do so. Good science fiction can be enjoyed by many readers through various interpretations. Good science fiction tells us about ourselves and the world we live in. GREAT science fiction does this and more. After reading just a few pages of 'The Left Hand of Darkness,' I knew I was reading great science fiction...and maybe a little bit more.Ursula K. Le Guin's novel is the story of Genly Ai, a Terran representative who has been sent to Gethen, a planet where the harshness of winter is nearly constant. The coldness of the planet provides many challenges for Ai, but even more challenging is being the lone human in the midst of a sexless population. The inhabitants of the planet are neither male or female until the time of mating. Even during that time, the participants themselves have no way of knowing whether they will become male or female. After the mating period, they revert to being neutral.Ai is completely a stranger in a world he can't understand. He's not sure who to trust. The planet's inhabitants certainly aren't sure if they can trust a being who is always the same gender. Even when friendships begin to develop, Ai is not sure who he can trust. Things are never as they appear, which makes his mission more and more dangerous.'The Left Hand of Darkness' was groundbreaking when it was first published in 1969. The roles of men and women were being questioned just about everywhere in this country and Le Guin addressed those issues brilliantly. This was an incredibly important for its time. Many readers have stated that the novel lacks impact today because of the progress that has been made in dealing with gender issues. Perhaps, but the issues that Le Guin targets are in some ways still with us. This is not a book to refer to and say, \\"Yeah, this book came out when we were searching for our male and female identities.\\" The book is much more than just an allegorical look at gender issues in the 1960's. Le Guin's writing style keeps it from being remembered for that reason only.I once heard a major science fiction writer say that Ursula Le Guin walks on water. Her writing certainly does. Le Guin masterfully creates a word in which everyone is comfortable with the status quo except for Ai...and the reader. In the reader's mind, Gethen becomes a real place. I read the book in July and felt like I was constantly trying to warm myself on the icy planet. Not only is her setting well done, the characters tell us all we need to know, just enough so that the ending really means something to the reader. It's far more than simply the feeling of a satisfying ending. It's the feeling that you've read something that was important when published and continues to be important."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Some science fiction works are optional. \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" is not. It is one of the most important novels in the development of modern SF, and it also includes some of the best writing in the history of the genre.The story is set entirely on a planet called Gethen, where people have no specific gender. This detail is not included just as a gimmick. Le Guin looks in depth at the implications of such an idea. The society that she imagines is one that has no warfare and no well-defined concepts of a family. She includes lots of interesting and sometimes humorous snapshots of what a genderless culture means, such as a character whose behavior appears 'female', but who has actually been the father of four children. By describing this alien society, Le Guin makes some hard-hitting points about the way that gender and sex have shaped our world. And by tackling issues that most earlier science fiction authors had ignored, she helped open the door to a new generation of literary SF works.In case the above paragraph makes \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" seem boring or preachy, let me just emphasize that it also has a suspenseful, fast-moving plot. An ambassador from another planet is trying to convince the leaders of Gethen to join an organization that allows for trade and communication between worlds. Despite his good intentions, he ends up caught in a web of political deception; some people would prefer that Gethen remain isolated. Throughout the book, the characters' reactions to the events around them is entirely believable, helping to create a vivid portrait of a society as it faces a tremendous change. The last hundred pages take a radically different turn from the earlier parts of the book. I won't spoil it for you, but I will say that Le Guin decides to focus the reader's attention on the two main characters and the way that the differences between their bodies and minds affects their relationship.Let me add one more important fact: the writing in this book is outstanding. It's clear that Le Guin put a great deal of effort into developing each chapter. The dialogue is well-written and meaningful, and the descriptions of setting on the planet of Gethen are unforgettable. The author can find the beauty in everything, even in a hostile landscape of rock and ice. Touches like that make \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" one of my favorite novels of all time."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This the first book I have read by Le Guin and the first science fiction book I have read in a number of years. Le Guin is a very good story teller. The science fiction aspects of the story are almost irrelevant. She could have placed the story in any number of different settings and the story would not loose anything. She does a wonderful job of developing her characters even when they are aliens. The story has a nice pace and some interesting twists and turns. Ultimately, the story is about character, values and personal sacrifice and how those qualities sustain people in times of hardship and danger."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula Le Guin truly outdid herself with this book. From the complex but brilliant plot-line, to the depth and intensity built into her characters; This book is hard to put down once started. Le Guin uses this book to explore the impact of sexual tension, and how it affects our entire social structure. To do so, she takes us to the planet Winter, where all the citizens are hermaphroditic. On this planet, the reader follows the struggles of an 'emissary'; a man sent to Winter in order to try and get the citizens of the planet to join an intergalactic 'family'. On this trip, the main character, Genly Ai gets to experience both the best Winter has to offer, and the worst. Le Guin carries the reader through this book with a constant sense of curiosity and wonder, ever leading to a magnificent ending; leaving the reader feeling breathless and lost when the book finally does end. If you read and enjoyed Isaac Asimov's Foundation, you'll be sure to love this one too."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Le Guin certainly made a masterpiece of The Left Hand of Darkness. I could never have thought that a novel with the premise of a single-sex society could intrigue me as well as educate me. The story has a great plot and pace, and yet it also has so much information to give that helps us humans learn what makes us tick.For the most part, the novel kept my interest in its entirety. There were a few points at which I was, for lack of better term, bored, but it is hard to attend to everyones attention-span. Another little problem I had with the novel it that it is really hard to picture a race of people that all look different from eachother, yet they don't have distinct male or female traits. While I was reading I changed the appearance of the characters tons of times to try and piece it together, but I could never really picture the Gethenians.The good news is that the book is a blast to read. The plot twists in directions that you wouldn't see coming. The books title and message have an incredible meaning that I won't quite give away, but I'll say that it teaches us humans balance. The structure is very unique, because its mostly written by two characters, which gives us a nice rest from mind to mind.I reccomend this novel to anyone who doesn't need to be entertained by punches and explosions. If you wish to really open your mind for imagination, read Le Guin's masterpiece. It may be a rather hard concept to conceive, but the story relates to our society more than you might notice at first glance. The Left Hand of Darkness is a great sci-fi/fantasy and also a great piece of great literature for anyone who wishes to open their mind to nature of us human beings."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"As I work through joint Hugo/Nebula winning books (this is also in the \`100 Best SF' collection), this was another worthwhile discovery.Le Guin's winter world feels rich and authentic, as do her alien societies. Estravan is noble, tragic and heroic, as is his namesake in the strikingly effective parallel inserted historical vignette. There is surprisingly little action within the context of conflict and international (and intergalactic) tension, although the occasional thriller scenes are handled capably, and the gruelling escape over the ice is epic. I really appreciate the way she builds Genli and Estravan's relationship through their shared ordeals, rather than just assuming it. Le Guin admirably avoids a formula plot, particularly with the ugly diversion into Pulefen \`Farm'.It's an original \`first contact' idea, but one that I suspect influenced later (good) books such as Cherryh's \`Cuckoo's Egg', Banks' Culture series, and Orson Scott Card's Ender series (where he also just grabs her \`ansible' concept, name and all). Rather than blithely blasting in and out of relatively primitive societies on their way to more important business (no hyperspace bypasses here), the Ekumen does covert research, then sends in a lone envoy. Curiously they aren't protected, culture-like, by hidden technology: rather there's something, dare I say, Christlike in the way Genli Ai has put aside his transcendent advantages to live (and suffer) with all the restrictions and vulnerability of the natives. I wasn't totally convinced by the rationale: at times it seems it would have suited everyone's purposes if the Ekumen arrived (as they eventually do anyway) with a fanfare, but perhaps there was some advantage in the subtle preparation of having an initial unthreatening visitor. Whether there was or not, Genli's experience is compelling.Oddly I felt the androgyny, something I suspect was central for Le Guin, was expendable. The sexuality angle was a cool idea neatly stated, but in practise the characters' actions and dialogue could overwhelmingly have been spoken by \`standard' humans and have made equal sense.Le Guin has managed a rare gravity and dignity, particularly in 1969, where intergalactic contact was more often a Star Trek style place to go and pash a green chick. I suspect part of the reason she made the top 100 cut was that \`The Left Hand' raised the bar and, apart from being a potent read on its own, led to some better books in its footsteps."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The first time I read this book, I was a newcomer to the science fiction genre. In college, I took a course on science fiction, and for the most part, I was rather disappointed by the selections we were reading. Some of the books were great fun to read, and innovative, but they lacked the depth and thought to make them great stories. But my reading of Le Guin's novel persuaded me to read more science fiction. This book is a beautifully crafted story about two people whose meeting raises questions about their cultures, and their perception of the other's world. Their journey across the cold lands evoked the kind of yearning that continued to ache many days after finishing the novel. I highly recommend this book for people who have the time and the faitful energy to savor the story."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula Leguin's writing style is great. Many readers will not appreciate the author's imagined aliens though. There have been more imaginative aliens. And the imagined planet, called Winter, is not really far different from some places on our planet. Mainly, the aliens differ sexually and that crops up frequently in the book. Then there is the envoy from our planet trying to open trade with Winter. It seems that all known humanity in the universe except those on Winter are male or female like on earth. A natural inhabitant of Winter can be either male or female during special times in their lives though they are not permanently one or the other. OK, it isn't to everyone's liking, but I think it deserves a better than average ranking mainly for the rich, descriptive language."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I read this book years ago, like maybe during the early seventies.So well written, it is pleasingly elegant & ingenious, the characterizations so real, so subtly sophisticated, they appear tangible.I was, and still am, amazed at how the author was able to access the various protagonists emotions, thoughts and inclinations with such vivid clarity.Utterly, thoroughly believable in context.For the times the book was, I think, pretty daring. Hell, it is still daring.Anyway, I heartily, without reservation, recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This novel treads into terrain that few writers choose to enter, and is a perfect example of what science fiction could do it it spent less time with light sabers and space battles. That is to say, it looks at one of our most basic assumptions about the universe and then turns that assumption on its head. What is gender? What are male and female, and what do they mean? Our own society assumes that they are fixed, and with good reason, since very few people actually get to be both, to experience both the masculine and the feminine in a fully physical way. And none of us can be both father and mother.In The Left Hand of Darkness, however, LeGuin takes us to a world where the norm is quite the opposite of our own: people change sex regularly. They are both fully male and fully female, alternating between the two. The narrative, the story, revolves around this fact and expresses the collision of a man from our own world into this new one. Told from his point of view, it begins, therefore, by anchoring us in what for us is normal. This is a good idea, since the Gethenians are quite alien at this most fundamental level. The insertion of other \\"normal\\" human reports on their world and unique sexual physiology is well handled, and gives us essential background that would not otherwise be available in a first-person narrative.What is also fascinating about The Left Hand of Darkness is that we find, as the story progresses, that the Gethenians aren't so alien after all, and this is a valuable lesson from this book: there is no doubt but that male and female are different, but in focusing on those differences we often overlook the larger areas where the two genders overlap, where it doesn't matter if you are male or female, because you are human."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Wonderful novel and a timeless classic.This work has the potential to open the mind of the reader to other ways of approaching life and considering the role of men and women in society.The story is deceptively simple and a familiar format for science fiction but Le Guin creates a world so believable you will be convinced it must exist somewhere in the universe.Themes of love, friendship, compassion and sacrifice are subtly drawn to give the reader an experience at once satisfying and uplifting.James Pope"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"With Left Hand of Darkness we get a great picture of a possible first encounter with a new race of humans on a distant planet. Add to that a political struggle between the various factions and the story begins to take life unto itself. But all is not sugars and plums as the story is slow going and you can easily lose interest.The plot follows two points of view: Genly Ai, an envoy of the Ekumen (Federation of Worlds), and Estraven, the Prime Minister of Karhide (one of several nations on the planet Gethen). Genly is the lone envoy and isolated so as not to instill fear. Estraven is the on again off again believer of Genly and friend. The two points of view establish a well rounded picture of what life on Gethen is like, but more importantly it shows the reader the conflicting views of how and why the Gethen(ians?) believe and disbelieve what the envoy tells them. I liked the intrigue and power struggles of Karhide, and just as interesting is the intrigue and power struggles of Orgoreyn. Genly, at times, is nothing more than a pawn for what he represents.The plot was slow moving and at times had me wanting to put the book down and read something else. I was not drawn in to the story, emotions weren't evoked, and I really didn't care what happened. It was an interesting dichotomy. Intriguing supposition of what first contact with a new world would be like, even more interesting political struggles of an alien culture, and the description of an alien human race, contrasted with the slow and boring storyline.I can understand why LeGuin won the Hugo and Nebula Awards because of the content of the story and how it unfolded, but I certainly don't think that plot was given enough attention to draw in the reader. A recommend for a quick read of a sound science fiction but lacking real meat to the characters and emotions involved.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I probably first read this book long before many of the posters were born, but not in a vacuum-I also read all of the other Hainish novels I could find. For whatever reason, the Hainish novels have always held my attention in a way that the Earthsea books do not.I was always struck, not by the gender-role examination, but by what the book had to say about common aspects of humanity and loyalty. Look at it also in terms of how we relate to societal norms that are different from our own."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A masterpiece, yes, but of a quieter caliber than most of these reviews would lead one to believe. Although Le Guin herself claimed that the politics were of more importance than the gender issues, what struck me most was the latter; the gender differences call into question the nature of love.Le Guin manages to masterfully present a love story without romance: Genly Ai and Estraven grow so close by the end of the book that there remains no border between friendship and love. Ai describes his feelings for Estraven as \\"love,\\" and yet there are no embraces, no shmaltzy \\"you complete me\\" lines, and no pretensions of eternal love. What Le Guin does through this unromantic, but close relationship is make the reader question his own preconceptions; can true love exist platonically? Her exceptional handling of such a subtle story makes this an excellent, thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I know quoting a book isn't really a review, but here are two passages that really moved me and I think give a strong sense of the story's themes.=====================================\\"Good night, Ai.\\" said the alien, and the other alien said, \\"Good night, Harth.\\" A friend. What is a friend, in a world where any friend may be a lover at a new phase of the moon?=====================================\\"How does one hate a country, or love one? Tibe talks about it; I lack the trick of it. I know people, I know towns, farms, hills and rivers and rocks, I know how the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a certain plowland in the hills; but what is the sense of giving a boundary to all that, of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to apply? What is love of one's country; is it hate of one's uncountry? Then it's not a good thing. Is it simply self-love? That's a good thing, but one mustn't make a virtue of it, or a profession... Insofar as I love life, I love the hills of the Domain of Estre, but that sort of love does not have a boundary-line of hate. And beyond that, I am ignorant, I hope.\\"Ignorant, in the Handdara sense: to ignore the abstraction, to hold fast to the thing. There was in this attitude something feminine, a refusal of the abstract, the ideal, a submissiveness to the given, which rather displeased me.Yet he added, scrupulous, \\"A man who doesn't detest a bad government is a fool.

The inhabitants of Winter are also human, but they are neuter hermaphrodites, living in neither gender for most of the time, and assuming either gender when in estrus. Genly Ai must bridge the gap of culture and gender in order to bring Winter and its inhabitants into the growing galactic civilization. Writing with thoughtful detail about her characters, life on Winter, and issues of culture shock, politics, and gender, Le Guin's text is skillful, thought-provoking, and readable despite the various and difficult contents. This is a science fiction classic, and while I don't consider it a personal favorite, I do recommend it.The strength of this text is Le Guin's skillful grasp of the realism and detail of her fictional alien planet and species. The inhabitants of Winter may be human, but there are significant details between the humans that the readers are familiar with, embodied in the character of Genly, and the alien residents. The primary difference is the issue of gender, which is a large focus of the book--so much so that this focus feels blatant at times. The narrator's sexism is also somewhat dated, making the focus on gender all the more clunky and exaggerated. On the whole, however, the issue of gender and how it defines both the individual and human interactions, is relevant, dynamic, and addressed from many angles, including that of the realistically biased narrator and the sensitive author.The habitant and life on Winter also makes up a significant section of the text, and Le Guin approaches this in incredible, realistic detail--enough to tell a gritty extended story but, thankfully, never enough to bore the reader. This is a thin line to tread on, and Le Guin does so with skill and grace. While not the most alien of alien cultures, Winter and its inhabitants are skillfully rendered and open up a new, wide world to the reader.All this lauding aside, I didn't find this to be an exceptional or memorable text. I suspect that this may simply be a matter of personal preference: I enjoyed reading this book and appreciate the author's skill in writing it, but I can't imagine rereading it, nor did I find it memorable. I just wasn't particularly taken with plot, character, or story. (I rated the book four stars based on this personal preference.) However, I do recommend it. Your taste may not be mine, so you may find this text more interesting than I did; even if you don't, the book remains skillful and important, and is a science fiction staple. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book is a difficult read initially due to the alien names and terminology, particuarly since the author sets off almost immediately with the protragonist right in the middle of a political fight on this planet. However, do not let that detract you from reading this beautifully-written book. By the end of the book, I felt strongly interested in Ai and Estraven.The biological science suggested by the author is compelling, but while reading the book I wondered if the hermaphroditic nature of the aliens was really anything more than a superficial plot device. The vague sexual tension between Ai and Estraven was indeed palpable, but would the story have been just as interesting without any of it? By the end, I decided the story was equally strong either way.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Le Guin's creativity is timeless. Like all the best science fiction writers, she truly transcends the genre classification. Le Guin's novel is an exploration of human interaction, gender identity, and political intrigue-and it happens to take place on another planet. It's beautiful-a true classic."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Beautiful and complex. I haven't encountered an author who can so soberly and gently push us to the limits of our society's imagination."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness started with a provocative question: what would a society look like in which there is no sexual difference--more specifically, what would that society look like to a man from our own gender-conscious world? However, the book took a long, meandering path from there.The main plot line is frequently interrupted by subplots and factoids that didn't fully integrate into the story (even though it seemed to be the author's intention to do so). Moreover, too many techno-babble and jargon weighed down the prose, forcing it in the painful position between fiction and pseudo technical writing. Eventually, the main plot emerged from the mist and peaked in a beautiful emotional moment, but the reader's interest was already tried by then."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I enjoyed the book and thought it ended better than it began. I would put this somewhere down the middle of Science Fiction/Fantasy. If you prefer science fiction books where to plot moves quickly, you might be disappointed. For me this book didn't have the pull in plot to keep pulling me back. But it is still something I would recommend reading. It has some interesting concepts and I think the constructed world in the book is one I will remember for a long time."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Another lovely, beautifully written story from Le Guin. I'm 3/4 done with it, and I think you should read it yourself to find out the plot. None of the synopses I've read do it justice."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Genly Ai has the role of ambassador of sorts, sent to invite a new world to join the Ekumen society, which is an alliance of different planets, of a sort.The planet he is an emissary to has people he finds it pretty hard to understand for quite a while, with their fluid and changeable sexual characteristics and roles.Misunderstandings and confusion abound, as well as political conflict when Genly and the prime minister he was cultivating end up on the run."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The protagonist is a human envoy sent to a planet of hermaphrodites to invite them to join galactic civilisation. The inhabitants of Gethen are functionally sexless most of the time, but for a few days each month become sexual, and may be either sex during that time.Le Guin takes this premise and works out a whole social and political system, and then introduces a normal human character to be the outside observer through whose eyes the reader gets to experience this world. The result is a society which is far more alien than many. (I recently described aliens in the poorer grade of SF as \\"humans in rubber suits.\\") But the story does not simply depend on that central idea. There is excellent characterisation, and some adventure thrown in for good measure. I found it hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"guys and girls who dont wanna think a lot about their sexual beings and continue in the state of nature of hormones and instincts, shouldnt care to read this... surely this is a book that may seem appalling to someone whos too much absorbed in his or her identity... as i was back like five years ago when i read it on the suggestion of a feminist professor.. but over the years it makes you be able to look at a man's and woman's face and realize how contingent she or he is what he or she is sexually.. and maybe then you see the woman or man that is, for the first time.. artistic enlightenment to the highest degree."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is science fiction at its best. Le Guin makes just minimal use of technological buzz to set the context and then is off into societal adventure. An envoy from the human Ekumen of Worlds (a kind of federation) visits the frigidly cold planet of Winter to persuade them to join the group. The politics of such a decision are well explored with various players jockeying to get into a position of dominance should the new order come to pass, while others resist any change.The best part of the book however lies in the way LeGuin has created a society where people's gender and sexuality are totally different. On this planet, people's sexuality is so different from us as to seem bizarre. People are of neutral gender, neither male nor female, but for a cyclic period called kemmer when they are almost \\"in heat\\" (I don't mean that negatively, I just cannot think of a better term) and can be of either male or female gender. This totally affects inter-personal interactions : just bear in mind how we tailor our communications (formal or informal) depending on the sex of the person we are addressing. The human character has no choice but to adapt to this environment and his efforts to do so make the book so compelling.Not an easy or fun read, but certainly a thought provoking book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"My American Literature teacher, a brilliant and well-read man named W. Rutledge, recommended this novel to our class because of its fascinating topic of ambisexuality. I finally got around to reading it, and was not disappointed. It is very thought-provoking to imagine other races or civilizations whose basic functions (can you get more basic than procreation?) are vastly different than our own. It exercises one's ability to imagine what else we take for granted as universal, but in truth is only peculiar to our own race.The pace of the novel was very fluid and quickly moved from one episode to another. As has been claimed before, this is more of an intellectual enterprise than typical space opera; in this respect, one finds the true value of LeGuin's vision.The Weaver (Foreteller) Faxe lays down for posterity one of the main themes of the novel on page 70, and it is worth quoting completely:\\"'The unknown, the unforetold, the unproven, that is what life is based on. Ignorance is the ground of thought. Unproof is the ground of action. If it were proven that there were no God there would be no religion ... But also if it were proven that there is a God, there would be no religion ... Tell me, Genry, what is known? What is sure, predictable, inevitable -- the one certain thing you know concerning your future, and mine?'\\"\\"'That we shall die.'\\"\\"'Yes. There's really only one question that can be answered, Genry, and we already know the answer ... The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.'\\"A very profound and serious philosophical statement contained within a science fiction novel, indeed! I recommend this novel highly, if for no other reason than for its originality of purpose."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula Le Guin has established herself as one of the most beloved genre writers for a reason: She has penned a veritable library of classic SF works considered by many to be among the genre's best. Finding a dud in her catalog is difficult indeed.Of the handful of works hailed as her greatest, \\"The Left Hand Of Darkness,\\" \\"The Dispossessed\\" and the Earthsea books are among the best known and most respected.In \\"The Left Hand Of Darkness,\\" we follow an envoy from a federation of worlds who has come to a planet steeped in an eternal winter with a task: To bring the planet and its people into the federation. It is a tale of culture clashes, of seeing through the eyes of others, and of adapting to those different than yourself.Most frequently cited as central to the book's theme are the overt gender differences on the planet (all people are of no gender, or both, and reproduce freely among one another).\\"The Left Hand Of Darkness\\" has less to do with its alleged subject matter (non-gender sexuality) than is often suggested, though when it does get into the subject, delves into it with grace and subtlety. The reader never feels beaten over the head. Yet the meeting and understanding of cultures has less to do with the sexuality involved than with simply UNDERSTANDING and accepting.While this is considered a genre work, the book has very little in the way of alien technology; do not expect \\"hard\\" SF. Yes, it takes place on another planet. Yes, other worlds are mentioned. Yes, most of the characters are essentially \\"aliens.\\" But the story does not rely on technology. This could have been a story of culture clash set right here on Earth and it would have been just as effective.At its core this is a wonderful story exploring the idea of how people relate to one another on an intimate level. And there's some intriguing political stuff going on behind the scenes, too.LeGuin deserves every bit of praise she gets. A true master and one of the best genre writers of the last 40 years, her works transcend fantasy and science fiction like few others."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Out of all of Le Guin's books I've read so far, including the Telling, The Dispossessed, Earthsea, Gifts, Changing Planes, and Coyote Girls, this book was my favorite. Although the Telling and the Dispossed are also achingly good, the stories are a little too political. At times, the messages in them distract you from the story.The Left Hand of Darkness is epic. Le Guin's prose may not be as polished as it is now, but the story is absorbing enough that you forget all about that. This is a story that makes you sit after you've finished it, to fully digest it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I must confess. I love Ursula LeGuin. Absolutely love her. I think if she wrote a computer tech manual, I'd rate it a '5'. If she authored the back of a cereal box, ditto.If you're lucky, there are a few authors who will speak to you, will engage you, will draw you in, in a way that is rare, that is complete, a bit unnerving, and, yes, wonderful.Ms. LeGuin is one of those writers, for me.The Left Hand of Darkness, like her other works, is absolutely the best at creating a world, another place, a place where you desperately would love to visit, or to live. It's not a real place, of course; it's free of the day-to-day tensions, pains, disappointment and banalities of the 21st century. No, maybe it's a great place to retreat to, to yearn for, to ache for. Maddenly close in your mind; just out of reach.Why that is, I'm not sure. Maybe it's the sense of place she creates that allows you the comfort and space to fill in all of the blanks. Yes, life may be tough in Ms. LeGuin's world, but one manages, one copes, and does so in such a damned fine place!Winter is such a world. The book opens with a rare, sunny, warmish day. Used to searing cold, the weather is suddenly, pleasantly, warm. Except to the residents of this very cold place, it's a bit much. Wrapped in the clothes meant for sub-zero temperatures, sweating from the 'heat' of a 70 degree day must have been a novelty.Read above and below reviews for the plot details, if you must. My take is different, as I've said. The interesting plot, with the unusual gender variations (which Ms. Le Guin has said she altered from a more conventional story). The Left Hand of Darkness, as her other books, allows one in a beautiful alternative to this world, if only for as long as one doesn't close the book covers. It's like that secret, mystical garden that one only enters in one's dreams.Enjoy the atmosphere, let is seep into you, let the tantalizing hints of a world that almost, almost, exists. And revel in that world, a world that only Ursula Le Guin could create.Of course, the only disappointment is when the book ends, and you must put it down. Like the wisps of a stirring, moving, touching dream that fade with the dawn, her books fortunately leave a small bit of the wonder with you for years. Go back to them (as I have, many times), and marvel that they are as enjoyable on the fifth reading as the first.Most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"At about the halfway point, I thought that THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS was an okay novel, but not a great one. However, by the time I arrived at the end, trudging through the ice and snow with Ai and Estraven, I found that my opinion had grown more positive. I'm still not quite convinced that it's the awesome and overwhelming classic that its reputation would suggest, but I can definitely see how it has received a lot of its praise.The book's plot is quite thin; the story is more concerned with world-building and character exploration than it is about events. The universe that Le Guin creates is where the book has its biggest successes and its most notable failure. The planet of Winter and the story of the one man sent to make first contact from a galactic alliance are extremely well realized, as is the society that human Genly Ai encounters in his travels. Their customs are sufficiently alien, yet rational; their non-human physiology is reflected upon in fine detail without becoming belabored; their squabbles and political wranglings are interesting; and their environment is described in depth. These portions of the story are a pleasure to read.Where the book falls down, I believe, is in the sections told from the point of view of the aliens themselves. A big deal is made out of the fact that for most days of the month, they are neither one gender nor the other, only becoming man or woman for a few days of their reproductive cycle. But while the actions they take reflect this substantial difference, the way they think doesn't. There's really no difference in style between the first person narrations of Ai and Estraven. Le Guin goes through a lot of pain to describe the pure facts of what a non-gender person would be like, yet can't quite convey the emotional responses. This is a pity, mostly because she did such a great job bringing to life all the other details.Still, while that one portion of the book frustrated me, I found a lot to enjoy in the rest of it. The bulk of the story concerns the relationship between the visitor, Ai, and the insufficiently alien, but realistically human Estraven. They play off each other well and it's fun to see the waxing and waning amounts of trust the two have in each other as the story progresses.Back when this was published in 1969, the message that gender wasn't really that important in determining one's station in live was probably considered a bit more sophisticated than it is today. Nowadays such an announcement seems rather obvious. Still, the book's other themes (such as the importance of loyalty and trust) have aged much better, and, in fact, the discussions on the exact meanings of nationalism and patriotism seem very apt in today's political climate. This turned out to be a very rewarding read in the end, so if you find yourself getting stuck in the middle, I'd recommend that you keep going. The book as a whole is certainly worth it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"In many ways, Le Guin delineates upon the Taoist belief of unity in order to prove that all things, materialistic or idealistic, have an opposite in this wonderful, original, and often startling novel.Through androgeny, Le Guin shows that although male and female are opposites, they complement each other to make one. Protagonist Genly Ai has difficulty seeing the Gethenians as either man or woman, instead of what they really are - a union of both. And in return, the androgynes see Ai, a human, as a pervert - a division of the two sexes. Indeed, the androgeny in 'The Left Hand of Darkness' creates a world in which sexual discrimination and exploitation are not possible. Le Guin uses androgyny in order to make us conscious of the way our stereotypes can be destructive. One major stereotype that is brought to light is how female traits usually have weak connotations, whereas male traits are strong and more desirable.In using androgyny, Le Guin poses the question of personal identity in a strange new world. Genly Ai, a black envoy from Earth, is suddenly catapulted into a unisex society and is forced to question who he really is.Moreover, Le Guin displays a journey in which the protagonist moves from ignorance, to the polar opposite of truth. In the novel, he realizes who the people are, who he can trust, and what really matters in life. Genly's transition can only take place through his friend, Estraven, one of the androgynes:\\"And I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to see [...]: that he was a woman as well as a man. [...] Until then, I had rejected him, refused him his own reality. [...] I had not wanted to give my trust, my friendship to a man who was a woman, a woman who was a man\\" (248-9).To go back to the Taoist theme that is ever-prevalent, Le Guin calls upon a 'Handdara prayer' called, 'Tormer's Lay,' in which her title was taken from:Light is the left hand of darknessand darkness the right hand of lightTwo are one, life and death, lyingtogether like lovers in kemmer,like hands joined together,like the end of the way.Each line shows part of the Taoist belief in opposites, similar to the Yin-Yang, which is a symbol that embodies the idea. In the Yin-Yang, black symbolizes female, while white is a symbol for the male. In this perfect circle, both are one. On Earth, it symbolizes man and woman. On Gethen, it symbolizes one person, the union of both man and woman. Simply in existence, the androgyne of Gethen is in fact the true essence of the Yin and Yang.Also, Le Guin's intricate combination of viewpoints truly brings balance to the story. Throughout the novel, Le Guin uses various points of view. These range from a third person, which is used to tell stories or give a historic view of Gethen, to a first person narrative in the voice of Estraven, to a first person narrative in the voice of Ai, and finally to a first person narrative of an Earth woman. The voice of Genly and the random voice of the woman contribute to the balance because man and woman complement each other. And finally, Estraven's voice is not only a change of viewpoint, but also unity itself because he is the union of man and woman.'The Left Hand of Darkness' is a prime example of Le Guin's Taoist beliefs worked into her writing. Her novel, in fact, proves her Taoist image of the Yin and Yang. Le Guin's proposal suggests that all things in the universe, whether that be in idea, thought, action, or material, has an opposite complement that is necessary for the world to function properly. Easy to understand, one can look to the title of the book, 'The Left Hand of Darkness.' Even the title delineates upon the Way. Light and darkness go hand in hand. If there is not one, there cannot be the other. It is not possible for either of them to be separated. This is exactly the same with everything else in life. Not only does Le Guin prove her point, but at the same time, creates an elegant piece of art. And until all people realize the need for complements and the necessity of an opposite, there can never be peace on Earth. Perfect unity and ideal peace will never be achieved unless we acknowledge differences in each other, all things, and most importantly, ourselves.Overall, Le Guin presents a thought-provoking novel, even for those not normally warm to science fiction. Her work is much deeper than meets the eye, and most definitely, her Taoist ideas shine through."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This novel presents a richly detailed alien world and culture, and gives you a regular human as your ambassador as well as a powerfully rendered native in Estraven. The plot is a mix of intrigue, communication, and learning, but also of survival when political and environmental forces are pitted against the main characters. So far, it has all the things that make a good book: great setting and characters, plus intrigue and conflict. But Ms. Le Guin takes it up a notch with a very intriguing exploration of how gender, as well as climate, can shape a world. For me, this heightened an already engrossing character study."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"If you know me, you know that I love this book. God Bless my English Professor Preston L. Allen (Author of Hoochie) for recommending it to me when I was going through my science fiction phase. The whole idea is pretty cool, with the bi-sex creatures, the cold planet, and the two cultures on it that might be symbolic of the two super powers of our world who were at the time in the middle of a \\"cold\\" war. I am not going to go over the aspects of the book that so many other reviewers have already covered--I agree with them all, it is a great book. What I want to do is point out something I caught the last time a read the book: the hero is black, is he not? Did I read the book right? Doesn't he say, somewhere near the end, that on his home planet (earth) he would be considered \\"dark\\"? Ursula K. LeGuin is so cool."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I like Science Fiction when it presents me with interesting characters, a good deal of 'hard' science, and when the characters are not overwhelmed by the science in the plot. Basically, I'm fussy.&quot;The Left Hand of Darkness,&quot; succeeds on all counts: the narrative character is representing a multi-solar-system trade federation, the sole human on a planet where the native beings are neither male nor female, but both, only becoming of one gender for a brief period of time, when they couple to propogate.Watching the narrator, Genly Ai, navigate this world of genderless/bisexual beings was keenly interesting. The social commentary Le Guin was submitting was there, but not so overpowering as to make you flinch at a preechy story by any means. The machinations of the various governments on this frigid world, called Winter, were truly quite interesting, and the relationship between the narrator and one Winter native was so carefully crafted that it had a resonating gentle emotionality thoughout the novel.Where the book fell apart a little was the language: there is a tendancy of the book to create tongue-twister words for things and processes that do not have a cadence that lends itself to memory. This over-use of science fiction gobbledygook was very frustrating at times, as I had to flip back through the book to find the first time the word was used to remember what it meant. That said, despite this small mishap, the book is a remarkable work of not just science fiction, but sociological commentary. Like all good Science Fiction, there is more here than a tale of alien peoples, there is an extrapolation from our own society, pushed to an extreme limit to better display something not alien, but very human indeed.'Nathan"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Some of the best novels in any genre, but particularly in SF, conjure emotions and thought out of stories that may not in themselves appear remarkable. These books don't do it for everyone. You have to make a commitment, and let go any prejudices about what stories 'should' do, and what SF 'should be. You have to be patient.This is one of those books. It is about mood, culture and even climate more than it is about plot or action. It seeps into you slowly. It infects you and warps your perception of the world around you. Those of you who want things straight, simple and clear cut will probably hate this book. People who see the grey areas, the bits in between, will probably learn to love it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Many reviewers here seem to be looking for action instead of content. Like americans who criticize foreign films for moving too slowly, they are missing the point. Le Guin's incorporation of Jungian psychology into her tale was the most profound aspect for me. I would recommend her book of essays: The Language of the Night. I think it could shed some light on the issue for those who call this wonderful little piece of art a bore."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"One of the most compelling science fiction books I've ever read, The Left Hand of Darkness is a complex novel containing several layers. Its main plot is relatively straightforward, the protagonist, Genly Ai, on a mission to bring a remote planet into the Federation of Planets. Beneath this main story line, there is a yet another even richer and more intriguing tale earthling Ai confronting a race of people with a psychological and physiological make-up entirely different from his own.The book opens in the main street of Erhenrang, a large city in the nation of Karhide on the planet Gethen or Winter. As the name implies, the planet puts the reader in mind of a Scandinavian landscape and climate of snow and ice. Genly Ai is the representative of the Stabiles of the Ekumen, the Federation of Planets including Earth. He is seeking to bring Gethen into their Federation. There on the street, he describes a parade in progress.The Left Hand of Darkness won the Hugo and Nebula Awards for best science fiction novel of the year. After you have read it there will be little doubt as to why it was chosen. For the reader accustomed to well defined roles for men and women, this story will confound your sense of sexual orientation and leave you asking why we are the way were are, which, after all is what a great piece of fiction should do."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Some writers are good, others great, and then there are those like Ursula K. Le Guin, who take literary risks to accomplish something great. In this novel, Le Guin ably succeeds.The plot, on the surface, is remarkably simple. An envoy from the Ekumen (a loose federation of aligned worlds) is sent to a frigid planet to get them to join. In the process, he finds himself caught up in a conflict between two rival nation-states.Reading the novel is as much an act of exploration as the envoy's mission, and I won't spoil any of the plot twists that emerge in the story. Suffice it to say, Le Guin tackles politics, family, religion, sexuality, and technology with a deft hand that gets her ideas across without interrupting the flow of the tale. This is a book you will likely think about for quite some time after reading it, but it's not a rollicking adventure or space opera that lends itself to more. The story is satisfyingly complete, and there is little left unexamined.As a word of caution, this is a controversial work, and I wouldn't recommend it to children because of sexual themes, though nothing is particularly explicit. If you have defined politics, religious beliefs, or sexual mores and do not enjoy having them challenged in your entertainment, definitely pass. Le Guin isn't preaching here, however, and one doesn't have to agree with any of the ideas put forth in The Left Hand of Darkness to appreciate their delivery."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Author of some of the best classic SF/Fantasy stories ever written, no praise is too high for Ursula Kroeber Le Guin. Her beautiful Earthsea books are perhaps her most famous works but The Left Hand of Darkness is equally haunting.Set in the word of Gethen or 'Winter' and told from the perspective of an envoy from the known worlds whose mission is to recruit Gethen into the confederation.But Gethen's culture is complex and unknowable and our hero, Genry Ai, cannot see whom to trust, makes mistakes and finds himself facing failure and death in a gulag. His rescue comes from a surprising source and the final quarter of the book concentrates on their flight through the desperately harsh terrain of Winter. And Genry learns to understand the people and culture of Gethen through the actions of one person, his companion and rescuer.Le Guin writing at the height of her powers is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Science fiction is sort of like a kid let loose on a playground. It can sprint along the fence's sweep all the out to the edges just to see where it will end. It can scramble all over the jungle gym until it knows every inch of its construction. Or it can plop down in the middle of the sandbox, take up a shovel, and start building whatever comes to mind. Which is exactly what Ursula K. Le Guin does in The Left Hand of Darkness, only her materials are significantly less mundane. She constructs a world all her own by packing together stars and solar systems, cultures and kingdoms, mysticism and science, sexualities and semantics.Genly Ai, ambassador of a star-spanning confederation called the Ekumen, can't seem to convince the inhabitants of the planet Gethen about the sincerity of his mission. His problem lies not only in persuading them that a heretofore unknown galactic government wants them to join its ranks, but also in demonstrating that he's actually an alien. It shouldn't have proved difficult, especially since he's a he in a world of hermaphrodites whose male or female characteristics emerge only during a monthly mating period. But the feuding nations of Karhide (a monarchy) and Orgoreyn (a socialistic bureaucracy) each believe that Genly is a hoax perpetuated by the other. Soon he finds himself on the run through the hinterlands of a planet so continually cold that its discoverers dubbed it Winter, his only ally a traitor with a price on his head.I know that stories require decision making, conscious choice in emphasizing character and plot, place and theme. Le Guin gives the latter two an admirable workout, especially the setting. One rarely finds a paragraph that fails to detail some part of Gethen's geography or climate or mythology or politics. Also, the anthropological impulse runs strongly through the novel. Le Guin likes to get caught up in pondering, say, the interplay between sexuality and violence (her androgynous creations have never known war) or biology and religion (just as the planet's inhabitants combine masculine and feminine, so its philosophies seek a cosmic unity). Fascinating stuff. Unfortunately, The Left Hand's action and, to a lesser degree, personalities remain underdeveloped. Sometimes Genly acts essentially like an erudite tour guide. Still, the detail of Le Guin's imaginings boggles the mind, and when you reach the back cover, you have little trouble comprehending why the book won the Hugo and Nebula awards, two of science fiction's top honors."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When I first heard that this book is about a planet of hermaphroditic people, I was a little turned off. But this book is much deeper than that. After all, it did win the Hugo and Nebula Award. For starters, the people of the planet Gethen are usually gender neutral and only take on male or female characteristics when they are \\"in heat.\\" Still, this concept can be difficult to grasp because we are so used to addressing and responding to people based on their gender. But the book never focuses too much on the sexual differences between Earthings and these people. Instead it's more of an analysis of culture, prejudice, and survival. The main character, Genly Ai, shows us how difficult it is to drop these preconceptions about gender as he tries to convince the Gethenians to join the Ecumen, a league of planets that shares ideas and technology. The Gethenians do not exactly accept the league's envoy with open arms but constantly question his intentions, and some even try to eliminate him, seeing him as a threat to their power and influence.The author definitely reflects the influence of her father, an anthropology professor at UC Berkeley, and this is what separates this book from your average science fiction fare. The book is more of a study of the people of Gethen than anything else. If you've grown tired of the average science fiction book and want something that will make you think about what you're reading, give this one a chance for a change of pace."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Pros: An interesting concept, very well written, the two main characters are great.Cons: Bombards the reader with unfamiliar names and concepts, doesn't stand up to time as well as it could.\\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" is about the envoy, Genly Ai, trying to bring a new planet, Gethen, into the coalition of mankind. Gethen is a cold planet and Le Guin describes this frozen world with so much skill that I almost feel that I am there. She also uses much skill in describing the cultures of the planet. She sets herself a hard task by choosing to write about a culture where everyone is ambisexual -- but the book shows that she has clearly thought of all the implications to society when people can only mate at certain times and may be either male or female. She manages to show how this sexual difference affects everything from religion and mythology to government and politics, but all the while, the Gethenians come off as entirely human.The way that myths were woven through this book was intriguing -- it really helped me to understand the society by getting at its roots. Although many of the minor characters fade into the background, the two main characters, Genly Ai and Estreven are beautifully crafted. The real genius of this book is that it manages to condense all the conflict and all the connection between two different cultures, just meeting, into the interactions between these two characters. It takes the cosmic and makes it intimately personal and this book is as much about two people being able to connect as human beings as it is about planets being able to connect to one another.This book does have some flaws. It uses a large number of unfamiliar terms that are off-putting in the beginning. I also think that the passage of time has made it a lot less original and controversial than it was when it was published. You can almost spot places where the author seems pleased with herself for her unusual ideas about gender -- which probably seemed a lot more unique 40 years ago. Despite this, the main character, Genly Ai strikes me as unusually sexist for someone who is supposedly living in the enlightened future. Some of his attitudes really jump out at me as attitudes that most people had decades ago and are now on their way out.Despite these flaws, \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" is a book that is highly recommended for a number of reasons. The beautiful writing, the complex, eloquently rendered cultures, the thought provoking ideas about gender identity, and the fascinating relationship between the two main characters. 5- stars."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The intriguing notion that our gender dictates not only our personal life, but the society we create and our political systems was quite a radical thought for me in the 1970s when I first read this book in college. I was immersed in an on-going sexual revolution and a feminist awakening. Ursula Le Guin's groundbreaking science fiction novel about a planet of individuals who are both ambi-sexual and asexual was a revelation for me.Re-reading the novel thirty years later just underscores what a classic this work is, and how great literature can inspire different thoughts and reactions all through one's life.When I read the book at twenty, I was not a mother, nor a wife, nor even very politically astute. I identified almost entirely with the narrator of the novel, Genly Ai, who is a heterosexual and a young, unmarried man. The political situations in the book seemed very clear-cut to me -- one country was like the Evil Soviet Union, one was like a Brothers Grimm fairy tale kingdom. The people of Winter were gender neuters except for the few times a year they entered the \\"kemmer\\" state, when they became either male or female and felt an overwhelming need to procreate. The line \\"The mother of several children could be the father of several others,\\" stuck with me.Now I am the mother of three teenager daughters, the wife of a politician and a professional in my own right. I still find Le Guin's icy world of Winter fascinating, but for very different reasons. For one thing, I find myself identifying not so much with the narrator of the story, but with the character of Lord Estraven. Estraven is dealing with a political situation which is delicate and complex, much like his/her sexual being. The novel is no longer so clear-cut for me, but is a far richer reading experience because of the life experiences I have now undergone.I highly recommend re-reading this classic for yourself."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have read Ursula Le Guin's other novels(the Earthsea series and The Dispossessed). I thoroughly enjoyed everything I had read by her, so I expected big things coming into this book. Reading the term \\"feminist science-fiction\\", I was a little worried I would see a lot of male-bashing.The story begins at a slower pace. The author creates such an elaborate and effective atmosphere of this foreign world, that I felt extremely lost. Not lost as in that I didn't understand what was going on, but lost in that I her description was so immersive that I was a stranger to this exposed world. The story picks up pace as the plot develops, but the author is very adept at maintaining readers.To avoid sounding like a book critic, the story was simply excellent. I can't ensure you'll love it, but I'm inclined to think you will."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When I started to read this book, I was aware that critics considered it a significant work of feminist literature. Because of that, I expected it to focus on questions of gender and sexuality. Somewhat to my surprise, that was not my experience at all. Instead the characters simply seemed human, and even the descriptions of the odd change of sex undergone by the aliens seemed more whiz-bang sci-fi than deeply significant. Perhaps society has changed enough that the feminist message has faded into the background, or maybe (as Le Guin has said herself) the author set out to create a genderless society but ended up creating a world of men.In any case the lack of the in-your-face message that you may be expecting does not detract at all from the book. \\"Darkness\\" tells the story of Genly, the first ambassador from the Ekumen, a sort of interstellar non-violent coordinating committee, to the winter planet of Gethen. To prove their good intentions the first amabassador is always put down on a planet alone, unarmed, and without support of any kind. Genly is a strange combination of resignation and persistence. Throughout the book he maintains his belief that Gethen will eventually ask (they must ask) to become part of the Ekumen, but at the same time he pursues this goal he is strangely passive. Perhaps Le Guin is trying to indicate that he simply has the sort of deep abiding patience that we hope an ambassador would have, but as I read the story I began to believe that he was simply depressed. Life on a winter planet is both cold and dark, and as a life long resident of New England I understand how that can affect your outlook over time!Nevertheless, Genly relentlessly pursues the leaders of each major faction he can reach, trying to convince each one that it is in their best interest to be the first to join the Ekumen. His efforts are aided by the disgraced Prime Minister of the first country he visited, who not only argues on his behalf but rescues him from imprisonment and certain death. The most beautiful and memorable scenes in the novel take place after this rescue as the two of them flee across a massive ice shelf. In the end, what I remember most about this book is the incredible descriptions of this escape, and Genly's growing awareness of how close he has become to his friend during it.\\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" remains a classic of science fiction decades after it was written, regardless of whether you are looking for a feminist message. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I read this novel after it was recommended as a novel involving a matriarchal society. While the Gethenians aren't matriarchal, (that would pre-supposed they had one main gender which they do not) they are hermaphroditic, it was still an excellent recommendation. This novel was written in the 60's and was cutting edge for the time, exploring the perception and bias of gender, the ecology of a world where gender is not set and where temperatures are often below zero, and the fact that much of humanity's struggles are driven by gender and perceived differences.The main character is a nebulous man by the name of Genry. I say nebulous, because it takes a while before you even know Genry's gender. It is narrated in the first person, and switches between Genry and the Gethenian chamberlain Estraven, who is a likeable man that Genry believes has betrayed him.I really liked the character of Estraven, the former chamberlain, and the Gethenian who risks everything to help Genry. The understated attraction between Estraven and Genry was both poignant and at times frustrating as the author fails to explore the intense feelings between these two beyond, simple attraction. Still he remains a loyal friend to Genry, who constantly misjudges him and assumes the worst about him until midpoint in the book.One weakness of the story was that I felt Le Guin failed to describe her main characters in any way so that I could get an idea of what they looked like. The main character is stocky and brown-skinned, and young seeming, but I have no clue about Estraven other than at times he is described as dark, and sometimes plump, other times thin. I never really got a feel for how the Gethenian looked (aside from their absence of gender).I felt the ending was a tad weak, and the tragic elements a bit senseless. Nevertheless, this was an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is generally considered by most to be an SF classic, and won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for best novel in 1970. I enjoyed it overall, but I also found it lacking in certain areas.The most impressive aspect of THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is the depth of its ideas. This is essentially a story of first contact between two very different alien civilizations. Author LeGuin is a first-class worldbuilder, and both of the cultures she creates are quite fascinating. The clash of the two cultures also allow LeGuin to explore issues that relate to religion, politics, and most notably gender. This is a very rich, multi-layered novel, the kind that actively engages the reader's intellect. It is the type of novel you probably need to read more than once to fully appreciate.Still, THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS left me wanting in several ways. While LeGuin's prose is superb, her writing style is rather distant. Most of the characters talk like intellectuals instead of real people. Most of the supporting characters are barely fleshed out. The plot lags in places, and I would not describe this book as a compelling pageturner.In many ways, this novel reminds me of the 19th century novels I was required to read in high school -- well crafted but not particularly engaging at the emotional level. I suspect more than a few readers will find this novel rather tedious and unsatsifying.In short, THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is a great work at the intellectual and philsophical level. But as someone who enjoys good storytelling, I found it a somewhat sterile reading experience."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I hate to spoil the love-feast that prevails here, but reading this book was one of the most painful literary experiences I have ever endured. The prose is stilted (or to put it more generously, dated), the characters elicited no personal interest on the part of this reader (as opposed, to pick an example that most of you will recognise, to that of Bean in Ender's Shadow), and the plot (and it pains me to dignify the story-line with that word) practically non-existent. Numerous reviewers will tell you that this is science fiction for the thinking man; not for the light-hearted. Proceed at your own risk!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Some years have passed since I read this book. I won't repeat the experience, and I certainly won't buy 'The Left Hand Of Darkness.'Why not? Let me count the ways...Unengaging characters sink a book, and this one has a Titanic deckload of same. He certainly isn't particularly manful, especially when he must deal with the sex-change of another character (how many readers would, in the same situation, have closed their eyes?).Russian winters are best written by Russians with lots of time and vodka on hand; we Americans just don't have the touch. Anyone with enough bucks to put down can visit Antarctica in mundane reality, and for most of us National Geographic specials are sufficient. Give me a setting that isn't a prescription for Prozac waiting to happen!Some cultures belong in a petri dish and should be treated with biocide rather than respect. The ice-planet culture is one of the most poisonous set of autocracies ever to belabor a manuscript. Unfortunate, when you consider how the hermaphrodite concept could have been liberating and a source of dry humor (see Lois Bujold's Betan hermaphrodite character or even smiled, as I read it.True, laughter isn't the sine qui non of sci-fi. I didn't laugh at Dune or at anything Andre Norton wrote. But I had a smile for the triumphs of the protagonists of those books. The Left read in a long time. It isn't even good tragedy as is Conrad's Lord Jim. In fact, it fails to convey any emotions save boredom, hopelessness, and helplessness. If the protagonist's chore is to 'understand' the culture, his task is pretty simple-it's a totalitarian pesthole notable only for the biological oddity of its people. If he were charged with liberating the hermaphrodites... but no good collectivist wants to destroy a native culture that leaves its unfortunate adherents ripe for subjugation by the greater collective. Culture be damned! These people were killing and oppressing each other, and the fool protagonist doesn't seem to give a rat's ass one way or the other, so how am I supposed to care?So I'm puzzled. Did those reviewers who slobbered all over this piece of tripe read the same book I did? Or are they all collectivists of one or another stripe who ignored the protagonist's Woody Allen haplessness?

Well, I thought the book was BORING. Plain and simple. The book has a very limited plot, and is more of a travelogue than a &quot;story&quot;.

Why not just have Amazon.com write good reviews and not allow anyone else from posting. We'll see if this one gets through. The book, in my opinion was a giant yawn. The three hundred page book was as dry as a cracker and seemed, to me, like a thousand pages long."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I started reading this book years ago, I forgot when exactly. I read couple of chapters, and couldn't continued reading. I put it back on my 'to be read' shelf and forgotten about it. After watching \\"Jane Austen Book Club\\", the book was praised by the characters in the movie as one of the best Scifi book out there, and I thought, hmmm...I must be missing out, maybe I should give it another try now that I'm a couple of years older, I might find it interesting.I'm still trying to read my way through. I read 75% of the book, and I don't care at all about any of the characters in the book.It's about an envoy, Genly Ai, from a planet similar to Earth, not Earth? I don't know. His mission is to enlist the Winter planet to be part of the space United Nation. But the people on the Winter Planet are skeptical and suspicious of his character and motives, why? Because he's different from the people on the planet. While the main character's gender can be defined as male, the people in the Winter Planet only have one gender, but they are all referred as 'He'. How they kemmer (Another word for mating)? When the phase of kemmering approached one will remain a male form, while the other changed into a female form.The only complaint I have about this book is that the author mentioned more about kemmering than any of the characters in the book. No, there are no kemmering in a pornographic sense. More of a touch of hands that caused arousal because it was their kemmering phase, like mating seasons for animals, and then they kemmered.The author waste a lot of pages on unnecessary side stories that did not progress the story at all, leaving no room left for character development.I read up to the chapter where the main character was imprisoned, and I don't care. The author failed to put details leading up to events, instead things just happened.Unfortunately I don't like leaving books unfinished, so this is going to be another chore on my list."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book won both a Hugo and a Nebula award, an amazing feat for the time (and still is). I'm usually pretty much in agreement with the choices on these things, but in this case I have to disagree. It's been some years since I've made a point of reading all the Hugo and Nebula-award winners, but up till that time I'd read every story and book that had won either of them, and in my opinion this is the weakest book ever to win either of these prestigious awards. The book isn't bad, but it certainly isn't in the class with your typical Nebula or Hugo winner. There are Le Guin stories that I liked much better. It's okay for general reading, but if you're looking for something truly Nebula or Hugo worthy, look elsewhere.An odd piece of personal trivia here--I was a biology and psychology major in college back in the mid 70's at San Francisco State University, and I had a young psychological statistics prof by the name of Ted Kroeber. One time he was talking to someone in class, and I happened to hear him say his sister recently got married to some Frenchman by the name of Le Guin and moved to Oregon.Some of you may know that Alfred Kroeber was America's first great, and possibly greatest, anthropologist. So Le Guin is another of Kroeber's children. I'd known that Ted was his son but I didn't know his sister was the emminent woman Sci-Fi writer until then. Sorry about dissing his sister's book, 'cause Ted was actually a pretty cool statistics prof.Just goes to show you it's a small world."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book is about substance and it is beautifully writen.

I read it six years ago and was disappointed with it then... as I am now. The repackaging (it has a new cover now) is far more attractive than the story. It was just too drawn out and obviously not very memorable. I hope they don't re-release this in 2006!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Yawn. And I don't care what her father did, it doesn't make this book any better or interesting. Fair warning, this book is as good as a warm cup of milk. It can cure insomnia. There is no story whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The book opens with what sounds like a justification as to why Left Hand of Darkness should be considered sci-fi; that it needs justification at all should be considered a huge warning sign. The story can quickly be summarized as follows: an envoy (Genly Ai) for an interplanetary society is sent to negotiate a trade treaty with the nations of the ice planet Gethen. Through the protagonists' travels two nations are examined. The monarchy of Karhiden and Orgoreyn, a totalitarian state. Banished from one and tortured in the other, Genly Ai has to make a dangerous escape through the icy plains before finishing his mission.There is the additional twist that Gethenians are androgynous and only become male or female when they are in heat, two days of each month. However, this theme is not really explored and if Le Guin's characters were simply male and female the story would not see much change. Which begs the question: why introduce that concept in the first place ?The political drama part has a few similarities to Dune on the one hand and 1984 on the other. However, it pales in comparison to either of them. What we are left with then is a vivid description of the arctic landscape, its horrors and its beauty, making the reader shiver as he follows Genly's and his friend's three month journey.Why has this book won Nebula and Hugo awards ? I have no idea. As a travel report of the arctic in National Geographic magazine it would be excellent, but as a science fiction novel it is quite disappointing."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Although my soul didn't fly to the, where books like &quot;The Word for World is Forest&quot; and &quot;The Dispossesed&quot;, and must tell you that I liked this book.

It's hard to necessarily put all the pieces together with this intense exploration of gender roles, but it's a puzzle, nonetheless, that will stick with the reader for a long time to come. Ultimately, this book (as explained in the seminal introduction to this novel Le Guin provides) isn't about some far off planet in time and space. It's about US, and how we perceive and act on gender roles we've inherited. Of course, those theories wouldn't mean much if the prose wasn't sparse and vivid, the characters weren't engaging (even when extremely strange), and the planet this takes place on wasn't realistic. Thankfully, LeGuin supercedes these criterea for an excellent novel--groundbreaking when it was published, as essential as ever today."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness is a very difficult work to rate, I think. I liked its dark, deep atmosphere, the sharp contrast between its dark depths and bright, dazzling heights, cold and warmth...stuff like that.

Nevertheless, considering the new way of thinking it opened up to me and the intellectual stimulation I got, I think it's one of the best books I've read(so much for hard to judge).

The relationships between the characters are amazing, not to mention the awesome descriptions of the planet and some of the long journeys made across a planet of ice!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is the first science fiction book I've ever read, and I never would have picked it up had it not been a requirement for a literature course.The book takes place on the world of Gethen, and the action describes one man's (an envoy named Genly Ai) experiences on this world as he tries to convince the Gethenians to join a multi-world league called the Ekumen. He encounters many new things in Gethen, but by far the most interesing is that the Gethenians are ambisexual. This concept, difficult enough in itself, is complicated when Genly Ai realizes the implications that ambisexuality has on gender: the social constructions that exisit on earth are completely different on Gethen.The first part of the book was very confusing for me, and it just didn't pull me in...I had no idea what was going on and all the action just seemed...random.... By about the half-way point, though, things started to get interesting and I began to really understand what the book is about: humanity and what it means to be human, and the question of whether gender is inherent in humanity or a perversion of it. One of the most interesting scenes is when Estarven asks what a women is like on Ai's planet. Genly Ai is confronted with the fact that this is not as simple a question as he originally thought.This is a good book and I enjoyed reading it, but it's a little hard to get into, especially if sci-fi is not a genre you typically enjoy. I recommend this book, it brings up some really interesting issues to think about. Also it is relatively short, only 215 pages, so it's not a big commitment."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book explores a world whose inhabitants are androgenous, both male and female.Into this world comes an alien, a single gendered human. His attempts to explain what a woman is, or what it is like to have two sexes to a race with no notions of such things made me wonder what I would have said in his place. We also experience his attempts to understand a culture that has formed without gender bias and no pressure to conform to the expectations of a particular gender role.Technology takes a back seat and there are no space battles: this is not space opera. It is thoughtful sci-fi that that asks subtle questions."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Before I read Ursula LeGuin's novel, The Left Hand of Darkness, I was already an avid reader of science fiction greats such as Alfred Bester, Theodore Sturgeon, and Orson Scott Card. I will say it now: Ursula LeGuin is completely unique. In a century that has already abandoned the old literary rules, LeGuin keeps them intact.LeGuin can write great as far as literary terms are concerned--college professors and purists will love her writing style. This is her biggest strength. However, it's also her greatest fault, as there is not much dialogue and the characters are all but completely empty.The story revolves around and envoy sent from Terra (Earth) to persuade the people of the planet Winter to join an interplanetary alliance known as Ekumen. It follows the main character, Genly Ai, through the world of Winter as he bridges the gap between their two worlds.Ursula LeGuin obviously has an imagination. The race of Winter are able to change sex when they are ready to reproduce, and hence every person is both a man and a woman.I will say it once: if you're looking for books you will read for pure enjoyment, this is probably not for you. This book is interesting, very interesting, but fails to ever get exciting or connect you to the characters (as is the case with all of LeGuin's novels, take 'A Wizard of Earthsea' for example).I do, however, reccommend that everyone that picks this book up reads to at least a third the way through, because even if you don't find yourself connected to the characters or story, you find yourself engrossed in the ideas of LeGuin and the planet of Winter.It is a masterpiece of science fiction, definitely. Is it filled with action? No. Does it have suspense? No. Is the story very exciting? No. Is the book good? Yes, quite. And as much as my review contradicts itself, if you find yourself wondering whether or not you want to read it--pay attention to my rating. I rate hard, and 4/5 is a good read."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have never read a better book than this one. Such wonderful description, such deep and emotional characters, such vast scope and yet told so simply.... This is one of the true masterworks of science fiction.LeGuin, among other things, is the best writer of male characters since George Elliot. Imagine a female author, writing as a male character (Genly Ai), trying to explain to an androgyne what women are like! Yet, she pulls it off, and beautifully too.I admit that this book is a bit hard to get into, and I had difficulty my first time, but if you're just patient and see it through, you won't be disappointed. LeGuin has created a wonderful world and an incredibly real-seeming race of people.This book does so well what only a few do: it uses the future to comment on us, now. The two nations, Karhide and Orgoreyn, and so easily comparable to the two super powers of the 1970's and 80's and are relatively interchangeable, both wanting the power but unable to believe in Genly Ai's incredible story, or have the faith or the vision to believe in him and his offer to them to join a League of Worlds, or to keep the information as anything but a state secret. Yet at the same time, they are two sides of the same coin, just as each Gethenian is both sexes, and cannot exist without the other.There simply isn't enough room here to tell you all the good things about this book. Just read it! It'll be the best thing you read all year."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Forget the comments left before..this book is wonderful.. i can see sort of why they say itmay be slow in the beginning but it is so well written and touching in the description of the relationship between Ai and Estraven i really got emotional over it. The fact that both are exiles - one only a few miles from his home and the other millions of miles away, makes no difference. The two share the same feeling of having no one except each other. I know it is considered science fiction, but it contains many social/anthropological overtones (Leguin's father was a noted anthropologist). If you like laser beams and space ships and time travel forget this book. If you enjoy plausible, carefully crafted original work please read this book. It made me start wondering seriously about what life elsewhere could be like. . .this time not ahead of us technologically, but with much to offer us in terms of learning about ourselves."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Whoever called this book &quot;tedious and dull&quot; (see below) not only has an apparent fondness for tautology, but simply has no taste! The atmosphere in this book is compelling - I felt the cold of Gethen so much, I shivered several times. The politics is intriguing and the characters very believable. I lent it to my girlfriend, who doesn't usually read science fiction, and she loved it as much as I did. Now I'm off for some hot beer by the fire..."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is by far the most overrated novel I have ever read. While I can't deny that the setting and Le Guin's play on gender roles is very fascinating and worthy of being explored to the fullest, that in itself is not enough to make up for agonizingly bland characters and a non-existent story.Reading this book is like having a painter show you a blank and shiny canvas. You have to admit, that's a nice-looking canvas she got there. But you can only stare at it for so long before telling her to please put some paint on it already!Genly Ai, the main character, is not a compelling protagonist. In fact, if anyone can tell me a single character trait of his that is not \\"he's human\\", I will give you a medal. Estraven, the other character whose viewpoint we're getting, is a little more compelling, but once the sense of awe over getting a viewpoint from a genderless creature disappears, he too becomes utterly bland and uninteresting.Like I mentioned earlier, the story is simply non-existent. And no, that little track across the ice near the end is not good enough. One simply cannot introduce a plot 200 pages into the story and expect anyone to care at that point. If this was not on the required reading list for my class I would have thrown the book in the trash after 50 pages. Left Hand Of Darkness should have been a companion book for a real novel, perhaps then it could have worked. As it stands now, it's like Lord Of The Rings without the ring! Sure the world and people are still fascinating, but who gives a damn when Frodo and Sam are just wandering aimlessly around Middle-Earth for a thousand pages?It's easy to see why this work got the awards that it did at the time of publication. The gender-concepts introduced here are indeed very fascinating and thought-provoking. How it still is held in such high regard today however, fifty years later, is a mystery to me. The setting and concepts should serve the story and the characters, and never the other way around!Left Hand Of Darkness gets one star for the setting, that's all it deserves."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"LeGuinn had a fascinating idea for this book - a world where people spend most of the time as neither male nor female, but just become one or the other (not the same each time) for mating purposes. Unfortunately, while the book gives you something to think about, there is not much of a story there, and the book is boring."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I had heard so much hype about this being \\"one of the best books by the best SF writer ever,\\" that my expectations were unfairly too high. While this book was really well written and surely deserves to be considered a classic, the story just didn't really overwhem me like I had hoped. It basically consists of an interstellar envoy's (Ai) adventures attempting to convince the leaders of the worled known as Winter to accept the reality of and to become part of the Universal community. Sounds like it could be really exciting right? Well, it should have been a bit more so than it was. For one thing, the book was quite predictable and tended to drag out some boring parts here and there. A lot of time was spent following the characters along a journey over a glacier (about 25% of the book) and it didn't really have a big impact on the plot of the book. Some pretty interesting character relationships were developed and the whole culture of Winter was very interesting (the people there are unisexuals..) So, the book was good but don't expect too much or you'll be disappointed too."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I re-read The Left Hand of Darkness last week (I'd first read it 15 years ago). It is still as emotionally, conceptually and imaginatively powerful as it was. It is one of a handful of books that made me (consciously) look at the world and human beings in a different way. You can breeze through it in a day, you owe it to yourself to read it."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When I first read this book back in college, I didn't appreciate it nearly as much as I do now, but with more years and experience under my belt, I've eventually come to consider it one of the best books of speculative fiction out there. Thank goodness I took the time to read it a second time and soak it all in. It was definitely worth the effort. Le Guin's planet is a remarkable work of imagination, and offers us a sobering and insightful look at gender. Here, \\"gender\\" is not a permanent state of being at all. Le Guin's vision is one where a person's gender is a seasonal thing, and recalls the old Greek legend of Tiresias, who was able to change genders at different points in his life, as well as some creatures here that are able to do the same thing. As unique as this idea is, the book is much more than that, and touches on many other societal issues as well, including religion, equality, etc. Though it can be a dense read at times, the novel definitely deserves the awards its won over the years."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I guess that since I mentioned this in my review of The Earthsea Trilogy also by Ursula Le Guin I should most probably write a review for Left Hand of Darkness as well.Left Hand of Darkness is more of an exploration of human emotion/sexuality than straight Science Fiction. The story centers around an emissary who has been sent to a distant planet, called Winter, in order to convince them that joining the intergalactic federation is a good thing for their planet and their society. The people of the planet are both male and female, able to change their sex pretty much at will and our emissary must learn how to cope with this strange sexuality at the same time that his body is learning to cope with the extreme climate of this frozen planet.Overall, I thought that this novel had a grand concept that the author handled adeptly and really did make the reader think and consider human emotion and sexuality. Her storyline is engaging and her characters are well-fleshed out. My only problem with it is that her prose seemed very heavy-handed. I consider myself to have a fairly extensive vocabulary and it seemed that I was stumped by words often in this book. I normally don't have a problem when I come across a word that I don't know and I actually enjoy finding out the meaning of a new word, but the frequency with which this occurred was a bit frustrating. Even without the vocabulary that Le Guin uses in this novel, there were many times that I felt that the plot was plodding along especially when dealing with all of the philosophical and bureaucratic hurdles that the protagonist must go through in order to reach an understanding of these people with whom he must attempt to make some sort of alliance.The concept and storyline were enough for me to give this an above average rating, however had Le Guin's style matched that of her Earthsea Trilogy, I'm sure that I would have enjoyed the novel much more and given it a much higher rating."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I really liked this book for the first 2/3rds of it. Great story, did dry up a little towards the end, otherwise I was kept interested until the last 1/3rd of the book. Ursula has a great writing style that's worth mentioning. I guess I was just expecting something much more sinister based on the title of the book. If I had not had this expectation would it have been different? Possibly."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I eagerly anticipated this book having heard that it was a science-fiction classic along the lines of Dune. However, in my opinion The Left Hand of Darkness has not maintained its appeal the way Dune has over 40+ years. I can understand why the book won the Hugo and Nebula awards, as the themes explored are indeed fascinating, and groundbreaking at the time. The idea of a civilization not engaged in a struggle of opposites, of 'this vs. that', is intriguing. However, the style of writing is detached, the characters are barely developed and the story drags until about two-thirds of the way through, when a journey across a huge ice cap is visceral and atmospheric. If you have an interest in Eastern philosophy, which heavily influenced this book's thematic content, and are willing to be patient, then I would recommend reading it at least once."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I found the story to be a compelling one that kept me engaged throughout. I hadn't read anything about the novel beforehand, so while I may have been prepared for (and craving at times) a little more 'action', I was still entertained.I particularly found the trip across the ice shelf to be very engaging.

Le Guin distinguishes gender as a biological function necessary for procreation from gender as a social construct implemented to dictate one's social identity and social behavior.She does this by creating an alien world, where the inhabitants may take the sexual role of either male or female only during a mating cycle -- and they are not always the same gender from cycle to cycle. Planted in this setting is a representative, a human male, who co-narrates as he pursues a mission to convince its leaders to join an inter-planetary alliance. The second narrator is one of the planet's inhabitants, who is an \\"ear\\" to one of the planet's rulers.To illumine the novel's motif, which suggests a boundary between one's concept of gender and one's biological gender, Le Guin gives each character voice to express a perspective on the unfolding drama as well as on one another and their sexual cultures. While Le Guin uses the native of the alien planet to provide much of the story's mystical and political intrigue, it is through the representative that Le Guin asks the reader to examine one's notions of sexuality and gender.As a whole, The Left Hand of Darkness is a book to be enjoyed by anyone interested in pursuing gender studies."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A bisexual world.

Genly Ai is the First Envoy, who sets foot alone onto the surface of the frigid planet of Winter (Gethen to its inhabitants) to bring offers of trade, peace and alliance to the people of the planet. However, the genderless inhabitants (who only have sexual urges and genders for a brief period once a month) are sceptical of Ai's claims, and he soon finds himself a pawn of political factions in two neighbouring countries eager to use or discard him as they see fit.The Left Hand of Darkness was originally published in 1969. It is set in a shared future history which Le Guin has used for several other novels and short stories, though foreknowledge of these other works is completely unnecessary to read this book. The novel also has a formidable reputation as one of the most critically-acclaimed science fiction novels in the history of the genre, noted for its complex themes and its use of metaphors to tackle a wide variety of literary ideas.The novel spends a fair amount of time talking about the genderless inhabitants of Gethen, who have no sexual urges at all apart from a brief period called kemmer, when they are able to mate and reproduce. Le Guin has put a lot of thought into how not only this works biologically but also the impact it has on society and on the world. Her notions that a lack of sex drive for most of the month reduces the aggressiveness of humans (Gethen has never had a major war) seem obvious, but these ideas are constantly examined and re-examined during the course of the book and she steers away from trite answers.Whilst the gender theme is notable and the most oft-discussed aspect of the novel, much is also made of the planet's cold climate and the challenges the people face in living in a world mostly covered by glaciers and icecaps where the warm seasons are perishingly short. The politics and divisions between the neighbouring countries of Karhide and Orgoreyn are also described in some detail. As a result Gethen, also called Winter, is as vivid and memorable as any of the human characters in the novel.Amongst the individual characters, the dominant ones are Ai himself and Estraven, the Prime Minister of Karhide whose interest in Ai sees him suffer a fall from grace and having to travel a long road to try to redeem himself. The book is told from the first-person POV of both characters, moving between them with interludes taking in myths and legends from Gethen's past and also on matters such as the Gethenese calendar and sexual biology (there's also an appendix which handily collates this information into an easy-to-find collection). The two characters are compelling protagonists, with Ai's bafflement at his status as a man from another planet being considered incidental at best to the trivial politics of two nations leading him into difficulties, whilst Estraven's characterisation is subtle and compelling, with the reader constantly having to review his or her opinion of him based on new information as it comes to light.The themes that the novel tackles extend far beyond the obvious ones of gender and climate. Duality (expressed in Ai's discussion of Taoism with Estraven), faith, the difficulties of communication even when language is shared and politics are also discussed and examined. But where The Left Hand of Darkness impresses is that these thematic discussions are woven into the narrative in a manner that is seamless and stands alongside a compelling plot. The book's climax, where the two main characters have to traverse a 700-mile-wide icecap with limited supplies, is a fantastic adventure narrative in its own right.Complaints are few. Written in the 1960s, Le Guin presents a few outdated ideas on gender roles and sexuality that were common at the time, but these are minor issues at best.Overall, The Left Hand of Darkness (*****) is a smart and intelligent read that has a lot to say and does so in a manner that is page-turning, compelling, relentlessly entertaining and refreshingly concise (the novel clocks in at a slim 250 pages in paperback). One of the all-time classics of the genre and a book that more than deserves its reputation. The novel is available now in the UK and USA."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I was forced to read this in high school!

I turns out i really like this after all!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This novel transcends the science fiction genre. It is a fast paced adventure story that is also a meditation on sexuality, power and love. There is truly nothing else like it that I have read. Le Guin never lets us forget the infinite flexibilty of human consciousness and the many possibilities that we summarize with the word \\"civilization.\\" While this may sound heavy, I want to stress again, a great read, a page turner, a character driven thriller. Thank you, Ms. Le Guin."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Outside of the many compelling thematic elements debated and discussed by so many readers here, I'd just like to say that this novel is also simply a damn good story--a tale of adventure, discovery, suspense, and sacrifice. It's written in a scholarly and more cerebral manner than so many novels out there, and though sometimes a bit withdrawn in its storytelling, it's a refreshing change from the majority of tales. And watching how Genly Ai and Estraven come to know each other is remarkable. More importantly though, this is a thought-provoking gender-bending read, and the story's single-sex society is an intriguing concept. The idea of needing complementary entities, a range of opposites that require each other to form a whole (night and day, yin and yang, if you will) may make the book a fascinating literary study, but it's also an engaging story of friendship as well."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Beautifully written and filled with great characters.

Le Guin takes you into a different world -- in which, among other others things, sexual identity is far from stable -- and almost imperceptibly has you thinking about gender differences and the role of sex (and the &quot;Other&quot;) in our lives and culture. At the same time, the story and characters are fully involving, with the book's themes enriching rather than dulling the reader's experience. The book well deserves the acclaim it has received."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A voracious reader of s&amp;sf, particularly enjoying fun and extremely well-written, stories with reference to mythology, wonderful female characters, and alternative social structures, this book is the book I will always refer to as the SF classic. I just re-read it, and wanted to make sure that I'm ALWAYS notified of anything remotely similar in print - so here is my review.I realize that the most interesting thing about this book, when I read it first back in the 70's, was that it was the first real discussion of gender roles. I'm amused to read some of the reviews of this book - I think that perhaps some younger readers my not understand how pivotal was Left Hand of Darkness. Virtually a banned book for years in my midwestern hometown, it was a simple first and second word on gender, sexuality, and difference. Elegantly simple. The haunting tone of the book survived its plot, in my mind, and though on re-reading it, it does not have the contextual detail I enjoy in the wealth of the post-1990 &quot;genre&quot; (is this still a genre?), I still find it haunting. The anatomy of a relationship, the uneven odd emotions provoked by difference in biology and culture including mild paranoia, the realistic political confusion, the tragedy - this is a complex novel, and ranks as literature. Nothing is oversimplified. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When we are finally done reading a novel, especially a good one, we may find that we are a bit different from what we were before we read it, that we have been changed a little, as if by having met new people, crossed different streets, or visited strange lands. But it's hard to say just what we learned, or how we changed because real art, not that specious imitation so prevalent these days, deals with what can not be fully expressed in words. And so, I who usually have no trouble finding the words, stand rather speechless after reading this great classic of science fiction literature, the winner of the Hugo and Nebular awards, that taught me, rather by demonstration of feelings than by telling, that the truth is a matter of the imagination. When you have finished reading this work, I therefore predict, you will be permanently changed, that you will have a new insight into the nature of culture, love, exact and vivid myth and saga, and that you will have acquired a new vocabulary which will now include kemmering, kadik-germ, and gicky-michy. Nowhere else have I recently experience this tremendously fruitful power of answering well that question that most writers ask as they approach the extended narrative that is the novel: What if?"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is great literature. You might think it moves a little slow at first, but it draws you in, and you come to a quiet yet emotionally breathtaking climax. Along the way, you explore what it means to be human. How dependent are we on gender in defining who we are? Can a person who feels no permanent gender affiliation be truly human? Or is that person the integral, self-contained, individual human being that gendered humanity can only imitate? What does it mean to truly love someone? Is there love without gender? LeGuin discusses all of this and more, and her insights are genuinely meaningful because she understands human social structure, since she is the daughter of anthropologists. A truly moving book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I first read it back in high school, and I really didn't appreciate it then... I read it again recently and I was amazed at how socially relevant it is today, even though it was written over 25 years ago. Ursula Le Guin is an amazing author."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Given this book's notoriety and the fact it won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards (something 17 other books have done, by the way), I approached this novel with great anticpation. I was very disappointed by book throughout. The premise is interesting enough, but the characters are rather bland and the plot is very esoteric. I kept trying to get into the story, but it failed to captivate me at any point. I attempted to give each chapter a fresh chance to grab my interest, but it was like trying key after key from a key ring to unlock a door only to find that none of the keys fit. While LeGuin is certainly a great writer, this is not her best work. I recommend the Earthsea stories instead (beginning with \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\")."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is a wonderful, deliberate book that works on many levels, as a fascinating intellectual/philosophical look at various concepts, particularly gender (obviously, since the inhabitants of Genthen are androgynous, but there's really no grounds for calling this a \\"gay/lesbian\\" work) and dualism. Although it's relatively short, and other books take hundreds of pages to relate their created worlds, Le Guin manages to give a solid sense of the planet Genthen by using several devices, including some in-between chapters that consist of different myths folk stories or scientific reports. These serve to heighten and highlight the themes of the novel and to ellucidate them as well. Readers who complain about this, or the shifting point-of-view narration are simply missing the point. However, ideas, no matter how compelling, do not give a book heart, and so the most affecting aspect of the story is the bond that develops between Earth-man Genly Ai and the Genthen Estraven. From original misunderstanding and distrust, they learn to trust and understand each other, despite their cultural differences. This friendship is truly poignant and well-wrought. While it is not an action-adventure book, and thus will disappoint anyone looking for extended action sequences (not Le Guin's forte), it's a deliberate, evocative book, and would be so judged by the standards of any genre."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I'll synthesize some thoughts I share with other reviewers, rather than discuss the plot or premise, which you can easily determine from the other reviews.This book is cold, cerebral, and clinical. Like the world it is set in, locked in perpetual winter, the pace is glacial, the characters are cool and detached. So much contemporary science fiction features the bling of the genre: technology, battles, space ships, laser guns, that type of thing. This book has absolutely none of that. Once I became accustomed to the nature of the book, I settled in and found a very deeply thought out, provocative, and, at the end, profoundly moving experience.It is certainly not for everyone. The characters are essentially unsympathetic and difficult to relate to. The plot is secondary to real point of the book: the reader must decipher the world and the characters through their own subjective narratives. One is left to one's own devices to create allegorical and other connections to our own social and political realities.One of the beauties of the work is the moving aesthetic experience that the author creates through the world, Winter, that the book is set in: the description of this world and the character's journey through it can draw the reader into a visceral and hypnotic mental state.The critical review reprinted under the listing is an excellent one: \\"science fiction for the thinking reader.\\" Adventurous and serious readers (be they science fiction fans or simply fans of great literature), will find a unique and challenging book here. Others may just be bored."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This extraordinary novel details the adventures of a young man, Genly Ai, sent as an envoy to try to convince the people of Winter (Gethen) to join the great concord of peoples and planets known as the Ekumen. Genly is sent alone because that is the custom--one Envoy at a time sent into a strange world to question, be questioned and perhaps killed. Then another Envoy goes out, infinitely, until the planet gives up its fears and welcomes contact.Genly first takes up his mission in the nation of Karhide, ruled by a mad king. He does not quite trust the king's minister and eventually takes his ambassadorship to the neighboring nation which is run on socialist lines. But he discovers that all news of his coming is censored in this second nation and eventually he is imprisoned.This is also the story of the king's minister, Estraven. Estraven, like all his people, is neither a man nor a woman but hermaphrodite, sexless until a season of \\"kemmering\\" calls forth courtship in a couple. Estraven, for reasons of the heart, is willing to sacrifice his honored position for this young man beyond the stars.LeGuin has created an astonishing world, full of complex politics and unusual philosophy. Sexuality shimmers beneath the reality of this gripping adventure. What if being man or woman is not a given but something that can change in a season? Everything we think of as human mutates. This is a classic of science fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Imagine a world in which sexual and gender identities are not fixed. Imagine a world where people are sexless for 90% of the time, and for the rest of the time may be either male or female, depending on the dynamics of the particular sexual relationship they are in at that time. And imagine all of this taking place in a world of perpetual snow and ice.This is the starting point for this intriguing piece of speculative fiction. The book obviously invites reflection on issues of sexual politics, but doesn't preach or push a message. It also explores themes of loyalty and betrayal, and the difficulty of telling friend from enemy. It's the sort of science fiction that uses imaginary worlds to illuminate the real world by contrast.It's a book that stays with you once you've finished it. The different ways in which the two central characters sacrifice themselves for one another are genuinely moving.4 stars, because it's not as good as the same author's &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. Otherwise I think it's the best of this author's &quot;Ekumen&quot; series."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I get cold just thinking about this book. Much of it is a description of trying to survive an incredibly long and harsh journey through endless miles of snow. The interesting ideas about politics and gender seemed brushed aside in favor of lengthy poetic descriptions of snow that even eskimos would find tiring. Better to read &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; or &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot; by LeGuin."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Gethen is a world of ice. Genly Ai was sent as an Envoy to persuade the planet to join the Ekumenical Legion of Known Worlds. But the people have no interest in membership, and the King of Karhide has taken his starship for observation and refuses to return it. Genly's guide to the city of Erhenrang, Estraven, was banished from Karhide for breaking the Gethenian honor code of shifgrethor by associating with Genly. The unfortunate Envoy soon found himself under scrutiny of the androgynes of Gethen as well as without an adequate guide to neither the city nor country. Genly fled to the region of Orgoreyn, then to the capital city of Mishnory, where he learned of an Orgota group called the Foretellers. He found someone to take him to them to ask them a question. When he arrived, they were reluctant to answer an alien, but he had become quite persuasive and they gave in. He asked if Gethen would join the Legion of Known Worlds within five Terran years and they answered yes. Heartened, he set out once more to return to Karhide and steal back his ship from the King, but he was captured by a shipping truck bound for a Voluntary farm called Pulefen. Estraven, who had been in hiding was employed at the farm, and soon found Genly and rescued him by pretending Genly was dead. To return to Karhide, they had to cross the Gobrin Ice Shelf. The pair made it, of course, and snuck into Erhenrang undercover. But one of their hosts learned of their true identities, and handed them over to the authorities. In a desperate attempt to escape, Estraven was killed by a Karhidish soldier's blast gun. To compensate, the King of Karhide accepted an audience from Genly, gave him his starship back, and was persuaded to join the Legion. Being a gentleman, Genly journeyed to Estre to meet with Estraven's father and son to restore his shifgrethor even after his death.The Left Hand of Darkness was a strange novel, but easily the absolute best science fiction book I've ever read.Ursula LeGuin's most famous novel was impossible for me to willingly put down. Granted, I was forced to stop reading it many times, but always reluctantly. There were so many twists to the story, like when Genly was taken to the voluntary farm, I had no clue Estraven worked there. I was sure Genly would stay there forever!LeGuin's eloquently phrased descriptions of kemmer and the Gethenian sexual cycle was oddly intriguing, but in some places slightly disturbing, as in the Foretelling when the Weaver began to glow and transformed into a female while all the others became male. That specific reference to a female leader is obvious proof of the author's feminist bias. As a girl, I don't take offense at that, but I believe that it's something that shouldn't have at all emerged in her novel.The Left Hand of Darkness was also slightly confusing, as the viewpoint would switch very frequently between Genly and Estraven, from the plains of Orgoreyn to the outskirts of Karhide in a single moment. I despise it when authors switch back and forth so often, and I guess in some cases it makes the story more intriguing and deepens the plot by showing both sides of the story, like an interrogation or a debate. Some of my favorite authors do the same thing, though, like in Brian Jacques' Redwall series. He has been known to have three or more stories going on at one time, and they all tie together somehow. I suppose it also makes the story come alive, as the view splits whenever the characters split, and comes together when the characters reunite.In conclusion, The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. LeGuin was a superb work of art (or science fiction, as the case may be). Be sure you have quite a bit of time to devote to this book, because once you pick it up, you won't put it down!-C. Edwards"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"With a few exceptions, I don't usually enjoy the usual science fiction books. But this one is different. If I had just seen the cover and the description on this page, it would have sounded like a horrible book. But the book is so much deeper than that. It brings up political, philosophical, and moral questions. This book is more about the nature of the human race than science fiction, disguised as a story about another planet. The story is addicting, the main character is easy to relate to, and the language is thoughtful and deep."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I've always been a great fan of science fiction and fantasy and Ursula Le Guin was one of the first authors I learned to love (after, of course, R. A. Salvatore) as a pre-teen, so I will admit my biases.I heard about this book, not from other fans of the genre, but in a college classroom. I was a freshmen and taking a Gender Studies course and I wrote a paper on a gender-bending speculative fiction piece. My prof suggested that, if I like that sort of thing, I should read The Left Hand of Darkness, the novel that pioneered the concept. The next summer, I picked up the book. I am so happy that I did! Le Guin does her best and she creates a world and characters that are incredibly real.Of course, there are some parts of the book that drag a bit - discussions of culture and custom that carried on when I wanted to see the characters doing and interacting. However, those same discussions became important later in the book, when I needed to know the cultural significance of certain actions that were integral to the plot. Everything, it seems, was put in the book for a reason. It is utterly brilliant."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"For a 10th grade reading assignment, a partner and I had to read Ursula Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness, and it was by far one of the most original and thought provocative science fiction novels I have ever read. The story narrates the experiences of Ai, a human male, who was cast upon a genderless planet of Gethen (Winter), to unite their plants with a galactic alliance called the \\"League of Planets\\". The things that I loved most about this book were the marvelous character, and the hidden themes and traits behind them. For example, the protagonist Ai name discloses his three roles in the narrative: as I, the narrator who sees all from his own restricted point of view; as Eye, the witness who learns to see into people and events; and as Ai, a cry of pain. The progress of the character is his expedition from I to Eye and at last to Ai, his concluding cr y of pain as he comes full circle to the discovery of self and depth of soul. This is one of the many brilliant themes Le Guin uses in the book. In all, the story was incredibly smart and really makes you think about things socially different, especially on the idea of gender classification. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the idea of sexual identity and classification, or anyone really who is interested in science fiction."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Hugo and Nebula Award-winning novel by Ursula K. Le Guin, The Left Hand Of Darkness, is rightfully among the all-time science fiction greats. This book does so many things so well, it's hard to find a place to start. Ms. Le Guin has incorporated themes of betrayal, equality, mythology, culture, and acceptance and tightly packed them into a magic school bus of a story. The Left Hand Of Darkness is not your typical science fiction work. Ursula Le Guin utilizes a relatively uneventful, impersonal plot as a vehicle for her astonishing story telling. Ms. Le Guin tells this story using a pattern in which she alternates from the two main characters' point of view as they embark on a journey across a harsh land. The book begins in a somewhat ominous tone and uses several sub-themes to distract from what is really happening. Ms. Le Guin establishes many of the fundamental issues and themes within the first few pages of the book and this helps to take away a little of the confusion in the first chapter. Ms. Le Guin kindly gives us a little background as to where and when the action is taking place, but she then quickly drops us into the story running. The story begins as our central character attends a parade in a large city that is beautifully described and bares a faint resemblance to cities in The Lord Of The Rings. The first 4 chapters alternate between myth and story, but this unique, interesting aspect actually only adds to the complexity of it all. Although the story is somewhat hard to follow throughout the first few chapters, it gets evolves into more simple, heart warming tale of two friends in an unfriendly land. The main character in this story, an Alien Envoy from Ekumen (an earth-like planet in a galaxy far far away), is on a mission to convince Gethen (the planet he's visiting) to join a union of planets. He always seems to know just a little bit more about this strange culture and language than we do. While some might see this as frustrating, it actually just fuels our curiosity, and by the end of the book, Genly Ai (the envoy) and the reader know the same amount of information about this strange culture. The distant planet Mr. Ai is visiting, Gethen (affectionately known as Winter), is an ice cube of a planet that suffers from the present ice age that seems more like perpetual winter. Ms. Le Guin decided that the people of Gethen would be ambisexual in an experiment to see what a utopia where men and women would literally be equal would really be like. This plays a major part in the book along with other issues surrounding a stranger entering a strange culture. This Gem of a book is a must read, even for non-science fiction readers."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The premise is startlingly original: Le Guin creates a world populated by hermaphroditic humans and then describes what might happen when individuals on this planet first encounter a lone representative from \\"normal\\" (dual sexual) human civilizations.Like the best science fiction novels, this one borrows heavily from other genres. The first two hundred pages read like a political/espionage thriller and then, surprisingly, the story turns into a tale of adventure and survival (clearly influenced by Jack London), as two fugitives cross the uninhabitable tundra of the planet of Gethen (or Winter). It is the last part of this book, I suspect, that some diehard SF readers find boring or disappointing; it could have easily taken place in our own Arctic zone. Rather than focus on how the people of Gethen as a whole might react to the arrival of alien beings (a la \\"Independence Day\\"), Le Guin concentrates on the plight of two individuals, and, quite believably I think, explores how they come to accept each other, even though they are from different worlds and of different sexualities.As Le Guin herself notes in the introduction, this book is not \\"extrapolative\\"; her fiction is not in the business of predicting the future. Instead, she invents a civilization that resembles our own, since, in many ways, we all are confusedly androgynous. As a result, she succeeds in creating a profoundly humane and deeply moving book."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula Le Guin's classic novel exploring the boundaries of gender centers on an Earthling visiting as an ambassador a planet where the inhabits are genderless, except for once a month during 'kemmering' where each individual becomes either female or male, without her/his own choice. In league with Marge Piercy's &quot;Woman on the Edge of Time&quot;, Monique Wittig's &quot;Les Guerilleres&quot;, and Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;, Le Guin's book cloaks an intelligent analysis of gender and sexual roles in a beguiling story set on another world, which is reminiscent of aspects of our own. Not only is the book captivating, but it's highly thought-provoking, which can't always be said for much science fiction."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I read this book as i was a HUGE fan of LeGuin's Earthsea Trillogy, i took a chance with this book as ordinarily i detest science fiction with its tedious laser battles and endless journeys through space. This book is very different. It features several themes brought up in the Earthsea trillogy but also features issues of sexuality, a topic that it deals with very well. It is brilliant theme, especially when one of the characters realises how awful it is to be judged merely by your character without relying on any of the quirks that come with your gender. Not so much sci-fi as an extremely well written, very touching and thought provoking piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This book is incredible. I'm impressed with how Le Guin says so much in so few words. Huge open door for a good sequel, though I'm not familiar with any. Read this for a good adventure into another world where a human becomes accepted and accepts the differences of an alien culture. I'm not sure of a better story for high school students. On the other hand, any book is better if you choose to read it yourself, and I highly recommend it. One of my co-workers is a complete homophobe, and he asked if he could borrow this when finished. Initially I hesitated (not saying why), but decided this book would do him (and anyone) a lot of good."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"It's hard to believe that this was released in 1969 - it is still as fresh, even urgent, as ever.This is science fiction for people who claim they don't like SF. It's literate, but most of all it's personal. There isn't much to the plot: an emissary (Genly Ai) from an interstellar exchange federation arrives on Winter after many millenia of isolation among the stars. Because of their brutal climate the natives are only just emerging from non-technological dark ages, and they have a hard time believing in interstellar travel and communication.Because of their unique history as a people, they have trouble believing in Ai. You see, he's male. All the time. His masculine identity never subsides, and never cycles to the feminine. That baffles the genial hermaphrodites of this world. They have an identifiable sex only every few weeks, and it's never sure which one will make itself known.The most striking feature about this profound difference in the people of Winter is how very little it matters. They are who they are, he is who he is, and that's good enough for them. The real point of the story is in the court intrigues, national politics, and daily interactions of the starman with these technological primitives. Since LeGuin wrote this when the Cold War was still hot, the characters of the two major nations are easy to predict, at least in their broad features.In the end, though, contact between worlds and nations is contact between people. And, although Ai has come light-years to make this contact, it is the native Estrevan who dedicates himself to making the contact succeed. LeGuin's not-men/not-women make it clear that the underlying, shared humanity is what has meaning, not the superficialities of world, nation, or even human gender.\\"The Left Hand of Darkness,\\" like any book, carries traces of the time in which it was written, including the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Like any great book, those traces also describe our time, though differently, and are part of what keep this book readable and relevant. I recommend this highly, and not just for SF fans.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Ursula LeGuin is without any doubts the greatest author in the world, but I was not into raptures about her book, for which she made a name for herself. Although my soul did not fly to the realms, where books like &quot;The Word for World is Forest&quot; and &quot;The Dispossesed&quot; are, I will tell you that I liked this book. I recommend it to those who like profund, philosophical science fiction, not to those who like action and excitement, since the story is over-uneventful and slow, but the planet Vinter, or according to the natives, Gethen is lovely described and the white, icy vast expanses and the imaginative feature of the androgynous people of Gethen should be enough for patient readers."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Picture LeGuin, a woman, writing in the character of a male human, trying to explain to an alien androgynous person what women are like! Yet, LeGuin portrays male characters as well or better than George Eliot is reputed to have done (in Middlemarch, for example). From the story's Creation myth to its tragic ending, I am still held breathless by the depth of LeGuin's characterization and the scope of her vision. For my money, she doesn't put out enough material."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Book Info: Genre: Science FictionReading Level: AdultRecommended for: Anyone, especially those interested in gender roles.Please Note: I picked up a used copy of this after reading Nataliya's review on Goodreads. A opinions are my own.Synopsis: Genly Ai is an emissary from the human galaxy to Winter, a lost, stray world. His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender - or both - this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.My Thoughts: This book is part of a series by Le Guin called the Hainish Cycle; these books can be read interdependently of one another.In the introduction to this book, the author says, \\"Science fiction is often described, and even defined, as extrapolative. The science fiction writer is supposed to take a trend or phenomenon of the here-and-now, purify and intensify it for dramatic effect, and extend it into the future... a prediction is made. Method and results much resemble those of a scientist... the outcome seems almost inevitably to be cancer... somewhere between the gradual extinction of human liberty and the total extinction of terrestrial life... Almost anything carried to its logical extreme becomes depressing, if not carcinogenic.\\" Her point is that she is telling a story, not extrapolating into the future - and she tells a story very well.Genly Ai is a fascinating character; he's so incredibly biased, but tries to maintain a presence among the people on Winter without letting them know how he really feels; watching him grow and change through the course of the book was a wonderful experience. On the other hand, I'm also fascinated by the King of Karhide who, upon learning there were thousands of other civilizations out there, instead of considering that his people were the odd ones, rather claims that they were the only normal ones and all those thousands of civilizations were full of aberrations and perverts. It's a fascinating study on how people consider themselves and only themselves to be the norm.I do wish some form of gender-neutral terminology had been created for this book. Having Genly call everyone \\"he\\" even if he considers some of them feminine is distracting. However, this is not, I am fairly certain, something that was really even considered when this book was written (1969) and it was probably quite a shocking and groundbreaking idea at the time.\\"Consider: Anyone can turn his hand to anything... The fact that everyone between seventeen and thirty-five or so is liable to be (as Nim put it) \`tied down to childbearing,' implies that no one is quite so thoroughly \`tied down' here as women elsewhere are likely to be... burden and privilege are shared out pretty equally, everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make. therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else.\\" A fascinating thought, and one that is dealt with in only an ancillary way throughout the course of the book, as are all other ideas being expressed by this text.Definitely an interesting book, a great story, wonderful world-building. I'm very happy that I was introduced to this book and took the chance to grab a copy when I had a gift certificate. I think this is an important book that should be study in gender-study classes at the university level; I think it is a book most everyone should read and spend some time thinking about."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"\\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" is the story of a man named Genly Ai, the first envoy from the Ekumen of Worlds to the icy planet of Gethen. The story follows the envoy on his mission: to commence diplomatic relations between the Ekumen and the Gethenians. His quest takes him through the nations of Karhide and Orgoreyn on Gethen.In Karhide, the people are welcoming and curious, but the ruler is wary of the Ekumen and worries that relations with aliens would decrease his own power. By contrast, Orgoreyn is a more secretive, repressive society where the envoy's existence are not made public. The political intrigue that the envoy gets caught up with in these two nations, and the contrast between the two nations is quite well-developed in this novel.Another big theme of the novel involves gender roles. The natives on Gethen are nonsexual except during certain periods when they are in \\"kemmer\\", or heat, and take on male or female characteristics for the purpose of mating. The envoy goes through a certain amount of difficulty to conceptualize a person without innate gender.On the whole, this novel was a very interesting read. The story has some gripping twists, and it deals with some weighty subjects in the process. Even 40 years after it was first published, the story does not really seem dated at all. I think its Nebula and Hugo awards are well deserved."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This science-fiction is amazing. The slow expanding union of all human species and families in the universe. Globalization at the scale of the cosmos. But systematically seen as dual, as contradictory, as not being able to be but contradictory, though certainly not antagonistic, and yet not far from it. \\"Finally Ai understands. To prove it he draws the yin-yang symbol of the double curve within the circle, the Taoist symbol of the coexistence of opposites. When Estraven does not understand this symbol, Ai demonstrates his understanding of the Gethenians' mind by being able to translate his Earth views into Gethenian understanding. He explains that the yin-yang symbol is the same idea as \\"light is the left hand of darkness\\" and as \\"Female, male. It is yourself, Therem. Both and one. A shadow on snow.\\"\\" (Analysis of Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand Of Darkness, Rebecca Rass, [...]) The contradiction is purely formal and in many ways evanescent and accidental, like a shadow on the snow, provided there is some sunshine to have a shadow in the first place. But in this case the anecdotic is more important than the ideological. We have here a planet known as Winter with several states, if not countries. The one chosen by the Ekumen of the universe for their expansion is Karhide. Then the story concentrates on the relation between the Prime Minister at the beginning of the story and the Envoy from that beginning to the integration of Winter in the Ekumen. The two men (if we can say so in the case of hermaphrodite Gethenians on Winter) are Lord Estraven and Genry Ai. It is a very precise and detailed study through these adventures of politics and the social organization behind these politics. Karhide is a rather democratic feudal monarchy, whereas the neighbor Orgoreyn is a collectivist communistic country controlled by a secret police. In the first state Lord Estraven is declared a traitor and banned. In the second state Envoy Ai is seen as a danger and sent to a prison farm to die working. The main part of the story is the escape of Envoy Ai with the help of Lord Estraven, and their flight from Orgoreyn back to Karhide across the polar ice of this cold planet. Le Guinn describes the differences, be they political or genetic and physical, with the delicacy and the precision of a surgeon, a social surgeon of course and her aim is to show that all evils can only stop or disappear when human beings decide to unite into one entity. Unity is able to make differences anecdotal and common aims the wardens of peace and tolerance. She is slightly optimistic though when she believes a totalitarian state can become democratic (at least a democratic feudal republican state) when the secret police is proved to be lying. It is slightly more complex, unluckily. The main charm of the book is the description of a planet that is so cold that ice and snow are nearly permanent everywhere. These extreme conditions provide a challenge to her characters and to us the readers. How can we imagine what it could be to cross from Canada to Siberia via the North Pole? There is a fair chance that very few people on earth may ever have the opportunity to do it, what's more with a hand sleigh, skis and a tent and nothing else, or nearly nothing else apart from rationed food. Extreme survival is an art and Le Guinn makes its description a literary art, though her hermaphrodite human beings with a locked and short period of sexual responsiveness, in a way like with sows, is funny but does not bring anything really except some innuendo about things we are not supposed to speak about in public.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is one of the most important books ever written, and it's only S.F.

Not man, or woman - but person.Look; you'll be entertained by this book. That's how she get's us to read her stuff.

The change of perspectives throughout the novel at first seemed curious, but worked perfectly as the engrossing story proceeds. The story and the central odyssey of the novel will linger with me for some time."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"So the book is set on another planet with a different culture to what the 'humans' are used to, but that aside it is really about politics and personal relationships. This could easily have been written about a European living with the early discovery of native Americans.Criticisms first:- why the obsession with the planet's calendar? So it snows a lot. Do we need to know for each day of each month of each year how much it snows?- The gender non-specific aliens come across as very male oriented.- Some inconsistencies such as Genly is called Genry by the aliens because they do not pronounce the letter 'l' well. Yet they have no problem pronouncing the letter 'l' in other words.It starts slow and a little uninteresting. I wondered if I was going to have to plow through 500(?) pages of description about another civilization, its politics and its culture, but once the exile occurs things start happening. The final third of the book is riveting even though it is almost entirely devoted to the relationship between the 2 main characters.Give it a chance. It starts slow, but picks up pace as it progresses."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Being an honors lit. student thu high scool and college, I am no stranger to classic lit. My taste is sophisticated, but after 6 chapters of this book, I am putting it away. I find the use of made up language difficult to interpret, the jumping from old folklore stories on the planet and the tale being told distracting and scattered. There is no depth of character or feeling coming thu. I have stuck with other books that get off to a slow start, but after reading Joan D. Vinge's Snow Queen I can not imagine how this book won any kind of an award. I am sorry I wasted the money."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I've read a lot of scifi, fantasy, etc but this has got to the about the biggest waste of time that I've experienced in a long time. Single dimensional characters, plot that crawls along, just really boring. I ended up not caring if any of the characters survived.Don't waste your time, try Joanne Bertin or Melaine Rawn or Mercedes Lackey, Anne McCaffrey or even MZ Bradley."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have never read such a poor Sci-Fi book in my life, I don't know what planet most of the other reviewers are on. The book was badly written around a very weak plot. Absolutely no charaterisation at all, dull dull dull. I lost all faith in the Hugo awards after reading this trash."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I was just forced to read this book for a class. It was assigned under the false pretenses that my classmates and I would take away some kind of meaning from it about notions of gender and sexuality. By the end of the first half, I wanted to hurl this book out the window.My understanding of LeGuin's groundbreaking so-called genderless society is that they A) are all sterile or suffering from mental defect as humans born with chromosomal problems (which these people must suffer from since humans that are not XX or XY tend to have many problems.) B) have all since died of heart disease or other obesity related illness since all they seem to do is eat all day and live on a planet where outdoor activity seems to just about kill everyone. C) overrun the planet with an excess population since according to the author nearly everyone gets pregnant at one point or another, making that many more people capable of gestating. D) in their sexually recptive constantly due to pheremones in the air.The characters are bull-headed and completely unlikable. When Ai and Estraven crossed the Ice, I wanted them to freeze to death already just to put me out of my misery. The prose is choppy and shift between narrators without any notice making it rather difficult to figure out just what is going on.I the end I have to say that I understand why this book won the awards that it did when it did (1969) but is by no means a well written book or likable story. The author only deserves credit for having the gal to pose some issues to society. I just wish she could write, making such assignments easier to bear.Hopefully all of the professors who grew up on this drivel in the 1960's will re-read things like this before assigning them and realize that what was great then just isn't now, or in the case of \\"Darkness\\" never was."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Considering this book won both a Hugo and a Nebula, it's hard to believe how bad it really is. You could make a case for this being the worst novel to ever win these two awards. The award selection committee must have been on drugs when they chose this one. The novel is dull, boring, unimaginative, and goes nowhere, at least nowhere interesting. The author should have gone into anthropology like her great father. Maybe she would have been better at it, because the culture she has created in this book is uninteresting, unbelieveable, and sounds like the more dismal parts of New Jersey anyway. A good candidate for the first sci-fi book burning, since it's not even worth the paper it's printed on, and maybe it would keep someone warmer than the people in this frozen world. Give this frigid story the cold shoulder."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"A small, yet ponderous book. I'm near the end and I find the long trek to Estraven's homeland torturous reading. I'm impressed by the world and the culture the author has designed. What she has done intrigues me more than the story itself. I keep picturing the black Vulcan from the latest Star Trek series as Ai, except Ai as written is prone to be impulsive now and then. Can't say I'd read any more of her books. My reading through this one is slow-going. I can't speed through the writing because it is somewhat stilted and unpredictable. I do, however, recognize it as a classic."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 years old and though I liked it, I didn't understand it. When I was a bit older, I read it again and was simply amazed by the levels of abstraction and thought that were attained in this novel. It is an amazing critique on what motivates us as people, and understanding &quot;human&quot; differences."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I have been reading SF since I was about 10 years old and somehow missed this one. My mother tried for years to convince me to read it and for some reason I resisted. When I finally started it, I couldn't stop. I read it in one single sitting, then reread it a few days later. And I still haven't given it back!I think that Le Guin has written most convincingly about a world of true hermaphrodites and the culture that would spring up from their differences. This book is justly considered a science fiction classic and should be considered an overall classic."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Gender-bending is a frequent ingredient in speculative fiction, and The Left Hand of Darkness is, in my opinion, a masterpiece of this theme. It alters the distinctions between feminine and masculine, of course, but also illuminates all human relationships and interactions. Venus Plus X, by Theodore Sturgeon, deals with the same issues but in a more science-fictional, less lyrical way"},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"I had been meaning for some time to read Le Guin, and picked this book as a starter. It did not live up to my expectations.Let me start with the good. It IS quite an impressive exercise in world-building, and Winter is an impressive, completely realized setting. The strongest parts of the book are the descriptions of the two great societies of the planet, Karhide (provincial/monarchial/parliamentary) and Orgoreyn (communist/beaurocratic). Le Guin is adept at exposing the irrationality and inhumanity of both societies without being doctrinaire. Her discussions of patriotism, loyalty, and friendship--mostly through the great character of Estraven--are compelling and deep.Now for the dissapointing. While the setting and secondary character, Estraven, are strong and fully realized, the actual plot and main character (and narrative voice), Genly Ai, are somewhat droll. Many aspects of the plot--including the main one, a journey across a vast glacier--are excuses for Ai/Le Guin to meditate on the roles of gender in the hermaphoditic Gethen race, and these themselves are humdrum. Oh, men are aggressive and prone to nationalism? Women sometimes don't say what they mean? Sexuality influences our thoughts and actions? Who woulda thunk it?Le Guin is a virtuoso writer, as shown when she steps into the voice of Estraven and is subtle and statesmanlike in writing and thought. However, her chosen voice and subject matter, which occasionally subjugate the plot, bring the novel down a few notches."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Well, after having read here the reviews written about Ursula Le Guin's 1969 THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS, I was a little puzzled. &quot; Hate it &quot; or &quot; Worship it &quot; were the only alternatives ! I must confess that this book didn't create in me such passionate feelings. This novel, in my opinion, is an above average science-fiction book but doesn't deserve so much praise nor so much hate.Descriptions of the arctic deserts of Gethen and of the different cities of the planet are well written and made me believe in this strange world. If one excepts the special sexual status of its inhabitants and its urban architecture, Gethen is not so strange for the common Earthly reader. That is the reason why we care a lot about the love-friendship story of the two main characters which is the principal plot of the novel. But THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS is way too short in pages and in analysis to be considered as a masterpiece.A book to read. Once."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"When I read The Left Hand Of Darkness shortly after it was first published, I was delighted and amazed. Even though this is a dark story that ends in tragedy, Le Guin's masterful narrative compelled me to read it through in a single sitting. When I was done, I was left with a sense of loss for having finished. As a trained social scientist, I was fascinated by a whole culture and society shaped by androgeny. As a human being, I was appalled by the prejudice and stupidity that only too clearly mirrored what I saw in the contemporary world around me.This is a classic, a wonderful study in character and a biting commentary on human society, all told in elegant style. It is not for the fainthearted, but it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"This is a very good sci-fi book that explores some anthropology based speculations. Ursula K Le Guin is a top notch sci-fi/fantasy author, and I think that this is an exemplary novel. You should definately pick it up and check it out."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"Brilliant and moving - a science fiction classic. The relationship between the two protaganists is fascinating, and personally, I thought the cold, snowy atmosphere was wonderfully conjured."},{"Title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","review":"The Left Hand of Darkness is one of the true classics of science fiction of all time and with good reason. It should not be passed up. A man is sent alone to make contact on a distant planet with individuals who, at different times, can be man or woman. He becomes embroiled in conflicts between individuals and conflicts between nations. This takes place in a &quot;slower than light-speed travel&quot; technology . This, plus the cold climate of the planet &quot;Winter&quot; plus the profound physiologic differences between him and Winters population serve to enhance the picture of his being alone and on his own.I encourage everyone not to miss the opportunity to read this fine story!"},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"This is a nice introduction to Civil War history. The author does not take sides which is refreshing since a bias is often evident in Civil war books. Between narratives of movements and battles are several short essays about the cause of the war, the economies of the respective nations, and analysis of military doctrine of the period.The author does a bit of analysis of the key characters and its interesting to see a foreigner's take on the war (Stokesbury is Canadian). One criticism is that the battle descriptions are so short that it is easy to get confused about what took place in the action, and whole complex campaigns can be glossed over. To be fair, this is difficult to avoid in a &quot;short&quot; history of such a protracted war.The writing is good and some of it stands out (the last paragraph of the book gave me goosebumps). This is a good primer on the Civil war and is recommended."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"I bought this book for a nice summary, but not too detailed summary of the Civil War....and thats exactly what I got. Professor Stokesbury writes this wonderful, well researched book on one the most key points in our history. After reading this book I have a new outlook on how close we were to becoming two nations. Each key battle is cleary and methodically discussed, along with some of the stuff outside the battlelines. He is very objective, not favoring either side, and explains the causes of the start and the final collapse of the Confederacy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a quick, easy-read summary of the Civil War, or to a history buff."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"James L. Stokesbury was a professor of history at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. He has written numerous short histories of some of the most important wars of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.In this book on the Civil War, Stokesbury takes a vast amount of information (over 50,000 books have been published on the subject) and condenses it into a slim book of just over 300 pages. He covers the broad horizon of this period in a meaningful and entertaining way. Of course, sacrifices must be made. Some of the battle narratives are confusing in their shortened form, but the ebb and flow of the campaigns are accurately portrayed.Stokesbury's account is remarkably objective generally; however, every Civil War buff has his own opinions about the best and worst of the generals. Stokesbury makes no attempt to hide his feelings about his candidates for the worst.Many of the trivial details a typical soldier's life are incorporated in the narrative. Also covered are some of the economic, social, and political events which shaped the course of the war.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about this pivotal point in our history but doesn't have the time to commit to some of the larger tomes."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"There are a number of one volume histories dealing with the American Civil War, but this is one of the best I've read. It consists of about 330 pages of narrative published in a very readable text design. Within this limited amount of space the author does an admirable job of covering such a sprawling topic. Descriptions of the major military campaigns are balanced with sections explaining changes that occurred in the political, economic, and social landscape. The often neglected war in the western portion of the Confederacy is well-covered. Although the historical personages who cross this bloody stage must be rendered in brief strokes, they are handled deftly enough so one gets some feeling for their characters and their roles. Author James L. Stokesbury dispenses personal observations that are at some points droll and at others fully reflective of the tragedy of the war. Certainly there are aspects of mid-19th Century American life not given full scrutiny, including slavery itself. But this is, after all, a self-described short history. I would strongly recommend \\"A Short History of the Civil War\\" as an introductory text for casual readers and students. I'd further suggest that even more serious minded researchers can benefit from reading what I find to be a model of concise, balanced, yet compelling historical narrative."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"I blundered on this book in the stacks at the local library. After an introduction to the civil war via the Shaara novels, my wife and I have been reading some histories of specific battles and some biographies of individual leaders. We felt the need for a general survey of the war to tie it all together, but we did not want to devote the time to a comprehensive history. This book filled the bill perfectly.Stokesbury has an extremely fluid and readable prose style that is simply a joy to read. I assume that his facts are reasonably accurate. To me, he seems to devote just the right amount of attention to the various battles, individuals, issues, etc., though he leaves enough unsaid to stimulate further reading. He certainly does have his opinions, which he expresses sometimes with a delightful sarcasm. And he imparts some of the flavor of what it must have felt like to fight or have a loved one fighting in this war, which literally tore America apart in more ways than one. Tears came to my eyes as I read the details of the surrender at Appomattox, a testament both to the extreme emotions of the war, even after more than a century, and to Stokesbury's narrative powers.The only real weak point of the book for me was the maps, which are not cited in the text and do little to assist the reader in visualizing troop deployments, battle maneuvers, etc."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"The new student of history will find a competent, intelligent and well organized work, while the experienced Civil War scholar will find a Bruce-Catton style, folksy-but-intelligent and well written study."},{"Title":"A Short History of the Civil War","review":"mostly a chronological list of the battles with some background.

The children's very favorite book during these storytimes - every year - has been Chili Chili Chin Chin by Belle Yang. This book flies off our library shelves with a long reservation list for it at all times.To read one-on-one with your favorite child, Chili Chili Chin Chin is a feast to the eyes with colorful illustrations, each one a work of art. You can't help falling in love with Chili Chili Chin Chin, a donkey with a mind of his own. I found it to be a pure, innocent, yet deep story of a loving friendship between a little boy and his donkey. Lessons of kindness and acceptance are just under the surface of this fun book that is a quick read and will definitely be a number one bedtime story choice of all kids who experience it. \\"Read it just one more time,\\" should be expected by all parents.As a book to read to a group of children, it is perfect. The story is fun (watch out, don't get on the wrong side of Chili Chili Chin Chin!); the children are gleeful when Chili sticks up for himself. The repetition is fabulous for youngsters. They learn the phrases quickly and feel good about themselves, participating happily with every page. The bright artwork captivates children in even the largest groups, and Chili is just adorable. We've used bells with this story and have used this book as a catalyst for introducing Chinese culture to even our youngest preschoolers. This book fits perfectly with a multitude of themes including friendship, pets, multicultural stories, animals, China, favorite books,etc. For anyone conducting storytimes of any sort, I highly recommend Chili Chili Chin Chin.My babies are nearly grown now, but I bought this book for future grandchildren. It is one they will love and will remember. And it is one you will be happy to read again and agin. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"No wonder he won the Nobel Prize! Four hauntingly magnificent short stories, all but the third with death as the end. Or maybe not the end, but the raison d'etre of the story. \\"The Gentleman from San Francisco\\" almost half the book, translated rather badly, I suspect, in the version I read, by D. H. Lawrence; \\"Gentle Breathing\\", an incredibly subtle story; \\"Kasimir Stanislavatch\\", and \\"Son\\". In each, he takes the human tragedy and contrasts it with beautiful nature. His detail is remarkable. The stories are all short, plots not intricate or even eventful, but he manages to make each one simply live and breathe and have being. It rather reminds me of all Russian writers; they're all so tragic. What is it about being a Russian? And nobody remembers him as they do Chekhov, or Tolstoy. I wonder why. Perhaps his volume of writing was not large enough."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"Ivan Bunin's one major message is Horace's Carpe Diem. You should \`enjoy your life, because you're earlier dead than you think.' \`Even today people still marvel above all else at death and refuse to accept it.'One of the characters in this book expresses it also as follows: \`I'm suffering from a fatal disease. And I assure you that I go on living as if there were nothing the matter.' (\`At Sea, at Night')How should you enjoy yourself? By the prime of love (\`Late Hour'), and one of its ingredients, sex: \`When you love someone no power on earth can make you believe that you may not be loved in return.' But this love can also be violent (\`The Riverside Tavern').Sex is enjoyed in furtive encounters with \`the shamelessness of the purest innocence' (\`Zoyka and Valeria'), lonely women on a journey (\`Sunstroke', \`Visiting Cards') or plain adultery (\`The Caucasus'). Ivan Bunin's eroticism is outspoken. He enjoys all parts of the female body.Those who cannot enjoy life, those who don't master the art of love, those who cannot accept that love sometimes dies (\`Mitya's Love'), those who cannot overcome the death of a loved one and those who go to war (\`A cold Mountain'), are doomed.Also doomed are the \`Modern Men' with their stupid arrogance, like \`The Gentleman of San Francisco', who forgot to live.The longest story in this bundle is \`Mitya's Love', Bunin's version of Goethe's Werther combined with elements of Tolstoy's \`The Devil'. Mitya is Bunin's anti-hero because he cannot overcome an unanswered love. However, the story is not totally convincing. It is too long and the introduction of the sexual element is rather forced.This book is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"I'm glad I returned to Ivan Bunin, whom I had not read since my early teens. Although some 25 years have passed, I could soon recognize the refined, poetic, and quiet style of this Russian author. This collection of 17 short stories, of assorted subjects and tonalities, includes several very remarkable ones. Among them is the story that gives the book its title, which tells of a nouveau riche's fatal family travel around the Mediteranean. Others are: \\"The Primer of Love\\", located in a remote Russian town, about the discovey of a peculiar book in the house of a recently deceased man; \\"Chang's Dreams\\", about a retired and alcoholic ship captain and his dog; \\"Mitya's Love\\", almost a short novel, a \\"slit your veins\\" tale of adolescent love and all the pain it may entail, as well as about the possible fatal consequences that the insecurities of young passion may cause. In the whole book in general, but noticeably in this story, Bunin's capacity for description, especially of a Nature in perpetual change, shines in astonishing and beautiful paragraphs. Sexual anxiety and the abrupt waking-up to carnal passion are constantly present during the narration.\\"Night\\" is, in my opinion, a small masterpiece, actually more a prose poem than a tale, the reflections of an artist as he contemplates the sea from a terrace, on a placid night. It might just be the transcription of Bunin's own thoughts. Finally, \\"Zoyka and Valeria\\" is another stroy about juvenile love, with a countryside weekend as landscpae and another sexual initiation as detonator.Certainly a great storyteller, Bunin has a fine, deceitful style: in spite of the apparent placidity and poetic beauty of the tales, these frequently treat asphyxiating, unnerving situations. Excellent edition of great stories."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"Bunin is one of the most brilliant Russian writers of the early 20th century. His short stories express more in a couple of pages than most novels do in hundreds. It is poetry in prose."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"Ivan Bunin is a great writer. And as for the readers, reading his stories and enjoying them are a mark of achievement. As you read his stories fierce chill pierces through you simultaneously as grand pictures fill your imaginations."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"In the meditation entitled \\"Night,\\" Bunin's unnamed narrator says: \\"Why did God choose to brand me so deeply with wonderment, thought and \`wisdom', and why is that fatal mark constantly growing inside me?\\" Although the voice is abstract, I think it works as a description of Bunin himself. He wasbclearly a man with (again in his own words) \\"the capacity to feel with a singular intensity ... not only their own identities but those of other people....\\" And although he may feel that his capacity is somehow unusual, he does a remarkable job of imagining (or is it projection?) that capacity in others. Everybody, he says somewhere (although I can't put my finger on it), has a story that deserves to be told.In his introduction, David Richards calls Bunin \\"egocentric.\\" In context I think I know what it means, but it's an odd choice of words and I suspect misleading. Conceded that Bunin is not a \\"social\\" novelist in the sense that Tolstoi is, nor a dramatist like Dostoevsky: his metier is, indeed, the minute attention to feelings. In some sense I suppose these feelings are \\"his own,\\" but in some sense, every artist's feelings are \\"his own.\\" Perhaps closer to the mark to suggest that at some level every one of us is an egocentric, and that Bunin may be able to capture the egocentricity in all of us.Caution: Bunin won a Nobel Prize, but don't be misled into disappointment. He's a fine and rewarding writer, but not better than several others who did not win the prize, the award of which inevitably has more to do with politics than with intrinsic merit."},{"Title":"The gentleman from San Francisco,: And other stories","review":"I ordered this for my bookclub.

This is quite unfortunate as the number of African-Americans to proudly and honorably serve the US armed forces in the Second World War was not trivial. Nor was their contribution to the Allied war effort trivial. While most African-Americans served in service and support units in the segregated US services of the 1930-40's, there were a small number of all African-American combat units, and by the end of the war a few integrated units (although integration occurred on a platoon rather than individual basis as occurred with white soldiers), that served with equal, if not greater, distinction to all white units. Fortunately for all Americans the past few years have brought a number of historiographies of the contributions of African-American soldiers to the Allied victory in WWII, both in Europe and Asia. \`Patton's Panthers: The African-American 761st Tank Battalion in World War II' by Charles W. Sasser is a solid contribution to this growing literature that anyone interested in WWII and/or issues of segregation/race relations in the middle of the 20th Century should pick up.Not only does \`Patton's Panthers' deal with a historical issue worthy of coverage but it does so with flair. Sasser's writing style is quite easy to follow and he presents material with literary flavor. While this makes the reading fun and informative at the same time, much in the same way Stephen Ambrose, John Keeghan, Cornelius Ryan, and John Toland's works function, Sasser's style goes a bit beyond that of the aforementioned authors. Two aspects of Sasser's approach to \`Patton's Panthers' are particularly noteworthy in this context:First, it may take authors a while to get used to the \`frank' language Sasser uses to present the stories. Not only are curse words frequent, but also political correctness is often left in the editing room. Sasser rarely refers to the soldiers at the center of the story as African-Americans but rather Negroes. It is not entirely clear that Sasser did not do this in fact for visceral impact - most culturally-enlightened individuals prefer to use African-American as a term to denote people of color - since the first half of the book is peppered with Negro and Negroes, while in the latter half use of this more derogatory term becomes much less frequent. This reviewer certainly recoiled at the free use of the term Negro(es), but right or wrong this approach did help to highlight emotionally the more important issues of bigotry and discrimination that these warriors experienced. Somehow by being more \`politically incorrect' Sasser may have actually been able to drive home more clearly the morally correct issue of race tolerance and brotherhood that we should all strive for.The second aspect of Sasser's writing approach that stood out to this reviewer was the way in which nearly all the \`recollections' of the African-American soldiers presented read like a stereotypical screen play of uneducated son's of poor southern African-American sharecroppers. Again this seems to have been done for \`affect' as Sasser states very clearly in his \`Author's Notes': \\"...I have had to rely on numerous sources to fill gaps left by memory and official record. Also, using my own knowledge and experience with war and men at war, I have had to improvise and to necessarily re-create scenes and dialog in certain instances...I strive to match personalities with the situation and the action while maintaining factual content.\\" Either a majority of African-American soldiers in the 761st actually spoke the way Sasser wrote their dialog or other authors who have recounted the exploits of the 761st, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Joe Wilson Jr. (both African-Americans themselves, the latter's father was in the 761st), have excessively \`cleaned up' the dialog. It is likely that reality is somewhere in between. Yet this reviewer believes that latter two authors' recounting of combat dialog and reminiscences are probably more representative and that Sasser's self-admitted alteration was done for affect. Please do not read into either of these criticisms anything prejudice on the part of Sasser. This reviewer feels that Sasser has approached this topic fairly and thoroughly, and deserves credit for bringing to light (again) the exploits of these brave soldiers who have been forgotten, even denied, by their countrymen. Rather the reader should simply be aware that Sasser's writing style has potentially taken wide liberty to pull the reader into the story and human drama by drawing on stereotypes and visceral hot buttons.All in all \`Patton's Panther's a solid historical piece of work that is also a thoroughly enjoyable read. The bonus a reader gets is a rich human story of the contrasts between the lives of bigotry and inequality these African-American men lived in the United States before and after the war versus the equally scary, sacrificial, and heroic lives they shared with their white brethren in combat in NW Europe. 4.5 Stars!"},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"Patton's Panthers covers a segment of the oft neglected roles of Black combat troops in WWII. These men often fought a two front war against German bullets and American prejudice.Unfortunately, this book does make some glaring errors. For one, it perpetuates the false claim that German tanks were powered by diesel engines when, in fact, they used gasoline just like American tanks. The author also seems to imply that all German Tiger tanks were armed with 128mm guns (only the very rare jagdTigers were so armed). The old bit of Shermans burning when hit it also beat to death when in fact the 761st were equipped with Shermans using wet stowage. The chances of such Shermans burning were actually quite low. There is also a story of a sergeant firing his .50 caliber machinegun from the hip--personally I would like to meet the man could fire a .50 from the hip (perhaps the auther meant a .30?, which is attested to in many accounts). The author also spends a lot of time with the love story of the battalion's CO and a nurse (the CO was wounded and not present with the battalion until the near the end of the war).Patton's Panthers is not so much a military history as a social history. Individual stories are the strong point of this book as the men speak of their fears, courage, desires and, of course, racism. The author points out that the white officers with the battalion also had to face contempt and abuse for being part of a Black unit. The story of the ill-fated Sergeant Rivers is both compelling in his courage and commitment. The abuse the men faced by their own army is broken up with touching acts of Blacks and Whites saving one another or dying in the attempt. The court martial of Jackie Robinson is a fine touch for the book. The book's ending offers one a glimmer of hope. A wonderful touch is at the end of those chapters where Panthers gave their lives, the author lists their names in honor of their memories. Very few writers bother to do so.Read Patton's Panthers for its social value."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"Patton's Panthers by Sasser is an inspiring story about a group of African American soldiers in World War II, who despite their disadvantaged positions fought bravely for their country which at the time hardly recognized or appreciated their services. In battle, these dedicated soldiers had to confront the Nazi and Fascist armies as well as the racist attitudes of some white officers who were sometimes responsible for the battalion going into combat without all the necessary equipment or training.This belated tribute and public recognition comes as a soothing acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by the Tank Battalion in World War II , which is the first African-American armored unit to enter combat and holds one of the few records of continuous unbroken service during the war, spear-heading Gen. George Patton's drives. They captured 30 towns and liberated concentration camps, and gave the African American soldiers an honorable place in the US army. Patton's Panthers, Disciples of Fortune, The Key to Rebecca are the books I enjoyed last month. I like stories with the touch of that historical era."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"Sasser provides an inspiring tale of duty and sacrifice. By a group of soldiers for a nation that barely knew or appreciated their devotion.Some other groups of Negro combatants in World War 2 have been fairly well known. Like the Tuskegee pilots. But few readers might have hitherto known of this accomplished tank battalion.Sasser writes of a thankfully different America. The casual and pervasive racism described in page after page is now mostly history. What some readers might find especially infuriating is some of the descriptions of the combat experiences in Europe. Where racist attitudes amongst white officers often caused the battalion to enter combat with less equipment or training than white units.The book is timely, and long overdue. Many of the soldiers who served in the battalion have died. The book gives them and the survivors some belated public recognition."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"Patton's Panthers by Charles Sasser is a good book about the African-American 761st Tank Battalion that fought in World War II. I also read Brothers In Arms by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar which covered the same subject matter and found this book to be much easier to follow. The book takes us from training up to the end of the war, and the only constant during this entire time was the way these fine men were treated by many of their fellow soldiers, nurses who were supposed to care for them, fellow citizens, and many of the commanding officers of the Army. Even the mainstream press of the day would bypass the 761st in order to write about only white soldiers in their stories. With that background, it is understandable, although extremely unfortunate that the men of the 761st had to wait so long to be recognized for what they did, and how well they did it. They fought hard and long and did everything that was asked of them and more, yet were still treated like second class citizens by many. A prime example of this was when one of the men of the 761st, upon arriving home with a chest full of medals, and despite all that he had been through, was still told by the driver to move to the back of the bus. This is a book that should be read by all. The only shortcomings were two obvious historical inaccuracies. The first one has Lt. General Leslie McNair being killed by the Germans when he was killed by friendly fire. The second one has General Patton carrying pearl-handled pistols. His pistols were ivory-handled."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"I've been reading a lot of books about WWII lately, by Stephen Ambrose (Citizen Soldiers), James Bradley (Flags of our Fathers), etc. Patton's Panthers by Charles Sasser fits well in this genre of writting. Sasser has done an excellent job making a book that's very interesting to read. He has done extensive research and then taken that research and compiled it into a narrative well worth reading. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"After seeing the movie \\"RED TAILS,\\" I wanted to learn more about the role of blacks in the military.

It's not like most history books in that it has a fair amount of dialogue. If you want a historical book that explains events from a global point of view, then this probably isn't for you.

The wisdom in the off-hand in combat comments of the \\"common\\" citizen soldier far exceeds the hash cranked out by most scholars of war. Anyone who has ever worn the uniform will recognize the attitudes and scenes, time and place altered.This is a WWII oral history which does not romanticize war or minimize the faults of our own nation. The heroism of these men was extraordinary. The feats of courage described so frankly and brutally were those of realistic men not motivated by propaganda or careerism.One can only wonder how much those racial attitudes persist today, though there is no doubt that what does remain inside our forces has been pushed deeper below the surface. On the other hand, substitute \\"haji\\" for \\"negra\\" and follow today's soldiers [of any race] around for a few moments to discover that our latent racial bias always finds some way to push back to the surface. Some would no doubt argue that this is part of a necessary process of dehumanizing the enemy to enable our young soldiers to kill. Only 60 years have passed; one wonders if we have really changed our nature so much that we are qualified to \\"train\\" the Iraqis and Afghans how to bridge their own ethnic and tribal divides. Go to our Southwest Asian bases today, and watch the long lines of \\"host country\\" nationals filing past us every morning and afternoon, not a glance or a word exchanged between us. One of the men in \\"Patton's Panthers\\" noted that the only time the black man was sent to the front of anything, bus, train, or battle, was when the white man did not want to be there. Our allies of today cannot help but feel the same way, I suppose. Plenty of bias, both racial and religious, on both sides of today's war, perhaps more than usual."},{"Title":"Pattons Panthers the 761ST Tank Battalio","review":"This one of the most inspiring stories I have ever read about WWII, and I have been reading about and watching WWII documentries for over 30 years. It is a shame the USA was so bigoted at the time to ommit an important part of WWII history. I had never heard about this group until recently. The story of these honorable brave men need to be added to our current history books if it has not been already. I am hoping to find other books to read about these fine men.

SO what are you waiting for hurry and read it!"},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"I have read this book at least six times, and it still captivates me that the author kept such a close feel on the character, Mary. Ms.Lenski took her imagination to the extreem. I believe that she took into herself the emotions and the heart of Mary and used it to her advantage. The whole setting of the book and especially the other characters in it make it a wonderful experience and it sends a feeling inside me that nastalgia seems too small a word to speak. It reminds me of where I lived as a child, and the person, Mary, sounds so much like I was. She talked like she knew much more than her age should alow her to. She spoke with clarvoyance and dignity that many other characters did not have. She learned the language of the Indians quickly and learned their culture with no complaint. I only wish Ms. Lenski would write more about Mary Jemison. I want to know what happened to the girl who did not return to her people when she had the chance. This book has changed my outlook on books. I read it for the first time in the fifth grade, and it touched me in such a way I cannot describe. I love how Ms. Lenski put her descriptions into words. I can never seem to do it exactly how I plan. I am currently writing two books, neither of which would, or could compare to Indian Captive. I only hope that my books will get published and appreciated like this one. I am sorry that I made this so long, but like I said, I can never really quite put into words exactly what I want to say.

Mary Jemison was 12 years old when taken from her family's farm in Eastern Pennsylvania on a spring day in 1758 by a band of Indian warriors. Mary was separated from her parents and her sisters and brothers on that day. The Indians made her travel to a Seneca village on the Genesee River and this is where all the adventure begins. I really admired the character Mary Jemison, also known as Corn Tassel, an Indian name given to her by the Senecas because of her pretty yellow hair. Mary was strong, brave and very smart. She adapted to the Indian ways in order to survive.One of my favorite parts of the book was that Mary never forgot the advice that her mother gave her or her family.

What inspired me to read it was my Aunt, who's part Indian and is into the culture. I started reading the book expecting something like a history lecture, and finihsed it off feeling enlightened not regretting a thing!! I know what piece of Indian culture I took in is nothing compareed to the real thing, but it is so amazing to learn of how these poeple lived, and how benign and simple to life their culture is. What kept me even more interested was to learn how the little girl that got captured by them took it. She was the all-american-colonial girl, unwilling to new ideas, and came out a wise and educated, further than any college degree can teake you -woman. Experiencing each step of her journey along the way, and recognizing her growth next to mine, her journey can be compared to the analogy of a little child going out into the \\"big world\\" in his/her own.

But on a Spring day in 1758, her family is taken captive by Indians and her life is never the same again. It's bad enough to be taken captive by Indians, but even worse to be separated from her family forever. This book is a Newberry Honor book, which certainly deserves the honor. Indian Captive tells about a captivity, a relationship, and a girl who finds a new family. This is a heart warming book, that will bring you closer to your family than ever."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"Indian Captive is a great book but a little sad.

It was really cool as she began to understand. I thought it was extremely boring when the book spent chapters explaining how they did something. It was really sad when she was taken from her family. I pity her.Although this book did have some mildly interesting parts, it was overall very boring; so do not read it unless you don't have any other choice. This book was extremely tedious.

I understand Mary Jemison's story is about a real life occurrence (with certain liberties taken due to the reading level set for this book), but I still didn't get involved with the story or love the character. I usually end up rooting for the character, no matter what choices they make. However, the author didn't get me as involved as I'd have liked. I'd have liked more detail and more background than just the same thing over and over.Some may like it, but this didn't do it for me.

If you are interested in Indian history, this book was a non-fiction account of a captive white girl and what she experienced as a captive. It was well written and kept your interest through out the book."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"I have enjoyed Lois Lenski's books since I was a girl back in the 50's, but this is one of her best. Based on a true life narrative, INDIAN CAPTIVE chronicles the psychological journey from white girl to a young Seneca woman. In fact Mary Jemison (kidnapped at 15) became known, respected and loved as the White Woman of the Genesee. Lenski recreates her struggle to maintain her English heritage in the face of Native American beliefs and traditions--all depicted honestly, fairly, without bias to either side in this 18th century culture-clash.Lenski devotes much time to research each of her books--usually about a different rural area of America. Her excellent b/w illustrations enhance our reading enjoyment and appreciation for the material culture of the Senecas--one of the Five Nations under the Iroquois banner.During her first two years of captivity (as a replacement for a dead clansman), Molly recalls her parents' last words to her when she and a neighbor boy were given moccasins and roughly marched off (before her entire family was butchered on the trail). Her pa assured her that her golden hair would endear her to the Indians; in fact she was called Corn Tassel. She also kept her ma's words in her heart: to be brave, to be flexible and accept her situation with grace; to practice her English in secret and never forget her name, her family or her Bible teachings.Molly's loyalties were tested many times over the years, for she hated the thought of becoming an Indian. Yet can a 12-year-old girl (Lenski makes her younger) live long in an emotional vacuum? Respect, gratitude and friendship gradually slip into her heart despite herself. Will she ever relinquish her dream to escape back to white civilization? Set against the backdrop of the French and Indian War in 1758, this story is very readable, although much of the &quot;action&quot; takes place in Molly's mind and heart. Girls will enjoy this tale of forced adoption and culture shock, for Molly is very real and vulnerable when she is ripped away from her home and Pennsylvania lifestyle. This book touches the heart.(For more reading about culture clash, I suggest the LYON Saga,a series by M.L. Stainer, about the lost colony of Roanoak.)"},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"I can remember pulling this book out of the library in elementary school many many times. I just loved reading the story of Mary Jemison. Now that I am adult, I am very happy to be able to add this book to my collection. It is a story that is simple enough for children to grasp, but emotionally-gripping enough to keep adults reading. I believe it is an honest story. It explains much about how the Indians lived at the time, as compared to the somewhat more modern experiences that Mary had at home. It explains the ways of the Indians and chronicles the violence of the time, but retains the humanity of these people and what they believed. The reader learns all these things through Mary's eyes, and lives through her grief at the loss of her family and all that was familiar to her. Then, slowly, how she comes to befriend and even love her new Indian family. I would recommend this book highly to every child to get a good feel of the history of the Indians and their beliefs."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"Mary (Molly) Jemison lived a normal life on her farm in Pennsylvania where her family harvested corn. Her father didn't believe that Indians would ever come to their home as their neighbors said, but one day that is exactly what happened. Molly was having a normal day when a band of Indians came. Everyone in Molly's family was captured. Molly and her family had to walk for miles on end. Finally they stopped at a place where Molly was seperated from her family and was being taken with the Indians to become one of them. It was hard for Molly to adapt to her surroundings and she missed her family greatly. The Indians gave Molly the name, Corn Tassel, because of her long yellow hair. Molly was depressed at first and tried to run away a multiple of times. This book definitely a 5 star rating and it never got tedious."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"I liked the book Indian captive because it was full of history and was based on a true story. It really showed the ways and the ideas of the Indians and how they weren't that bad, they just wanted to love and protect their people. I have read a couple others about Indian captives but I like this one the best because the author took so much time explaining how molly felt.The book is about Molly Jemison who is taken away from her family when the Indians take over her house. They take her to become an Indian and rename her Corn Tassel for her yellow hair. She has to learn the Indian language and ways and find out where her soul is, with the whites or the Indian tribe. The book is about a white girl living in an Indian village and her journey to accepting her new life.I recommended this book to history lovers like myself who love to learn about the past, the Indian and colonial times.

Although I haven't seen a copy of the book in almost 50 years, I can still recall the story and the drawings by Lois Lenski vividly. No other author of children's books, has, in my opinion had as distinctive style as that of Lois Lenski. I think that my lifelong passion for pioneer days and ways was fostered by Indian Captive. The little tow-headed girl who so fascinated the Indians; the difficulty that Mary endured, and finally staying--had quite an impact on my young, impressionable mind. I now live in Canada, where books about American girls and American Indians are, understandably, not a big attraction. Recently during a conversation I found myself longing to see a copy of &quot;Indian Captive&quot; -- and to show it and read it to my 7 year old granddaughter.

(My local library had a beat-up, old, hardcover edition.) As a child I loved stories of white children adopted by the Indians, and I must admit I still find the subject fascinating. I loved &quot;Indian Captive&quot; when I first read it as a child. I thought it was the best and most realistic look of what it must have been like to be a captive among the Indians. No phony heroics or daring escapes here; just the story of a girl struggling to adapt to life in a completly alien environment, while at the same time holding onto her identity. I remember how disappointed I was when that old, beat-up copy of it disappeared from the library.&quot;Indian Captive&quot; was one of the books of my childhood which I never forgot. I am quite glad to see it was reprinted. It finally gave me a chance to re-read it, and it is just as good as I remember it. If readers enjoyed this book then they should take a look at &quot;I Am Regina&quot; by Sally M. Keehn and &quot;Trouble's Daughter&quot; by Katherine Kirkpatrick. Like &quot;Indian Captive,&quot; both of these books are stories about young girls taken captive by Indians during the colonial period and both are just as well written and exciting to read as &quot;Indian Captive.&quot; Also for older readers (12-15), I cannot speak more highly of Conrad Richter's &quot;The Light in the Forest.&quot; It is a story of a white boy, who has spent most of his life among the Indians, forced to return to his white family who he has forgotten. Mary Jemison found happiness among the Senecas while still holding onto her identity; the main character in &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; has lost all memory of his white past and finds himself caught between the the claims of blood and loyalty.

It is a glimpse into the life of the Seneca Indian tribe during the mid to late 1700s.In this classic Newbery Honor Award book, Lois Lenski authentically reconstructs the fascinating story of Mary Jemison's capture, flight, and early years with the Seneca Indians. Lenski has brought her special talents for research, for writing, and for drawing to this true American story of a white girl's life among Native Americans.The real Mary Jemison, at the age of 80, told her memories of her experiences in detail to James Everett Seaver, M.D., and the book was first published at Canandaigua, NY in 1824. She was one of a few Indian captives who refused to return the \\"pale face\\" world. Mary Jemison, aka 'Little-Woman-of-Great-Courage,' lived to be 91 and was buried in the Seneca churchyard at South Buffalo, and later re-buried at Letchworth Park in her beloved Genesee Valley.

Molly was able to get past what the Native Americans had done to her family and accept her new life, even after she had an opportunity to go back to the white settlers.

I can see why this is on the list."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"CaptiveIf you don't like fantasy book, then you're in luck... this isn't a fantasy book review! The book of the review this Indian captive, this book was published in1941 by Harper Collins publishing Inc. Indian captive was written by Lois Lenski and is about two Native American tribes, the Iroquois tribe and the Seneca tribe, And a family of six. Lois Lenski has also written a number of 13 books some of which include: Strawberry Girl, Mr. and Mrs. Noah. Anyway, back to the review, the plot line does not make sense, and has no climax, also is just plain boring. This book also has a lexile of 700 (a lexile is sort of like a rating of how hard the book is) which means you wouldn't go up to a first grader and say read this book then shove Indian Captive in their face. A first grader probably only has a lexile of 150- 300.The way the book did not flow well, and after a few chapters was confusing. One day while sitting eating breakfast Indians arrive and invade Mary Jemison's house two members of the Iroquois tribe along with 2 Frenchmen Capture Mary's family along with their neighbors. Then halfway through their journey to the Iroquois land Mary and her neighbor Davy were separated from the rest of their family, they took a very rough trail to fort Duquesne, and lay in a dark room with a hard floor. Then three days later Mary is sold to the Seneca tribe. When Mary and two women Indians reach the land Mary is lucky to receive the name of corn tassel and an outfit, a Seneca outfit. After a while she finds a friend in the woods and meets the chief. Finally... well if I tell you too much it will give away the ending.I personally think that the book had too many sad points and it was annoying. For Example, when Mary and Davy were captured by the Indians they were treated like Christmas trees while the Indians painted their faces. Afterwards another captive said now all we need is black hearts. Another example is when the author wrote, a man and a horse lay dead beside the well sweep.\\" The way it was written (in a way) threw the whole chapter off. It never said who died but gave enough info for you to guess, but you weren't sure. And last when the author wrote, suddenly the horse stopped, you just knew something bad was going to happen.I dislike the fact that people were being separated here and there... it was overdone. For example: After Mary and her family were captured two Indians separated her and took her to their land. Or when Mary and her captures met up with two other Indians, from the same tribe, who had taken a teenager from his family. Even after Mary was separated from her family you'd think the separating would stop but it doesn't. Mary is separated from her neighbor because Mary is a girl and Davy is a boy. Even after all that \\"separating\\" there's more to come. The Indians that captured Mary sold her to the Seneca tribe, separating her from the other captive. I just think the author overdid the \\"separating.\\"A brief summary of my opinion may make you understand it better. First of all I personally thought the book did not have a climax.

What I liked about the book was that the autor told a lot about the Indain way of life, the author showed great emotion in his writing, and described the scenery very well. The only reason that this is not a five star book is because I thought that the author asked too many questions in the story, not in dialoge but in the story.

After reading 'Calico Captive' and 'Calico Bush,' I would recommend them over this title as the writing and dialogue within this title seemed unnecessarily stilted and elementary."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"I just finished reading Indian Captive for my language arts class, and found it extremly boring. I don't know if my reading level's low, but I could not understand this book. The reading level says ages 10 and up, but I don't see how any person younger than 13 could possibly read this book and grasp the entire meaning of the story. I thought the plot was fine (what I could understand of it) but that it used words with very difficult meanings, and it sounded like a college thesis paper. If you enjoy books that are a challenge, Indian Captive is a good find. But if you prefer understanding everything you read, I recommend staying clear of this book."},{"Title":"Indian captive: The story of Mary Jemison","review":"Indian Captive is about a young girl. She is a pioneer. Her name was Mary, and she hated her life, but she was taking it all for granted. Native Indians kidnapped her. This all happened on a regular day at her family's farm. Soon she learns to live with the Indians and doesn't know if she wants to go back. Fore she has made so many friends who treat her very well.Personally I really did not think that this book was very interesting. Indian Captive dragged on about if she should go back home or just stay with the Indians. In my opinion this book was boring. Also it was just too sad for me, being a true story and all. So over all I did not like this book.The reason I chose this book is because it was a historical fiction book and I know I needed to read that type of book. I also wanted to know more about Indians and pioneers. How they really lived brought interest towards me. I never really knew that Indians took young children. Another reason why I chose this book is because of the cover. The girl, I'm guessing Mary, looked so scared and scary, and I wanted to know why. This is why I chose Indian Captive to read, and write about."},{"Title":"Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine: Phlebotomy","review":"I feel rip off, at least.

I especially liked the description of Washington at that time. He basically developes two characters. One completely evil and one good. They clash and of course good overcomes evil. The plot is well developed but is thwarted by the good soldier from Media, Pa. (the author's home town). It is well constructed for a first time author. I couldn't put it down and am hoping for more of the same from this bright young man. Gae Leccese"},{"Title":"The Winter Soldiers","review":"The main things I got out of this book were: War is hell, Media,PA is a great place to live, and no one in Washington listens to a lowly Captain. I could relate to the story because I started reading it while visiting in Washington DC, and I live in Media, PA. The pace of the story kept me reading, although thoughts and information were often repetative. I thought the ending fell a bit flat. I would recommend this book to historical fiction fans if for no other reason than to get a feel for the Washington \\"homefront\\"."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"- this book fell into the \\"I wish I had not bought this\\" category. It is not particularly badly written, but I found the hero's actions to be less than romantic and the whole scenario somewhat unbelievable. Furthermore, although the story is set in Regency-era London and then in Scotland, there was very little detail provided to make me feel that I was really in the period. Yes, there was a derelict castle, there were the usual retainers. But the story could have been set in Scotland in any year, in any century, apart from the occasional reference to transportation . There were no references to what was happening elsewhere in politics, society or even in Scotland itself. I find this kind of a narrative, torn from history, rather hard to take. Where was the history in this historical romance?I *am* picky about such things, and this review is for people who care about the use of history as more than wallpaper or a generic label. If you are a Joan Johnston fan (or the author herself), ignore this review. If you don't particularly care that the historical setting be somewhat close to real history, again, this review is not for you.This book is related to AFTER THE KISS, although I suspect I am missing a book in between. Very briefly put, between AFTER THE KISS and this book THE BRIDEGROOM, the daughters - of a British duke have grown up. One of them, Rebecca, is unhappily married, and comes to love a man whom she cannot marry since he is so low in rank. [Her story and his forms the backdrop to the major story, that of her sister and a man out for revenge].The hero Clay is a peer who has been disgraced by her father's actions (however well-intentioned). Since he lost his family, his title, his estates, and then his freedom, he bears a grudge against her entire family. Althouh the heroine, Regina (Lady Regina Blackthorne) knows this, she forms a friendship with him, believing his grudge to be a matter of the past. He has her kidnapped, thrown into a brothel from where he pretends to rescue her. He then persuades her to marry him, before springing the series of revelations - he hates her and her family, he wants to be revenged on her father, and so forth. He keeps his promises by preventing Regina from meeting her father, and vice versa. There is some mystery generated by the fact the hero has been wrongly accused, of course, and that the real villain is at large and in an unexpected position to strike again. There is however no reason given for the villain to want to hurt the hero in particular.Part of my problems with this book was that I could not believe in the whole revenge scenario. I could believe that the hero would want to be revenged for his sufferings, and that he could present himself falsely to a gullible female. But could the heroine have been that gullible - to believe in the good faith of someone with cause for grievance, and to do some other stupid things? While a convicted felon lost his estates, removing a title even from a convicted peer was not easy. There is a complicated process of attainder. Furthermore, Rebecca's marriage could not be annulled so easily, and certainly not on the whim of her husband alone. All this rather detracted from the story. I won't even go into the problems with Mick's real identity.I had problems with the characterization as well. Clay's desire to seek \\"compensation\\" for the loss of his title and estates (for several years) as well as the hardship he suffered is understandable. But he seemed too much like a stock character, the wronged hero out for revenge [think Edmond Dantes of THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO]. He shows very little growth in the course of the story, although he recognizes - before the real villain is unmasked - that it is wrong to keep Regina and her father apart. Regina is amazingly quick to forgive Clay for putting her in danger and for tricking her into marriage, not to mention keeping her from her family.On the other hand, Rebecca and Mick were well-drawn, and I wished the book had been about them, even though Mick's good fortune is almost unbelievable.The minor characters tended to fade quickly and made little impression on me or even on the hero or heroine (since Regina forgot about the orphans so quickly, for example).If you like a good tightly constructed plot, with a real sense of living in the Regency period, I really cannot recommend this book. If you want your Regency lite, this book might satisfy, but again it might not, depending on how credible you find the romance between Clay and Regina."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"This book begins okay, and it's interesting to meet the characters from the previous books in the series, but about halfway through I began to get really bored. The hero is far too indecisive, the plot comes undone very quickly and the ending is so abrupt and contrived it left me shaking my head in disbelief. Ms. Johnston appears to have a hard time writing about characters who really have a dark side to them - Carlisle could have been much better constructed, but his angst seems weak. Its also very difficult to make the hero from one book the apparant villain in the next (Blackthorne), and we never do understand Cedric Ambleside's motives in this story. Too contrived, particularly the ending, and not enough real characterization."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"I will admit that this book started out very slow and did not capture my attention. As a matter of fact I had started reading it a few months ago and quickly got bored after the first few pages and set it aside.I think there were a few other things that could have been better in this book, I must agree with the other reviewers that said that the pain and turmoil that plaged Clay just really wasn't there or felt deep enough by the reader... although I will admit that she did an excellent job at the end!!! I loved it!! It had me in tears and completely made up for where, in my opinion, it had been lacking else where."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"Ok. Yes, the plot was a bit farfetched at times. And yes, the characters weren't perfect. I also admit that the ending could have been drawn out a bit more but, alas, all of a sudden it was just there and they all lived happily ever after. This is a romance novel not a work of literary genius. That's not to say that there are not romance novels that can't achieve that status, but that's not what one really looks for in a romance novel. We want romance and this book has it. For all its faults, I liked it. I liked the characters regardless of the semi-weak characterazation. It was enjoyable and romantic, just the way I like my romance novels to be."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"This book is an insult to readers' intelligence. We are asked to believe that a man, deeply scarred by his own illegitimacy would conspire to have the marriage of the woman he loves annulled. It's done--and in record time, without the knowledge of her father, a duke, or anyone else. Does the author not know that annulments were rare and time-consuming to obtain, that having a marriage annulled (on trumped up grounds that the husband was a bigamist) would make the daughter illegitimate? Would any mother stand for it? Would the man who instigated this and is so conscious of his own illegitimacy-- contemplate it? As for him, the sudden discovery that, instead of being the illegitimate son of a whore he is the grandson of a nobleman, that too, strains credulity, not to mention the circumstances which forced his mother to prostitute herself. Finally, why the villain of the piece should wait 12 years to revenge himself on those he once wronged and then attempt several times in a row to murder them instead of continuing to hide is beyond me. But then, I like my stories to have a modicum of logic. One star is as low as one can get with this ranking system. I would have given the book a raspberry."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"I waited anxiously to get this book since the other 2 were so good.

I found all that and more in Joan Johnston's &quot;The Bridegroom&quot;:-- A strong but wounded hero transformed by an equally strong and lovable heroine-- A story with heart as big and complex as love itself-- A subplot and secondary characters that mesh with the main storyline and enhance it-- Minor characters who delight, touch and amuse; whose interaction with the principle characters develops them and the plot-- Realistic conflict grounded in human nature and the social order of the periodBRAVO, MISS JOHNSTON: Come back from the Wild West and give us more of your topnotch Regencies!"},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"&quot;The Bridegroom&quot; hooked me from the first page and never let me down.

Ms. Johnston has provided the reader with a sensual, thrilling, exciting read to conclude the Captive Heart series.

She never lets her readers down."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"After over thirty-five romances, many of which were best sellers, one would think that Joan Johnston has written about everything and could only be trite and stale. However, the incomparable grandmaster of historical romance shows she is quite refreshing as she provides her audience with a majestic tale of love's struggle to surmount a quest for revenge engraved inside the hero's soul. The story line is a fast-paced, yet seductive love story that makes for a wonderful climax to the captivating \\"Captive Hearts\\" series (see CAPTIVE, AFTER THE KISS, and THE BODYGUARD). Ms. Johnston should be right back where her readers always seem to place her, at the top of all the best selling lists.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"Those delightful twins from the earlier Captive Hearts books are all grown up ... well, with a bit of maturing yet to do which they will in the course of THE BRIDEGROOM.

Once you started reading the first page you couldn't stop reading it until you reach the very end of the book. I recommend this book to all romance readers!"},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"Joan Johnston's four book series -- The Captive, After the Kiss, The Bodyguard, and The Bridegroom -- are fun, romantic and steamy. The woman is always a bit too smart for her own good and winds up in an amusing yet dangerous situation... and this book is no exception.This book was recommended to me by a friend after I became interested in reading romances; my requirements for a romance include it be historical, have a sassy female, and an English or Scottish setting. This has all three, and was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"The reason I gave this 3 stars instead of either 1 or 5 is because I'm balancing the fact that this book is VERY appealing to those who are emotional, but VERY insulting to those who prefer emotional stimulation that's based on a modicum of logic.There are too many loose ends which leave the logical reader unsatisfied. For example:(1) If Reggie was indeed so dedicated to the London orphanage then why, upon her abduction, didn't she immediately lash out at Carlisle that she can't just suddenly neglect that responsibility?? It's ridiculous, because for the most part, she's portrayed as someone sensible... so it just doesn't jive!(2) Upon Reggie, Carlisle & Pegg's arrival in Scotland, no mention is made about Freddy (the orphan hired by Carlisle in London) - yet Johnston DOES mention that food trays etc. were served. Where DID their meals come from - if the house was abandoned? From thin air? And had Freddy disappeared into thin air?(3) Any logical reader is left wanting to know more about Becky's daughter Lily, and the twins' pre-teen brother Gareth - especially Gareth. These 2 characters should have been offered more of a role. Especially since Reggie astutely observes that Gareth's peace-keeping diversions were artfully shrewd, rather than childish whims, so why - when push came to shove - did Gareth turn wimpy?(4) I was disappointed with the portrayal of both Becky and Carlisle - they were MUCH less likable than Reggie and Mick. Kitt was also a very judgmental, non-intuitive, shallow character (not only in Bridegroom, but in Bodyguard as well). I enjoy characters who have depth & understanding, rather than constant cross-purposes due to childish non-communication. Don't get me wrong - I enjoy arguments and machismo - based on mutual humor and respect, rather than constant mistrust!(5) I was disappointed that the issue of Mick's baby sister Blinn was never resolved in this book. She remained lost - yet Mick goes blissfully about his courtship of Becky with no discussion whatsoever about Blinn - not even in the epilogue!(6) Also ridiculous, was the way Mick was so furious at his grandfather for spilling the beans to Becky about his true status. Had he even warned his grandfather?There were many more loose ends, beyond the scope of what I care to tackle. But with all that, I STILL say that this book is enjoyable, since the mingling of Carlisle's tragic past, combined with Reggie's spunky determination to heal him and patch the family together against all odds, sorta makes up for the loose ends."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"Oh I just loved this book for the feelings that were discribed in it. I laughed, cried and felt sorry for them both. The sad story about his wife and first unborn son was uncontrolled emotions. I laughed like crazy with all her ideas on the right husband list. I enjoyed this book very mush and still don't want to put it down after having it for two years. I even stolled it from my mothers book collection to have this one. I hope you enjoy the turn around of event in this book. If you ever feel sorry for yourself this would help a lot."},{"Title":"The Bridegroom","review":"I did enjoy this story. Regina was a wonderful character full of spunk! I knew she would be able to break down the wall around Clay's heart.

The drawing ofAhriman on page 232 is particulary potent when scryed, butI found this true for most of the book's drawings.

The part called \\"Goetic sorcery\\" is doubtful for those who had even a little study of Judaism (HOW can Adonai and Tetragrammaton, being in fact related to Jewish god, be called \\"Luciferian\\", for example?). I think that any information that comes from this book must be checked by reading some academical stuff. And the better depth and understanding come in mind, the more usable this grimoire becomes.Also I must say that this books needs a good editor (in some places there is a lot to improve in language department) and an illustrator (pics aren't perfect either), but I understand that the budget is not so big, so it's just a suggestion.

Back to the book though. This book goes into different chapters. One chapter is about the historical side of Luciferianism, and the different characters in Luciferianism. (I.E. Lucifer, Lilith, Samuael, etc.) The other chapters go on to things like witchcraft, the author-goetia fits nice in here, and some ritauls, and even a sex magick chapter.I have found a lot of useful information on Witchcraft, Luciferianism, and the occult in this book, and I think that Michael Ford is a great author, and I encourage others in this field of occult to get this book!Thank you,Chaos_mage4"},{"Title":"Luciferian Witchcraft","review":"It is delightfully intoxicating with such empowerment to touch those in California from witch the base of energy reaches me.

It's all so jumbled that I cannot make sense of it. I spent WAY too much money on this book. It's not original or cutting-edge in my opinion. I know there are many who will disagree with me, but I think Ford's attempts at 'reconstructing' are just too 'wanna be' scholorly. I do like the artwork in the book, but it wasn't worth the price just for the drawings. If you want something more authentic, I suggest \\"Call of the Horn&eacute;d Piper,\\" by Nigel Aldcroft Jackson.Personally, I delve into Traditional Craft and working with the Dead. This book just reminds me of a fictional system. Yes, you can make something fictional real. It's also too Christian. I would recommend it to reverse-Satanists.

In fact, \\"The Book of Lilith\\" has all the information I need besides my own work with Her.Sorry to disappoint folks. I'd pay maybe $10.00 for it.

It is the only book in my collection that i am driven to keep separate from the other grimoires and keep out of reach from any accidental perusals by the unwitting. As soon as i started to look through the book a sense of deep uncertainty overcomes and something wants to come out. At other times it drains me and i can't let go of it - as if i was hanging onto an electric fence. Neither the works of Archaelus Baron or the supposed Necronomicon of Simon evoke such an unease like this intense book. I recommend this book to adepts in the arts only, something which i do not consider myself to be yet and so naturally i pay the price for delving into such things like it is some lonely planets guide. This book will punish those who do not approach it or appreciate it properly. Its presence whenever opened seems to precede so inexplicable chaos - electrical disturbances, strange smells, sickness.

I was following up references in The Pillars of Tubal Cain and while that work is not at all 'fluffy', it's spun sugar compared to this. And I don't mean that as a put down for The Pillars of Tubal Cain. Not at all. The sheer intensity of this book caught me off guard. It made me nervous, made me hesitate, but I am so glad that I read on. This book is challenging, intense, and deeply rewarding. And I've only gotten to his Goetia.

Ford on YouTube and liked what he had to say about working with the darker sides of our natures instead of trying to deny them.I was also looking forward to a scholarly account of the Adversary as promised by the promotional literature.However, on opening it up, I noticed that the first page of introduction by Nathaniel J. Harris was full of errors; for example he writes \\"thraots\\" instead of throats, \\"accademic\\" instead of academic and most embarrassingly \\"Gloden Dawn\\" instead of Golden Dawn....p.5This didn't bode well and indeed in the first few pages of Ford's own writing we are treated to further spelling errors and ungrammatical sentences that make no sense.For example:\\"...it is a path where the practitioner becomes like Cain who leaves an outsted or solitary life...\\"p.8. Presumably he means \\"who leads an ousted or solitary life\\".On page 11 he writes \\"Beginning with the foundations of the Adversary in the form of the Egyptian Set are we firstly to understand that his force, while averse is indeed a necessary and significantly important to the balance of nature in both a 'natural' and 'supernatural' sense.\\" Presumably he means \\"that this force, while averse, is indeed necessary and significantly important to the balance of nature...\\"And on page 12 there is a missing first footnote, hardly \\"scholarly\\"...Now, why am I bothering to complain? Well partly it's because I resent having paid so much for a sub-standard book, but more than this it feels like Ford's slap-dash editing has marred what could have been an excellent and thought provoking work....I have almost given up trying to read it...why should I have to spend my time working out what Ford means to say, when he hasn't spent enough time checking that what he has written makes basic sense?[...]. Seems only this demon has the courage to challenge his Satanic Majesty's masterwork. Come on Michael, pay for a professional editor to go through your book. You can afford it!

I've also done the invocation of Cain and Tiamat. Of course as someone who has just begun to delve with the workings of this great book I find revelations about myself that I didn't fully know until now.On top of everything this book is most diffenately not for Wiccan or Neo Pagans.

It has more than enough to keep you reading and working, and is highly original in content. I was especially pleased to see the added notes for the Goetia inside, rather than the same things I have read about it reprinted again and again.

As such any history buff will find this book easy to read and very informative. I doubt there is a better single text on the subject. Someone had written in the margins of the copy I read, where it discussed DeGaulle's pre-war book on the subject and the fact almost nobody in France owned or read it, \\"Hitler did.\\" It would be interesting to know if this was true."},{"Title":"The blitzkrieg story","review":"\\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" was published in the United States in 1976, the same year that another title by Charles Messenger, \\"The Art of Blitzkrieg,\\" was published in the U.K. A revised edition of the latter title was published in Britain in 1991 and in the United States in 1994. I assume that \\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" and \\"The Art of Blitzkrieg\\" are essentially the same book, and I've found no indication that the revised edition was substantially updated from the original, but don't hold me to that. Certainly, the actions of the Coalition armies the 1991 Gulf War would have warranted a re-assessment of the potential of air-supported armored warfare in the late 20th century. If you have the opportunity to buy it, the revised edition might be a better value than the 1976 originals.Messenger is (or was) an officer in the Royal Tank Regiment and has published numerous books on 20th-century warfare. His professional experience and insight provide in \\"The Blitzkrieg Story\\" a thorough account of the the development of tank warfare from World War I through the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. For casual readers, however, I fear the book will be a rather arid reading experience. Roughly the first half of the book is spent discussing the controversies within various armies (those of Great Britain, Germany, France, the U.S.S.R., and the United States, essentially) during the 1920s and 1930s over the proper employment of tanks (as \\"rolling pillboxes\\" supporting infantry vs. use in independent armored/mechanized formations striking quickly and deeply into enemy territory). Messenger's account of these arguments is an important part of the story he tells, but not terribly exciting (if that's what you're seeking from this subject).One would expect that things would pick up once Messenger's account arrives at September 1939 and the Wehrmacht begins its \\"lightning war\\" on Poland. The author covers the major armored campaigns of the European war quite thoroughly; but, again, his \\"top-down,\\" command-oriented accounts are not scintillating reads. Messenger's comparison of the Israeli Defense Forces' brand of armored/air warfare with the World War II practitioners of \\"blitzkrieg\\" is interesting and insightful. I also commend him on attending to the role of air power in the rise of mechanized warfare, something that other writers on tank battles often overlook.Again, casual readers, or those seeking slam-bang action stories about tank warfare, are going to be disappointed in \\"The Blitzkrieg Story.\\" This is a scholarly, rather technical account of the ways in which various armies developed and used the tank in the mid-20th century, and Messenger's rather detached writing style adds to the book's overall dryness. I would recommend it as a managable, informative introduction to the topic; but the reader will need to pay close attention and commit himself to a hard slog through the dense military prose."},{"Title":"Love Potion (Enchanted Hearts)","review":"This book kept me in suspence all of the time by how each character was going to react.

Two men working for opposite sides, one for the British and one for the colonists, have a relationship with the same woman. Their relationship comes to a climax during the battle at King's mountain. Mrs. Fletcher knew the area and the history intimately and writes with skill that is not dated. Planters living near swamps using boats for transportation with descriptions of the plants and animals, open door hospitality, and later divisions within the characters as they are forced to decide whether to support the British or join the colonist when war reaches their homes. This is an excellent choice for those who like historical fiction."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"Surprisingly enough, I found The Mansion to be the best novel in Faulkner's impressive Snopes trilogy. Flem Snopes, the devious and underhanded antihero of The Hamlet and The Town is on a crash course with Mink Snopes, the unbalanced family member whom Flem allowed to be imprisoned for murder nearly four decades earlier. The paths of these two characters converge with fascinating inevitability, as Gavin Stevens and Linda Snopes finally arrive at a crossroads in their own relationship. The Mansion is a satisfying conclusion to a story that spans over forty years in the history of Jefferson, Mississippi; the Snopes trilogy is a must-read for Faulkner fans."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"This book (The Mansion) was my first experience with William Faulkner. I plan to read more. Despite his tendency towards long sentences that are impossible to parse, Faulkner has created an extremely compelling story chronicling 40 years in the history of a family and a town in the deep South. Having been raised in the South (although certainly long after the setting of these events), I found many of the characters, and certainly some of the attitudes towards the rest of the world, eerily familiar.This epic of the rise and fall of the Snopes family illustrates the tremendous impact a single family can have on a community, especially when that family is driven by naked ambition. In the course of his narrative Faulkner also reveals how the inhabitants of a small town in the South viewed such events as World Wars I and II, the New Deal, and the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement.Although this book is the last of a trilogy, I found it to stand on its own very well. In fact, the first chapter stands on its own and is worth reading all by itself - in my view it's a near-perfectly constructed short story."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"William Faulkner wraps up the epic saga of the Snopes family by telling the story of the monstrous Mink, a convicted amoral murderer and victim of counsin Flem's conniving ways. Several other characters from various other stories come and go, allowing Faulkner to wrap up another Jefferson tale or two. As is the case with all of Faulkner's tales, the story has a deeper significance to the human condition. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"I read the first two books of the Snopes trilogy, The Hamlet and The Town, many years ago, so it is lucky for me that this concluding novel more or less retells the main events of the previous two novels - albeit from different points of view - from the start. So, let me get one thing that irritated and disappointed me, by turns, throughout the novel out of the way: Faulkner is rather sloppy here concerning his interior monologues and, indeed, exterior dialogues. Having a Harvard educated lawyer (viz., Gavin Stevens) saying \\"ain't\\" is just as grating as hearing an illiterate tenant farmer (viz., Mink Snopes) thinking in fifty dollar words. One only has to contrast the effect here to the masterfully controlled interior monologue of \\"the idiot\\" (q.v. Macbeth-\\"...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\\") Benji in The Sound and the Fury to see how striking is the difference.Nevertheless, I think this a very worthwhile book because - as another reviewer has stated - it deals with the human condition, more particularly with the fallen state of man. Also, I had well-nigh forgotten how addictive Faulkner's prose style becomes after one adjusts to it. He seems to have never met an adverbial phrase he didn't like, nor a restating of matters with a slightly different nuance which he couldn't resist putting to paper. But the more one reads, the more acutely one becomes aware of how accurately this mimics life itself, in which we constantly relive the past in our minds and in which we dwell in a constantly changing state of uncertainty regarding the motives of those closest to us and even of ourselves.I think it more than a bit of an over-simplification to say that this trilogy and that this novel are merely about the rise and fall of the vile, money-grubbing Snopes clan - though, on one level, it's certainly the plot line. But, as ever with Faulkner, the book is about far more than mere plot. There are so many themes here that I can't do justice to them all. I certainly can't do justice to the knight-errant psychology of Gavin Stevens. So, let me just advert to one question he poses: \\"If mankind matched his dreams too, where would his dreams be?\\" This question is the most concise explanation of his fear of consummation and all his other actions. He values his dream life. But the main character of the book, as far as overarching import is concerned, in the beginning of the book and the end, is the aforementioned unlettered tenant farmer and twice murderer Mink Snopes, who serves as an avenging angel of Fate, or of our fallen nature, or call it what you will here, to whose death Faulkner devotes the final words of the book:\\"...himself among them, equal to any, good as any, brave as any, being inextricable from, anonymous with all of them: the beautiful, the splendid, the proud and the brave, right up to the very top itself among the shining phantoms and dreams which are the milestones of the long human recording - Helen and the bishops, the kings and the unhomed angels, the scornful and graceless seraphim.\\"I could go on, but this is an Amazon review, not a dissertation. Suffice it to say that in Faulkner's mansion are many themes, all of them deep and well-worth exploring."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"\\"the mansion\\" is faulkner's memorable conclusion to the excellent snopes trilogy. Although it can be read on its own, it is best appreciated as the third in a series.Let me first start by commenting on the trilogy as a whole (you can see my reviews on the first two books). This trilogy provides excellent overall background to all the novels of faulkner. In it he talks about most of the main characters of yoknapatawpha county, mississippi which run through all of his work. \\"The mansion\\" in particular ties many of these people and history together. In addition to that, it tells the fascinating story of the snopes family.In \\"the mansion\\" faulkner retells most of what has occurred in the prior two books. This allows the reader to enjoy this novel on its own. For the trilogy reader he makes it interesting by changing the point of view. In \\"the town\\" v. k. ratliff tells the story of mink snopes and his murder of jack houston. In the retelling in \\"the mansion\\" the story is told by mink himself; a totally different perspective. Faulkner also, in sections of the book, reverts back to the omniscient narrator in this book whereas in \\"the town\\" 3 individuals tell the story from their perspective. point of view is one of the most intriguing aspects of faulkner's style.In this novel, he concludes the stories of the main snopes' characters and other characters in the trilogy. There is a clear air of fate that doesn't appear in the other novels. The story centers on mink, linda, and flem. Each ones destiny is irreversible. Even gavin stevens is fated to become a co-conspirator in murder.As before, we never see into the head of the main character, flem snopes. He has clearly become bored with life as he defeated everyone in his way to becoming the most powerful person in jefferson. Why, at the end he takes no steps to save himself from mink is described by ratliff like rules of the game he has been playing. Is he also bored with life?Faulkner is a masterful writer. This trilogy is not his best work, but it is excellent literature."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"This book makes slogging through The Town very much worth it. Although the Town is an excellent book, it serves mostly to set the groundwork (whether he intended it or not) for this absolutely fabulous text.Mink Snopes, cousin of Flem Snopes as well as victim of his kinsman's steady rise to the top of Yoknapatawpha County's high society, returns from prison to seek revenge. It is described in almost mythic prose. Also, causing Flem no small amount of grief, is his daughter's continuing relationship with anti-Snopesian, Gavin Stevens.Along the way, several dozen Snopeses come and go. And we learn the final fate of the Compsons from the Sound and the Fury.It sounds like a hoity-toity soap opera, but this is one soap opera that will stick to the ribs of your soul."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"I've heard people talk about the best approach to reading Faulkner, and the best book to begin with. I don't think this is a good book to start with - too much of Faulkner's previous work crowds this text for it to make sense to someone without exposure to some of his earlier work. But I think the Snopes trilogy, and especially this book, is some of Faulkner's most important (and most neglected) work.The Snopes trilogy follows the fortunes of the Snopes family, and especially Flem Snopes, as they invade and virtually conquer Faulkner's fictional Yoknapatawpha County. The trilogy starts with The Hamlet, published in 1940 before Faulkner was a Nobel laureate and a famous author. This book is often considered one of his great works, and I recommend it. The second book in the trilogy, The Town, is a bit less interesting because it focuses so much on Gavin Stevens and his obsession with Eula Varner Snopes and then her daughter Linda. I suppose I got a little tired of the dirty old man staring at the little girl thing.Anyway, in The Mansion, Flem has risen to the presidency of one of Jefferson's two banks. He lives in the old Sartoris mansion (hence the title) with his daughter (since his wife committed suicide at the end of The Town - sorry to ruin that book for you). As the book progresses, Gavin Stevens moves closer to Linda, though they don't seem to end up together. And Mink Snopes, a cousin of Flem who killed his neighbor Jack Houston in The Hamlet, is getting out of prison (through the intervention of Linda Snopes and Gavin Stevens), and he wants to kill Flem.Basically, the book jumps back and forth between these two components: the Gavin/Linda exchanges, and the Mink Snopes quest for revenge. Mink is an illiterate sharecropper who seems incapable of sympathy or remorse for his earlier murder or the murder he wants to commit. But in this book you start to feel bad for him. Sitting in a truck, hitching his way across Mississippi to buy a gun, he has to ask the driver to do the math for him to help him figure out how old he is after being in prison for almost forty years. He's too old to be useful to anyone, and so out of touch with the changes in the world around him (cars, for instance, were a novelty when he went into prison) that it seems a miracle that he finds someone to sell him a gun. He has enough principle not to steal from the former-Marine preacher that he runs into, and the preacher gets him his stolen money back and finds him a ride to Memphis.For me, this book is worth reading for Mink Snopes. He's almost/sort of a sympathetic character here, and the whole trilogy starts to unravel a little when we get inside the head of a Snopes, and we start to feel bad for him. He has a lot of real problems - he's a terrible racist, though near the end of the book he goes to work for an African-American cotton farmer and seems to be social with them. But he rescues this book from being just the fantasy of an aging writer about a voluptuous young woman.I should also mention that this book really ruins Ratliff as a character. The whole business with the tie really annoyed me, and made this homespun Socrates into a hick.I think this is a flawed book, but interesting to people who are looking for more from Faulkner. Like another reviewer said, a lot of Yoknapatawpha shows up in here, such as Jason Compson from The Sound and the Fury and Clarence Snopes, who has a small but funny part in Sanctuary.If you're looking for a good Faulkner book to start with, I think Light in August is good but a little long. Or Sanctuary, because it's so sensational."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"The Snopes trilogy has been a steady progression in the maturity and complexity of Faulkner as an author, concluding with The Mansion, the tragic finale piece. Less quirky and expansive than its predecessors and decidedly tragic in its inevitable downward spiral, the book offers one of Faulkner's simultaneously most complex and comprehensible studies of human nature. The characters, with the exception of V.K. Ratliff, are less likable than in previous installments, but the almost magnetic pull of the plot's inevitable conclusion is gripping."},{"Title":"The Mansion","review":"the third and last volume of william faulkners triology, of the snopes familey of missisippi. it can be read by itself or in order with the other two.it is very thrilling and of an interesting style of the southern united states."},{"Title":"The Studhorse Man","review":"When Hazard Lepage sets out to breed his rare blue stallion Poseidon in the hope of saving his horse's bloodline from extinction, he creates a trail of anarchy, confusion, and chaos -- as well as encountering the charms of a few good women.

I was seeking answers and appreciated Guthrie's humble, probing guidance. Even then I disagreed with his mildly Barthian take on things, but I did enjoy much of his approach. It was smart and accessible. He posed lots of very good questions, though he offered hesitant answers. (Often in areas where Barth did NOT). This could be frustrating at times, and he was clearly even a little less classically orthodox than Barth, but I did get much out of this book.Unfortunately, the new addition moves further along on the trajectory of the more disappointing aspects of the original work. To be honest, Guthrie comes off as somewhat more hesitant to make truth claims, even less orthodox, and even more politically correct. I hate to give low scores, but I really should have given this edition two stars (I'd give the older edition three and a half).Far better would be something like J.I. Packer's Concise Theology, or even Louis Berkhof's slightly more combersome Summary of Christian Doctrine."},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"I was very pleased how quickly I received the book.

The updated version is inclusive of theological voices that have joined the ongoing debate in the last thirty years. At the end of each chapter questions are provided to enable group study. This is a wonderful study for serious small group or Sunday school class work. A must have for any serious layperson in the Presbyterian/Reformed family."},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"Shirley Guthrie's introduction to Christian theology was recommended to me by Professor Roger E. Olson as a primer book for a theology/doctrine small group I started at my church, and it most helpfully delivered. Guthrie's book comes from a Presbyterian tradition that cherishes the works of Calvin and the documents of Westminster divines. Though he sees himself in neo-orthodox tradition, he displays a thorough knowledge of the London and Belgic Confessions as well as the Heidelberg Catechism, and remains reverent to them as he provocatively speaks to issues of racism, economic disparity, and human life. He also is a great writer that communicates complex subjects with remarkable ease.Guthrie's strongest chapter by far is on the Atonement, where he deals with many of the hard problems in a penal-substitution theory that normally obfuscate the fact that God is FOR us and loves us without abandoning the theory altogether. His chapters on the church, Holy Sprit, and the Trinity are also especially strong. Written in the 1960's Guthrie took on some of the hot topics of the day, which shows a sometimes prophetic voice, yet also a dated one. His view of Word Council of Churches is awkwardly optimistic, and his weakest chapters are on the subject of Predestination and Biblical studies, though he does have some helpful notes on subjects of general and special revelation.Though some might be ascared of Guthrie's neo-orthodox moorings, I can heartily recommend this book to any evangelical who is looking for a bigger picture of Christian theology."},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"If your faith background was strict and dogmatic and you left because it was so narrow minded, then this is the book to help you find your faith once more. One of the best quotes from the book is, &quot;An honest doubter is closer to the truth than a superficial or dishonest believer.&quot; Dr. Guthrie talks about the basic Christian Beliefs and reviews the pros and cons of each area-- so that you can decide what you believe. He does not hand out &quot;pat&quot; answers-- nor does he give &quot;politically correct&quot; answers. He does give Bible references throughout for further reflection. His work is refreshing and most helpful."},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"I was expected much when bought this book, a best-seller for more than thirty years and has introduced thousands of laity, students, and theologian to the tenets of the Christian faith. But after read some chapters, I am a little bit disappointed. It is ok in general, that's why I give it 3 stars, but Guthrie just too fast to move his theological topic into the contemporary issues or applications, before he dig deep enough. For example, when he discuss about Trinity, he used so many words to speak about interreligious dialogue and the gender problem, and in chapter about creation, he speak a lot about the exploitation of our natural environment. Of course it is good to write a systematic theology with an eye to today issues but this book is short enough for a systematic theology book, only about 400 pages (content proper) and must deal with so many systematic topics (19 topics) from who is a Theologian to the doctrine of eschatology, so when he emphasis one thing, he must sacrifice the other. I realize that earth polution is an important issue today but when I buy this book what I want is to understand what the bible said about creation.Furthermore, this book is said to be written in reformed perspective, but if what you mean with reformed perpective is reformed in the line of John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Charles Hodge or Louis Berkhoff, you may quite disaggree with some of Guthrie position."},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"I came across the book in 2002, when I was about to leave my seminary. I was studying at an conservative-evangelical seminary in East Java province. To speak frankly, my teachers never introduced me to this volume. But I found it outstanding! Shirley Guthrie, in my view, succeeds in articulating the Reformed faith for today's Christianity. I seldom find conservative systematic volumes have weighty points on the doctrine of trinity and creation in clear reasoning. With the revival of Calvin's focal points on those areas (and the connexion between the two), represented by Reformed theologians like Barth, Moltmann, Colin Gunton (the latter of which I pay my deep admiration), Guthrie strongly condensed the much more complicated discourse into the current straight-to-matter-volume.Forgotten by many theologians, that the one-ness of God, according to Guthrie, means worshipping the one-true God whom the Scripture proclaims, and not the \\"-ism\\"s (77); thus he doesn't indermine the one-ness to philosophical speculations--God being one in his 'ontos'; henceforth he paves the way the prominence of trinitarian theologian. So interesting while discussing the Holy Spirit, he has spaces on Christian spirituality as \\"looking outside, this worldly and recognizing the ordinary work of the Holy Spirit.\\" (298-302), and no doubt that this is a staunch Reformed spirituality.I therefore have different opinion with my friend, Ongkowidjojo, though both of us are from the \\"same\\" root of Indonesian evangelicalism (yes, different schools). Guthrie IS a Reformed theologian in Calvinist wing though he has moved away from the Old Princeton school.For readers--pastors and lay people--please don't have reservation to pick this GREAT volume.

It can be opened at any chapter and understood without reading the previous chapters. It is worth the money!"},{"Title":"Christian Doctrine, Revised Edition","review":"If you are Presbyterian, and indeed, a fairly modern, fairly liberal one, the revised edition of Guthrie's 1960's classic is well-worth reading. It is also worth a read if you are trying to learn about Presbyterian doctrine, Calvinism, British Calvinism, or the relationship between Westminster and Heidelberg.Reading the older (1960's) edition and the new one will reveal some interesting trends, presumably in not only Guthrie's mindset but in modern Presbyterianism. As others aptly noted--It's more PC, more hestiant, and less likely to have any absolutes.However, to be frank, and here's hoping this will not upset too many Presbyterian readers, calling this volume CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE is a little offensive and hubristic. Certainly, theologians of larger Protestant denominations (Lutherans, Methodists, Anglicans, and Baptists) would have a hard time agreeing with much of what Guthrie proclaims in this book.Members of Christianity's two largest bodies, Roman Catholic and Orthodox, would be downright hurt, I would think. And the latter would find it at least ironic and possibly risable that Guthrie considers the espoused doctrine \\"orthodox.\\"So, if you are in the small body of likely readers noted above, this is an interesting work.

I agree with most of the reviews here that it is a masterpiece of sorts. It's a whirling panorama of life in seventeenth- century Italy--famine, plague, riots, and Spanish occupation. The story is melodramatic but so is much of Dickens. While I was reading it, I thought that it would make a compelling grand opera; I kept hearing the overture of Verdi's La Forza del Destino playing along in my mind. It's a mystery why Verdi, who revered Manzoni and dedicated his requiem mass to him, never attempted to dramatize this work. The two seem tailor-made for each other.My only major criticisms with Manzoni's magnum opus would be with the way he introduces fascinating characters, such as the Nun of Monza and Father Cristoforo, who would themselves be suitable subjects for novelistic treatment, and then whisks them away never to be heard from again for hundreds of pages. The Nun of Monza's fate is relayed in a couple of sentences. And the hero and heroine, Renzo and Lucia, are rather conventional in comparison, less complex, less multilayered, than some of the other characters. But nineteenth-century literary conventions would normally put such types at the center of the action anyway, so one can't really fault Manzoni for basically following fashion. (And this defect would not have made mattered so much in an operatic form where the music takes over much of the dramatization.)Another point of contention: the heavy air of Christian redemption and piety that hangs over the latter portions of the novel in which formerly evil characters reform their wicked ways and find God. It can be a rather thick and gooey mess for a modern reader unused to all this sanctimoniousness; in its own way, it's as offensive as Dickens' sickly sweet, masochistic, prolonged dwelling over the death of Little Nell.Overall, Manzoni's inspiration is erratic and he doesn't always concentrate on the aspects of the story that I would have liked. This may be because he's more of an instinctual artist than a thinking one, like Stendhal, whose Charterhouse of Parma, bridging the gap between thought and feeling, makes an interesting comparison in its portrait of nineteenth-century Italy. I would also agree with one of the reviews below: Manzoni is clearly not Shakespeare or Dostoyevsky. His writing lacks the unity of conception, the inexplicable greatness that makes the works of Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky so powerful, so relevant to all humanity. Nevertheless, this is a vital, important work in Italian letters and useful as a document of seventeenth-century Italian history."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"This book is, if I am not mistaken, considered one of the greatest pieces of Italian literature. The characters are enjoyably human, the pace keeps you interested, and the writer paints an excellent picture of the times. You see renaissance Italy with its plagues, religious uproar, and swaggering bravos.Since religion is a very emotional issue for me, I was tempted to give the book a three or two rating. In fairness, it deserves at least the four I gave it. It describes the period beautifully and gives perfect exemplars for many different modes of behavior.Here are my criticisms. If you haven't read the story, these will spoil it, so have a care. I have three: First, the conversion of the master villian struck me as horrendously done. He is touched by the innocent pleading and prayers of his victim. Personally, I find it laughable that a man of such black reputation has never encountered similar circumstances before. Why should this person's naive pleas for clemency be any different? Second, the conversion of the Unnamed can be compared to Darth Vader's salvation at the end of the film Return of the Jedi. Everyone is ecstatic over the redemption of this evil figure, only because of his power and charisma. Just as no one cared for the other 100,000 troops that died on the Death Star, the bishop who visits the new convert spares a paltry few words for all of his underlings and their spiritual welfare. The bishop does not visit them. The people are not thankful when they convert. We are thrilled when an archvillian switches allegiances, but like Manzoni, we couldn't care less about the salvation of any of his lesser followers. This supposed Christian triumph is in fact only an illustration of human fascination with power. Third, the reason for The Betrothed to marry despite the lady's promise to become a nun is absurd. What if their betrothal had not been official? Would God be so cruel as to hold her to a promise made while she was fearful for her life? That vow, like any other promise made under duress, cannot have been valid.I hope you'll forgive my rant. The story is a testament to its time and certainly one of the better books I had to suffer through during college. :)"},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"I received the book in timely fashion, in good condition.

I'm an advanced dilusionary scitzophrenic padantic twelve year-old, with involuntary narccassitc rage who makes aged people feel stupid. Just kidding. The Betrothed can be considered a reasonably good book, or a complete waste of time where Manzoni just displays his knowledge of obscure 17th century historians to attempt to impress us with his bombastic, pretentious, precocious, and padantic prose. However, at least this version of his magnum opus is good, wiht a reasonably good introduction. The overall story is interesting, however, at one point, Manzoni talks about the plauge in Milan and obsure historians for around 150 pages. These pages do not relate to the stroy at all. My advice is to skip them all together, i made the mistake of reading through them. Anyway the overall gist of the story is this... and i quote, \\"At the center of this turmoil (the turmoil being the suffering that is caused by tyranny in any form)are Renzo and Lucia, who end up having to flee from the villainous Don Rodrigo. They are separated and each faces many dangers-violent riots, famine and plauge-until they are reunited again. They also encounter a variety of people along their adventures: the Nun of Monza, whose strange manner hides a disturbing tale;Father Cristoforo, a man with a violent past and a passion for justice; and the Unnamed, the supreme tyrant.\\" The Betrothed is fairly good and i would reccomend it if you have time to kill, but not for fun neccesarily, this is soley because it is 720 pages...However, if you can manage to get through it all, its quite worthwhile. Yet, i could understand if one did not enjoy the book, or put it down whilst in the middle of reading and debunking it. In conclusion, I reccomend the Betrothed, buteven if you don't like it, its worthwhile to buy it because it will be a good source of toilet paper to last you through about 3 years."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Allesandro Manzoni's THE BETROTHED is rightfully considered one of the great novels in Italian history, if not the greatest. It is also one of the greatest historical novels ever written. Manzoni magnificently blends together a score of memorable characters with a string of vividly rendered historical events to provide an epic story of frustrated lovers in Italy during the Thirty Years Wars in the early 17th century when the state of Milan was occupied by the Spanish Habsburgs. The result is a great story placed against the background of a turbulent period in Italian history. The choice of that period of time is fascinating in itself. Instead of dealing with one of the more glorious periods of Italian history, such as the 15th or 16th centuries, Manzoni chose the relatively undistinguished 17th, during a time when much of Italy suffered under foreign rule, while many of the other city states were in a period of decline.Few novels that I know deal with historical topics as magnificently as this one. One has to go to a writer like Tolstoy to find scenes as memorable as the tremendous scene in the Lazaretto in which Fra Cristoforo admonishes Renzo for his desire for revenge, with thousands of people dying of the plague surrounding them. Nearly as powerful is Manzoni's masterful depiction of the bread riots in Milan or the way he describes the progress of the German army in its passage through the region on its way to Mantua. Although one hardly reads the novel for the history lessons it provides, one learns an unusually large amount.I am a bit perplexed as the criticism that the novel contains too much in the way of Christian redemption in the latter part of the novel. Of course it does. As much as an historical novel, THE BETROTHED is a religious novel, in which Manzoni in his own way tries to justify the ways of God to men. If one compares the novel to the historical works of someone like Hugo or other French historical novelists, one will be struck by the sharp divergence in the depiction of the Church and the clergy. In France, an anti-clericalism characterizes many or most of the novels. Manzoni is much more balanced. Some of his religious figures, such as the Nun of Moanza or the Lecco parish priest, are either ridiculous or treacherous, but by and large the great heroes in his book are either monks (Fra Cristoforo), clerics (the Cardinal), or converts (the Unnamed). The theme of the novel is a religious one: \\"All things work together for good for those that love God.\\" Given the central theme of the novel, the religious themes are not an unwanted accretion, added on arbitrarily by an author otherwise summoning up a tremendous yarn, but integral to the novel as a whole. To dampen or eliminate the religious themes would have been to make it into another novel entirely.Most of all, THE BETROTHED is just a flat out great story. Separated lovers, devious villains, mysterious figures: who wouldn't fall for all this? Manzoni is a masterful storyteller, and frequently one is left with a powerful impatience to know what is going to happen next. Anyone looking for a great novel could hardly hope to do better than this great masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Twenty years ago I went through a graduate program in Comparative Literature and read literally thousands of novels, plays, poems, etc. Of all that I read then, The Betrothed (I Promessi Sposi) is one of the few works that stand out. Scott, Hugo, and other novelists were familiar, but Manzoni was a new name to me then. He has become a favorite companion in the ensuing years. I am currently reading this novel for the 7th or 8th time (lost count). Written with compassion and humor, Manzoni offers an enthralling story of a peasant couple swept up in the political, social and religious turmoil of early 17th century Italy. There are many subplots involving characters of every rank and station, all vividly portrayed. What brings me back to this novel repeatedly are: 1) the author's masterful handling of plot--everything fits and flows (super)naturally; and 2) his ability to capture the beauty, wonder and horror of life in eloquent and moving prose. It is a mystery why this novel is not better known in the U.S."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"This is the most famous book in Italian literature. Most students hate it, but their opinion just doesn't count because for them it is but brutal forced reading. Manzoni's &quot;The Betrothed&quot; can be enjoyed on various levels. In the first place, it is packed with action: there's the good guy, the imperiled damsel, the arch-villain, the saintly friar and various comic characters like the cowardly priest and his spinster-servant. The plot is tipically Nineteenth Century: the loving couple can't get married because the arch-villain gets in their way and starts all the tribulations. On the other hand, the whole plot can be seen as a religious parable (and that is why students hate this book: they are forced to see the whole matter from this point of view ONLY.) on Providence. Thirdly, the book can be seen as an authoritative historical text about the Sixteenth Century. Unlike his colleague Walter Scott, whose Middle Ages look like a Hollywood movie starring Liz Taylor, Manzoni wrote &quot;The Betrothed&quot; after a serious hystorical reserach: almost every episode is historically based and he made use of Sixteenth-century chronicles and laws as a basis for his story's context. On top of this, the characters aren't mere literary creations. They are alive and pop out of every page as living creatures with all their humanity. Everything in them denounces Manzoni as a keen observer of the human heart. I highly recommend this book. Buy it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Don't let the fact that The Betrothed has been labeled a classic, nor its length, stop you from picking it up. It's a darn good read, with very believable characters: good, evil, and mixed. The narrator is lucid, witty, and erudite: a joy to spend time with. The translation I read flowed like a delicious cool stream. The story has both intimate moments and scenes of baroque insanity that seem somehow the progeny of the Barber of Seville and the Keystone Cops.The third quarter of the book leaves the story entirely to follow the development of the second plague in Milan from the famine years when it began to its demise--leaving 2/3rds of the population dead. Though this is quite a large detour, the descriptions of the world reduced to this hell and the understanding Manzoni brings to bear on it, are no less engrossing than the story, which he does tie in and resolve before the end of the book. The courage and faith of some of the characters burns all the more brightly when plunged into the darkness of the pestilence. Some are transformed for the good. Others, just hardened.It's too bad Manzoni wasn't as prolific as Dickens. He wrote a second novel, only, which apparently has been published very rarely since the time of its writing. So, The Betrothed is our one chance to be exposed to his great mind and heart.

This translation makes the story seem like a modern adventure."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Manzoni is the preeminent figure of Italian fiction - akin to Cervantes in Spain, Twain in the USA and Hugo in France. Not only was he a fabulous writer, Manzoni was also looked upon as a kind of beloved father figure for the shapers of modern Italy. (Verdi wrote his Requiem to mark the first anniversary of Manzoni's death).Certainly, with this work, he shaped the Italian language, in much the same way that Martin Luther shaped German with his translation of the Bible.Although he was also a poet, his well-deserved international reputation rests chiefly upon this book. It is an episodic tale, in a Don Quixote sense, of love between two delighful people, Lucia Mondella and Renzo Tramaglino. Their love persists and prevails, in spite of their separation and nearly every kind of challenge imaginable.There are religious themes in the book, of course, since it is a faithful rendering of its epoch. These serve to heighten the drama. As the author says in Chapter 38:\\"Troubles certainly often arise from occasion afforded by ourselves; but the most cautious and blameless conduct cannot secure us from them; and, when they come confidence in God alleviates them.\\"Amid the themes of patriotism in the face of Spanish rule and faithfulness that overcomes tyrants, riots and plague, there is no better depiction of leave taking than in this novel. And surely, every Italian immigrant to America must have felt the same stirrings. Indeed, if you have an Italian ancestry, this is your \\"Roots\\". Read this book and soak up your heritage, in ways that you cannot elsewhere.The sad thing is that this is Manzoni's only novel; it is as if Twain had written only Tom Sawyer, or Dickens, only Great Expectations.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"As a Brit I am often baffled by the American obsession with the idea of the \\"Great American Novel\\". Surely American writers have produced so many great novels that it would be invidious to single any one of them out as \\"The Great\\". And what is the \\"Great British Novel?\\" Or the \\"Great French Novel?\\"One nation, however, which does seem to have its own Great Novel is Italy; Long before I read it, I had frequently heard Manzoni's \\"I Promessi Sposi\\" (known in English as \\"The Betrothed\\") cited as The Great Italian Novel - so frequently, in fact, that it gave rise to the suspicion that the phrase might actually mean \\"The Only Great Novel Ever Written By An Italian\\". Although it is less widely known abroad, in Italy the book virtually has the status of a national institution, far more so than does any single British or French novel. (The closest comparison is perhaps with Cervantes' \\"Don Quixote\\" in Spain).This was the only novel which Manzoni wrote, although he lived for nearly fifty years after completing it in 1827. It is a historical novel, possibly influenced by Walter Scott, and set in the Duchy of Milan between 1628 and 1630, a time when that territory was still under Spanish rule. The main characters are a young betrothed couple, Lorenzo Tramaglino and Lucia Mondella, whose plans to marry are frustrated by the intervention of a powerful nobleman, Don Rodrigo, who has taken a fancy to Lucia. Rodrigo forbids the local priest, Don Abbondio, to carry out the marriage, and sends a gang of \\"bravoes\\" (hired thugs) to kidnap Lucia. She manages to escape, but is forced to go on the run, and the book follows their subsequent adventures, through famine, riot, and war, until their final reunion in a plague-stricken Milan.The reasons why this book has acquired the status of a national treasure in Italy are partly historical. It came out during the early years of the Risorgimento, the period of Italian history which saw the struggle to create a unified nation-state free from foreign domination. The first edition was published in Manzoni's native Milanese dialect but he later, significantly, produced a version in standard literary Italian. The novel therefore became a symbol not only of a united Italy but also of a united Italian language.Manzoni's use of a historical setting may have been due to a desire to avoid political censorship. His criticisms of the Spanish Hapsburgs, who ruled northern Italy in the seventeenth century, were widely interpreted as veiled criticisms of the Austrian Hapsburgs, who ruled northern Italy in the nineteenth, but because these criticisms were veiled they did not attract the attentions of the censor in the same way as a direct attack on Austrian rule would have done. In the early part of the book he demonstrates how the absolutist rule of the Spanish authorities was unable to secure law and order. However many impressive-sounding decrees the Spanish governor might issue, effective control of much of the territory lay not with the Spaniards but with the powerful aristocracy who, backed up by their hired bravoes and corrupt local officials, were effectively a law unto themselves. There was an obvious lesson here for Manzoni's compatriots who, whether they lived under the rule of Austria, of the Papacy or of native-born Italian princes, generally lived under absolutist systems of government.Unlike many Italian liberals of his day, however, Manzoni was not, except in his youth, a freethinker but a devout Catholic, and \\"The Betrothed\\" is not only a political novel but also a religious one. The second half of the book is deeply Christian, specifically Catholic, in tone, and this emphasis on Catholic spirituality may account for the book's comparative neglect in Protestant English-speaking countries, where the Catholicism of the Counter-Reformation period has generally been seen in a negative light. Edgar Allen Poe, although his review of the book was generally a favourable one, suspected that \\"something of a zeal for the honour of the Romish (sic) Church had mingled itself in the rich colouring of this picture\\".Poe, however, also admitted that Manzoni was aware of the faults of his church, and there are negative portrayals of some religious figures, such as the self-seeking Don Abbondio, who is too cowardly to stand up to Rodrigo's bluster, and the treacherous nun Gertrude. Both these characters, however, are portrayed as having no true religious vocation, and in contrast to them there are the heroic, saintly figures of the Capuchin friar Father Cristoforo and of Federigo Borromeo, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Milan. Borromeo was a real historical figure, the cousin of Saint Charles Borromeo; if Manzoni's description of his character is an accurate one I am surprised that he too has not been canonised. A key moment in the story comes when the Cardinal brings about the religious conversion of \\"the Unnamed\\", a powerful robber-baron and ally of Rodrigo who, once Lucia's persecutor, henceforth becomes her protector. It is these characters, both saints and sinners, who are the most powerfully drawn in the book, often eclipsing the nominal protagonists. Although Lorenzo- generous, impulsive, occasionally hotheaded- is well-drawn, the simple, pious Lucia often seems a rather weak figure.\\"The Betrothed\\", however, is not simply either a political or a religious tract. It is also a picture of a period of Italian history which will probably be unfamiliar to most English speakers. Manzoni excels in his vivid descriptions of the catastrophes (all real historical events) through which his characters lived- the Thirty Years War, the famine which affected Northern Italy in the late 1620s and the ensuing Milanese bread riots of 1628, the plague of 1630. in addition, the work is also a fast-moving, page-turning adventure story. A Great Italian Novel indeed."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"As an italian reader I was compelled to read the book during my school classes and, quite naturally, did not come to appreciate it at that time. Since then I have read the book quite a few times and I am going to read it once again soon. The plot is the universal one of the difficulty of the poor and weak to resist the rich and evil, and of the powerful force - be it faith, God, hope, kamma or whatever - that helps in this apparently impossible task. In the drama that force takes the part of war, plague, a saint, a restless villain, a corrupted nun and much more.

The framing story concernsyoung lovers whose marriage is thwarted by a local nobelman/petty tyrant in order to win a bet. Subordinate storiesrange from political, economic and biographical analyses of the times toa vivid, eye-opening description of a plague outbreak and the official denialthat exacerbated it. Penman's English translation is superb."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"This is merely to point out that reviews of Manzoni's &quot;The Betrothed&quot; are hopelessly intertangled with reviews of of Elizabeth Elliott's &quot;Betrothed&quot;. Manzoni's book might be the best novel ever written, with stiff competition for this prize, however, from Sigrid Undset's &quot;Kristin Lavransdatter&quot;. Eliott's book is of the romance genre. I haven't read it but feel bold enough to state that it's not even in the same class as the Manzoni book. Maybe, at least, an amazon.com staffer can sort out the reviews and assign them accordingly."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Don't let the fact that The Betrothed has been labeled a classic, nor its length, stop you from picking it up. It's a darn good read, with very believable characters: good, evil, and mixed. The narrator is lucid, witty, and erudite: a joy to spend time with. The translation I read flowed like a delicious cool stream. The story has both intimate moments and scenes of baroque insanity that seem somehow the progeny of the Barber of Seville and the Keystone Cops.The third quarter of the book leaves the story entirely to follow the development of the second plague in Milan from the famine years when it began to its demise--leaving 2/3rds of the population dead. Though this is quite a large detour, the descriptions of the world reduced to this hell and the understanding Manzoni brings to bear on it, are no less engrossing than the story, which he does tie in and resolve before the end of the book. The courage and faith of some of the characters burns all the more brightly when plunged into the darkness of the pestilence. Some are transformed for the good. Others, just hardened.It's too bad Manzoni wasn't as prolific as Dickens. He wrote a second novel, only, which apparently has been published very rarely since the time of its writing. So, The Betrothed is our one chance to be exposed to his great mind and heart. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"One of literature's masterpieces.

Many novels are intertwined into this one novel, many fully shaped, rich characters, some historical, other fictional, play it on the stage of the thirty years war, of the decadence of Italy and Europe, of the plague in Milan. It could be read over and over - so I did - each time it would say something new.In fact this is a book each and every educated Italian used to be very familiar with. Only the works of Dante can compare as for the influence on the education of the Italian.But this is first and foremost a deeply \\"scandalous\\" novel: in the big history, whose horrors Manzoni does not spare us, there unfolds the small story of two little people, two simple, poor, ignorant, peasant kids, \\"vili genti mecchaniche\\": a factory worker, Lucia, and a fisherman, Renzo. They do not have much, they do not ask for much; they just wanted to get married. Their expectations, their lives, are shredded into pieces because of the insignificant, silly caprice of a childish man of power, to whom they are, as human beings, quite simply worthless. While Voltaire ridicules the optimism of his time as he recounts the misadventures of Candide through uncountable horrors, Manzoni instead dares to talk of providence at the same time as he narrates of the young mother in Milan that delivers her dead daughter Cecilia, dressed in white, her hair perfectly combed, to the loathsome \\"monatti\\" (who will bury her in a common grave with other victims of the plagues) while asking them to come back in the evening to pick up the corpses of her other daughter, now still alive, and hers; he dares to talk of love of the God at the same time as he recalls the story of the \\"untori\\", poor innocents believed to be responsible of spreading the pestilence, who were rounded up, tortured and then executed; at the same time as he describes a world with no law but brute force, no justice for the weak, no value for human life. Truly scandalous, I find it. In fact, almost sublimely stupid. After all, \\"a scandal for the jews, stupidity for the gentiles\\", Saint Paul had written of his beliefs.Of course Manzoni is perfectly aware of all that: a former Volterrian himself and an atheist/rationalist before his conversion, the beloved grandson of Cesare Beccaria - one of the most read authors of the age of enlightenment and the father of modern criminology - Manzoni does not renounces his rationalist past; instead he conceive his faith as a completion, and he explores it with the method of reason; here with the methods of historical reason he investigates theology in a very practical way. Whatever our personal beliefs, he will not disappoint us in challenging them.As for the literary quality, the reader can judge by himself, from this excerpt, the episode of Cecilia, that Renzo witnesses in Milan (from http://www.bartleby.com/21/34.html):Having entered the street, Renzo quickened his steps, trying not to look at these obstacles further than was necessary to avoid them; his attention, however, was arrested by a remarkable object of pity, such pity as inclines to the contemplation of its object; so that he came to a pause almost without determining to do so.Coming down the steps at one of the doorways, and advancing towards the convoy, he beheld a woman, whose appearance announced still-remaining, though somewhat advanced youthfulness; a veiled and dimmed, but not destroyed beauty, was still apparent, in spite of much suffering, and a fatal languor--that delicate, and, at the same time, majestic, beauty, which is conspicuous in the Lombard blood. Her gait was weary, but not tottering; no tears fell from her eyes, though they bore tokens of having shed many; there was something peaceful and profound in her sorrow, which indicated a mind fully conscious and sensitive enough to feel it. But it was not only her own appearance which, in the midst of so much misery, marked her out so especially as an object of commiseration, and revived in her behalf a feeling now exhausted--extinguished, in men's hearts. She carried in her arms a little child, about nine years old, now a lifeless body; but laid out and arranged, with her hair parted on her forehead, and in a white and remarkably clean dress, as if those hands had decked her out for a long-promised feast, granted as a reward. Nor was she lying there, but upheld and adjusted on one arm, with her breast reclining against her mother's like a living creature; save that a delicate little hand, as white as wax, hung from one side with a kind of inanimate weight, and the head rested upon her mother's shoulder with an abandonment deeper than that of sleep; her mother, for even if their likeness to each other had not given assurance of the fact, the countenance which still depicted any feeling would have clearly revealed it.A horrible-looking monatto approached the woman, and attempted to take the burden from her arms, with a kind of unusual respect, however, and with involuntary hesitation. But she, slightly drawing back, yet with the air of one who shows neither scorn nor displeasure, said, \`No! don't take her from me yet; I must place her myself on this cart: here.' So saying, she opened her hand, displayed a purse which she held in it, and dropped it into that which the monatto extended towards her. She then continued: \`Promise me not to take a thread from around her, nor to let any one else attempt to do so, and to lay her in the ground thus.'&lt;&lt;One of my favorite chapters has always been Sixth: http://www.bartleby.com/21/6.html"},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"The best type of long novel -- humane and engrossing -- it ends too soon. It's surprising how few people I meet have read this. It deserves better. Do yourself a favor and read it."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"What made me read this, outside of Italy, quite obscure book? Well, Umberto Eco writes highly of it in his On Literature (Harcourt, 2004). Apparently, in Italy it seems to be considered as important as the Divine Comedy.The Betrothed belongs to historical fiction genre. The story takes place during the years 1628-30. Northern Italy is occupied by Spain, and the Thirty-Year War rages in northern Europe. The narrator claims that he is using an old manuscript as the source for his book. Historical events, like the famine of 1628, the siege of Mantua by the Imperial army in 1630, and the plague the invaders brought with them form the framework around the story in the book. Historical and events are woven into the narrative, some key characters like the Nun of Monza, the \\"Unnamed\\", and Cardinal Federico Borromeo are examples of historical characters who interacts with the fictional protagonists.The story centres around the Renzo and Lucia, the betrothed of the title. Local lord, however, wants Lucia for himself, and forces the village priest not to marry them. After the lord's men try to kidnap Lucia, she, Renzo, and her mother flee. During the escape they get separated, and are caught up in the historical events It will take them two years before they find each other and can marry.The writing style could be seen as a little bit preachy with an omniscient narrator. Often the narrator breaks the narrative to make a historical or moral expose, often several pages long. Even though sometimes preachy, Manzoni fills his book with a gentle humour. I have some problems with the religiosity of the author: the theme of the book seems to be that God tests us in any which way he wants, but, in the end, if we keep faith in Him everything will turn out fine. The author himself seems to take the role of God as he writes, since he subjects his protagonists to the most strenuous hardships, but in the end, he lets them be reunited since he has also let them keep their faith in God. It seems like Manzoni wrote this book during a period when he himself struggled with his faith.The opening paragraph of the book gives a birds view of Lake Como, and then gradually zooms down onto the village of Lecco, which is close to the unnamed village of Renzo and Lucia. This perhaps does not sound too exiting, but consider that the book was written in 1842, way before it became commonplace to see the world as if from an airplane."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"In 1628, in a small town near Lake Como in Northern Italy, young Renzo and Lucia are about to get married, when the most powerful man of the region (controlled then by the Spanish Empire), a Don Rodrigo infatuated with the girl, forbids the local priest, Don Abbondio, to marry them, or respond with his life. Renzo tries to deceive the priest, but things get out of control and the young couple, plus her mother, are forced to flee the town and look for the help of Fra Cristoforo, an ex-worldly man turned monk whose turbulent story is told, and who helps Lucia to find refuge in a convent, under the tutelage of a certain Nun of Monza, an enigmatic character whose terrible story is also revealed to us and which constitutes one of the most famous subplots of this novel. While Lucia rests there, Renzo goes to Milan to find refuge for himself in another convent, but there he gets mixed up in political riots brought about by famine caused by war. Chaos ensues, with Renzo being forced to live as a persecuted political offender, hiding with distant relatives, while Don Rodrigo hires the local crime boss, the Unnamed, to kidnap Lucia from the convent. This Unnamed and a new character, Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, capture a good deal of the middle part of the novel, in a struggle between Good and Evil of epic proportions. While all this is happening, to the famine and war that devastate the country is added the 1629-1630 Plague, which haunts the characters with dramatic consequences.A precursor of the late XIX Century's totalizing novel, this melodrama contains it all: the intimate portrait of the characters and their particular stories, with everybody's personal baggage and scars; the historical, economic, and socio-political context of the age, a time of succession wars, famine, plague and violence; the occupants' frivolity and the misgovernment of despotic regimes whose local representatives are pitiless thugs, without a trace of civil order. Manzoni, a deeply Catholic man, tries hard to present the Church in an always favorable light, but his wisdom carries the day, and his three main characters become a perfect portrait of Catholicism's virtues and defects: Don Abbondio, the coward and commodious priest, a true specimen of the clerical bureaucracy; Cardinal Borromeo, creator of the Ambrosian Library, a holy man who governs with common sense; and the Unnamed, the repentant murderer who exemplifies religion's virtues as a redeemer of souls. Magnificent novel of adventures that blends seamlessly with History, fast and tense, with a symphonic structure, which paints a whole age with extraordinary counterpoint and, despite the author's ideological baggage, is enormous, almost perfect."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"Wonderfully written, captures events and issues of the medieval times, such as power of the Church, wheat famine and peasant revolt, the plague and how all these affected the lives of priest, lords and peasant alike. t"},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"I ordered this product thinking it was the full book.

For the reader seeking deeper knowledge of Italy this book serves a couple of purposes.First of all, like War and Peace, it is an historical novel with well-drawn characters inserted into an accurately described place and time. The novel takes place in Lombardy (the area in northern Italy surrounding Milan) between 1628 and 1631. It describes the story of Renzo and Lucia, and the extraordinary difficulties they encountered getting married. The centerpiece of the tale is the Great Plague of Milan, brought to northern Italy by French and German troops engaged in the 30-Years' War. Manzoni's description of the horrible conditions that descended upon Milan is riveting. I Promessi Sposi gives the reader great insight into the history and culture of post-renaissance Italy. Because the book is so good, one can absorb an enormous amount of history painlessly.Secondly, because this is truly the greatest Italian novel, all educated Italians are familiar with it. I can promise the reader who travels to Italy that he will surprise those he meets when he displays familiarity with this beloved and extremely Italian work. I remember discussing the book with several Italians while having dinner in a small village near Milan. I mentioned an episode in the book that I said had taken place near Lake Como.\\"Lecco!\\" I was instantly corrected. They all knew the book and my bonehead error was not allowed to pass.Intellectually a child of the French Enlightenment, Manzoni became a devout catholic and the book reflects his deeply felt religious beliefs. Don't let his didacticism put you off. This is a beautiful book. One hundred years ago it was standard reading even in America, but sadly it is largely ignored here.

Because of its universal themes and well-researched depiction of early 17th century life in Lombardy, this novel deserves to be required reading for history students everywhere.This story poignantly portrays interplay between church and state, widespread famine, plague, politics of tyrants, and territorial wars in ways that helped me understand what these peasants went through better than a history text could have. Talking points in history class after reading The Betrothed might be: The incestuous influence of clergy on politicians and vice versa is why we don't want a church-state. The self-sacrifice of the Capuchin monks shows us why society is better when people follow Jesus Christ's examples of grace and truth. The lawless terror of petty tyrants and their bravos is why rule of law protects us--and is precious enough to be protected. Compare the courage and cowardice of each main character and describe the qualities most important in a ruler/leader. What is government's role in preventing famine and plague? What is government's role in managing famine and plague? Discuss the difference between doing what's right and doing what one feels like doing.At its core, The Betrothed is a love story between Renzo and Lucia. Their marriage is thwarted by a local tyrant and cowardly priest, and they must flee their home village. Their separation and ensuing trials wind through epic historic events of Lombardy in the late 1620s. Comprehending 700 pages of Manzoni's dense descriptions took perseverance, which really put me in protagonist Renzo's shoes for his whole hike through many troubles, toils, and snares to finally marry his betrothed. As Lucia revealed steady, faith-filled character by how she responded to seclusion, betrayal, abduction, and plague, I felt she and hot-headed Renzo were mismatched. Manzoni redeemed Renzo in the end by listing some of the lessons he had learned, so that tempered my unease with the match.The Betrothed is a good story and fascinating book."},{"Title":"The Betrothed","review":"The start of the book was a little slow, however,the author quickly caught my attention with his intimate detailing of each character, as well as their interactions with one another.There was something for everyone in this book: Love, Religion, Adventure, Insight, and Intrigue.

Such detailed accounts are rare in analytic literature and allow us to see a young, inexperienced analyst come to grips with difficult material in a way that heralds her furture contributions to psychoanalysis. Those who are familiar with her clinical writings will recognize the beginning and development of her ability to pinpoint and interpret the origins of unconscious anxiety and sexuality, and those who are not will have an excellent reason to further explore her work.The reader will observe that, despite what would now be considered some infelicitous technical decisions, McDougall manages to reach the heart of Sammy's inner conflict taking all his complexity into account using what, in my opinion, seems a balanced theoretical approach given the times (1954). If the reader's personal experience in child psychoanalysis has not afforded him the experience yet, it will become fairly clear as he reads \\"Dialogue avec Sammy\\" that the different theoretical and technical approaches deal with significantly different pathology and are not mutually exclusive.I would heartily recommend this book to anyone interested in child psychoanalysis (the uninitiated may feel a trifle out of their depth, but it's a thrilling trifle) and especially to those training in child and adolescent psychoanalysis since it will provide them with rare insight into the real process of treating seriously ill children."},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"This book inspired me to back track and read all of Tara Harpers other Wolfwalker novels in the series.

I'm sorry to say, however, that I was very disappointed by Wolf in Night. Although the characters were interesting, they couldn't drive the novel without the help of a gripping plot, which was missing until near the end. Individual scenes carry the whole of TKH's talent for suspense, but they don't merge into a greater plot (not yet anyway - I'll have to wait for the next book). The focus is primarily on characters who haven't done anything significant yet. The suspense often seems out of place, written into scenes that don't merit the attention. I wanted more than vague insinuations about a new plague threat. I feel as though the book were an over-long introduction to a far more interesting story, one I can't access until the sequel comes out.Most frustrating was the language itself, which was so saturated with similes that it actually distracted from what was going on. The similes were often trite, unneccessary, and/or absurd, e.g. \\"tension like bone\\".

Not a hard read either!"},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"I have read all of her books and have been waiting the release of this book in the continuance of the tale caught in the family of Ember Dione.

A must read!!"},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"If you like fantasy books or if you don't like fantasy books it doesn't matter because you'll love this book (and its series). Tara Harper has written an incredible fast-paced, thoughtful, action, adventure story.The characters are believable; you will at times love and hate them. A genuinely interesting setting as well as a very exciting story..... Good reading!I am a long time mystery book reader, but this book has now changed my reading direction towards fantasy/ sci fi. I found this book so enjoyable that I've now almost completed all of Ms. Harper's books."},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"Wolf in Night is a rapid pace action adventure sci fi novel set in a near wilderness civilization on a lost and forgotten planet. Its new central character is a woman named Nori who possesses a psychic bond to wolves that gives her extraordinary sensory advantages over would be predators, both human and animal.I enjoyed how the main story unfolded from the foreshadowing in the beginning chapters and how its threads led to the creation of an intriguing new reluctant hero Nori for this series. Several old and new mysteries about the world are solved along the way. Brilliant but evil characters lurk at every corner. Fast paced action and a thread of philosophy to boot. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"Her expertise is incredible, and I will never forget her stories, or her critique of my writing. The Wolf Series will always be a favorite of mine...I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Wolf in Night :Tales of the Wolves 7","review":"I expected a bit more when I read this book having read all the ones before this one. It moves a bit slow and you can figure out what is happening before it happens. But what realy makes me give this a three star is the editing mistakes and confusion that they cause. Two people talking alone becomes three then back to two, with no one coming or going, and items belonging to one person suddenly comming into the hands of another when they are a distance from one another and the other is using the said item the the other charicter now has, just to name two. Other than that its a pretty good book that leaves you wanting to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"This book was a disappointment. It is as if the author spent a few weekends at the library reading every article every written about the Beasties and then condensed them. Although the author claims to have met the band members, this book reflects no intimate connection with the band or anyone who's a part of the scene and knows how things really were. Everything Angus writes references the magazine article he learned it from instead of actual conversations with the band or people who knew the band. In addition to its superficiality of content, the book's writing is poor. The author's over insertion of esoteric vocabulary words comes off as amateurish instead of sophistocated and clever. Despite it's research paper texture and pretentious writing,this book is somewhat redeemed because it is the only Beastie biography published and contains many interesting factoids about the band's history. So I would reccommend reading it if you are a fan but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"A great overview of the Beastie Boys past to present. It spends enough time on License to Ill, but comes up a little short on their punk roots, and following albums. Doesn't talk much about touring, and is a little too analytical in spots.. Overall a good buy for any Beastie Fan."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"This book really has two seperate entities. The first half is overally academic in it's juxtaposition of the B-Boys in the music world/society. As a die-hard B-boy fan I wanted inside info and stories but the opening pages don't reveal that. Much of the first half is spent covering their tumultuous tour in Europe and pre-License to Ill days. Once Mr. Batey reaches the Check Your Head era, the book picks up. It stops trying to be overally analytical and just tells the story of the greatest band of our era. If you are a hardcore fan, I suggest it. Yet don't be confused, while the title might convey a nice easy read, that's not the case. If you want an easy source of Beastie info/pics check out Ricky Powell's 'Oh snap.'"},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"This book kicks ass! It tells the whole story of the Beastie's rise to fame and has great pictures. It is a must read for any B-Boys fan."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"He's got to do his thing and that's no lie. If Angus Batey's thing is to appear a little over the top in his laudatory worship of the Beastie Boys, perhaps it's his way of freeing up emotions that might not be too different from those of B.Boy disciples' all over the intergalactic planetary. The thing is, the Beastie Boys have, over the years, and through their many stages of development, become a phenomenon in their own right. It's something that's out of their control, 'cause, well, face it, they're pointguards on the court of cool, and I don't think anything they could do in the future would reverse this. This is because Adrock, MCA, and Mike D have put their souls on their sleeves since the inception of the Beastie Boys. Whether they were pissing people off through homophobic, male-centric, and altogether snot-nosed creepiness, or redefining their outlook on the world by helping those less fortunate, they've done it honestly, and with nothing to hide. Batey may have blurred the lines a bit in explaining their reasoning or motivation to address their past publicly, but the gift of his book is the realization that one is always dealing with the Beastie Boys on their terms, and the celebration of that as something highly enjoyable. What I loved most about this book is chapter three's voyage into the formation of hip hop and the point-by-point account of the Beasties' place in it. Never shy of dishing out humerous accounts or recounting the happenings in the early hip hop community, the book makes for a wholesomely fun read, good to the last drop. You might be getting more of a sweet taste than you were bargaining for, but when I'm reading about this group, I'm emptying my piggy-bank at the candy store."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"Angus Batey is God's gift to the printed word. Each passage rings with a clarity and a truth the Liberty Bell would be hard-pressed to duplicate. While most limeys are too busy eating steak and kidney pies and downing pints at the pub to learn how to write, Batey has clearly mastered the craft. The Beastie Boys have grown from a drunk and brash bunch large on talent and small on class, to first class bores but in Batey's capable hands, even their most pious pontificating moments become interesting. Buying this book will add years to your life and make you much better looking."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"I love the BEASTIE BOYS! This book has some rad pictures of the ever so lovely B-Boys and it is good reading material."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"This book, though apparently well researched and full of first hand accounts is nothing of the sort. As a B-Boys fan since the early 80s in NYC, I was surprised that this book so generalized the era and relied almost solely on interviews from the early and mid-90s. Though a fan, I find it very hard after seeing them that the opinions expressed on L to Ill were a joke and meant to be completely taken as such. This book is ill researched propaganda for the now regretful band to cover up their old ways. The author, who is British, had a pretty poor grasp on the impacts and feelings on this side of the Atlantic."},{"Title":"Rhyming & Stealing: A History of the Beastie Boys","review":"The author, who is from England, makes brood assumptions about the Punk Rock and Hip Hop scene in New York City in the early 1980's. He uses these assumptions to vaguely context the era that brought us the Beastie Boys from their roots in Punk Rock to inovations in Hip-Hop. He wasn't there or even in America during this time. I believe he has no idea what the youth of that time were feeling or up to. His sources are b-boy song lyrics(?), and other peoples interviews. The interviews he sites take place mostly in the mid 1990's. This takes away from my validity in what he has to say. He follows this method through the rest of the book. I don't think he has ever met the band, definitely never interviewed them on a profesional level. The book is in large print and thick paper so it looks bigger then it really is(180 pages).

I'm only fourteen, so at times the words the author used, and the fact that one sentence was about 50 words long, made it kinda hard to understand and keep concentrated. But i did learn lots of cool stuff about the beastie boys... it gave a lot of insight as to what many of the lyrics actually mean proving that they aren't just meaningless rhymes. I was a little disappointed that i didnt learn more about the boys' personal lives, but all in all, the book was pretty dope and i would recommend it, but only if you REALLY are a devoted fan."},{"Title":"Biochemistry and Disease: Bridging Basic Science and Clinical Practice","review":"Cohn and Roth really attempted and accomplished something interesting in this excellent overview of the role of basic biochemical forces causing many classes of metabolic and other systemic diseases. The effort is well received because they endeavor to help the biological and medical scientist (or student or professional) stand back from the specific complex mechanisms of one illness or organ and look at more fundamental priciples on display. This sort of effort is rare to find at all, in my experience, in the United States. Our science information tends to come in several distinct published formats, but is most completely described in textbooks. Our texbooks are written in response to the real or perceived &quot;marketplace&quot; and generally teach science &quot;vertically&quot; (top-tp-bottom within defined topic) rather than, .... &quot;horizontally&quot; (across subject areas and folllowing connected scientific principles and broad phenomena). So it is very refreshing to find and possess a book that attempts to integrate basic biochemical events with illnesses, conditions, diseases. I think this sort of book should be brought into science classes much more often (if only as a secondary source). Anyone interested in medical science broadly should consider this book as a reference for a personal medical or science library."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"I got this ebook through Amazon and I recommend that everyone read this from high school throughout adulthood.

I will issue a warning that much of the content is considered New Age, even by todays standards. I imagine back in the 1920s they must have thought that Napoleon Hill was a lunatic. The book is far superior to its sequel, Think and Grow Rich. The book is divided into 15 easy to digest lessons. Hill tends to meander within the lessons (e.g. he sometimes does not get to the actual topic of each lesson until about half-way through) and sometimes leaves you wondering why he titled the lessons the way he did, but the material is very useful. The lessons on Self-Control and Doing More Than What You Are Paid For are worth the price of the book.

One of the best books I ever read, if Oprah swears by it I knew I had to read it. I am on my way to make millions!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"I read all the reviews on Amazon about this product and did other research besides. It was highly recommended by someone whose judgment I respected (Kevin Trudeau), who indicated it contained vital information that was missing from Think and Grow Rich. Hence, I eagerly anticipated listening to this unabridged version of Napoleon Hill's The Law of Success in 16 Lessons (the BN Publishing version).I was extremely disappointed for several reasons, the first being the quality of reading of the information. I listened to all 21 hours or so but could not stand to listen a second time through (though my practice is to listen to educational things over and over and over to really let them sink in). Besides the poor reading, there is nothing new here, nothing that readers of this type of self-help literature haven't heard from a variety of other sources.Here are some of the mistakes from the first few hours of listening to this audio book that made it really tough for me to continue listening:Clergy (clergyman) sounds like cler' ghee - the g sounds like g in gutter (or \\"ghee\\" which is a clarified butter product) instead of the proper \\"j\\" sound - found many times.Pontius Pilate should not be pronounced pon' teus pill ate' - I just about stopped listening after that one.Antagonostic should be antagonistic - even if Hill couldn't spell, the reader should have corrected it so as not to sound like an idiot.Who in America has not heard of the Armour Meat Packing Company? How about arm' wahr which is how it is pronounced on this CD? Five times in the first few hours. When I heard arm' wahr mentioned it distracted me because I'd always wonder, \\"Is this the meat packer guy?\\" I think language is good for one thing and one thing only - effective communication. arm' wahr is a great way to say the name if you are speaking French (I suppose?), but the language of America is English, the American version. It ain't not for nuthin' that we pronounce it arm' er.\\"2 times 3 are 6\\" should have been \\"2 times 3 IS 6\\". For sure. What is the rule? Subject of the predicate is singular so the predicate must also be - or some such thing from the THIRD GRADE.Various and sundry - sundry should be pronounced sun' dree, not sun' dry - found twice early on and several more times later.Lying the foundation should be laying the foundation.Secretarianism should be sectariansim - found twice.Stenographer should NOT be pronounced as sten' oh graffer but rather sten ah' gruff er'.It goes on and on, but my personal favorite is Socrates which the reader pronounces as \\"so crate' eez\\", though I thought pon' teus pill ate' was a hoot, too.It continues on Disc 2 with my favorite being cont' igin (both letters I sound like the I in \\"it\\".) The actual word was contagion which should be pronounced as con tay' gin. It was mispronounced 3 times in about two minutes. The fourth time he got it right. I don't know about you, but personally I would have recorded over the mistaken sections if for no other reasons than I would want to do an excellent job. If I believed this was truly a great work (personally I don't think it is any longer compared to the \\"imitators\\"), or even a piece of absolute trash, there's no way that I would allow for any mistakes.Even if Hill made the above mistakes himself in print, the reader of the audio book should have corrected them. Failing that, the reader's EDITOR certainly should have said, \\"Whoa, fella! Hold up a minute. We need the King's English here because this is a Classic, a Great Work which deserves to be presented in the very best way possible. We want to do a quality job here.\\" Apparently the reader and his editor didn't really feel that Hill's book was worthy of their best. Did this CD set even HAVE an editor?As I said initially, I bought this thing upon the recommendation of Kevin Trudeau. He said it was first on his recommended reading / listening list because it contains \\"gems\\" which no other publication has, information that Hill was forced to take out of Think and Grow Rich because it was so effective that the rich guys didn't want to share it. If that was true, why would they agree to be interviewed in the first place? If they were that dumb to let the cat out of bag, why do we want their \\"secrets\\"? As I went through this I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for a voice to come down out of Heaven and enlighten me with Great Wisdom, but, alas, all kept hearing was a repetition of things, none of which are \\"new\\", none of which are \\"secrets\\", none of which you can't get much more easily in other CDs or books.I've been reading self help books for over 50 years. I love to read them over and over. This is the worst self-help book I have ever read or listened to.Hill's claim to fame was that he had distilled down the Wisdom of all the great moneymakers of the late 19th century, that he had interviewed all these folks over the space of 20 years after being given an intro by Carnegie to each of them, his \\"buddies\\". I was disappointed to hear during the first part of the reading that most of The Law of Success in 16 Lessons was drawn from Henry Ford. Hill made it sound like he had a fixation on Ford, that he was such a genius, a man for the ages, beyond compare. From what I read elsewhere (including a biography of Ford), he had a good product at a cheap price at the right time. Ford was smart but also he had a confluence of fortuitous circumstances, \\"A Series of Fortunate Events\\" (great title for a movie). If Ford was head to head with Toyota today, he likely would not look quite so smart. I was expecting a large variety of ideas from a variety of the world's most successful men - not just ONE smart man.Recommendation: There is much to be learned and so little time, so don't waste it on this bloated tome that is so painful to listen to if you are literate and have respect for the English language. Read the much shorter Think and Grow Rich. You won't miss a thing."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"I have not read book yet.

Believe you can do something hard enough and you'll achieve it . . . if you put in enough hard work."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"This book is an interesting read and defiantly gives you things to think about. I enjoyed it very much, although not quiet a page turner."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"Sometimes, the further back in time we look for truth the more clarity we find in the message. Such is the case with this book. Almost a century later the strength of Hill's message is this: strive to build the right habits in yourself, strive to find others that are in sympathy with you, and nothing can stand in your way. His tone remains inspiring all these years later."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"Those who are familiar with Napoleon Hill's work know that the techniques in his books were proven to work before the books were even written. As Hill has said himself, failure is not even an option to those who follow the techniques persistently.I don't think it would be possible to write a good self-help book without repeating at least one of the techniques outlined in Hill's books. That's probably why I find that most other self-help books do just that - and usually in a redundant and/or confusing way.If you're willing to be open-minded and - again, persistent - your best bet would probably be to go with Napoleon Hill - the original self-help author as far as I'm concerned.Also, it is my belief that the techniques can be adapted and used by intelligent followers of any faith."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"This is one of the BEST books (there are two in the set) that I have ever read for what truly creates real and lasting wealth, as well as what prevents people from the same.The wisdom in this book is timeless, and will definitely show you where you may have been unconsciously blocking abundance in your life, as well as the character beneath to sustain it with a pure conscious.I could quote this book a thousand times. A few of my favorites are:\\"No man has a chance to enjoy permanent success until he begins to look in the mirror for the real cause of all his mistakes.\\"\\"Don't be afraid of a little opposition. Remember that the 'Kite' of success generally rises AGAINST the wind of Adversity - not with it!\\"\\"Is it not strange that we fear most that which never happens? That we destroy our initiative by the fear of defeat, when, in reality, defeat is a most useful tonic and should be accepted as such.\\"\\"Service, Sacrifice and Self-Control are three words which must be well understood by the person who succeeds in doing something that is of help to this world.\\"\\"Charles Chaplin makes a million dollars a year out of a funny, shuffling walk and a pair of baggy trousers, because he does 'something different.' Take the hint and individualize yourself with some distinctive idea.\\"\\"E.M. Statler became the most successful hotel man in the world by rendering MORE SERVICE and BETTER SERVICE THAN HIS GUESTS WERE ASKED TO PAY FOR.\\"There is more in this book of lasting value that can truly make a difference in your life than many get-rich-quick books I've come across. As this great book states, \\"Conceit is a fog which envelops a man's real character beyond his own recognition. It weakens his native abilities and strengthens all his inconsistencies.\\"This book really shows you the stuff wealth is made of. It comes from a pure heart, an open mind that values wisdom, and a person who values people more than dollars. Do that, and you'll come to find more dollars than you ever have before.Along with this book, I recommend \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" (shown above) and \\"Failing Forward\\" by John C. Maxwell if you're looking for more current examples, though timeless and rewarding.They ALL deserve 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"Written by the incomparable Napoleon Hill, this book is like the Bible of Success. You could study it over and over and get something new each time. It's insights are what every success book has been written on since its inception. My favorite part is a tiny section where he goes into his take on the six ghosts of fear and there is a small artists rendering a man shackled to these ghosts trudging through life. It really made me take a hard look at the fears that where effecting my life. If you want a kind of cool condensed version of this book, with fear as the chief villain, there's a book calledSuperhero Success. I picked it up while looking for a book to take with me on a business trip for the plane. It was perfect."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"Like most people I bought Think &amp; Grow Rich along with several other business and positive mind books. A leader in a company that I was associated with suggested The Law of Success. He warned me that it would be a lot of reading. At that time it was two hard back copies, beautifully bound.I asked him if the books helped him. He told me that this set helped him achieve a level of success that was previously unattainable to him. And he told me that this series was much more complete than Think &amp; Grow Rich---it was like attending class. Transcripts from actual Napolean Hill lectures.I found that like Rich, these books helped me to go to levels that I could never reach before as well. Think &amp; Grow Rich planted the seeds and got my interest as well as offered powerful strategies. This 2 book set helped make more sense of the principles, tied things together.The other Hill book that I strongly recommend is Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude. I know that even in todays world, some people bicker at the positive mind books...but guess what? They work! Everyone I know who has achieved any level of success attributes that success to books like these.I know they sure have helped me."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"In defense of a particular audio rendition of this work, I'll make a few points about what we commonly refer to as The Law of Success by Napoleon Hill.Since few reviews list them, the 17 principles of success according to Dr. Hill are as follows:1) The Master Mind - Learn the psychology behind success and how you can use it to enhance your personal power.2) A Definite Chief Aim - Save wasted effort, and focus your heart and mind on a well-conceived, practical purpose.3) Self-Confidence - Overcome the six basic fears and empower yourself without falling into the trap of egotism.4) The Habit of Saving - Master this basic concept and learn to harness your greatest source of personal power.5) Initiative and Leadership - Develop your instincts to anticipate problems and know when to seize opportunities.6) Imagination - Stimulate your mind to create new concepts out of common ideas and put them to work for you.7) Enthusiasm - Overcome uncertainty or shyness, and inspire others to take an interest in you and your ideas.8) Self-Control - Find the firmness of character to truly be \\"master of your fate and the captain of your soul.\\"9) The Habit of Doing More Than Paid For - Take advantage of the Law of Increasing Returns to earn more for service rendered.10) Pleasing Personality - Transform yourself so that you can master your relationships and control any situation.11) Accurate Thinking - Separate real facts from mere information so you can devise definite, practical plans.12) Concentration - Laser-focus your mind on one subject at a time so the plans you create are plans that will work.13) Cooperation - Eliminate envy and greed, and learn to apply the Law of the Master Mind in all of your relationships.14) Profiting by Failure - Train yourself to recognize the difference between failure and what is just a temporary defeat.15) Tolerance - Eliminate mistrust and doubts so you can reap the rewards that come naturally to accurate thinkers.16) The Golden Rule - Use this most basic law of life to ensure cooperation from any individual or group.17) The Universal Law of Cosmic Habitforce - Transform your thoughts and habits so they harmonize with success-consciousness.One reviewer here remarked that you ought to just skip this entire book set and instead get Think and Grow Rich, however a cursory examination of the table of contents for Law of Success and Think and Grow Rich shows that the latter book covers a slightly different set of topics. Law of Success lays the groundwork for a success mentality whereas Think and Grow Rich spreads into the realm of some specific actions which you ought to undertake. To expand out from there in the realm of modern reality, consult works by, say, Brian Tracy, Jim Rohn, Dale Carnegie, etc.As for the Law of Success course, the original text appears to be out of copyright protection, having been first published in 1928, so now we see a plethora of publishers performing the old \\"copyright two-step\\" where an original public domain work is reprinted in its entirety with a few minor editorial touch-ups here or there, some light editing work done, and/or a modern introduction by the editor. Thereafter, the entire work is re-copyrighted. Hence we see a collection of competing versions of the same original text, some of better quality than others. Any hard copy will run between 1,000 -1,600 pages, so check the page count to ensure you get what you are bargaining for.As a personal fan of both the science of self-improvement and audiobooks, I recommend against both the BN Publishing edition and the Audible download edition.The Audible edition is an earlier rendition of the text which contains only 15 original main principles, whereas Mr. Hill gradually expanded his Law of Success central thesis from 15 to 17 over the course of his later life. Additionally, I advise against any Audible product because I cannot in good faith suggest your purchase of any sort of digital media download which contains Digital Rights Management (DRM). With DRM downloads, you run into headaches with playback, copying or burning and ultimately you don't really own the media you paid for.The BN Publishing edition gives the impression of being extremely poorly executed and the final product leaves a bit to be desired. The two-cd set is well-printed, but the text is an earlier version, the quality of the MP3's sound terrible, and the back cover points to the wrong homepage for the publisher(!).Therefore, with neither package do you get the \\"real deal.\\"The best-quality audiobook of The Law of Success is the High Roads Media edition, which you can buy either from the Napoleon Hill Foundation or here at Amazon. It is a 4-volume unabridged set with some minor editing, some more current examples, and editorial clarifications.The Law of Success, Volume I: Principles of Self-MasteryISBN: 1-932429-06-9The Law of Success: The Principles of Personal Power, Vol. IIISBN: 1-932429-08-5The Law of Success, Volume III: the Principles of Self-CreationISBN: 1-932429-10-7The Law of Success, Volume IV, 75th Anniversary Edition: The Principles of Personal IntegrityISBN: 1-932429-12-3This set is a bit more expensive than other audiobook approaches but you get the most exposure to the material for the money. Hard copies of this set are also available and are also strongly recommended.For myself, I am about halfway through the third volume and the going is great. Already my mind and mentality is beginning to shift towards more success-consciousness. I feel better and my \\"success instincts\\" are beginning to sharpen. The content is a bit long-winded and archaic, but very solid and very well-thought out, what with 20 years of active research necessary to produce these insights. I heartily recommend it and it should not be passed over. I wish I had come across this 10 years ago."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"I have try to write a GREAT review for The Law Of Success countless of time so that readers can get THE MESSAGE and acquire it.

Though this book was written back in the 1920's and 30s, the concepts are Universal and timeless. Reading this book opens up whole new horizons in my thinking, and has me going wow.As someone who loves metaphysics, I can state that Napoleon Hill is a very conscious person obviously schooled in the metaphysical laws as well. I love his explanation about energy and the ether, and also the analogy between radio signals, and our own ways of communicating, coinicidences etc.Clearly, he has had phenomenal success as a teacher and motivator, and he has tapped the greatest minds of his time.Motivation, wealth building and success without NH's concepts, would be like music as if the Beatles had never existed. You might appreciate it, but something would be missing.So, I highly recommend this book. If you are into the more metaphysical, check out Creating Money by Sanaya Roman."},{"Title":"The Law of Success, in Sixteen Lessons","review":"As you begin to read the book you sense a familiarity with the subject matter. Almost as though you heard the story before. Quickly you realize you're experiencing the original story.Napoleon Hill was originally responsible for finding the common traits between the world's most successful people. Andrew Carnegie &quot;suggested&quot; this idea to Mr. Hill. As a condition of employment Mr. Hill would have to perform the work without pay. He would have to earn money some other way. Mr. Carnegie helped by providing letters of introduction to some of the world's most successful people.Nearly every book written sine this time has used these same principles with new faces.Get the straight dope from the source.

However the real reason I give 3 stars is that the author has already successfuly condensed his philosophy into a more focused, clear, and readable book called Think and Grow Rich. I read Think and Grow Rich first and I'm not quite sure if the effort/time/money in reading the 800 extra pages in The Law of Success was worthwhile. Sure there are some additional good examples of his philosophy presented, but more than a few are not so good or are rambling or way too long.

Second, and more importantly, the depth of this book is essential to living life the way you want to live it. Not just because you want a few good ideas in your head for a couple days only to be forgotten a month later.For example, what lasts longer: a puddle of water, or an ocean? Of course an ocean.

The book comes in a 2 volume set and is well worth the money ($19.95) for both volumes. The book contains scores of life lessons and examples, and will take some time to read. I will not recommed this book if you have THINK AND GROW RICH or THE SCIENCE OF GETTING RICH by Wallace D. Wattles......

There is a blatant typo or misprint at least every second page (and sometimes many times per page) and, for some reason, lines from other parts of the book will occasionally just pop up in whatever passage you're currently reading, obviously having nothing to do with said misplaced line - and this happens at least a couple times per chapter. I don't know how a book could make it to print with such blatant disregard for any kind of professional standards, but this one apparently has, and it makes for some obnoxious reading.

In my opinion one of the main messages of the bible is to make the world a better place for all of us, so i think the law of success and the bible at least have that in common.

However, I used it as research for one of my historical books and I found it to be extremely informative. Clark has never received adequate recognition for his part in fighting the British during the Revolutionary War and it is a travesty that the Commonwealth of Virginia never paid their war debts and left him to pay them personally. This book shows none of the bitterness one might expect, which provides additional insight into the kind of man he was."},{"Title":"The conquest of the Illinois","review":"This book sounded great from the reviews and the \\"Look Inside\\" preview, - - - even though it stated that the pages were from the paperback version.What was not mentioned is the actual size of the text. The pages are 9 x 6, BUT, only an area about the size of a 3 x 5 index card is printed on each page. This may have been the size of the original book page? since this is a reprint, but it was quite a surprise when I opened the book I had purchased and realized the 214 page book was only going to contain about half of the content that a normal book that size would contain. The letter reproduced in the introduction is so small, I can't read it with a 3x magnifying glass. I have read about 15 pages so far and it seems historically compatible with other accounts of the events covered, So my advice is buy the paperback version of this book OR another title dealing with this subject matter, that will be easier to read."},{"Title":"The conquest of the Illinois","review":"If you're into the life of George Rogers Clark, this little book has most of the excitement..."},{"Title":"Space Facts (Pocket Guides)","review":"I tutor in a disadvantaged area and am constantly looking for books which will catch the imagination of my little friends, especially the kids who are having problems with reading.

What I realized, that not everything the book explains is in the movie. It says that Imhotep said something in the end about love but the movie did not metion that.You have to at least see the first movie to understand the concept of this book and the sequel. Overall, I this is a really awesome book."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I was so excited to see this book come out the other day, since I so eagerly anticipate the films release. I am an avid fan of the first film (my favorite movie), and Max Allan Collins' book. So I was thrilled to hear he would handle the novela1ation of the sequel. I obviously haven't seen the film yet, so I am unable to make a comparison. But from reading the book, I can say the film is going to be the wildest ride! It is the most epic work, and Collins' deft handling of the humour and human relationships is overshadowed only by his ability to craft rollercoaster chills and blockbuster thrills! His handling of bus chase sequence is a standout among many, and his description of the Scorpion King (The Rock in the film) makes him out to be the ultimate eight-legged terror! I was unable to pu the book down until I was finished, which was only about four hours. The author is so good at hooking his audience into the story (just as writer/director Stephen Sommers). I highly recommend The Mummy Returns, it's 288 pages of pure adventure!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I greatly enjoyed \\"The Mummy\\" when it was resurrected several years ago. I recall late hours spent watching Zacherlee and Shock Theater, entranced by the antics of a whole slew of monsters, with The Mummy being one of the most memorable. In those days movies still had to have plots and spooky atmospherics to do what we do with special effects and a truckload of gore today.What made the new \\"Mummy\\" fun was not just the updated effects. It also had just the right tongue-in-cheek attitude. Let's face it, mummy movies are high camp. Abbott and Costello figured it out first, but it took decades before Universal Pictures discovered the same secret.When I discovered that the novelization of \\"The Mummy Returns\\" was available I snapped it up. After all, paperbacks are still cheaper than movies and they can be re-read. Set 10 years later than the original movie, Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan have married and have an 8-year-old son, Alex. They have returned to Egypt seeking the Bracelet of Anubis, an ancient artifact associated with the legendary Scorpion King of Egypt's fabled past. In doing so they trigger an adventure that will have them chasing all over the Egyptian map. For, not far from the O'Connell dig, a group of nefarious cultists are once again resurrecting the mummy of the evil Imhotep, the real star of the first movie.Imhotep's has plans for the Scorpion King and his minions which require the bracelet. He would also like to even the score with the O'Connells, who foiled his first return. When Alex inadvertently puts on the Bracelet of Anubis, and is kidnapped, he triggers a chase scene that stretches from England to Abyssinia. Before Alex (and life as we know it) is rescued, our doughty heroes will be treated to every kind of adventure and mishap, including reincarnation, dirigible rides, pigmy zombies, and the Scorpion King himself.\\"The Mummy Returns\\" is an excellent novelization of what is a movie that is long on fun and action even if it is a bit short on plot. Max Collins does a good job of taking a thin script and turning it into something enjoyable. Don't expect deep insights or serious Egyptology. This is simply a few hours of enjoyable, light entertainment. Have fun!!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I love this book! In other books like the one by John Whitman they leave out parts like when Alex says to Imphotep, my dad's gonna kick your a** it says my dad;s going to kick your ... in the novel by Mr. Whitman. this book is a little more adult."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"This writer is a genius!! His storytelling is superb! I read the first Mummy and then saw the movie. I have read many movie adapations and by far, he is the best adapter of them all. When I heard this one was being released, I immediatly bought it. And as with the first, was never disappointed. He expresses wonderful emotions throughout. His descriptions of the events and how the characters look and feel is incredible!! I am already looking for other books by this author! Another thing about how he writes, you don't feel disappointed when you see the movie. I feel weary reading the book first, before the movie. But never get disappointed! A MUST read for ANY mummy fan!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"The mummy returns is a brilliant work on the part of John Whitman and Stephen Sommers. When the movie came out it was a must see movie on my list but when the book came out,I was thrilled! I liked the movie so much I rushed out to Borders to buy it and the discription was amazing! It felt as if I was having a private screening of the Mummy Returns playing in my head. It was wonderful. It is a must-read book for Mummy fans everywhere. I think everyone should see that magic exists not only in the sanctuary of the theaters, but can also thrive in the privacy of your own home. Now that is special. You can't ever replace the power of reading"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I enjoyed Collins' novelization of the previous MUMMY movie, and figured this one was a safe bet. The story and characters are conveyed well enough, and there are moments of insight and genuine artistry. Alas, I was left feeling that it lacked the polish of the first novelization. Mantra-like repetitions of &quot;puzzle-like tattoos&quot;, &quot;golden mask&quot;, &quot;obsidian-covered book&quot;, and &quot;black blunt-cut hair&quot; were distracting and should have been trimmed. There also seemed to be less depth to the narrative. Not a bad job by any means, given the unforgiving deadlines and other difficulties associated with adapting a script to prose form, but a mixed bag."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"My friend and I have watched the movie a zillion times, and have memorized almost every line. We wanted to read this book because of our love for the movie. This book was the WORST book based on a movie I've ever read! The dialogue was awful, and so were the character portrayals! Evie is portrayed as a racist snob commenting on Ardeth's people (\\"Yes, such amusing notions these primitives have.\\"). Rick is portrayed as a stupid smart-aleck welcoming Izzy (\\"Izzy! Is you is or is you ain't my baby!\\"). Alex is portrayed as a whining baby saying to Lock-nah (\\"I'll just pee in my pants, and I'll tell your boss lady you wouldn't let me go to the bathroom...\\"). Meela/Anck-su-namun is portrayed as a smart, upbeat woman saying to Jonathan (\\"You see, I have a photographic memory...\\"). Jonathan is portrayed as a wise-cracking idiot replying to Meela (\\"That's a coincidence. I have a pornographic memory, myself.\\"). Imhotep is portrayed as a weak, sympathetic man when he is barely able to lift Alex up, and then wags a finger at him, scolding him (\\"Naughty, naughty.\\"). Also, some of the dialogue was not set in the right time period (1934). For example, Alex says that his visions are \\"better than a ViewMaster,\\" and Jonathan says that a picture looks like a \\"surveillance photograph.\\" I was VERY offended at how this book was written!

Buy it and remember DEATH IS ONLY THE BEGINING"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I would recommend this book only to those Mummy fans who cannot wait to know what the movie is about. The story is simple, which this novel does a good job of letting you know what it is about. But this book is by no means a replacement for the action-packed, FX scenes. So read this book but WATCH the movie. The novel will satisfy your curiosity but the movie will thrill you!The part that O'Donnel being the reincarnate of a Knight Templar and Evelyn being the reincarnate of an Egyptian princess is, in my opinion, unnecessary CRAP."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"The Mummy Returns is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen. I find it fresh, original, emotional, and suspensful, and reading the novel is just as gripping as watching the movie.I found the first movie to be very cliched, with Evelyn as a clumsy damsel in distress. In the Mummy Returns, her character undergoes a considerable and very welcome improvement: Evelyn is now as strong as rick, and she even saves the day herself a couple of times. This book is differant from the movie, and that involves the methods of worshiping the scorpian King, but the story still wraps up satisfying"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"This book is well written and is good to read. I felt is is more suitable for teenagers rather than young adults. It gives great detail about everything it describes and is true to the film in every way. Even though it is great to read it fails to focus on the characters views and feelings and skips through important parts. Overall a good book if your a teenager, not an adult."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"This book is a novelization of the film The Mummy Returns, which is the sequel to The Mummy. It is set in 1933, ten years after the first movie. Rick O'Connell and Evelyn Carnahan are now married and have an eight-year-old son named Alex. While in Egypt exploring the ruins of an ancient temple, Rick and Evy find the Bracelet of Anubis. They bring it back home to London. Even though he knows it will anger his parents, Alex plays with the bracelet and accidentally sets off a chain reaction that could lead to the end of the world. When Alex is kidnapped, Rick and Evy must race against time to save their son and prevent the end of the world. I loved the movie The Mummy, and after reading this book I am even more excited about seeing the upcoming sequel, coming to theaters in May."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I've always been a huge book-fan; and let's face it, if you fall in love with a movie while it's still in theaters, you're going to go fairly crazy waiting for it to be released on video once it *leaves* the theaters so that you can finally see it again (only 24 more days until &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; will FINALLY be available to own and watch again and again)----so anytime I fall in love with a movie, one of my first steps is to go racing out to get the novelization.And, to be honest, most of them really disappoint me. &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; was a simplistic version of the script put into the past tense, as near as I can tell; &quot;X-men&quot; failed to impress me as anything special. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was descriptive, but it treated the characters _so_ vastly differently than the movie that it hardly seemed to be telling the same story.So was I pleasantly surprised by the excellence of the novel of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. I absolutely love it. It is descriptive, action-packed, humorous, and fills in some gaps and scenes that the movie either cut or didn't bother with; it filled us in on some loopholes (ie, that mysterious train track in the middle of the desert wasn't far off the base at all). I didn't find it repetitive in the least, nor did I think the character portrayals were off, either. I think it was simply a matter of how Collins interpreted the characters (because, let's face it, they come off differently to everyone); I think he saw O'Connell as a bit more rugged than others do. But I didn't find his portrayal out of sync in the least. That bit of cynicism that Rick has was still there, off-balanced by his good humor. Evy was quite different from how she was in the first one----but the *movie* makes her quite different to begin with! The characters have changed in ten years (what people don't?), and the movie reflects that.Attention is given to all the characters (I especially like hearing about my two favorites, Jonathan and Ardeth Bay), and the book is over-all well written. If you love &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; as much as I do, I highly recommend this book. It's not a flaky read----it's a *quick* read if you want it to be, but not a flaky one. This book is actually trying to say something about friendship and the strength of love----if you give it a chance and keep your eyes open, it might actually touch you. Give it a whirl. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"&quot;Death is just the beginning.&quot;~ImhotepMax Allan Collins does an excellent job in this movie novelization of 'The Mummy Returns'. He manges to bring the excitement and adventure from the movie to the pages of his book. Max Allan Collins has a lot of description here and you can picture each scene so vividly in your mind, it's almost like watching the movie again! 'The Mummy Returns' is filled with the same wondeful wit and humor in the first novel, Evie is my favorite. She cracks me up! One little thing that I have to throw in, I think that people love 'The Mummy' series so much because it's really original and funny and takes place in very exotic places, places that most of us only dream about going to. I suggest reading the novelization after you see the movie (which makes sense). It's an awesome action adventure movie and not to be missed!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"The Mummy Returns was funny, action packed, and very suspensful. I thought all of the actors and actresses did a great job. I thought it had a lot of action, and at the same time there was less action when I felt they should call it quits for a couple of scenes. Overall I felt I should give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"For kids this would be great, but not for a 12 year old. This book really left out a few great parts in the book.

Its funny and it seems so much like it could be possible."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"I watched the movie and fell in love with the characters. When I read this book it made the movie even better! There are parts of the book that the movie didn't cover that enhanced the story and made the good characters even more likeable...and the bad ones even more creepy!"},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"Realizing that the screenplay was written first, I expected the book to follow the movie rather closely. It felt as though this book was written not from the final script, but rather from an early draft. Mr. Collins' novelisation follows the movie closely in the area of plot only. Not many of the classic movie lines were actually in this book (very disappointing). Not many lines altogether matched up with the on-screen version. The novel portrayed Rick O'Connell to have more of an Indiana-Jones-cynical sense of humor, rather than the casual humor shown on screen. Almost the entire portrayal of the O'Connell's son, Alex, was off: Collins portrayed him much younger (and maybe more of a real-world 8 yr old); his spunk didn't shine through as much as it did in the movie.Depth was missing in this novel. Characterisation was also off. If you're looking for a way to &quot;relive&quot; the movie, or see it in more detail, skip the novel and watch the movie again."},{"Title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"So, The Mummy was great. The Mummy Returns was awesome. Now, the book, The Mummy Returns is Excellant! If you want entertainment, read this book. If you loved the movie, read this book. If you want a book that'll keep you intrested to the very end, and then it'll make you want to read it again, this is THE book. Even if you've seen the movie, you still should read this. If you haven't seen the movie, then read the book and then see the movie. Or see the movie and read the book, it dosen't matter...It's still worth your while. The only thing is that it's ALMOST identical to the movie, except a few situations. And when reading, they make the Scopian King sound much better than what he looks like in the movie. Which he looks like a giant... crab! But all 'round this is not just another book, to add on your list. It's a GREAT book that will satisfy your entertaining needs.

If you like a book that gives you excitment, thrill, and a surprise ending you'll love this book.This book takes you back to Egyption times and relates it to the present. The Mummy Returns is a sequil to the excellent movie The Mummy. This wonderful book deals with Egyption Kings and queens who are trying to over power normally people who diddn't know that there dreams releated them to an Egyption queen Nefertiti. They find out they have to fight to save the world. The book is mainly about people trying to over power each other, who loves who the most, lies, fighting, flesh crawling bugs, killing,and kidnapping. The book starts off norammly but then it takes a turn for the worst but that is when the excitment gets going and just when you may think it is over it is just getting stareted. Over all this was an excellent book and I hope you enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Nature Out of Place: Biological Invasions In The Global Age","review":"Global ecology books are generally interesting because they gather diffuse and disparate data about the dynamics of terrestrial life into a syncretic whole which allows us a glimpse of events occuring on a global scale. This book, released last year, is probably a fairly current snapshot of certain pressing global happenings regarding native and invasive species, and provides sufficient corroborating resources for the hard scientist (no troublesome endnote numbers in the text, but the supporting references do appear in the endnotes at the back of the book). The popular science reader is well attended to as well in this book by the lack of distracting endnote numbers in the text and the moderate but sufficient statistical data intercalated into the text.The other interesting aspect of this book is the style in which it is written. The authors are a father and son team who write alternating chapters in two distinct styles that nonetheless blend well with one another and are rather self-enhancing rather than distracting. The father portion of this duo, Roy Van Driesche, teaches biological control at UMass, Amherst, and tackles the essay-style chapters on more general subject matter. The son, Jason Van Driesche, a graduate student of environmental studies at UWis, Madison, writes the 1st-person particular accounts of specific, ongoing invasive species problems. The alternating styles tend to break up what could have become a dessicated excercise in patience into a more palatable and enjoyable romp through the ecology of noxious invasive species and the current human responses to them.The thesis of the book is, of course, how hundreds of years of unchecked waves of invasions by people and their concomitant pests, whether by invitation or as stowaways, is leading to a species homogenization, whereby the unscrupulous and hardy experts of survival: humans, rats, feral cats, weeds, fungi, etc. have and continue to decimate the more delicate and isolated species that simply cannot compete against the obviously hardier and more adaptable species. It's ecological whining at its finest, but the facts, as always, carry the day.I particularly enjoyed son Jason's chapters, which are largely based on interviews with the locals who must deal with such problems. For example, leafy spurge on the great plains of the United States has been claiming untold acres of land generally used for grazing lands for ranchers (whose wards traditionally munch on, as it were, some invasive grass species of yore, you just can't win). Cattle shun leafy spurge, so the sustainable number of cattle per acre has diminished, distressing local cattle men and forcing them to take action or suffer the consequences (these are not your typical tree-huggers, but macho cowboys who probably smoke Camel non-filters). This setting is then revealed as a success case of biological control, father Roy's bailiwick, wherein asian beetles were imported to counterattack the otherwise indescriminately spreading green plague. The two styles really compliment one another in this regard. The discussions of island ecology regarding Hawai'i, Guam, New Zealand, and Santa Cruz island are also timely, interesting, and well covered. It's edifying to read in this book how public and private groups are beginning to take heed of these serious problems and actually legislate in favor of resistance to invasive species once and a while, but it's also frightening to realize such political action is occuring in mostly developed nations, and that vast, uncharted ecological and political events in undeveloped nations are generally not even under consideration. Apparently it's a jungle out there and the jungle is being remodeled at a blistering pace. All in all, a good read any bonified naturalist will admire."},{"Title":"Nature Out of Place: Biological Invasions In The Global Age","review":"I found this book to be a refereshing look at biological invasions.

Thanks a lot!!"},{"Title":"Absolut Book.: The Absolut Vodka Advertising Story","review":"Much as I hate to admit it, editors add more value than authors often appreciate. This book is a good example of missed potential for good editing.The book contains almost 500 Absolut ads, and some of the rejects. What I did not realize until I looked at this book was how much bad Absolut advertising has appeared. Clearly, this volume would have been greatly improved by eliminating about 450 of the images in it. There is also a lot of text about how the ads are created, with a lot of pats on the back for the importers and agency involved. But there is relatively little about the creative process, and what works and what doesn't.If you want to learn more interesting details about Absolut, I suggest that you acquire the newer book, Absolut, the History of the Bottle, instead.Absolut advertising is all built around the formula of the word &quot;Absolut&quot; followed by some other word or words intending to say &quot;Absolute X.&quot; While the lines are almost always good, the execution of how well the images fit with the text often leaves something or a lot to be desired. In other cases, the visuals are just plain ugly.As the text suggests here, the idea was that &quot;Absolut would be a product that could laugh at itself.&quot; That position is missed when the image is either almost irrelevant or unattractive. It just makes Absolut seem like it is a reflection of bad taste.The mood for the ads was supposed to be light to &quot; . . . add a dollop of humor so the 'We're the best' claim wouldn't be quite so boring or prententious.&quot; Well, you'll have to judge for yourself, but the ads seemed to have badly strayed from that standard.Just so you won't think I dislike the campaign, here are my favorite ads in the book (I have eliminated &quot;Absolut&quot; from the titles to save space): Perfection, Joy, Peak, 19th, Harmony, L.A., Manhattan, Haring, and Appeal.The other thought that bothered me was treating expensive vodka advertising as art. What's the social benefit here?After you have finished considering the book, I suggest that you examine how you can add beauty to the world through your life and your work.A votre sante!"},{"Title":"Absolut Book.: The Absolut Vodka Advertising Story","review":"This is a wonderful, informative, and beautiful book.This book is about the Absolut Vodka advertising campaign.

Fleeing an empty existence in New York City during the mid 1930's, Victor travels down to South America in search of primitive instruments and to discover their importance to the indigenous cultures he will encounter there. Venturing deeper and deeper into the jungle, Victor feels as though he is traveling farther and farther into history and farther away from his chaotic life of New York City. The simplistic and peaceful lives of the many tribes he finds deep in the jungle, and their beautiful musical instruments and primitive beats, cause for deep thought in Victor because of the almost overwhelming difference between the world he finds himself in and the world of the United States. This great contrast sets forth an amazing story both of adventure and deep intellectual thought of this time period.The book will take one on a journey into the depths of the human mind, the streets of New York City, and into the dense South American jungle. Never boring, the book is a page turner and will entice each and everyone who reads the book to travel, think and understand what was going on in the United States during the 30's- both the good and the bad. The book also sets up great discussion between intellectuals who know and understand the study of primitive instruments. The book is beautifully written, beautifully told and is simply great. This is a must to read to let your mind go into the deep jungle and into the concrete streets."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"I've read thousands of novels that I cannot remember clearly, and this is one that has stayed with me for more than 20 years. I have thought of it repeatedly the last few months while walking in the woods and observing how the trails change with the seasons (a crucial part of the plot) and thinking about what life would be like if we were cut off from civilization the way the main character in this book is. The theme of this book is as beautifully executed as a classic opera and is especially meaningful if you are a music lover. I'm delighted to know that the book is still in print so that I can easily reread it and give it as a gift to people important to me."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"This great adventure novel was first published in 1953 and many of the scenes in this book seem prototypes for others I've come across in Latin American fiction. It is a story of a modern, educated, well traveled man, fleeing from the horrors of Europe leading up to WWII, to the Americas, who is then transposed into a world where the people still live in the stone age, a hidden city in the jungle and a bubble in time.Our hero &amp; narrator dreamed when young of becoming a great musician, but has long since sold himself out just for the sake of earning a living. He rarely sees his wife, an actress, because they both have busy schedules that seldom coincide. One day a fated encounter with a museum curator he knew in his youth leads him to a mission into the jungle to find and bring back the most primitive of musical instruments and to gain anthropological insights on the origins of music. The musician, who begins the trip with his mistress, ends up on his own cut off from civilization. In the jungle he at last able to find an inner peace and happiness, he finds a new woman, regains his health &amp; vigor and at last is able to release the musical score he has always known was inside him. By the time his wife has a plane sent in as a publicity stunt to rescue him, he does not want to return.This novel is deeply philosophical, in the end our musician can no longer find a place in either world, and the message is we can't go back, also theories about early humans which have been arrived at only by studying archaeological artifacts can only be flawed, to quote &quot;New worlds had to be lived before they could be analyzed&quot;."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"Every once in a while I pick up The Lost Stepsand savour it again. Each paragraph is a magical adventure.Reading The Lost Steps is like taking a mystical journey into the soul of Latin America. Harriet de Onis's translationcaptures the magic."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"Unfulfilled by writing commissioned film scores and disillusioned by the pretence and vacuity of his life in New York, a composer takes up an offer to go to the Amazon jungle to look for the rudimentary musical instruments that would provide evidence of a theory about the origin of music that he had developed as a student. The original plan of taking the money and his lover and defrauding the university so that they could enjoy an extended holiday in South America goes badly wrong when they unexpectedly get caught up in a revolution there and are forced into the jungle. Travelling at first with his mistress from New York and then with a mestizzo lover taken up along the way, the book describes in wonderful Baroque prose the awesome scale and sense of time reversal that he experiences in his dark, dripping travels into a world of perpetual greenness. He senses that he is retracing the steps of humanity. Finally, deep in the jungle he is faced with having to make an almost mystical choice about his life and life work. The \`simple' life is uncompromisingly portrayed in its pitiless and raw brutality and yet somehow the \`noble savage' still retains the essence of humanity, a survivor in the natural world stripped of the worthless accoutrements and gadgets of modern life. This is at once adventure, allegory, love story, morality tale, and academic tract, but above all it is storytelling at its majestic best, a minor masterpiece of post-war literature.Carpentier was the first writer to coin the phrase \`magical realism' where myths, fables and religion are interwoven into narratives without faithful adherence to time or reality. The form is taken to its extreme in Garcia Marquez's Autumn of the Patriarch, and these two authors remain magical realism's most accomplished exponents. Although the style has influenced writers worldwide, for me it doesn't seem to work beyond Latin America."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"The novel The Lost Steps by Alejo Carpentier is a beautifully told story of an anthropologist/composer who seeks to understand the often confusing world we live in.

And one of the most remarkable creators of this explosion is Alejo Carpentier. Reasonable people may differ regarding who is the greatest Latin American novelist, but surely Carpentier must be ranked among them, and \\"The Lost Steps\\" is his most widely read work.The plot of \\"The Lost Steps\\" can be summarized very simply. The narrator, a naturalized American citizen living in New York City, once had youthful ambitions to become a composer. However, he now finds himself earning a living doing musical hack work, e.g., jingles for TV commercials. He is married and also has a mistress. When the novel opens, he has not had any work commissioned in a while and is starting to feel desperate. A friend who is a museum curator offers him the opportunity to go to an unnamed South American country to find a rare musical instrument. The narrator cynically sees this as an opportunity to have an expenses-paid trip with his mistress, but as the trip progresses he feels his dormant musical creativity being revived. He eventually finds the instrument he is looking for. He also meets a primitive, illiterate, mixed-race young woman by whom he is initially repulsed but with whom he eventually falls in love and cohabits with. His mistress leaves him and goes back home. He ends up living with his mistress in a small, inaccessible village deep in the jungle; the only other inhabitants are a native tribe and a few merchants of European descent. He believes that he has now found true happiness, away from the corruption and decadence of modern civilization. He forgets all about his obligations to the museum that sponsored his trip and vows never to go back.One day his idyllic bliss is shattered when a helicopter lands and he learns that his \\"disappearance\\" has become front page news in the US. His wife and his museum sponsors have sent a search party to look for him. He realizes that he has no choice but to go back, although he desperately wants to stay. He promises his native lover that he will be back as soon as he can. When he gets back home, he discovers that he has become a celebrity, at least for a while, but he is miserably unhappy. His pregnant wife files for divorce, and the newspaper that sponsored his rescue now regards him as a traitor and deceiver and portrays him in the most negative light possible. His sources of income dwindle. He is reunited with his mistress but is repulsed by her and wants desperately to return to the village.Nearly a year passes before he is able to attempt to get back to the remote village. Getting there involves a water passage, and he finds to his horror that the rains that have fallen in recent months have caused the water level to rise to the point that the river covers the steps that were his marker for the jungle path to the village. He has no way to return to the village! Shortly thereafter he learns from someone who occasionally visits the village that his primitive lover has married someone else in the village. He is devastated. He suddenly realizes that he was never accepted by the people of the village or by his lover, that he was always regarded as an outsider who was only there temporarily and would never stay. Reluctantly, he decides to return to New York, realizing that he has no other choice.This simple synopsis does not to justice to the richness of this novel. Even in translation, the richness of Carpentier's prose comes through: his fluency with words, his mastery of sentence structure, his mastery of metaphor and allegory. This is a novel of immense erudition, replete with literary and musical references. One of the novels messages, I think, is to enjoy and savor the peak experiences of life when you can, because they won't last and they won't come back again. Another message is that perfect happiness is unattainable and that most humans need to be content with what they are able to attain. In short, this is a work of incomparable richness that I can recommend unreservedly."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"In this book, a Latin-American seeks to flee Europe for what he considers his roots. It is very important that we not confuse the narrator with the author. One of the author's many messages is that this kind of return to one's roots is impossible. The author subtly makes fun of his narrator to illustrate this. The tragedy of the book is that there is no escape for us into another culture, flawed as our culture may be.May I say that I was assigned to read this book in a comparative literature course at Berkeley over thirty years ago, but managed to avoid getting any more than the most superficial impression of it. But, hey; those were the sixties!My professor thought that this was an outstanding example of 20th century Latin-American literature, and I believe it is considered a classic. It is a book well-worth trying. Do not be frightened by the continued use of unfamiliar musical terms to express metaphors."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"First, anyone who criticizes this book for being pretentious and somehow hypocritical COMPLETELY misunderstands it. The irony that permeates almost all of the narrator's criticisms should be enough to tell you that this is not the case. The main theme of the work is the futility of the human will before the passage of time, amongst other subthemes that are wonderfully woven in. This is an absolutely beautiful book whose power brought me to tears a few times. I've read both the spanish and english versions and Onis's translation is very very well done-almost to the point that I enjoy her version more than the original. But, anyway, pick up this book, you won't be disappointed I promise you."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"Make no mistake, this is difficult reading. There were times when I wanted to put the book down because the narrator becomes so tedious. But I completely feel that it was worth it. By the end, I cared about the characters and felt that I had accompanied the narrator on his spiritual journey. I loved it and might actually read it again in the future. (I am not going to make specific comments on the novel's content because it seems that other reviewers have already taken care of that task)In response to some reviewers who had a problem with \\"pretentious\\" or \\"jaded\\" discourse of the narrator, I believe that this novel would not have the same meaning without such a narrator. He is constantly thinking that he has found the key to life or a secret to solving all of his problems--principally by returning to a simpler life--, but the narration shows his complete inability to do that (even when he thinks that he has). In the end of the novel he addresses this, saying that such a simple life (i.e. the prehistoric, Enochian time period of Santa M&oacute;nica de los Venados) is not meant to be intellectualized but rather experienced. The narrator is incapable of this kind of life, and his world view often clashes with it. If the narration were less complex, this truth would be less apparent, as it would not achieve such a stark contrast with the simplicity of its surroundings.Also, another note about the style: This novel was written in Spanish. In Spanish, the concept of a run-on sentence does not exist and Carpentier exploits this. If you don't like run-on sentences or intellectual \\"Baroque\\" style narration, then this may not be the book for you.Favorite quotes (if nothing else, Carpentier's phrases are beautiful when he's not filling them when obscure references):\\"Un d&iacute;a, los hombres descubrir&aacute;n un alfabeto en los ojos de las calcedonias, en los pardos terciopelos de la falena, y entonces se sabr&aacute; con asombro que cada caracol manchado era, desde siempre, un poema.\\"\\"Casarse es caer bajo el peso de leyes que hicieron los hombres y no las mujures\\" (especially after I had found the narrator horribly sexist)"},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"Frankly I don't see the &quot;connection&quot; between this book and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;... Different time, different book, different language, different continent... only the ignorant could conflate them. The Lost Steps is not a hypocritical, pretentious condemnation of pretention. It is a condemnation of the sort of empty commercialized work that prevents one narrator from finding his voice as an artist. The Lost Steps is the story of a hispanic musician/intellectual who lives in the modern city (sounds like New York to me) and makes a living writing jingles for commercials. He has the opportunity to make a long journey to a very different place in Latin America. The journey liberates him creatively so that he is able to find his &quot;voice&quot; as a musical artist. Not a bad story. As for the complaint that the narrator's language is riddled with words and metaphors from music should not trouble us when we consider that the narrator is a highly trained musician. Artists frame the world around them in the language of their craft. There was a time - not more than 60 years ago, in fact)when everyone who was &quot;educated&quot; could at least read a little sheet music and play a little bit of piano and those funny Italian terms that today sound like a foreign language were once understood by most everyone. The ignorance of today's readers is no basis for condemning the author as &quot;pretentious&quot;. What I liked most about this story were those moments of brilliant prose where the narrator's (and the author's) love for Latin America shines through. The narrator's journey portrays Latin America in terms of &quot;Lo Real Maravilloso&quot;, the marvelous reality where 20,000 years of human history have been superimposed and condensed within a single geographic space, making that space a unique place distinct from all other geographic spaces. If you are fascinated by &quot;Lo real maravilloso&quot; of Latin America, its cultures, its history, and you like stories about narrators who seek and find their artisitic voice (an over-used plot, perhaps) this is an enjoyable read. And no, you don't need to be a classically trained musician to appreciate this book!"},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this novel.Before anything else I must say that the writer has an extraordinary use of the Spanish language.What is most attractive are his descriptions, however his constant use of citations in French,German and English become somewhat tiresome (I do speak the languages)together with the endless citing of works of Art or Historical events. I cannot help but find it pretentious.Then we have the part were he describes the good woman of old - always there to serve the husband and attend to his slightest whish - is this machismo or not!!Unable to live any further in a society he despises ,he travels to the place where everything in still pure and noble, he is totally taken in by it and falls in love with a local woman.However he treats his lover like a piece of dirt, making love to the other when she lies half death in her hamac.She is not the perfect companion but a human being nevertheless.Much as I try I am unable to like the speaker in the book.So I find myself with the dilemma that I like his writing but probably not the way he thinks. So I give three stars which are very much deserved but cannot give more if I want to be honest with myself."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"I first heard of,'Lost Steps' about the time of its author's death in 1980 and ticked it off for a future reading that has waited more than two and a half decades. It's a big prize winner, carrying cult status. But these attributes notwithstanding, I found it too ponderous to raise an hurrah.Latin American 'magic realsim', I suggest, was more of a novelty when,'Lost Steps' made its mark. Jaded bougeoise seeks to revamp his creative energies in Amazonian jungle by contact with 'primitive' indians, their instruments and culture. Within the text the narrator flags that this surrealist motive had wearied during its halcyon days of the 20s and 30s. More than once Rene Daumal's,'Mt Analogue' sprang to mind with similar 'deep' pronoucements and promises of and from an enchanted world. One could say the piling of metaphor upon metaphor entirely expresses the fecudity of tropical forests or the baroque tendencies of an angst-ridden, fatigued intellectual. But why don't these similar excesses beleaguer Cormac McCarthy's great,'Blood Meridian'? Is it that McCarthy's sensibilities are closer to ours and that for all his biblical portent, he is more open to the aesthetic and moral disorder that we inhabit? Carpentier refuses to drop his moral superiority during brilliant reveries of geology, birds, music, and whatever. And he doesn't like 'back there' in the city. For me, the battle wasn't with the musical erudition but the canopy of hyperbole that shaded too much of the ground life. The action was sluggish, and the presumtions that the reader might be enlightened by strings of proper nouns that lack explanatory power, a trifle too demanding. Perhaps the narrator's prayer for a poetry of the city equal to that of an Amazonian snail shell was answered within a few years by Bobby Rauschenberg's art. He ferreted stuff from New York's gutters and junkshops to make a gregarious art that would stupify Carpentier's stuffy, opinionated narrator and render those earlier Surrealists' excursions into the second hand as so much preciousness."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"this book is about our roots,about how we find what we have left behind by leaving and forgetting about our precious past.this story is peppered with the sound of music through it all, music which carries pace with the story and is mingled and transformed into a symphony in the narrators head. i really enjoyed reading this little cute book even when sometimes the pace of the story is slow due to the detail descriptions but the novel is really worth the effort. LUIS MENDEZ luismendez@codetel.net.do"},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"The Lost Steps takes the reader on a vivid and deep, mystical, magical journey. Whether read as an adventure story into the cultural roots of humanity in Latin America or as an adventure into rich, literary symbolism, Alejo Carpentier's masterpiece is a work that can be read again and again.Carpentier's ability as a skilled craftsman in the art of writing comes through whether he describes a journey over the Andes, a revolution, or the barking of dogs in a Indian village.Harriet de Onis has provided us with an incomparable translation from Spanish to English of this work of art. In my opinion it is the BEST work of fiction of the 20th Century. Test it for yourself."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"This book reminded me lots of Malcolm Lowry's \\"Under the Volcano\\". In both books the self-destructive main character sort of moves from fascinating episode to episode, while the overall plots are seemingly not that relevant. In both books, these episodes take place in exotic, vividly described Latin locales. Also, in both books, there is bunches of deep philosophizing and erudition, which don?t make for the easiest reading around.All in all, I enjoyed \\"Lost Steps\\" as I enjoyed \\"Under the Volcano\\". Somehow I feel Lowry?s work is the greater. Perhaps the autobiographical tint in \\"Lost Steps\\" contributes to somewhat mundane finale. And some of the moments of philosopy do get grating. But this is still very good stuff, and I do recommend it for those inclined towards very serious fiction."},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"Well, any book that requires you to know a lot can be accused of being pretentious. This book expects the reader to have a passing knowledge of Latin American geography, botany, zoology, religion, some classical music, some 20th century world history, some vocabulary.... well, it just expects you to be a literate reader. You know, the kind of person that would read The New Yorker instead of Seventeen.This, to me, is the most fascinating thing about \\"Pasos Perdidos/The Lost Steps,\\" in that it challenges the reader to apply everything that he or she might have learned along the way in life, and get a thrill from doing so.Carpentier is one of the neobaroque writers who explore how the Latin American landscape and political culture contribute an entire new aesthetic to the world heritage, taking certain elements from the Spanish baroque but hybridizing it in a new climate, with new indigenous elements to form a completely new style of baroque culture. The moment, for example, that the narrator begins composing his original score, is the moment that he emerges from the Roman Catholic Mass in which he has been baptized (previously he was a cultural Lutheran), and gazes upon the liana vines hanging from the trees, and remembers strains of a Palestrina counterpoint. This fusion of American landscape, Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation ideology of incarnation and European aesthetic heritage is what (in)forms the American Baroque for Carpentier.Yeah, I love a good excuse to be \\"pretentious\\" myself, now and then. Thanks for the opportunity! :D"},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"This is the best literature I have read in my life! Alejo makes the story come to life, putting you in the middle of it. I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys good books"},{"Title":"The lost steps","review":"This book is perhaps the most horribly pretentious work of literature I've ever read. Some people write books out of passion or a desire to express emotion. Carpentier, however, wrote this book simply for the purpose of writing literature. It is ironic that Carpentier spends much of his book ridiculing the pseudo-inetellectual community for their pretentions to greatness, while in fact he is the worst of them all. References to works of literature and music seem out of place and cited only to prove the author's familiarity with them. If you want a better treatment of the same theme, read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness instead. The Lost Steps is not worth touching with a ten foot pole."},{"Title":"From Bapaume to Passchendaele 1917","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone interested in First World War history.

Haldane was a brilliant and eccentric mathematical biologist who was one of the three founders of mathematical population genetics in the 1930s and 40s. He was also arrogant, irascible, witty--and a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of the U.K. He wrote a regular column on biology for the Communist \\"Daily Worker\\" and many of the articles are simply superb. But in his concern for social justice, like so many Leftist intellectuals of the period, he was able to turn a blind eye to the horrors of Stalinism and to rationalize the Party line, whatever it might be. Ultimately, to coin a Marxist phrase, his own \\"internal contradictions\\" tripped him up, as the Soviet Union, for ideological reasons, decided that Mendelian genetics could not be true and simply banned the topic in favor of a neo-Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (\\"Michurinism\\" or \\"Lysenkoism\\"). The basic problem was that if the genes were fixed and invariant, no amount of social engineering could create a \\"new Soviet man\\" in a biological sense--genetically-determined selfishness could not be eradicated. Eventually the repression of his own science in Russia became too much for Haldane, who quietly resigned from the Party (he had joined with great fanfare) and moved to India, where he became a practicing Hindu (he found Hinduism to be inherently dialectical). This memoir by his wife, who led him into the Party but left it before he did, is a fascinating if little-known (and long out-of-print) portrait of the psychology of a man \\"born to rebel.\\" The personality described could fall anywhere on the political spectrum--except in the reasonable middle."},{"Title":"She's Got The Look","review":"I'll be the first to admit I adore Leslie Kelly's books.

It just doesn't get any better than this.Out with friends one night and slightly drunk, Melody Tanner once made a list of five men she could sleep with no matter what. It was a joke. But now six years and one nasty divorce later, she comes back to Savannahs and finds out two out of the five on her old list are dead.To make matters even more embarrassing, the number one hunk on her infamous list, Nick Walker, former Marine hero and cover of Time magazine, is the detective sent to question her about it.I'm putting SHE'S GOT THE LOOK on a list, too.

But still totally sexy.The heroine and her friends sounded like women I know and left me wanting to read more about the four of them.I am not a big mystery fan so having just a bit of a who done it was perfect for me. This is not a suspense novel and it is definitely not a chick lit, despite the cover. It's pure sexy contemporary romance novel. If you like Rachel Gibson, Julie Orloton, Susan Donovan, etc., give this one a try!"},{"Title":"She's Got The Look","review":"Leslie Kelly creates the kind of characters I don't want to leave. For me, that's the ultimate read-when I want to spend a little more time with these guys, or crave to see more of them in another book. Hint...hint. Or I absolutely need a few more laughs. Ms. Kelly hits the mark. The heroine, Melody, took me along with her, tugging me right out of my hectic, yet boring, little world and into an adventure where she falls for a HOT homicide detective.The story was pure fun, engaging with just the right amount of mystery to keep me turning pages.

Number 1 man on her fantasy list turns out to be the lead detective on the case.

While they are making the list, a Marine appears on the television who so grabs Melody's attention that she makes him #1 on her list. Now six years have passed and Melody, newly divorced from her cheating husband, is trying to start a new life for herself. But when men on Melody's list begin mysteriously dying, it looks like Melody may have a stalker.One of Melody's best friends, and former bridesmaids, sets her up to meet with homicide detective Nick Walker about the situation. When she arrives at dinner, Melody is stunned to discover that Nick is the Marine from her list. Once he learns her name, Nick, who has accidently seen her list in the past, knows exactly who Melody is and his place on the list.A fact that makes Melody very uncomfortable, especially since she's so attracted to him. Now Nick has to protect Melody while trying to find her stalker. But the more time Nick spends with Melody, the more he finds himself falling in love with her, adding to his determination to protect her. Melody also finds herself falling for Nick, but she's afraid to jump into a new relationship. Once the problem with Melody's stalker is solved, can Nick convince her to take a chance on him and on love?I have been looking forward to She's Got The Look since I read Leslie Kelly's She Drives Me Crazy. I found myself wishing that Nick and Melody had spent more time in Joyful, the town featured in She Drives Me Crazy, and also that there was a little more closure in this book with Nick's ex-wife Daneen. However, I was in no way disappointed. Nick was every bit the hot hero I expected, and Melody was the perfect heroine for him. Both are wounded from past relationships and never expect to find true love. Add to this an unknown stalker who puts in just the right touch of suspense, and Leslie Kelly delivers a sexy romp that I will most certainly be adding to my keeper shelf, right next to She Drives Me Crazy.

A good beach read for those who like modern romances."},{"Title":"She's Got The Look","review":"It had so much promise. Really, when I bought this book I was thinking along the lines of Linda Howard's Mr. Perfect, which was a much better book. But when I got to reading this book, I was disappointed. I hate being plopped into the middle of a series and not know it, with back stories and characters that talk about stories that I don't know. And She's Got the Look did that. In the end, I found I didn't care if the hero or heroine got together or not."},{"Title":"She's Got The Look","review":"Melody Tanner, former model and child actress, can't seem to get a break in love. Her ex-husband took her for all she was worth, and now she doesn't trust her instincts about men.Then, she meets Nick Walker in the flesh. Six years ago he was the unknown sexy marine on the cover of Time and at the top of her to do list. Now, he is a cop and partners with her best friend Rosemarry's boyfriend. Rosemarry sets Nick and Melody up to meet on the pretext that someone may be crossing off the men on Melody's sex list, permanently crossing them off. Although the \\"accidental\\" deaths of two of the men on Melody's list may be coincidence, Nick Walker is not taking any chances. And, if investigating the mystery means spending more time with \\"the peacock feather girl\\" from his fantasies, so much the better.Nick and Melody have both been hurt in the past. Melody doesn't trust her feelings for Nick, and Nick is afraid Melody is going to slip through his fingers. How many times does Nick have to keep proving he is here to stay? Will Melody ever regain her confidence? Will Melody ever live down the fact that a man died wearing her underwear?I really wanted to like this book, but I could not get into it. I thought it had a good premise, so I finished the entire thing in hopes it would get better, but I didn't feel satisfied. It had a few twists and turns, but the ending to the mystery was predictable. The writing could have been edited down to move at a faster pace. In fact, I think the story would have done better as a novella, rather than a stand alone book. The author also explored the romance between Rosmarry and Dex which didn't really add much to the main plotline, but also would have made a good novella. Other reviewers say that the banter between Melody and Nick is very funny, but I found it to be standard stuff found in Chick Lit books. There were some steamy loves scenes, but again, standard stuff.If you are a Leslie Kelly fan, then you might like this book. If you are new to her work like I am, I would start with something else by the author."},{"Title":"She's Got The Look","review":"After reading the synopsis for this book, I was thinking along the lines of Linda Howard'sMr. Perfect, but this was not the case. This was a very light, fluffy read where the heroine's never really in danger and what are supposedly side characters play almost as large a role as the 'main' characters. The 'mystery'/suspense was very easy to figure out and definitely not compelling, and the relationship between the main characters is very much based on sex, leading to some frequent and pretty graphic scenes. Although it starts out slightly humorous, it soon becomes dull and focused on the *mainly sexual and predictable* relationships between the characters.Bottom line: If you're looking for suspense, humor, mystery or a Linda Howard-type novel this will leave you unsatisfied; if you're simply looking for a light romance novel with lots of sex this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The daughter of the chieftain;: The story of an Indian girl,","review":"This really is a cute little story about an Indian Chieftain who befriends a little white girl (or vice versa) and the family becomes friends with him and he comes to visits and one day brings his little daughter.

Selection and introd. by Basil Davenport (Midcentury reference library)","review":"\\"To The End Of Time\\" is a collection of Olaf Stapledon's four most famous novels: \\"Last and First Men\\", \\"Star Maker\\", \\"Odd John\\", \\"Sirius\\"; and his novella, \\"The Flames\\". On the surface, this pulls together all of his most significant works of fiction, but there are some problems with the collection as well. Also included is an Introduction by Basil Davenport, who also made the decisions on how to present the material. This collection was originally published in 1953, and in 1956 it ranked 13th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll.The collection opens with \\"Last and First Men\\" which was originally published in 1930 and which many people consider to be Stapledon's best. However, in this case the editorial decision to truncate the work by omitting most of chapter one, all of chapter two, and part of chapter three makes this not a good choice for those who wish to read the novel. Many people have suggested omitting pieces of this long novel, but the final decision should be left to the reader, and not forced upon them by the editor.My personal favorite is next, the amazing \\"Star Maker\\" which was originally published in 1937, and builds on top of \\"Last and First Men\\", but does so in such a way that one doesn't have to have read that work prior to reading Star Maker\\". Next up is 1935's \\"Odd John\\", and that is followed by \\"Sirius\\" from 1944. The collection closes with \\"The Flames\\" which was originally published in 1947. All of these works are published in their entirety, so while this is not the book to buy if one wants to read \\"Last and First Men\\", it is a good way to collect the three other major novels as well as the novella.To be sure, there are a number of editions of \\"Star Maker\\" available which enhance the reading experience of that novel as well, so once again I would not pick this volume based solely on getting that particular work. Overall, I would give this collection four stars, but had it provided a complete copy of \\"Last and First Men\\" it would easily rank 5 stars for the convenience of getting all of Stapledon's major works in one volume."},{"Title":"New Stock Trend Detector: A Review of the 1929-1932 Panic and the 1932-1935 Bull Market : With New Rules and Charts for Detecting Trend of Stocks","review":"In my opinion, this is probably the most important book writtenby W.D.

I think that if you read many times 'New stock trend detector' you will find hidden some very important trading techniques that will help you to keep a good track record in your future operations.

I just wish Gann was around to help us out with the stock market today. I think he's a good instructor. He tries to illustrate his meaning over and over again with plenty of examples. I think it's so interesting to read about the history of the stock market and the financial situation in the U. S. I know from other readings that his great secret was the use of astrology to help him predict the stock market. There's plenty of evidence of others who were successful in its use also. It's too bad so many people are so closed minded. Gann became a millionaire 50 times over because he wasn't. There's something to say for that.I wish everyone could read the last two pages of the book where he talks about Roosevelt's mistakes. It looks like Obama is trying to repeat the the same policies as Roosevelt even though they didn't work and only made things worse.Here is a quote to illustrate: \\"No one man or set of men is greater than all of the people of this country. The majority of the people voted to elect Roosevelt and did not know they were electing him to direct a lot of 'brain-trusters' to run the country. Congress has submitted to Roosevelt and permitted 'brain-trusters' to run things. The government is no different from any other business or individual who spends two or three times as much as it earns and may eventually go bankrupt. Government's interference with business and the government's heavy expenditures simply mean trouble ahead and a day of reckoning must come and the bill must be paid by the taxpayers......If the policies that are now being pursued in Washington continue for another four years, this country will be ruined.........\\"I wish I could quote the whole two pages to you, but it would be well worth your while to check Roosevelt's history as a president on Wikipedia. That was a revelation to me. I had always been told he was a great president, but now I know better. One does have to wonder why an administration would try to repeat failed policies if they really have the welfare of this country in mind. Roosevelt fooled my parents and my grandparents with promises of great retirement incomes from Social Security. You see what happened to that. Now we are asked to believe we will have great health care if we just turn over our lives to the Federal Government. Too bad so many people have to learn the hard way.Gann was not only a brilliant man, but he spent a lot of time in old age that he didn't have to spend trying to help others to learn about the stock market. I think the only reason he didn't tell people about the astrology was he didn't want to contend with the prejudices against it."},{"Title":"American Boys","review":"After being in love with, engaged to, and ultimately losing a Vietnam vet in the early '80s, I read everything I could find about that war and PTSD. I had known a lot about the war from a state-side perspective. I supported the soldiers, opposed the war. I was Another Mother for Peace. I needed to know about 'Nam, what happened, what had made my man so locked up, so silent, so unwilling/unable to speak of it.This book, along with Fields of Fire by James Webb, allowed me to deeply know a few of those who fought. Each with a different background, his own back-story. They shared a unit, and thus life, missions and death. Each experienced it differently. This book answered some questions for me. It helped me think about the war in new ways, and from that came insights into my own loved one. And it helped me become a compassionate listener, friend and volunteer with veterans I have known over the 30+ years since.Years ago I had the honor of meeting Steven Phillip Smith at a MN workshop on writing about Vietnam. He spoke with simplicity and eloquence, truth and feeling. That night I shared a dinner table with him and several others. There he was just a blond-haired, smiling, regular, nice guy.

The link between them all is that they are all extemely well written, and their main characters have been involved in war in some way. Most of these are not new, but put together like this they make an outstanding collection. Included is one Miles Vorkosigan story (not new) if you are looking up this book because of that author's series.This book contains the following stories:&quot;Call him Lord&quot; by Gordon R.

Yes, hockey is the background, but it easily could've been about other subjects.Manasso does a fantastic job delving into the relationship between Snyder and Heatley and investigates why this on-the- surface \\"odd couple\\" (one was a star whose skill allowed him to be handed everything and the other was a mucker who needed every bit of Moxie to achieve his dream) became such best friend and how every twist and turn of their lives brought the two together.If you don't feel touched by the way Manasso describes the fateful events and the grief and sorrow that it brings on to households as well as a National Hockey League franchise, then you are without a soul."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"John Manasso's meticulously researched book tells the story of Dan Snyder's tragic death and its aftermath. There's enough background and detail in this book to satisfy hockey aficionados but the real story is about how the Synders and their extended family and community dealt with their son's passing. The book delves into the forensic investigation of the crash that killed Dan Synder and the subsequent legal negotiations that threatened to jail Danny Heatley, one of Canada's top players. It goes on to reveal much about the family's approach to healing and forgiveness and the vignettes about what went on with teammates in the locker rooms were touching. This was a great book and John's simple, straightforward writing style makes it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"A tragic tale well told.

I enjoyed the sneak peak into what goes on among teammates and seeing the more personal side of hockey. Very well written."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"This is the story of the September 29, 2003 auto accident in Atlanta which resulted in the death of Dan Snyder, hockey player for the Atlanta Thrashers. The auto was driven by Dan's friend and teammate, Dany Heatley, who was charged by the Fulton County District Attorney on five counts.The story is good in its details and facts. Doctors have trouble identifying Heatley and Snyder, not because of the accident, but because both men's driver's licenses and some money had been stolen at the hospital. Teammates come to the hospital in support of the players. Limited hope exists that Snyder would recover; he does not. The writer relates interviews with family, friends, and members of Snyder's home town. One chapter is devoted to the memorial service in Elmira.The legal proceedings took an extended time for resolution. The writer takes a wayward attempt to link the accident with the Ray Lewis stabbing affair which occurred in Atlanta on January 31, 2000 along the lines of how the District Attorney handled the case. I had trouble relating the auto accident which happened after 10:00 p.m. and did not involve alcohol with the stabbing deaths which occurred at 4:00 a.m. outside of a bar.The main focus is on the Snyder family and how the family members deal with the death, with Dany Heatley, with the media, and with other families facing similar tragedy.It is not a \\"feel good\\" story, but it is a story that makes you think about how people deal with tragedy. You get to know a little about Dan and Dany and come away from the book thinking about their stories. Although parts of the book do loosely follow the Thrashers during the season, you do not have to be a hockey fan to read this and get value from it."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"For those who were exposed only to the negative news stories of this event, and formed an opinion about the incident based on those stories, this book is must-read! The book focuses on reporting the facts of the accident, the emotions of all involved and describes the character of both of the players. I especially admired the Snyders family and their refusal to do anything but forgive Dany Heatley. The judge that presided over the legal proceedings gives one hope for our justice system. Based on personal experience, I can attest that the judge's assertion that Heatley will never be able to forget this accident is true, and is punishment enough."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"I was given this book by a friend without knowing anything about Dan Snyder or Danny Heatley. What an amazing story about two pretty impressive young men. After reading it, I wish I could have known Dan Snyder. I hope that if I were ever in this situation (heaven forbid), I would do what the Snyders did. In our litigious society, they are absolutely amazing people.The only negative about this book is that there are so many names dropped in along the way that I couldn't keep them all straight. The name dropping distracted me from the story itself.I wish the Snyders all the best."},{"Title":"A Season of Loss, a Lifetime of Forgiveness: The Dan Snyder and Dany Heatley Story","review":"Tragedy occurred on the night of Monday 29th September 2003 to two NHL hockey players. Canadian All-Star Dany Heatley was driving home his Atlanta Thrashers team-mate fellow Canadian Dan Snyder when Heatley's Ferrari tore apart and landed both occupants in hospital. Snyder, 25 died shortly after as a result of the accident. This excellent book follows the early years of Snyder's battle to hit the NHL big-time and his short-lived Atlanta career. An enormously popular guy suddenly taken away, his good friend Heatley coming to terms with responsibilty for his actions.This remarkable story shows how the Snyder family were quickly able to forgive Heatley and testify their wishes that a custodial sentence was not what they would want for Heatley. They wanted him to pursue his NHL career and not end up being deported from the US. The book gives a generous account of Snyder's early hockey days, his huge popularity with practically everyone he met and the shock of the accident. We also find out how the Snyders, the Thrashers and Heatley coped with the tragedy, the goodwill messages and gestures from hockey fans all over North America, the indictment and the final judge's decision the punishment Heatley must face.You may shed a tear or two through this. Well worth a read.

It tells about the life of Sam Houston from his teen years until he is kicked out of the Governor's mansion for refusing to go along with Texas' decision to secede from the union. He runs away to live with the Indians, is Governor of Tennessee and President of the Republic of Texas as well as a US Congressman and a veteran of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. He is a very exciting American. I have read it outloud to elementary students many times in Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri. I believe all Texas students over the age of 10 should read this book. I bought an out-of-print copy but hope it will be reprinted. All students enjoy this book because it is so captivatingly written. Otherwise boring historical events are woven into the fascinating life of a fascinating man. It is written on about a 6th grade level.

He tries to quantify a horse's exertion level during each portion of the race. After doing a fine job in those regards, he totally blows it by suggesting the player can profit by playing any good shape overlay, regardless of how firm your opinion is on that contender and even goes on to state that the more contenders in a race, the better the bettors chances become. The seasoned player knows that these assumptions are simply not true and any time you don't have a firm conviction on who the winner will be, no amount of overlay will profit you.After all, it's the horse with the best chances of winning that wins in the majority of cases, not necessarily the one with the best overlay odds. Anyone who thinks it's easier to pick winners by selecting any horse just because he's NOT the favorite is thinking backwards."},{"Title":"Enemy Ace: War Idyll","review":"The DC Universe contains thousands of quality characters. Unfortunately, only a small fraction are used to even half of their potential. Every so often, an author will dust off one of these forgotten gems and make readers take notice, such as George Pratt did with Hans von Hammer, the Enemy Ace, in this book. A true graphic novel, not a trade collection, this story is a beautiful piece of work. It's an interesting exploration of what makes a soldier, told in a series of flashbacks brought on through an aged Hammer's interview by a Vietnam vet.Actually, I would rather give it 9 of 10 stars, due to the art. Pratt's painted pages are great, but they're not very detailed, so it's hard to decipher exactly what's occurring at times. Still, it's a minor problem. DC should put it back in print."},{"Title":"Enemy Ace: War Idyll","review":"Being an aviation buff and military reenactor I have grown to recognize that war is a sickness that has plagued mankind for eons past. George Pratt brings the meaning of war and the emotional scars it leaves on it's victims, the survivors, to life in characters who are generations apart but who suffer from the same endless mental anguish for the rest of their lives. Each being left to wrestle with their own mental demons long after the war(s) are over. This is a very emotional novel that left me to ponder the fate of all those who tasted combat. My heart goes out to those poor souls whose respective governments left them alone to deal with their personal horrors once the smoke has cleared. I'm not afraid to admit to shedding a tear at the end of this wonderful novel. This book, like &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; should be required reading by anyone who is contemplating joining the military or better yet, those at the &quot;top&quot; who wantonly send their children away to be slaughtered."},{"Title":"Enemy Ace: War Idyll","review":"Pratt's work challenges the conventional reader. This is without doubt the most immersive piece of sequential art I have ever read. Each panel is a painted impressionistic masterpiece. The story is a monument to the author's feelings and experiences and research into the trauma of war. Pratt's artistic style is suited perfectly to the grim historical setting. The protagonist is lifted from his comic book origin in a fitting mature tribute. I didn't like this book the first time I read it, but now rank it with the best war stories in any format."},{"Title":"Enemy Ace: War Idyll","review":"very good I liked it a lot.

The summary on the back of the book is misleading claiming that Loye is going to give information on forecasting methods that will help many professionals predict the future.Loye covered a variety of topics. The reading was never boring, as it moved smoothly from anecdotes of historical figures who have accurately predicted the future, to an explanation on how predictions are affected by using the left and/or right hemispheres of the brain, and finally the psychological processes that we, as humans, use to arrive at certain predictions. The most interesting theory that Loye brought up was that dreams often foreshadow our futures.The biggest concern that I had was the looseness of terminology that Loye uses. The book claims to apply to forecasting, yet forecasting, being an informed decision that comes after examining multiple perspectives, is not described in Loye's work. What Loye depicts are predictions that come from mostly cognition, and less knowledge.I am inclined to recommend readers to take a look at this book. It is an enjoyable read that is brimming with intelligence. I just warn readers that if they are looking for a scientific approach to forecasting, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Siguiriya: A Novel","review":"The story of the Moslem who marries a Jew and has a grandchild who becomes a Christian is very interesting in its own right.

As the chapters unfolded, more and more was revealed, and I just couldn't wait to read on.

Now, they've moved into drug dealing. When Twin turns a thief onto Tommy and JoJo, the two lose all of their ready cash--and realize they need to make a score. But the Drug Enforcement Agency is aware of their activities. The DEA contacts Twin's girlfriend, a white stripper named Jennifer, and pressures her to cooperate with them. One of the agents seduces Jennifer, reasoning that he wants to help her escape from the life she's created for herself.With their major supplier in jail, Tommy and JoJo fall prey to a scam, losing even more of their money. Only by moving from cocaine to extaxy do they see a chance to recoup their losses. But the pill business seems like a good one and using Jennifer and one of her white stripper friends as mules works--the police don't go after white women nearly as much as they do black. When Tommy meets a beautiful woman whose father is a major real estate investor who promises to help him go straight--if only he can come up with a million dollars in investment income, Tommy thinks he has a chance to get out of the drug business before the DEA catches up with him.Tommy, JoJo, and Twin push their luck, trying to get just one more score--the score that will let Tommy walk away from the drug business, marry his beautiful lover, and escape to California. But the DEA has other plans. The DEA doesn't care that their enforcement efforts are destroying as many lives as would the drugs they are attempting to control. And they'll do whatever it takes to bring Tommy and his friends down.Author K. Elliot captures an authentic feel in this fast-paced caper novel. Tommy, with his adoptive father in jail, accused of a rape he didn't commit, and with his major ambition in life to enjoy his fishing, is a sympathetic character despite his two-timing his long-time girlfriend (who is also two-timing him). Elliot helps the reader understand how drug dealing can seem to be the only option, and how ethical black and white blurs to gray in the world of drugs and drug enforcement.STREET FAME provides an intriguing look into today's urban drug culture.

Elliott is by far my favorite read of 2007 so far!The characters come to life and rise off the pages in a way that they become people you see on the streets, your neighbors, even those close to you.Tommy \\"Fatboy\\" Dupree is the perfect example of someone who is a good person caught up in a series of bad situations--- and sees the light at the end. The book rivals anything by Sidney Sheldon as it reveals a suspensful tale of betrayals, love and redemption.And the dialogue is so real and believable--- full of lessons that all of us can relate to and apply to either ourselves or someone we know.For example: \\"There has to be more to life than this. (p.37)\\" \\"You gotta be a man and money don't make you a man. (p.209)\\", \\"If you're going to be a drug dealer at least be smart about it. (p. 53)\\" and my personal favorite: \\"People are ruining their own lives with the decisions they make.

They are slim volumes that can easily fit inside a small purse.As with all the \\"Top 10\\" books, this volume provides information in the format of giving ten subsections for different subjects. For example, you have a listing of Vienna's top ten \\"Highlights,\\" followed by lists of the top ten things to see at each of the top ten highlights. The Kunsthistorisches Collections, for example, is listed 3rd under \\"Highlights,\\" and then, a few pages later, you have the \\"Top 10 Works of Art\\" in the Kunsthistorisches Collections listed, along with maps of the museum showing where the works are located.This book has subjects like \\"Top 10 Places of Worship,\\" \\"Top 10 Museums,\\" \\"Top 10 Palaces and Historical Buildings,\\" \\"Top 10 Parks and Gardens,\\" \\"Top 10 Music Venues,\\" \\"Top 10 Children's Attractions,\\" etc. There are also, of course, top ten listings of restaurants, bars, cafes, shopping (retail stores), and the like. This book also has listings of restaurants, cafes, bars and retail shops for different sections of the city too, so that you can easily find one near your hotel.At the back of the book is the \\"Streetsmart\\" section with its lists under headings such as \\"Getting to Vienna,\\" \\"Getting Around Vienna,\\" \\"Information and Tours,\\" \\"Budget Tips in Vienna,\\" etc. There are seven lists of Vienna hotels.Because of its compact size, great maps (including maps of the subway, museums, palaces, and cathedrals), and the wealth of useful information on tourist sites, restaurants, shopping, etc., this is the one and only book that I carried around with me while walking through the streets of Vienna on my recent vacation."},{"Title":"Vienna (DK Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"For getting around Vienna this is a great guide.

Depending on the destination, the Top 10 lists become increasingly more detailed and may include, for example, top 10 churches, museums, children's attractions, festivals, events, restaurants, caf&eacute;s, pubs, parks and so on. In the second half of each book, the information is effectively repeated but organized by neighbourhood, so the prospective tourist might make the most effective use of limited time touring a given area in a city or country without missing anything of interest.The information is all linked to beautiful photographs and allows a potential traveler to make sensible choices in advance according to his or her personal tastes. Most telling is the fact that each Top 10 title makes no attempt to be comprehensive. It is absolutely, positively aimed at the first time tourist attempting to do a one shot overview of a city or country. If that is your objective, there is little question that the DK Eyewitness Top 10 series is the hands down winner against all the competition - Blue Guide, Green Guide, Rough Guide, National Geographic, Frommer or Michelin.As a pre-planner, Top 10 Vienna proved itself to be invaluable. My limited time was well spent and I felt comfortable filling my day with a thoroughly enjoyable selection of attractions that were well matched to my personal tastes and those of my traveling companion. There was not even a single instance where we felt we were misled by the guide into choosing an event, a food, a pub, a hotel, a church, an attraction, a park or a caf&eacute; that was not to our liking. And it was the ideal size to be easily carried around during our travels to keep handy as a pocket reference. High praise, indeed.And yet, there were still minor - and I stress, minor - quibbles that irritated me when I compared the reality of Vienna to the expectations I had based on the guide. The map of the subway system is now inaccurate in that the U2 line has been extended. In the description of the \\"heurigen\\" wine bars in Grinzing on the outskirts of Vienna, no mention is made of the fact that the town is virtually a dead zone until late afternoon and nothing, I repeat, nothing is open over the noon hour. With respect to transportation, I purchased a 72 hour subway ticket and used it for the electric tram system, the S-bahn high speed rail service and the surface bus system. I realized, to my horror, afterward that I had assumed that the subway ticket was all inclusive. To this day, I don't know if that was correct or not because the guide fails to point out whether separate tickets are required for each system. The guide also fails to caution the unwary traveler of the ubiquitous petty larceny that many of the museums indulge in. After you have paid admission and entered, you are advised that for security purposes you MUST check your backpack. All well and good, except that there was always an additional charge levied which was often as much as 1 Euro. A blanket suggestion should be made that walkers in Vienna should always carry a small amount of change in their pockets. There is nothing so disconcerting as struggling to find a public water closet and discovering that there is also a 0.50 fee to enter. Ouch, that hurts in more ways than one, doesn't it! And, last but not least, having searched high and low for Kaisermelange, a coffee concoction including strong black coffee, egg yolk, honey and cognac that was recommended in the guide, I was finally advised by a kindly, sypmathetic waiter that because of salmonella concerns, a food with raw egg was no longer available in Vienna (I don't know if he was right and I didn't check on the availability of steak tartare but, to my dismay, I never found the Kaisermelange!).Perhaps Eyewitness DK would take these suggestions under advisement for future editions.Highly recommended for all travelers, real world and armchair alike.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Vienna (DK Eyewitness Travel Guides)","review":"I am glad I purchased this guidebook for our upcoming visit to Vienna and found the information on accommodations, restaurants and sites useful.

As an academician who spent 20 years in Corporate I.S. before becoming a professor, I have always wondered why very successful I.S. projects are sometimes so badly received. Dr. Civin's insights have helped me understand some otherwise painful behavior I have encountered in the past.I have immediately begun using some of the author's insights in human behavior in my own teaching of Systems Analysis and Project Management.The only downside of this book is that it is very heavily laden with technical psychology language and terms. Readers will find the language easier if they, too, have some background or training in psychology."},{"Title":"Parables for Preachers: The Gospel of Mark, Year B","review":"Barbara Reid's books on 'Parables for Preachers' follow the Revised Common Lectionary. Because of this, the book for Year B concentrates primarily on the texts of the gospel of Mark. Before getting into the heart of the texts, Reid presents introductory material on parables, preaching, and the gospel of Mark. Reid states in her introduction, 'In the Synoptic Gospels, Jesus rarely explains his parables. They are meant to be wrestled with by each generation of hearers who allow themselves to be disturbed and challenged by Jesus' subversive stories.'Subversive stories? One of the things that comfortable Christianity has sometimes forgotten is the revolutionary and radical character of Jesus and his teaching in the first century. Perhaps this is because the teachers are so familiar. How does one find new meanings in familiar parables that show up again and again? This is a particularly important question for preachers, and Reid addresses it directly.The term 'parable' can refer to a range of types of speech - it goes beyond the simple moral stories similar to Aesop's fables. Parables in Mark carry much of the weight of Jesus' teaching.Jesus, of course, was not the first to preach or teach in parables. In doing this, he was following an ancient and honoured tradition. This is a tradition that may be continued by modern teachers and preachers. Reid illustrates several ways in which parables serve to carry a message. They provide a way for Jesus to explain his experience of God and holiness without boxing it into academic or dogmatic statements. It helps connect the encounter with the holy with the common people and their daily lives. 'In his parables, Jesus always began with the familiar. The images and situations he painted in his stories were from the fabric of daily life of his audience.'Of course, Jesus' parables were broad and inclusive - nothing was outside the scope of God's realm. While parables began with the familiar, they never lingered there. They served to recast 'common' creation in a new way - the realm of God. Of course, this then begs for interpretation, which is never as straightforward and simple as some preachers would have it seem. 'What catches up with the hearer is that Jesus' parables are usually open-ended; Jesus rarely interpreted these stories for his disciples.... Because they are told in figurative language, the parables are capable of conveying distinct message to different people in diverse circumstances.'Other aspects of parables that are key to their meaning include that they are not neutral, but always have a slant or bias, often toward the more marginal in society. They are a communal endeavour, and not really meant for individualists (something that Western society tends to forget). Parables are short, which makes for easier recollection - they are small like seeds, from which much may grow. Also, the final aspect of parables is similar to that of preaching - they are meant to be heard and lived, not simply forgotten.Understanding how to interpret parables involves several things Reid highlights. They involve understanding the gospels themselves, in their own setting. The nature of the gospels is important - what kind of writing is this, and what is its purpose? Parables fall within gospel literature, so yet another level of understanding is required. Reid gives a quick overview of different modes of interpretation, including allegorical, historical criticism, social science study, linguistic and literary approaches, as well as the new forms of liberation interpretation. Reid is quick to underscore that 'no one method provides the definitive key.' These methods are guides, but ultimately we are all charged with engaging the parables for ourselves and our communities.As this text deals with the gospel of Mark, Reid continues with a chapter looking at the gospel of Mark, from issues of authorship, historical and social setting, documentary transmission and analysis, theological issues and overall purpose. The theological ideas of Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology vary from gospel to gospel, as do some of the texts of the same stories. Reid highlights Mark as the earliest gospel, most likely the closest of the Jesus stories we can get to the actual time of Jesus.The remainder of the book looks at particular parables, eight texts in all, as they appear sequentially in the liturgical year. There is a chapter devoted to each text pericope. These include parables both in the Sunday lectionary as well as the daily cycle of readings. Each section gives attention to major images, theological themes, narrative devsices, and a helpful list of preaching possibilities. This book does not provide set sermons, nor does it emphasise one theological approach exclusive to others.Overall, this book is a very handy guide to anyone who reads the gospels, who is interested in preaching, or is interested in understanding more about one of the primary teaching/preaching devices of Jesus. Reid writes with clarity, sensitivity and care on her subjects. While she does tend toward a liberal interpretation of scripture, even evangelical and fundamentalists can find inspiration here, given that parables have never been meant to have literal interpretations placed upon them, and the multi-valent character of parables practically begs for as broad a range as possible for study. To that end, Reid has provided a generous bibliography for further research."},{"Title":"Juergen Teller Cindy Sherman Marc Jacobs","review":"Fashion and photography are two things that have always gone hand in hand. Juergen Teller and Marc Jacobs are another perfect example of this combined correlation destined to equal visual harmony. The two have worked together gracefully for years and with the addition of Cindy Sherman (who coincidentally has never collaborated with another photographer until now) Juergan Teller and Marc Jacobs created one of the simplest, and most effective, picture books centered around fashion. This aesthetically stimulating \\"picture book\\" is a work photographic genius bound to inspire and intrigue. The reader/viewer is both amused and confounded by the beautiful awkwardness portrayed page after page. It's like a graphic novel for fashion conscious artists, minus an epic ending.Juergen Teller and Cindy Sherman photograph themselves playing a series of rather ironic couples. They have some odd fun with these characters, using them to model the clothing picked handpicked by Marc Jacobs for them and to portray the awkward social tension between two people. Characters and subjects range from older individuals with babies to rock stars and transgenders. The photo quality is what you'd expect to see from Mr. Teller, white backgrounds and blown out models; the look is both expected and yet, still inspirational. The book itself is as beautiful as the photographs themselves; printed on a heavy matte paper and hard covered, the book is tangibly stunning, almost as stunning as the clothing the photographers are wearing."},{"Title":"Juergen Teller Cindy Sherman Marc Jacobs","review":"The book is a good look through, but not more than that.

The ahead-of-its-time idea of these tales is of a type of being - whether a new species of hominid, digitally generated superhumans, or, as here, an extra-dimensional creature - which outwardly resembles man and woman, but which, mainly by virtue of having high intelligence unburdened by emotion, slowly takes over the Earth from its more sentimental predecessors.The idea of this, so to speak \\"anti-Vulcan\\" type being able to infiltrate, dominate, and at last annihilate, all proximate competition resonates deeply with us because, really, it is more than an idea: it is history. Or, more precisely, prehistory: The reason we homosapiens believe ourselves to be alone \\"in God's image\\" amongst \\"the beasts that perish\\", or, in the words of the brilliant ethologist Desmond Morris \\"a kind of fallen angel rather than a naked ape\\", is more than probably because, at some point in prehistory, homosapiens *simply and ruthlessly, wiped out every other hominid - and perhaps even every anthropoid - that could reasonably(!) compete with us for the inheritance of the Earth*. Then, with our closest cousins gone for some 10,000 years, we began to believe the flattering myth that there never existed any creature closer to us than the relatively stupid chimpanzee, and the relatively harmless bonobo; that we alone were valued by the Heavens; even, that, like the Inheritors of the Conrad/Ford story, we were descended not from a pitiful lemur-like beast in the primeval forest, but from \\"a higher dimension\\", be it Eden, or the apex of Aristotle's \\"Chain of Being\\". In the words of another brilliant social commentator, Howard S. Schwartz: \\"We pushed reality back until it became a rumor, then we denied the rumor\\".I highly recommend this deeply insightful, metaphoric novella, by two of the finest writers in English."},{"Title":"Faith and the Future: Essays on Theology, Solidarity, and Modernity (Concilium)","review":"Essays by two leading theologians discuss the subjects that they find challenging for the future of Christianity. For Metz, most of the challenge is in restructuring Christianity from a European-based perspective to a more global inclusion of the needs of the non-European world. Metz looks forward to the revitaliation of Christianity from the common base of dealing with the issue of suffering in the world. Moltmann's topics deal with increasing ecumenical understandings between the various Christian sects and take up a broad range of theological isssues that often divide rather than bring together modern Christians such as Mariology and views on the Trinity. Most interesting is an essay on the concept of the triune God in relation to the Judaic concept of God.

Adding the statement \\"other analysts do not believe we are living unsustainably\\" to an Environmental Science textbook is like saying \\"some people believe the earth is flat,\\" in a geography textbook, or, something that unfortunately seems to happen in some biology textbooks these days, \\"evolution is just one theory, there are other theories as well, some experts believe god created all life on earth as it is today.\\" A similar statement was made in part 1-6, \\"Is our Present Course Sustainable?.\\" \\"Are things getting better or worse? Experts disagree...\\" Experts paid by huge resource exploiting corporations? Experts who like to bury their heads in the sand?There were a number of interesting facts in the text that the general statements did not reflect. These inconsistencies really got to me. It seemed as if it were trying to write about what was outside the box but writing from inside the box. I particularly disliked the sentence that included: \\"... how much more we need to do to help make the earth more sustainable...\\" Wait a second, if you were writing from a viewpoint that \\"Nature does not exist just for us and we only think we are in charge. We need the earth, but the earth does not need us,\\" how can you talk about \\"making the earth more sustainable?\\" The earth is what it is and is bountiful, it is our resource exploitation and pollution that are not sustainable for human survival.I found the first part of the side bar \\"Free-Access Resources and the Tragedy of the Commons\\" quite interesting, but the second part on solutions seemed to missing a lot. The first of the two listed solutions was: \\"Use free-access resources at rates well below their estimated sustainable yields or overload limits by reducing population, regulating access, or both.\\" It then went on to say how this is rarely used since it means we would have to establish and enforce rules and regulations, and it is hard to figure out a sustained yield. But it doesn't mention that educating people about these resources that they take for granted could go along way. Also not mentioned is that regulating the devices that allow people to exploit these resources (such as clean air, the atmosphere, water and wildlife) so easily and unthinkingly would be much easier than regulating their actual use. A lot of the resources mentioned are being depleted by pollution not use in a strict sense. The other solution listed is: \\"Convert free-access resources to private ownership,\\" since if someone owns something they will protect it, has so many problems which are not addressed. The books lists the problem with this solution as being that \\"it is not practical for global common resources (such as the atmosphere, the open ocean, most wildlife species, and migratory birds) that can not be divided up and converted to private property.\\" What about the fact that people do exploit the resources that they do own, and the fact that it would no doubt cause even more problems with poverty, and sharing things in common is what brings people together as a community (e.g. they all go to the park and see each other), and so many other problems that I get overwhelmed just thinking about them.There was a lot of talk about overpopulation as a major problem, but not so much talk about overconsumption by certain parts of the population, even though there were sections on this. There was a section on ecological foot print and how the people in the USA have such a large one, but this didn't seem to get integrated into the text. There was also the statement: \\"Thus poor parents in a developing country would need 70 - 200 children to have the same lifetime resource consumption as 2 children in a typical U.S. family,\\" but there was a lot of emphasis on population as a major problem and how in underdeveloped countries populations are growing as such a fast rate, when slight rises in US middle/upper class populations can make so much more difference. It felt to me like too much blame poor people in poor countries when it is people in the US and corporations based in the US enriching people in the US who are causing so much of the problems, even exporting our TV and advertisements to other countries which makes people want our unsustainable lifestyle.There was also no mention of empowering women as a major tool to deal with high birthrates. There is overwhelming evidence that when you empower women to choses when they want to get pregnant and give them education and job skills birthrates do down. The paragraph on why poor people have so many children basically says the reason is to have their labor, with no mention of lack of birth control or power of women to make choices. It also seemed racist and disrespectful.While we are on the subject of racist and disrespectful, what is with the developed and developing labels? The societies in all countries are developed, it is just industrial manufacturing and certain kinds of resource exploitation that are not as developed.One last perhaps picky complaint. Figure 1-13 mentions \\"Traditional decision making\\" and \\"traditional societies\\" but it really does not mean traditional, it means modern industrialized hierarchical societies. This may seem picky but I feel it really does matter, we need to keep remembering that these societies we are living in are new, not traditional. True traditional societies did merge social, economic and environmental issues when making decisions, in fact, they did so in all aspects of living their lives. What we need to do is get back to them."},{"Title":"Living in the Environment: Principles, Connections, and Solutions (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","review":"Being a chemistry student, I've read this book as part of my classes.

Ms. Mann has done a service to those of us who are interested in art and in Florida. Although I am a &quot;native&quot; Floridian and documentary photographer who has done much work throughout the state, I quickly realized that Art in Florida is not a regional book. Everyone, it seems, has some connection to Florida through relatives, a pilgrimage to Disney World, or dreams about tropical breezes and swaying palm trees (especially during winter). Yet with the necessary exception of chapter 7, &quot;Travel Tracts in the Late 1800s,&quot; there are no traces of blatent commercialism or kitsch in Ms. Mann's admirably researched book. The focus on regionalism serves as an antidote to the stereotypes of Florida. This is a serious book that is delightful to read. Art in Florida, finely designed and printed, presents wonderful paintings and illuminating text and is clearly a definitive contribution."},{"Title":"Art in Florida: 1564-1945","review":"For the first time Florida's important art history has been captured and documented for the world to enjoy.

The book is beautifully bound and ofers 160 illustrations of Florida art, 100 in color. The paintings were gathered from public and private collections all over the country. Mann spent years painstakingly searching through vast amounts of matrial in order to write a history of Florida art. &quot;Art in Florida&quot; is history not only of Florida's arts but also of its people.

I have finished the first two in the series and am moving on to the third. It teaches the basic building blocks you need to understand kanji. Kanji understanding is really necessary in order to begin to gain an understanding of Japanese. I will have to respectfully disagree with the above reviewer. I thinkit is absolutely essential to read and write kana fluently before moving from beginner level. It is a time investment but it is well worth it! As long as you are aware that this book is kana only you should be ok. I do wish they gave more casual language and a little less focus on business but I suppose that is useful for those who work in Japan. Enjoy the book ^_^*"},{"Title":"Japanese for Busy People 2 Audio (Pt.2)","review":"If you used Japanese for Busy People I to start learning Japanese, you might be disappointed with this second book in the series. JFBP II has been, for me, less user-friendly. In comparison with JFBP I, this book inundates the student with vocabulary and grammar notes in each lesson. Yes, having lots of information is good. But in my opinion, this book has packaged that information in larger chunks that are more difficult for the student to digest. Lessons are oriented around events, places and situations -- Lost and Found, the Health Club, a Business trip; a festival, etc. The book might have been more helpful had it been oriented around grammar concepts. Or better yet, give me a lesson focused on just new vocabulary and then give me a lesson focused on a grammar concept -- where I can use my recently acquired vocabulary. (I am learning in a classroom environment, and it's extremely challenging to soak up all the new vocabulary AND all the new grammar in each lesson.)This book also is big on kana and kanji and sparse on romaji (although the book, in the appendix, does awkwardly provide romaji for the lesson texts). I agree that learning to think in kana is important. But I think more prominent romaji is still needed at this level -- when beginning students are still visualizing in terms of romaji. Kana is easy enough but requires my brain to kick in some extra processing power -- which slows down my comprehension of the material. In other words, I think students still could benefit from the &quot;training wheels&quot; of romaji at this level. It could speed up learning of vocabulary and grammar. It just makes sense: We learn to speak English fairly well. Then we learn to read and write it. Why not learn to speak Japanese fairly well (using easy romaji) and then learn how to read and write our newly acquired Japanese using kana?And speaking of training wheels, more illustrations of vocabulary and concepts would have been helpful -- to help students better soak up new words and grammar. Another gripe: Not all words used in this book are in the glossary. (If it's not in the glossary, it's probably in the glossary for JFBP I.)If you are studying on your own and on no timetable, this book will do you just fine. This book covers a lot of territory. If you can soak it all up, you'll be Japanese wiz. But if you're truly a busy person (like me -- or maybe I'm just slow! ;) ) and if this is the book you have to use, be prepared to make extra time in your schedule. And do your best to master each lesson before you move on to the next one -- since each lesson requires knowledge of previous concepts. Otherwise, your house of cards will come tumbling down."},{"Title":"Frontiers of Alusia (Dragonquest)","review":"While sparsely sketched out, it gives just enough detail to spark the imagination.

Then get ready to do exactly that minutes after you pick up this one! Facades, by newcomer Alex Marcoux, is one of the best new novels I have had the pleasure of reading in a long time! From the moment I picked up the book, I found myself simply fascinated with the characters Marcoux brought to life within the pages, transfixed with the skillfully woven storyline, and didn't put it down until several hours later!The core character, Sidney Marcum, personal manager extraordinaire, is a dynamo. Smart, driven, hot shot professional with a fiercely guarded past, Sidney exudes a sort of bitchiness attributed to strong, powerful women. However, anyone with a little bit of insight can see it is nothing but a &quot;facade,&quot; created to ward off the most prying eyes. Yet Marcoux wisely doesn't give it to you all at once. She draws you into the web of Sidney's life, making you turn the pages, delving deeper into Sidney's psyche, her angst, the hidden secrets of her past.

Marcoux will capture your attention as each chapter brings you closer to the light."},{"Title":"Facades","review":"Sidney Marcum, founder and president of Marcum Promotions, Inc., is a personal manager for musical groups and singers. For more than a decade she has specialized in taking unknown talent and making it a success. Anastasia, the beautiful, sensual, talented singer-songwriter, is struggling with her flagging professional career while attempting to balance her personal relationship with Stephanie and a life with the closet door open. After a series of unfortunate publicity incidents, the singer approaches Sidney for management help to reclaim her superstar status. Sidney advises Anastasia to reenter the closet and create a straight public persona or &quot;facade&quot; to reconnect with her straight audience. The relationship these two women develop over the next two years is an interesting and cautious one. The publicity campaign that Sidney orchestrates for Anastasia's comeback is a fascinating story alone. Marcoux uses the &quot;facade&quot; analogy to represent both that constructed public entertainment persona as well as the face of a closeted lesbian. However, set primarily around 1993, with flashbacks to the early 1980s, Facades is more complicated than the thematic analogy implies. Marcoux also deals with spousal abuse (heterosexual and lesbian), sexual assault, child custody issues for previously married lesbians like Sidney, blackmail and reincarnation. In addition to the above issues, Anastasia performs in Denver during the Boycott after Amendment 2. [An Amendment to the Colorado constitution that would disallow any municipal government to grant civil rights protection based on sexual orientation, which the US Supreme Court struck down.] She uses her concert as an opportunity to question the Religious Right and A2 supporters. If it's starting to sound as though Marcoux is juggling a lot of themes in this book, you're right. While most of the story lines are tied up at the end, the reincarnation theme is never fully developed. It is hinted at throughout the novel and yet doesn't seem to fit. In fairness, many of the themes are interconnected. Overall this is a pleasantly readable novel with characters who draw the reader into the story. As a lesbian love story, Facades is rather chaste. The characters and the writing make Facades a novel worth reading. Marcoux does not shy away from controversial issues, in the lesbian &amp; gay community or the majority society. Acutally it is that willingness to address sensitive socio/political issues around sexism, homophobia and violence that makes this a good a novel to loan to a straight friend. Facades is the first novel from Marcoux, a Colorado resident. Hopefully there will be future novels that allow Marcoux to pay more attention to tightening her plot lines."},{"Title":"Facades","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, but was highly disappointed by the trite and adolescent writing.

A professor at Biola University, and then at American Baptist Seminary of the West, he was a prolific writer. His book on hermeneutics remains a useful textbook on the subject.In the present volume he explores the purported incompatability between scientific reason and biblical accuracy, and shows that the illusion is because of improper interpretation of scientific evidence and/or the Biblical texts. Although some of the scientific data he cites are somewhat dated (e.g. supposed age of the earth), his reasoning still stands. The strength of the book is in its ability to sweep away the controversy and clear the way for intellectual honesty on both sides.As the list of books referencing this work demonstrates, \\"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\\" is a seminal work. Reaction to this book was evidently the impetus for the writings of Henry Morris, who shortly thereafter published his first major works on so-called \\"scientific creationism\\". Thus, it may have been the opening volley in the current \\"war\\", but as Ramm points out, the debate goes back to Augustine's time. While Morris' work is meant to exclude and divide, Ramm's book paves the way for those trained in the sciences to approach the Bible without having to \\"check their brain at the door\\". It also allows the Christian to approach science without a sense of guilt or heretical treason, free to explore its wonders, and yet, understand its limits. But most importantly, it opens a dialogue between serious believers and serious scientists that can lead to salvation on one hand, and greater appreciation for the works of the creator on the other.It is obvious that Bernard Ramm had a great love of the Bible and science. His most cogent point is that we, as Christians, must be cautious when we speak of scientific subjects, and we must be sure that we really understand the scientific method and the field of which we speak. Otherwise we will be dismissed as ignorant, and even more tragically, we may exclude honest seekers from coming to the Bible for reconciliation with the Creator. Also, as scientists, we must not impose a scientific framework on the Biblical texts. It will almost always result in misinterpretation and obscure the intended message.That however does not imply that the Bible cannot stand up under scientific scrutiny. While it was not the intent of the Biblical authors to write a scientific treatise, Ramm points out many instances where statements in the Bible have proven far ahead of their time for scientific and historical accuracy. And when viewed from a phenomenological perspective, even the creation account violates no basic tenants of science, a remarkable accomplishment for such an ancient text.This book remains a classic on the subject. I recommend it to all who honestly seek to reconcile science and scripture, not merely compromise one or the other or both."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Science and Scripture","review":"This book is an all time classic on the relationship of scientific knowledge to Christianity. Bernard Ramm bemoans the fact that there are so many books of this type and his is just another. But his stood the test of time, while the others have largely been forgotten.This book is timeless. Although some of the information on specific sciences such as geology, astronomy and biology is dated, much of the discussion could have been written yesterday.Ramm illustrates many ways of reconciling science and the study of scripture. He sometimes gives his own position on a particular issue. We may not agree with him on any particular issue. But Ramm stresses the important thing is that Christian scholars should take seriously the findings of science. Although we Christians accept the Bible as authoritative, there are sources of knowledge outside the Bible and it is not acceptable for the Christian to dismiss these if they seem to conflict with our understanding of scripture. Our understanding of scripture is every bit as contingent on fallible human reason as scientific knowledge.Ramm is a villan to the young-earth movement because of his \\"accomodationism\\" and critisism of \\"flood geology\\" and young-earthism. He is cited heavily in Witcomb and Morris' book The Genesis Flood, and in fact may have partly inspired that book.Some of the information on specific sciences is quite dated. But that illustrates the ever-changing nature of science (and theology) and the unchanging nature of scriptire. Just as our understanding of nature is always changing, so is our understanding of scripture and how it relates to science.Ramm does indicate that he does not personally accept evolutionary theory and is not a theistic evolutionist. He characterized himself as a \\"progeressive creationist\\". I have to admit I don't know if his opinions changed over the years as science progressed. Although my personal opinions may not be in total agreement with Ramm's, he displays an appropriate respect and honest consideration of scientific knowledge."},{"Title":"The Christian View of Science and Scripture","review":"Bernard L. Ramm (1916-1992) was a Baptist theologian who was professor of Systematic Theology at California Baptist Seminary. He has written important and influential books such asVarieties Of Christian Apologetics,Protestant Christian Evidences, andProtestant Biblical Interpretation: A Textbook of Hermeneutics.He wrote in the Preface to this 1954 book, \\"In research for this book I discovered that there are two traditions in Bible and science both stemming from the developments of the nineteenth century. There is the ignoble tradition which has ... used arguments and procedures not in the better traditions of established scholarship. There has been and is a noble tradition in Bible and science, and this is the tradition of the great and learned evangelical Christians who have been patient, genuine, and kind and who have taken great care to learn the facts of science and Scripture... Unfortunately the noble tradition ... has not been the major tradition in evengelicalism in the twentieth century... It is our wish to call evengelicalism back to the noble tradition...\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"...the Holy Spirit conveyed infallibly true theological doctrines in the cultural mold and terms of the days of the Bible writers, and did not give to the writers the secrets of modern science. It is a misunderstanding of the nature of inspiration to seek such secrets in various verses of the Bible.\\" (Pg. 136)\\"The amount of material carried by a water stream varies with the sixth power of the velocity of the stream. There is little deposit far out on the continental shelf where a few feet may represent thousands of years of deposits. Flood geology has no means of accounting for this.\\" (Pg. 184)\\"A local flood would come and go and leave no trace after a few thousand years, but could a universal flood be a traceless flood? (George McCready) Price's view we cannot but emphatically reject.\\" (Pg. 243)\\"The mixing of the waters and the pressure of the waters would have been devastating. Many of the salt water fish and marine life would die in fresh water, and many of the fresh water fish and marine life would die in salt water. An entire marine creation would have been necessary if the waters of the earth were mixed, yet no such hint is given in the account.\\" (Pg. 244)\\"Getting rid of such a vast amount of water would have been as miraculous as providing it. If the entire world were under six miles of water, there would have been no place for the water to drain off. Yet the record states that the water drained off with the help of the wind (Genesis 8:1). A local flood would readily account for this, but there is not answer if the entire world were under water.\\" (Pg. 245)\\"There is the problem of the special diets required for the animals, and the problem of special conditions for the animals. Some animals need a moist environment, and others a very dry one; some need it very cold and others very warm. Again, there is no question what Omnipotence can do, but the simplicity of the flood record prohibits the endless supplying of miracles to make a universal flood feasible.\\" (Pg. 247)"},{"Title":"FORCED EXPOSURE #18","review":"The largest and last issue at 148 pages, perfect bound.

If there is one first book of poems you need to read, it is this one. I predict we will be seeing much more from Sidney Wade in the future"},{"Title":"The Terrible Tide","review":"While not as witty as MacLeod's Peter Shandy series, The Terrible Tide is fun and entertaining. The style is modern gothic complete with noises in the night and several options for both the love interest and villain. In contrast to the classic gothic heroine however, Holly is no-nonsense and well able to handle any problems that come up. She is also refreshingly intelligent and not given to stupid acts the reader knows are dangerous.The Terrible Tide holds no shocking surprises or sudden revelations. As the plot flows smoothly along, the reader easily figures out its general direction; and Holly is only a few steps behind. The lag is just enough time to give the reader a smug sense of superiority without making the heroine look dense. This is not to say that the reader figures everything out. The solution is still foggy enough to keep the reader engaged and wondering how everything will come together.As for faults, the characterization of the love interest is sketchy; and the reader might like to get to know him better before sending him off into the sunset with the heroine. Also, the ending is a bit abrupt with all the loose ends gathered together in one or two pages. Although, to be fair, the reader will probably have picked them up already and only need confirmation. MacLeod's flowing style and smooth writing voice make up for any weakness. The Terrible Tide is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Terrible Tide","review":"Generally I'm not a huge fan of the books MacLeod writes as Alisa Craig -- the tongue-in-cheek cutesy melodrama is just a little *too* cozy for my tastes. Tbis book is different from those in her &quot;Grub and Stakers&quot; and &quot;Janet Rhys&quot; series, though -- it's a straightahead 1970's-Barbara-Michaels-style modern gothic, with a spunky-but-injured young heroine stranded in a dusty old heap of a house with two old ladies, ghostly noises in the night, and various threatening characters wandering in and out. If you like that kind of thing (and I do) it's a good read, although you will easily guess every &quot;shocking plot twist&quot; miles ahead of its revelation. I wish she'd write more like this one . . ."},{"Title":"Painless Speaking (Barron's Painless)","review":"Painless Speaking is written for public speeches or dramas rather than improving communication skill, if you ask me. So the content itself is pretty advanced, but too advanced for non-native speakers. Certainly, you need to change the way you talk according to the person you are talking to or the situation you are in. That's a fundamental art of conversation. I must admit this book shows us that clearly. However, I'm afraid it's going to be painFUL for non-native speakers if they deal with this first. Of course, again, it is quite useful for theater plays, musicals, and speech contests to get your message across to the audience.Therefore, for beginners it may be literally better to start with Painless English for Speakers of Other Languages. In other words, you shouldn't deal with Painless Speaking as a textbook for English conversation classes."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln's World","review":"This book is not about Abraham Lincoln alone, but about the world in which he lived.

Foster writes about what was happening all over the world when the main character was alive. The stories are so vivid that I still remember most of them: Benito Juarez growing up in Mexico, a Chinese boy studying for exams while his friend gets hooked on opium . . .

I developed a lifelong love of history."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln's World","review":"This is great story telling and a fun way to learn history. The World of Abraham Lincoln is not just about Abraham Lincoln, but the world in which he lived from birth to death. It covers from Lincoln's boyhood days in which Napoleon and Queen Victoria are discussed along with other major global figures. Throughout the book we are taken to various parts of the world to learn about impacting events and persons that shape history. From 1800 to 1865 is covered. The events of the USA are discussed: events like the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Alamo, the Missouri Comprimise, the Kansas-Nebraska Act and much more. One learns about the first Reich of Germany under Kaiser Wilhelm. The life of Abraham Lincoln is interwoven throughout these history time slices. These books are not just for kids, but for adults to learn history as well."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln's World","review":"As a homeschool mom I found Abraham Lincoln's World and George Washington's World so well written that is doesn't seem like a school book at all. The authors keep the reader engaged as though you are reading a story. It is not a biography of Lincoln but a time line of history during Lincoln's life. It puts historical events in perspective with each other so that a middle school child can understand how events effect each other and how countries and history are entwined. I did find, though that note taking in this book was difficult for my child, we became more creative and decided to write each name that was mentioned in the book as we came to it and made a list of events for each name, this worked great. This book is by no means a boring reference book, it is interesting and fun to read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln's World","review":"What a unique book!

In the 20th century, one of the most famous portrayals of Cossacks was in that early classic of Russian cinema, &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot;, in which a body of these perennial soldiers, dressed in the white jackets of the Tsar, gun down a crowd of civilians on a set of steps in Odessa (&quot;Cossack massacre on the steps&quot; in English works well as a pun).A little-known aspect of Cossack history is explored in Claudio Magris' pseudo-novel, &quot;Inferences from a Sabre&quot; (1986). In June 1941, shortly after Hitler's invasion of Russia, German agents persuaded General Pyotr Krasnov, &quot;ataman&quot; (chieftain) of a band of Cossacks, to command a battalion of these fighters, famed for their aversion to communism. Krasnov, then 72 years old, was one of the most colorful figures of the 20th-century. As Neal Ascherson writes in his engrossing book, &quot;Black Sea&quot;, Krasnov's hatred of &quot;Bolshevism&quot; was matched &quot;only by his contempt for the Judaeo-democratic West.&quot; After joining the White Russian armies in the civil war, he fled to Paris, &quot;where, to the astonishment of this tough old soldier's friends, he became a prolific novelist.&quot; After World War II, so the story goes, Krasnov was betrayed by the English, handed over to Stalin, and hanged as a traitor.Magris' &quot;novel&quot; takes the story up in October 1944. Hitler had promised the Cossacks a homeland in Carnia, that mountainous part of northeast Italy wedged between Venice, Austria, and Slovenia, and, the end of the war approaching, these exiles of the steppes were fighting it out with the Italian partisans. The book is a letter by Father Guido, a priest from Trieste, to one of his superiors.In 1944 Guido was sent to interecede with the Cossacks and try to mitigate the cruelty meted out on the Carnians. While he was there, he thinks he met Krasnov, whose life and death intrigue him from then on. The crux of the book is the &quot;enigma woven around the death of Krasnov&quot;, an enigma that begins on 2 May 1945. As the Cossacks flee on horseback through the Val di Gorto to hide out in the forests of Austria, one of them is shot dead by the partisans. His companions bury him in a poorly marked grave and throw in a broken sabre. Father Guido explores the possibility that, contrary to the official story, this soldier was Krasnov.Blurring the lines between fiction and reality, Magris plumbs the depths of Krasnov's character. Apart from the fact that Guido never existed, this lyrical &quot;novel&quot; would be an interesting work of speculation. Magris &quot;plays through the pathetic coda to Krasnov's life&quot;. We see the Cossack commander and his men as living contradictions, romantic figures (&quot;the flash of the blade in the air evoked for a moment the vague yearning glow of certain brief, blustery evenings, of curling sea-waves that seem to shine with the promise of everything we lack&quot;), medieval men, &quot;untamed and feudal&quot; who &quot;saw the revolution as the anonymous assault of modernity, the sunset of the individual, the end of adventure&quot;, yet also as anti-Semites, butchers, and the enemies of their own dream (&quot;the Cossacks reached that corner of the world [Carnia] to build themselves a house and to take shelter from the indeterminacy of nothingness, and instead they destroyed the hospitable order enclosed by these walls and delivered it back to formlessness.&quot;)The novel is a great read, one of the best I've read this year. I also recommend Magris' depressing book, &quot;The Other Sea&quot;, about an Italian on the plains of Patagonia, plus Ascherson's book mentioned above."},{"Title":"Operation Pinball/the Usaaf's Secret Aerial Gunnery Program of Wwii","review":"Operation Pinball was one of the oddest U.S.A.F. programs ever. A gunnery program devised in WWII, it involved specially armored Bell Kingcobras making gunnery passes at various U.S. bombers who fired upon the P-63s using special frangible ammunition. The Kingcobra was specially modified so that hits on the P-63 registered as flashing lights, therein giving the bomber gunners more realistic training. Former 'Pinball pilot' Ivan Hickman describes this odd yet fascinating program in this 1990 release from Motorbooks.Conceived in the spring of 1942, Operation Pinball was up-and-running by May 1944, the P-63 being selected as the best Bf 109 stand-in. Prior to war's end, the now-redesignated RP-63s helped train hundreds of heavy bomber crews before they shipped off for combat. As with any such innovative program, mishaps did occur and several Kingcobras - and a few target bombers - suffered damage or were downed.Hickman, who was one of the Kingcobra shootdowns, does an entertaining job describing this oddball innovation. He traces the development of aerial gunnery, the impetus for the Pinball program, the background history of the P-39 and -63 and the checkered history of the Pinball program.OPERATION PINBALL is an entertaining read. The author includes many of his own memories along with personal reminiscences of other Pinball pilots and personnel. The book features dozens of interesting and rare photographs of pilots, 'targets' and 'shooters,' armament, turrets, etc.In all likelihood, OPERATION PINBALL will stand as the definitive book on this innovative program. And it's a great read to boot! Recommended."},{"Title":"Operation Pinball/the Usaaf's Secret Aerial Gunnery Program of Wwii","review":"A comprehensive description of the \\"Pinball\\"training program involving bomber gunners firing (mostly) harmless plastic bullets at fighter planes (almost) fully protected by aluminum armor, including the luftwaffe \\"experten\\" fighter pilots that shot down so many heavy bombers, forcing a search for better ways to train bomber machine-gunners, various \\"realistic\\" training schemes preceding the pinball like complex movie-simulator setups, stories from many pilots that flew the planes into the hail of plastic bullets including the author himself, and his impressions of the not only the pinball fighter but also the original P63 fighter and its predecessor the P39. After reading about the pinball on the net I got immediately obsessed to find out the details. The American military often seems to get credit for innovating realistic training and planning schemes, and the pinball must be one of the most bold, extreme examples of such. I was also attracted since the P39/P63 is one of my favourite designs in the \\"not highly rated but the idea sounds so good\\" category: amidship engine layout allowing accurate-aiming heavy nose armament, pilot-friendly tricycle landing gear, very compact cooling intakes, and high visibility canopy for its time.

Estleman","review":"I've never really thought of myself as a fan of the 'Western' genre, but soon found that this was not required in order to thoroughly enjoy &quot;Hell On The Draw:Best Western stories by Loren D. Estleman&quot;. While each story is indeed rooted in the West, they are by no means your run of the mill 'shoot-em-ups.' Each one is completely different in mood and style, from lighthearted humor to dark twists of fate, from romance to a touch of the supernatural. The author fills each tale with people you'll find yourself wishing that you had known or vey glad that you didn't. The vividly described settings along with fine attention to historical details of events, people, equipment and weapons, pull you inside and make you feel as if you are there. Aside from the complete enjoyment of the stories themselves, this audio version features a variety of gifted voice talents well suited to the telling of these tales of the West."},{"Title":"Hell on the Draw: The Best Western Stories of Loren D. Estleman","review":"These stories have a western flavor, though the one I liked best, 'A Web of Books,' was downright scholarly. He has a book collector on the run who had bought a ten dollar version of a volume of Shakespeare's tragedies from an old bookstore out West. He has been followed by another book collector to obtain a valuable rare volume entitled 'The Midnight Sky' which had been published in Scotland in 1758. There are murders along the way as the killer is bound to have what he thinks he deserves. Instead, he is found out by the crafty bookseller.He is my kind of writer who hates to have his work edited in any form or fashion. When he tried to get 'The Pilgrim' published, a crazy editor rankled him by changing a tad too much by using this as a scapegoat to vent all the vitriol accumulated in his job. He completely revamped it, omitting some of the necessary parts of the work. When he was demoted from that publisher to \\"Reader's Digest\\" it was a 'fitting punishment,' according to this author who had to almost rewrite the whole thing to satisfy this man's demands. Here, it is in the original state for the reader to decide on the changes.'Kate' was most interesting because this story gives the background of one of the important participants in the Wyatt Earp legend. She was born in Budapest but came to Davenport, Iowa, in 1863. She watched as the trains brought the alarming chain of coffins from Manassas, Sharpsburg, and Antitem, something which upset a young impressionable girl. And so she ran away and stayed in a convent for six months before marrying a 'professional' to get out of there. They went to Vicksburg, then to Atlanta, where things were all in a mess after Sherman's fateful March. In 1877, in a small town, she became acquainted with a personage of our history, one Doc Holliday and was just one of his women there in the saloon (like Gunsmoke's Miss Kitty). Before the big gunfight at the OK Corral, she became known as his wife.In 'Hell on the Draw,' the town of Persephone, out west, was taken over by the Devil on horseback. He bought the gambling house called Brimstone, and things went from bad to worse as he carried out his mission of death. It took a \\"retired\\" gunfighter named Marlowe (how about that?) to set things right again by not fighting fair. Whoever said that life is fair? I don't usually read short stories as they don't have the depth for elaboration as a novel, except for this writer. They may be based in the Old West, but they are varied and each a gem on its own."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"SPOILER ALERT! Let's start here. Ayn Rand is not a great writer. As proof I offer the following comparison. I read recently that a survey had indicated that this book was voted the book that had changed more people's lives second only to the Bible. Rand cannot touch the beauty of the language in the Bible (and I say that as a nonreligious person). Her language is more the utilitarian language of business which is perhaps fitting given that both the subject matter of this novel and Rand's highest ideal is business.That is not to say that this is not a good book, because it is. It is almost awe-inspiring that writing in the late fifties she predicted where we are today. When I first read this novel some thirty years ago, I thought that she was exaggerating the danger, that the US could never go pure nuts and, in worshiping the false gods of fairness and compassion, we would legislate ourselves into poverty and weakness. I stand corrected. Rand predicted the death of truth in journalism, the arrogant pseudo-intellectual rot in government and academy, and the use of junk science to promote socialism. Her characters spout drivel just our leaders spout drivel today. For example, a failed banker who took down the economy of an entire state with the bankruptcy of his bank because he ran it as a banker with a heart rather than by financial calculation, brags that he never made a profit. Our current president-elect, the former community organizer, similarly seeks to rule with a heart by looting from those who earn and promising to give to those who need and who can brag that he has never made a profit, or contributed anything of value to the community. As I write this, the heads of the big three automobile companies are coming hat in hand to the congress to beg for $25,000,000,000 or more based upon their need, not their value, and argue, in essence, that they are too big to fail. As Rand predicted, the looters and the moochers are reigning supreme.Rand failed to foresee a few of the looters and moochers tactics, most notably the cult of multiculturalism/diversity/political correctness and the environmental hysteria, particularly the global warming fraud.Rand's solution, however, is the problem. The plot is that the movers and shakers stop moving and shaking thus causing the economy to collapse thus forcing the looters and moochers out of power and allowing free market capitalism to prevail. There are several problems with this starting with that it is unlikely that the looters and moochers would ever see the error of their ways and get out of the way. On the contrary, the more failure their economic solutions cause, the more excuse they have for implementing ever more radical looting and mooching. (Obama's soon to be chief of staff, Rahm Emmanuel expressed this as, \\"You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. And what I mean by that is an opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\\") Nor has it historically been the case that the looters and moochers go quietly into this good night. Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, for example, has looted and mooched the former breadbasket of Africa into absolute economic collapse (an inflation rate of hundreds of millions percent) and, although everybody else may be starving, Mugabe is doing just fine, thank you very much.Further, closing up shop and retiring to the great unknown is not an option unless individuals own the businesses outright. However fed up with regulation and taxation the president or chairman of the board of GM or any other big corporation may be, they can't just shut her down. The shareholders aren't going to let that happen.Finally, Rand's solution is suspiciously like the old sixties mantra of tune in, turn on, and drop out. That is what John Galt and the other heroes do. They go play in the woods in the Rocky Mountains and feel good about themselves while conducting economic sabotage just like the hippies did. Groovy, man.Notable by its absence, and questioning the viability of the Rand vision of economic heroism, is the parent-child relationship. None of the heroes have any children nor time to raise them. There is a fairly long discussion of Dagny and James Taggart's childhood, and shorter references to those of Francisco d'Anconia and Eddie Willers. References to their relationships with their families are largely limited to hero worship of ancestors, such as Nat Taggart, and acknowledgment of their parents' cluelessness, such as Dagny's mother (who is never named). Rand's vision doesn't require, perhaps doesn't allow, child rearing. (I don't believe that Rand herself had any children.) If we are all living the lives of heroes, where will the next generation of heroes come from? Or, for that matter, where will our customers come from?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" is a book worth reading. It takes some effort to make it through this lengthy, thoughtful and intellectually challenging book, but it is worth it in the end.While controversial in a number of ways, the philosophy, thoughts and observations that thread through this book are worth understanding, whatever one's viewpoint(s) might be along these lines.A novel, a philosophy textbook and a snapshot of the world as it was wrapped up into one publication, \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" remains as relevant today as it did when it was published decades ago.Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged describes a socialism beyond extreme that could only be countered by a capitalism also beyond extreme. It's really as simple as that, in my humble opinion. Enjoy the book in that light--eschew the shadows.And this is a great time for everyone to read this work because we have an extreme in our present circumstances in America, a situation that would be abhorred vehemently by Any Rand, and should be so abhorred by all of us: An extreme form of capitalism that is aided and abetted by government; new robber barons who cannot get their gain by creativity, so must be virtually handed it by rules, codes, regulations, laws, and court reviews established and promoted by government at all levels. What at one time was our government is now in the business of advancing mediocrity.Too bad Ayn Rand or someone of her intellect hasn't yet created a neo-Atlas-Shrugged with reverse characterizations."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I decided to take on the monumentous task of reading this book after hearing some good things about it and seeing it near the top of some \\"Best books of the 20th century\\" lists. Although I havent read nearly enough to make a great judgment on whether this is one of the best books of the 20th century or not I highly doubt that I would put it up there if I had read more. Ayn Rand's philosophy has some good ideas that I agree with. Ideas such as the one that one should honour only people's virtues and not their faults for example. Some other aspects of her philosophy seem to me to be misguided however. For example, while organized religion certainly has some faults I do not believe that it's ultimate goal is the unhappiness of everyone and that it is a philosophy of \\"death\\" that they preach. I am certainly not a very religion person but to totally rip into religion as Ms. Rand does seems unjustified, at least she does not present adequate justification to me. Also, even if everyone followed Ayn Rand's desired trading code I doubt the world would be perfect. I mean some people just can't produce wealth because they were born with mental or physical disabilities or what have you.The way the book was written made it difficult to read for extended sessions. I agree with other reviewers who say that the characters are pretty one-dimensional and I found them almost to be more like robots than humans. The main characters are pretty good at everything too, as if they have no faults. Not only can they produce amazing industrial achievements but they can also drive perfectly and fire weapons masterfully. One chapter of the book is a 70-page monologue that is almost unbearable. It doesn't help that the same ideas are re-hashed over and over and over. Rand really overdoes it when trying to get her point across. Overall I would reccomend that people read this book if they want to get some interesting philosophical ideas if they are willing to slog through some difficult section of monotony."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has an ounce of ambition. If you are one who belives that you are entitled to sit on your lazy ... and do nothing but whine about your lack of opportunity while living off of the hard work of others, then you probably won't enjoy this book. Otherwise read it as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I picked this up after reading CONQUEST OF PARADISE, a novel with similar themes that simply blew me away. I remembered reading this in high school and decided to re-read it. Ayn Rand writes so beautifully and descriptively that it is difficult to put her books down. While the FOUNTAINHEAD was a masterpiece, ATLAS SHRUGGED, though long and at times tedious, is one of the finest written books I've ever been lucky enough to read. The characters are masterful, and the intrigue is gripping. Dagney Taggart and Hank Rearden are admirable characters who truly come to life. The book touches on subjects which apply today, over forty years later. They include: Big business and the role government; what happens when big government overtakes big business's ability to create and succeed. In many ways, it predicts the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. The book is deep, yet fun. I've never enjoyed a book more, and highly recommend CONQUEST OF PARADISE as complimentary reading."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If a man is the sum of his actions, then what is he if he performs no actions? What happens when more people consume than produce? What are the implications of the mindset that simply because one breathes, one is entitled to just as much as the next person? These questions and more are answered in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.Set in the mid-1900s, this is a thrilling novel that, through a logical course of events, illustrates the extreme dangers of a communistic society. Written in the third-person, the novel follows the lives of several characters, especially Dagny Taggart, a vice president at a major transcontinental railroad.The country is being bled dry by people who don't produce and who take from those who do. People have forgotten the relationship between productivity and reward. Communistic behaviors prevail as far as the eye can see.The only ones keeping society from collapsing are those who are hated most - the producers. Their pride and responsibility are inspiring, but even they have limits. As more resources are squandered through stupidity, the government tightens restrictions on production, with Dagny and other powerhouses taking the brunt of it. The more that is destroyed by the stupid, the more that is demanded of the intelligent.Curiosity and exasperation eventually lead Dagny to investigate a man named John Galt, whom no one seems to know anything about, but who may hold the fate of the world in his hands. During the course of her search, there are enough twists and turns to keep one interested. The ending instills a sense of bliss, to say the least, and is well worth reading the entire book.I recommend Atlas Shrugged to anyone who can read, and the audiotape for anyone who can't, or won't. At 1,168 pages, it will take a while to finish, but the sense of purpose you gain from this book makes every minute well spent. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is that it was written in the 1950s, yet we can already see in our own society elements of the future it portrays, a future that chills my bones."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is not a &quot;life changing&quot; book. Nor is it the well-written, well-oiled Great American Novel many consider it to be. But it is one of the most interesting, most colorful, and most insightful books I've read in a long time.The book is ostensibly about a railroad executive who finds that she needs to fight to get the freedom to do what is in her best interest. Obstacles, from the incompetance of her brother, the railroad's president, to the government's insistence to enact &quot;People's legislation&quot;, frustrate her and her fellow indistrialists. Eventually, the government's meddling causes widespread dissonance in the economy, and, eventually, to a breakdown of transportation, food distribution, etc. The mythical figure of John Galt, a slang phrase (&quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;), used to convey a feeling of hopelessness, figures in the plot as she tries to track down the origin of the phrase. The book spirals into a succession of exiciting events, and you have a full range to choose from: political power plays, factory riots, mine explosions, physical torture, you name it.The high points of this book are not merely good, but great. As another reviewer pointed out, damned if she doesn't make steel production and railroad operations exciting! The above synopsis sounds a bit heavy-handed--more on that later--but everything is done gradually and piecemeal so that you're halfway through a crisis before you stop to think about its consequences.That said, this book really attempts to do two things at once. It attempts to tell a great story, and it attempts to establish and preach Rand's philosophy. In the first count she does exteremly well. With a few exceptions, every page is significant and exciting. This, from a book that is over 1,000 pages long! The exceptions, however, are the few monologues that permeate the book just enough to make it notable but not enough to drag the story down. The famous diatribes--most notably Fransisco's &quot;money&quot; speech and the 80-page (!) radio address--are not nearly as eloquent or interesting as many Rand followers believe it to be, though the points are quite valid.And--this is a nitpick, to be sure--I dislike books that overuse noted words. For &quot;The Catcher in the Rye,&quot; it was &quot;Phoney;&quot; in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; it's &quot;looter.&quot; Everyone's a looter in AS: It's true, but everyone uses the word so much that it becomes meaningless.As a philosophical tome, Rand does the job, I'd say, 80 to 90 percent as it should be. Her arguments are convincing, they are not &quot;extreme,&quot; though I will admit that she's quite inflexible. A is A, as she says, and anything deviating from that--i.e., anyone that disagrees with her--is absolutely wrong and not worth thinking about. I agree with most of it, but with the Rand followers I talk to, there's no argument--it's Rand or nothing.Translated in book terms, the story supports her philosophy, and you don't know it--no &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; bash-over-the-head nonsense. I wouldn't quite call it subtle, but it doesn't turn you away. The only disappointment is during the radio address, when Rand discusses religion (to which she is violently against)--this seemed to be soapbox preaching, not because it's about religion, but because religion was not an issue *at all* throughout the book. (at least directly; Rand supporters would argue it's essential to her philosophy. That may be true, but it's bad prose.) It's as if she forgot about it, so at the last minute stuck it in.In the end, though it is well worth the read. Be prepared to skip a few pages now and then--and don't let anyone tell you they didn't--but it's not necessarily because it's boring. This book is anything but boring."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have to agree with a most recent review that &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; will make you think because it is a book about ideas. The core of John Galt's philosophy is that &quot;I will never live for another person or ask another person to live for me.&quot; Now, what kind of person would say that? And who would NOT say that? This book makes a mystery story out of asking that question and giving you an answer.If you strongly dislike this philosophy, you most likely will hate and think poorly of the book. But why would you hate a book about living your own life and about not making others live for you? Isn't that how you live? Read this story of ideas and think about it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I just finished reading Atlas Shrugged...it took me 3-4 months. Unfortunately, I can only give it 2-stars out of 5.The most positive aspects of the book were Rand's colorful descriptions (e.g. city scenes) and strong use of similes and metaphors. She is a decent writer, but mostly around the way she describes things, not in plot creation or character development. That's about all I can say on the positive side.I should mention that I agree with the vast majority of Rand's philosophies, including her concepts around selfishness, libertarianism, her beliefs on theism, and generally speaking I agree with her ideas on objectivism. So don't mis-read this review as not agreeing with her philosophies, as many negative reviews on this book are. This is a primarily negative review on the novel itself! To keep this short (a statement Rand has probably never mouthed):* The book could have been easily cut in half...it's entirely too long for its relatively basic storyline and utter lack of character development* The entire 1168-page book only contains 2 character types--the handsome, intelligent, well-spoken, objectivist \\"good guys\\", and the sniveling, conniving, unattractive, slinky, back-handed, WHINY \\"bad guys\\". It's entirely too black and white...EVERY character in the book falls into one of those two categories. The lack of a middle ground or of varying personalities makes the book quite unrealistic and, frankly, *boring*. Every leading man in the book has the exact same personality, which Dagny shares. No wonder Dagny went from seeing Francisco to Rearden to Galt, given that they all have the exact same personality! And every one of the \\"bad guys\\" has the maturity level of a teenager...whining, pleading, groveling, crying, begging, etc. I mean how the heck did James Taggart ever get commissioned to run a public company like TT? He didn't seem to have a single business skill, nor any mental fortitude whatsoever. Furthermore, I hardly know anyone who has this weak and groveling of a personality, yet in the novel, almost all of the Americans do including every single member of government (conveniently). The dialog that came out of the sniveling \\"bad guy\\" crowd was soooo tiresome to listen to--I don't know about the 50s but people just don't talk like the people in this book...AT ALL. But again the biggest point here is that I've never read a novel where there were only 2 personalities in the entire book, much less in an 1168-page one!* The book is set in some sort of pseudo-United States. I say \\"pseudo\\" because there doesn't appear to be a president, nor any checks and balances in any of the government arms that are changing the laws around so spuriously. It actually doesn't even appear to be a democracy, as nobody ever even mentions voting or impeaching the government out, even as the country is going to hell in a hand-basket. It was so un-America like that I'm not clear on why she set the novel in America...it would've been more realistic to put it somewhere that was less of a free society already. Speaking of which, what's happening to the rest of the world in the novel while America is falling apart? Why aren't these horrible conditions in America just driving Americans to move to Canada or back to Europe?? Instead they're committing suicide and starving? Huh??* John Galt's 60-page monologue over the radio was absolutely **painful** to wade through. It could've been 3-4 pages and covered everything quite nicely. How unbelievable, too, that any of the \\"sniveling\\" crowd would actually sit and listen to the esoteric and labored ramblings of Galt for 3 hours on the radio? I'm not even sure a rabid NPR listener would sit through more than a few minutes of that speech. Yet somehow, even though nobody knows a single thing about Galt prior to the radio broadcast, somehow he's practically a God (certainly a savior type) after the speech, and the government guys want to give him full control over everything. Huh?? Interestingly, I thought there were some pretty deep parallels to Galt and Jesus Christ throughout much of the book, other than Galt was saved during HIS crucifixion.* Interesting side-note: in almost 1200 pages, there were no children mentioned in the book. None. Certainly not by name, and really not even as a concept. Though many of the characters in the book were married (none happily), none had children. Just thought that was interesting, and really for me I think it subconsciously lent to the whole environment being not-believable (along with many other factors, most covered in this review). Where are the kids Ms. Rand?* Also interesting that the person who led a company in this book pretty much WAS the company. Dagny was TT, Rearden was Rearden Metal, Francisco was Anaconia Copper, etc. That person was so critical to the company that just leaving the company was enough to practically destroy it. It was like there were just a few dozen (or perhaps a few hundred) worthwhile employees in the entire country, and once they went to the valley, along with some economic policy changes, everything fell apart within months. It was just entirely too dramatic of a scene, and the main individuals in the book had way too much ability to make their company succeed or fail. Keep in mind these were among the biggest companies in the country. If the CEO of Coca Cola disappeared, somehow I think the company would be OK.I could keep going, but I won't. The most summarizing statement I could say about this book is that it's very weak as a novel, as it attempts to surround and support Rand's strong philosophical ideas. Ms. Rand should have just stripped the \\"novel\\" part out of the book and presented it as a 100-150 page treatise on objectivism, like some of her non-fiction works. That would have served two important purposes: (1) letting the reader know upfront that they're reading a bland philosophy book (as opposed to them thinking they'll be reading a page-turning novel), and (2) shortened the book 10-fold, which heaven knows this book desperately needed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I decided to re-read this classic after first having read it twenty years ago. It is amazing how timeless this book is! More importantly, in this era we now find ourselves in, of big government and the demeaning of private enterprise, Ayn Rand's politics resound. While I am not a fan of her promotion of atheism, a philosophy more engrained today in the hearts of the big government political elitists, I am a fan of her promotion of the businessman. For some odd reason, the weaker politicos in Washington are almost always compelled to repress capable men and women around the country in their endeavors, be it through the second highest corporate income taxes in the world (currently right behind Japan) or through prohibitive legislation. Rand would recognize the drive toward nationalism we are currently seeing in our country (banks, insurance companies, hospitals, you name it). She wrote about and predicted this in Atlas Shrugged (published in 1957), and experience it first hand as a child when the Soviets took over her fathers store in St. Petersburg, Russia during the October Revolution. In Atlas Shrugged, Rand describes the chaos of a society growing ever more dependent on a weak and bigger government. The story itself is engaging, but the lessons for today are unavoidable. I highly recommend this read, along with Amity Shlaes \\"The Forgotten Man\\" in tandem. We need to have strong voices of dissension toward bigger government."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand paints a grim picture of America crumbling, as collectivist ideas take hold and destroy the economy. She mounts an ingenious attack on these ideas, both theory and practice. The copper mine failure, for instance, had me laughing out loud. Ultimately, Rand shows that collectivism is based on a distorted notion of morality.Atlas Shrugged is best read as philosophy, not art. As a novel, it is marred by lengthy speeches, cardboard villains, and improbable dialogue. On the other hand, the anti-capitalist thread in American literature, which Rand rebuts, is huge and also poorly written. No one ever complains about Lewis or Dos Passos. Rand's thousand pages barely tip the balance.Stimulate the economy! Buy two copies."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged isn't the easiest book, but it is a really good one. The story line is engrossing, but there are long sections of political philosophy that bog you down. If you can read those parts attentively, they do make you think, make you ask yourself what you believe. But if you can't get through them, you can always just skim over them. (Don't tell anyone I said that!) You'll still get the message from the story. The story isn't dry at all, as you might expect from a book that has a message. There is mystery in it, and passion. It's a very intense book even with the political essays.I first read this as a sophomore in high school, and there was one quote from it that made such an impact on me that I still remember it. It is: \\"Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.\\" This book also was a strong lifelong influence on me in inspiring me to always strive to be the best I can be at whatever I am doing; and in taking responsibility for what I do rather than offering excuses.Although Ms. Rand was an arrogant snob about her intellect - and it does show in her writing - there is no question that she did have a brilliant mind."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Read this as a young college student.

This is the one notable exception. I stumbled across Atlas Shrugged when I was in my late 20's, and have read it about every 5 years since. It has been the most influential book in my life.Why? Two reasons. First is because over time my spirit is eroded by the drumbeat of media pop philosophy. It's unfair to expect other people to perform to my level. I shouldn't be selfish merely because I am able to do more than others. I should accept that my role as a productive citizen is to serve those who can't or won't do the same. Rereading Atlas Shrugged reminds me that just because \\"people\\" say it constantly doesn't make it true.The second reason is that I tell people how prescient Ayn Rand was, but when I experience it again I relive that breath-taking astonishment at how someone could see so clearly through the decades. Every time I read it, our world has come much, much closer to the one she predicted. The latest financial crisis seems to be taken directly from the pages of Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I loved this book when I read it for the first time at 16.

Indeed many of the ways that government treats those it is entrusted to protect in the book are straight from todays headlines.The characters are very well thought out and realistic.

I found myself glancing through page after page without really missing anything of great importance. Things that could be summed up in a paragraph or 2 tend to go on for several pages. The worst part is that it feels like the same things are being said over and over and over. The author didn't seem to trust that the reader would be able to \\"get\\" her message the first time.

In retrospect I would just read the cliff notes for this treatise. Also, just like for the KJV Bible they have made Living and NIV versions in modern day language, the publisher of Atlas Shrugged needs to revamp it into a 21st century version -- they can use Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Meg Whitman for the protoganists.

It's hard to start and hard to finish, though I do like the story. Very fitting to read during these trying times of the world today."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Rand's philosophy, as stated in Atlas Shrugged, is basically that the world is run by talented super-geniuses (like Gault) without whom all productive activity would stop. Due to the burden of the parasitic class, including the government, these super-geniuses decide to flee to a valley, away from such moochers where their mental gifts are free to be unleashed. On the other hand, you have Nietzsche who espoused a view of the unrestrained Will as being represented by the Over-Man, the super-human who has dominion over the world because he is strong and is expressing his will, and there are weaker individuals, who adhere to a slave-morality who try to stop the Over-Man. He wrote this in 1883.True he was not writing about an economic system, but neither does Rand. To believe her philosophy you have to turn economics into a morality play, where only the righteous and good succeed, and the weak parasitic leechers fail and deserve to fail. It's beyond an economic system, let alone a capitalistic one. It's not as if the free market exists in a vacuum. A market, businesses, producers all rely on common space (highways, access to markets, a peaceful society) that they do not pay for directly, nor would they if they weren't coerced by...I don't know the government.In order to have a functioning market, there have to be rules that buyers and sellers agree on. When the seller bribes the judge, or the tax collector, it's not free, and yet that's the hallmark of capitalistic enterprise. So-called producers are allowed to become too big to fail. So big, in fact, that they end up buying the rules. Oh, you have a small business and have to pay taxes and follow regulations, you're not a capitalist, just a sucker. Walmart and Exxon get a tax rebate and make their own regulations--that's capitalism.Ruthless capitalist isn't a myth. To succeed in business, beyond merely making a better product (and lets face it, how often does that happen) you have to be a tyrant--squashing your friends and crushing your enemies. This is what Rand espouses in her book."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I've noticed that there are a couple of basic reactions to \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" - what I will call the critical philosophical kind and the youthful enthusiastic kind.Rand's writings have appeal to the youth, I've noticed, and other people who take to her ideas of justice in economics. It is far too easy to read Rand and easily identify with her ideals of justice without considering how these things might actually shape up were they instituted in real life. One other review I read elsewhere said that \\"her main accomplishment is her ability to make the unwary or slightly-informed reader feel superior to every one else he knows or meets. Thus, for young people, this book can produce bothersome results ... for a long time.\\" As I was well into my 40's when I first read the book (just to discuss it with a friend over email) I did not get to experience this phenomenon firsthand, but I find exactly that sort of attitude given by several young reviewers here on Amazon. This is in no way intended to be an ad hominem statement - I'm just making objective observations.It is easy to get excited or \\"all het up\\" about new ideas, especially when they seem to address the deep problems of the world. However, the more mature and perhaps more sober mind will ask why then hasn't it been discovered before? And therein lies the rub, and what is wrong with Rand's book. As others have noted in various ways, one just can't live her philosophy - because it's just not made for actual humans. And that is what I would like to focus upon here in this review.How is it, for instance, that common people and government people tend toward cravenness while businessmen (and -women) are immune to such vice and are indeed paragons of virtue? What kind of person finds such measure of satisfaction from the production of excellence and the receiving of just pay for such production that he is never tempted to try to get more for his work than it is worth? What kind of person will bow down and worship the idea and ideal of money as his guiding principle in life taking the utmost care never to violate it either by asking too much of it or by producing even slightly shoddy work? I sincerely hope the movie will make an attempt to portray a truly \\"Objective\\" person; I suggest such a person will be rather inhuman.Notice that Rand is trying to say we should be virtuous, we should be just, and we should never ask too much or give too little. We did not need Rand to tell us that. There are numerous tales out there of the how and why of human weakness and imperfection. Perhaps one of the most widely known is the one in the book of Genesis of Adam and Eve's fall from grace. So Rand's observations are not in any way new or even surprising - we are pretty sorry in many ways! But her novel proposed \\"cure\\" takes away much more than it offers by inverting traditional interpretations of virtue and vice.It is most helpful, I think, to realize that Rand came of age during the post-Czarist Russian times and like many young people was heavily influenced by the tenor of times as she grew into adulthood. She may well have found herself no longer able to put any trust in any social institutions and conventions and turned to the individual as the source of meaning, since that may well have been all with which she found herself left. I can only have any sympathy for her ideas using this idea as a frame of reference.Now to my specific critique of her ideas. There are many objections that I could raise, but I intend to look at only a few.The first I've already mentioned: how and why are business people to be trusted when government and the common rabble cannot be given this same trust? How can Rand avoid a charge of elitism here? Where is the guarantee that business people will actually keep faith in what I'll call the \\"God of economics\\" and never ever abuse the power that money gives them? Look at the current post-banking-scandal world in which we live. I'm afraid that the current times strongly point to the idea of universal human weakness. I see people as worshiping the having of money, not the ideal of it. Rand is simply out of touch with real, actual, living, imperfect people here.Secondly: How are we to start the process of getting only that which we earn? An infant or child cannot deserve anything yet. Rand (hypocritically, I believe) dodges this issue by claiming that it's not really \\"sacrifice\\" when giving is directed toward one's children. This is plain nonsense to anyone who has been around children ... in case one's own childhood is forgotten. And I find it creepy to contemplate what will happen to the old people - a society of euthenasia seems inevitable.Thirdly: What would a real person look like that embodied Rand's Objectivist virtues? Imagine one whose highest goal in life is to produce as well as he can. I do not for a moment suggest that excellence is not a good thing. But I just can't imagine getting the kind of totality of satisfaction from such activity that Rand ascribes to it. No matter how good I am or how good my production, I'll always be reaching or hungering for a vague \\"more\\" in life, as nothing I accomplish can possibly fill the deep hunger within. I would suggest that whatever Rand's ideal Objectivist would look like to me and many others, such a person would be a very narrow individual indeed.Finally, the very premises of her philosophy seem a bit mutually contradictory, and it is here that I make my most fundamental objection. She essentially espouses a radical individualism. But any philosophy that purports to making the individual his own measure cannot allow itself to make any further prescriptions, as this authority has been radically handed over by the philosopher to the individual who puts the philosophy into practice. How can she first say it is within the authority of the individual to pursue his happiness and then say one can never use a person as a means to an end? What if I as an individual can't or won't accept the idea that achievement will produce happiness? How can I as an individual follow my own counsel and then accept the rest of Rand's philosophy, if I happen to think it will not serve my ends?As I see it, the premises of her Objectivism stand somewhat independent of one another and require some sort of encompassing principle if they are to be seen as a cohesive whole. In other words, Objectivism must be taken as a kind of religion rather than a set of conclusions that might be drawn by many a reasonable person independent of belief. Another way of saying it is to point out that there exist no self-evident truths that can be automatically universally accepted by anyone exerting his or her raw intelligence. Therefore, the individual no longer is the true master of his destiny.These are some of the things that I have against Rand's philosophy. Notice the \\"Objective\\" nature of my complaints as opposed to weak ad hominem \\"people don't give her a fair shake\\" kind of reviews I've read here. I've noticed that serious readers easily find specific things to say against Rand's thinking, which truly seems rather underdeveloped. The above-mentioned typically younger crowd tends to be less critical. I'm hoping that any comments my review attracts will be objective (if not Objectivist) and specific, because I believe that precise criticism of the subject at hand will better serve the potential readers of Rand's works, keeping in mind the nature of this forum.I find myself wondering, too, if Rand's atheism doesn't perhaps make her react against typical religiously upheld virtues such as personal sacrifice and charity toward those in need. It is easier for me to accept, for instance, her assertion that people should be paid only what they deserve if she didn't also mention that the traditional virtues are not only unneeded but actually evil. Her posture here makes me wonder what unstated premises really form the basis of her arguments. As much as atheists like to fancy themselves bias-free, I have never found this to be the case. No one is bias-free, because any coherent argument must flow from premises that are ultimately neither provable nor disprovable.Potential readers should be prepared for a long read that often becomes rather heavily didactic, frequently long and drawn out, and in one case (the exposition of Rand's philosophy using John Gault's pirated radio broadcast as a vehicle) an expository rant of such ponderous and tedious verbiage to severely test the patience of the most dedicated reader. I believe in this last case Rand was trying to make sure that her readers got the full benefit of every pearl of her wisdom; it's up to the individual to decide if she succeeded, and I would say she could have made her case with the spillage of a great deal less of ink.I did like Part I, as it had the feel of a cosmic mystery in the making. I will concur with other reviewers who objected to the often clumsy feel of the writing, but that really didn't bother (or entertain) me excessively. I will also concur with the accusation that Rand's protagonists were idealized and that she made straw men of her anti-heros - but I will not object, as this kind of literary technique has been widely used by others as a means of conveying their arguments. Similarly the length of the book per se didn't bother me - and I read every single word of every page.In summary: worth reading not because of its intellectual clarity or worthwhile content, but because of its appeal to a wide portion of society. Understanding Rand's ideas and recognizing their wide appeal certainly gives insight into the society in which we live."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read Atlas Shrugged and four other books by Ayn Rand 25 years ago during my senior year of highschool. Nothing held a light to the clear portrayal of capitalism in Atlas until Alanna the Great was published last year. Atlas Shrugged presents capitalism and the challenges it faced in the mid 20th century. If you find Atlas Shrugged too long and too full of philosophy, then try Alanna for a fast paced 21st century novel in praise of capitalism."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"First off, Ayn Rand is not the greatest thinker of the 20th century, no matter what your trendy friend wearing a Rocky Horror Picture Show tee-shirt says. She is at best a romance novelist with wooden writing on par with Danielle Steele on her worst day (everybody is always seeing so much cliche emotion in the eyes of the heros). Rand was not even very original, copying objectivism from Thomas Jefferson who said it better anyway the first time. Anybody who thinks that Rand solves all problems (and combats socialism and censorship though any non-Romantism novel or movie is hated by all Objectivists I've noticed) isn't thinking about all the contradictions in her philosophy. For instance one must think on their own and be different, and yet everyone of her hero characters acts exactly the same (perhaps an example of her poor use of characterization)and their enemies never get a chance to speak, leaving out the possibility of free thought. The reader is constantly being assaulted by Rand's beliefs, never getting a chance to think differently. Objectivism has as many contradictions as the bible, with all the blind followers of it believing every word Rand ever muttered without thinking about there own philosphy of free thought and originality. Besides all of this, the novel is plotted horribly (putting in Gault's speech right in the middle of the action slows everything down and bores the reader), showing that Rand really just was a fourth rate writer with some ideas that attract certain people like moths, or perhaps lemmings, following Rand over the cliff of logic, swallowing every contradiction as fact. Admit it, even if you're a die-hard Objectivist who believes everything Rand ever said (kind of a contradiction though), Rand was a horrible Romance novelist. Read some Fabio and get the same experience."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Ayn Rand ran away from Communism then spent the rest of her live trying to convince the world that she did the right thing. In 1957 some Westerners still weren't sure. Most of the world is now. While &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; has more complex plot than &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; the characters are similar in dimension, the dialog as unrealistic, and the human relationships as mechanical (I doubt if rape and love get confused much these days). After over 40 years of hearing Ayn Rand's name but knowing virtually nothing about her, I now have read, at age 66, both these books in the past month (whew!) and I doubt if I'll visit them again. readers who wish to become familiar with a point of view (but who can also think for themselves, are urged to tackle one or both. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; would be a good start. If still intrigued, then try &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot; I can't ever recall skipping pages in a book, but admit that John Galt's three hour speech baffle! d me. After the first few pages, there wasn't much more to say. But he said it anyway. Shades of Fidel Castro et al. Dogmatism sounds the same, whether from the Left or the Right!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Hear, hear to the reader from Austin Texas who got it exactly right. If I might add to what he wrote, I'll point out that Ms. Rand's book wouldn't have even been published without the efforts of many of the non-genius &quot;parasites&quot; she denigrates.Or did she--all by herself--chop down the trees, process the pulp (after building the paper mill), collect the material necessary for the ink and process it, design the printing press and build it (with the machine shop she built herself), create the bindery, proofread and edit her text, carry her books to every store and sell them herself? (And I've left out quite a few steps!)Of course not. In truth, Ms. Rand knew very little about the human condition, now or ever. What she knew about was her own ego which she magnified into thousands of pages of philosophical nonsense. For authors who struggle with the human condition, try Dostoevsky, Conrad, Hardy, De Assis, Toer....well you get the idea."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I say get the cliff notes. The book is very long. However,the reason so many people spit venom at Rand is because she strikes at the root of their irrationalism. Most people would rather live in the matrix. Most people would rather let their emotions rule reality. It's more comforting that way."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I'm a Physics major (Junior)and a member of the US military (MIANG) I normally don't read much fiction. I read a variety of other subjects (hist, econ/fin , math, biblical, politics, communications etc). The reason I picked up this book was that I wanted to read some fiction and my brother had once suggested Anthem. I remembered the author and saw Atlas Shrugged at the bookstore. After reading the back I decided it should be an interesting story and a challenging (lengthy) undertaking. What I did not expect to find is my new favorite, most inspiring and inspirational book. I relate to this book so well that I feel as if it was written to me. Ayn Rand puts into words some of the things I have half-thought and felt all of my life.I think that the best application of this book, at present (other than personally), is to realize that we live in the most prosperous country with one of the most free and productive societies of all time, BUT it is the simple fact that we (as a society) do not adhere to nor believe in the foundations that it was built on... Free Will, Freedom to Persue Happiness, Hard Work, Self Pride, Individual Effort..... etc... I am not saying that the US started with a perfect sys nor that it has not improved, only that she points out (intentionally or not, I don't know) the areas to improve.OVERALL :LENGTH : not a challengeSTORY : mostly exciting with a few slow spotsIDEAS : life changing and thought provokingBEST QUALITY : AMERICAN AMERICAN AMERICAN AMERICAN, through and throughWORST DRAWBACK : redundancy of &quot;looters&quot; ideas and actions... it makes you wait for the really exciting stuff"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Worst book I've read in a long time. The premise of the story was interesting. The execution of the plot, to say nothing of the development of the charcters was overly simplistic and self-serving. Ms. Rand had a point to make, and attempted to disguise a 50 page treatise with over a thousand (!) pages of poorly written, repetitive drivel. She only manages to make her theory of \\"objectivism\\" seem all the more absurd. I don't normally write reviews, but this was bad enough to make an exception. If this saves even one person the pain of slogging through this torture, it'll be worth it."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"You will be tempted, after a while, to skim-read the nine-page monologues. My advice is to yield to temptation. When George Orwell inserted long chapters of a fictional political treatise into \\"1984\\" ... well, he wrote better, for one thing; for another, Orwell's slabs of text have an internal structure, and don't merely repeat themselves. When Rand launches one of her characters into a rant you can sleep easy in the knowledge that each paragraph will merely repeat the previous one, with new bursts of rhetoric, new insults (some not so new: the words \\"looter\\" and \\"moocher\\" are used so often that by the end of the novel they have become technical terms), and new outbursts of spite that the author could not bear to leave out.The ironic high point, for me, comes midway through Book 3, Chapter 2, when it's Richard Halley's turn to talk his throat dry. His speech is an expression of hatred for artists whose works merely issue from them as expressions of feeling (\\"like vomit from a drunkard\\"), who don't realise the iron discipline required to turn their impulses into a coherent, beautiful work. So where's Rand's \\"iron discipline\\"? Her novel, which began promisingly enough, had hundreds of pages ago been ruined by her unwillingness to cut a single. Whenever she must choose between expressing her credo (by writing yet more words) or living up to it (by crafting a good novel), she opts for the former.I meant it when I said it began promisingly enough. There's a tantalising mystery (which is later dragged out long past the point where even the dullest reader has guessed it all and wishes to move on), a dark, detailed, fantastic vision of a decaying society, characters that look as though they might be worth following, and Rand does a good enough job of treating the things she loves - furnaces, girders, railways, engines - as elements of romance. But the worthwhile elements dissolve into nothing until nothing is left but the endlessly repeating rhetoric.Oh, and the love scenes. They're ... I was about to say Victorian, because of the way Rand's lovers spend pages on end doing nothing but \\"being in love\\" and striking attitudes at one another. (Rand disguises her starchiness by throwing in the occasional graphic half-rape, but fools no-one.) But this would be unfair to Victorians. Shortly before reading \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" I'd re-read George Gissing's \\"New Grub Street\\", and I was surprised by how plausible the talks between lovers were, how the professions of love vary from one another and how unafraid the author is to come to the point. Gissing's book was written 70 years before Rand's. The truth is that perceptive writers have NEVER written love scenes as stodgy as Rand's. They can scarcely be read, even for curiosity's sake.Perhaps my comments will strike you as beside the point: many people, after all, consider Rand's book less valuable as a work of fiction than as a work of philosophy. They're wrong. Another respect in which Gissing scores over Rand is in his ability to express opposing points of view - Rand merely knows how to gather all the viewpoints she disagrees with and the traits she considers vices together, so that no character may have one without also having all the rest. Nobody is in favour of income tax without also denying elementary principles of logic, doubting the existence of an external world, and having a whining voice, shifty eyes and an ugly face to boot. And the wonder is that Rand is, by her lights, more or less honest. She thinks that all the details of her political and moral philosophy really DO follow, as a matter of logic, from such banal and uncontroversial trivialities as \\"everything is identical to itself\\".My star rating is subjective. I wouldn't have guessed this from the opening chapters, but the book really is unbelievably bad ... and yet this in itself is a reason to read it, just as it's a reason to read Lewis Carroll's \\"Sylvie and Bruno\\". By all means read this book, and \\"Sylvie and Bruno\\" as well. They're ... ahem ... unique."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book was the longest manuscript I've ever read. Which is a good thing and a bad thing. Ayn Rand builds an unbelievable landscape with countless characters, which weave a narrative unlike any before or after. The length is necessary to give the full effect of the ending. Capitalism as perfection and the world as subject to the almighty dollar. Cynicism and idealism in one tightly story that will take your mind on a journey that it will never forget."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This is by far, my most beloved piece of literature around. However, the Audio CD version of it is absolutely horrible. I actually bought this version to share it with my friends who don't seem to have the time and patience to trudge through Rand's wordiness. My only recommendation is to pick up the book and read it. You will not be disappointed.The problem with the Audio CD version of this thing is that if you turn off your CD player before the disk is over, you have to &quot;seek&quot; within the CD to find where you were last. There is one track per CD. There is no logical pause between chapters. The narrator thinks he needs to put on some goofy Spanish accent when speaking as D'Anconia.Maybe some day the publishers of Audio versions of books will get it right and produce a product worth buying. Until that day, keep buying the paper, ink, &amp; glue versions and happy reading, my friends."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Liberals/Socialists/Communists/Marxists/Greens...do NOT buy this book. You will be shocked; You will be frightened; The truth can be a scary thing to face when you aren't prepared for it. Be warned...Your ideas WILL be confronted. Your philosophy WILL be challenged. It will be disected piece by piece, and eventually obliterated by Rand in this magnificent novel!Now, for everyone else...For every open minded, level headed, patriotic, hard-working American...Do yourself a favor. Clear your schedule next weekend, take the time, and bury yourself in this masterpiece.Words can't describe the brilliance you will find in Atlas Shrugged. Unfortunately, many people in this country are all too willing to give up their personal freedoms out of a sense of guilt, and shame, for what they've achieved in life. Too many people are willing to sacrifice their time, their money, their energy, their freedom, and ultimately themselves, to the guilt-peddling predators in Washington...people who have made success a dirty word and dependency a virtue. These so-called \\"progressives\\" have taken our country down a very dangerous path. Ayn Rand exposes their agenda with incredible accuracy...She shows the philosophy of the left for what it really is...and for this, she is hated and despised worldwide. The truth will hurt many well-intentioned people on the left, people who follow their heart and not their brain...those who really don't know the ultimate intentions of their leaders. I'm sorry friends, but the pain is necessary. Some will reject the truth. They may try to ignore it, or brush it off...but they WILL learn it. Nearly every one of Rand's predictions from Atlas Shrugged has come true, and we can only hope someone turns things around before it's too late. This book will make you reconsider everything...and it's not an exaggeration to say it will change your outlook on life forever. A definite must read."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I am not going to bore you with details of the book. Many others have done so already. It is obvious, even to this so-called liberal, that Ayn Rand was a genius. Atlas Shrugged is a literary masterpiece. Just be sure to notice when you are being manipulated. I would fear a world in which the &quot;looters&quot; gained control. I would also fear a world controlled by Francisco, Dagny and Henry Rearden.

Anyway forewarned is forearmed. And I'm not just writing this in responce to the minority negative reviews; the &quot;positive&quot; ones contain thier share of nonsence too -unfortunatly.

No doubt a fair percentage of them watch the daytime soaps that run for 20+ years... Quantity doesn't mean quality. Another review stated that Rand kept going until she &quot;ran out of ideas.&quot; NOT TRUE. A book should be as long as it needs to be without meandering. Lord of the Ring was three books (4 if you count The Hobbit) but every page meant something, served a purpose, moved the story forward. AS treads water. Was Rand paid by the page? Or by the word? Where ten words could suffice, Rand uses two hundred and fifty. I have just enough interest in these characters to keep me reading the book, but I don't need page-long descriptions of everyone's hair, breeches, chin, face, skirt, expression, cleavage, skin color, sweat, shoes, etc. NO ONE CARES. Perhaps Rand alone isn't to blame. We keep buying her books. And who the heck is the editor?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"rand's first book, the fountainhead, converted me in an instant - it finally gave real world examples of believing in a purpose in life. therefore, i waited for the right opportunity (long trip overseas) to read atlas shrugged. after getting halfway through it, i am reluctantly putting it down because i can't stand the negativity anymore. a person can subscribe to rand's philosophy of Objectivism without having hatred or scorn for everyone and everything around you, but you wouldn't know it if you read this novel. the characters waste too much energy complaining and dropping out of the \\"unfair\\" society. what a bunch of whiny, wimpy babies! it's life - it's not gonna be fair! i have much more admiration for people that overcome without having to put down others to do it. now i have to wonder, was fountainhead the same and i'm different...or was fountainhead different?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"An Open Letter to the Pod-People,I wonder what Ayn Rand would have to say about the repeated failure of US and other 'first world' countries to adequately compensate the first line of defence against ignorance and stupidity? I'm talking about teachers here, people. Oh, sorry, according to Rand we're all just plebs and employees of the moribund state, aren't we? Cannon fodder for the titans of her novels? The latter of which I suppose every 5 star reviewer of this book is?I read this book, and as an educator I am intellectually and morally offended. Many of my beliefs for a safer and better world were stripped down to overly simplistic black and white arguements. But that's a moral stand-point, and I don't want to be like Rand and try to mask my own personal beliefs as researched, tried, and proven philosophy.Maybe if more money was spent on compensating educators and better funding for public school systems, we would have many more people ready utter drivel such as 'Atlas Shrugged' with a critical eye.I want the- time- money- effortand mental anguish I wasted on this drivel refunded to me immediately. Surely a titan could accomplish that for a humble school teacher?The only good thing to come out of this book? I now understand all the 'Simpsons' and 'Futurama' references to Rand.Oh, and anyone who saw Dagny as a positive female role model is living proof that our collective first world education systems have failed. Why don't you get yourselved knocked up and married to a billionaire recluse already? Oh, sorry, I forgot that's why our mothers burned their corsets."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Does Objectivism work in practice? There is one way to find out. When one looks at Ayn Rand's own life (there are several biographies) to see how the objectivist-in-chief conducted herself, it is just stomach-turning and doesn't really inspire the wide-eyed admiration her heroes ellicit among some readers. Her life was in the end a failure and a dead end which is what the life of anyone who buys into this philosophy ends up being. You will find out for example that the people around you are not interested in knowing the virtue of your selfishness.I have to say though, she does a remarkably good job making us feel ok about our prejudices, if that's what you're looking for. This comes out for example when she treats other countries and people as barbaric, showing herself to be shockingly ignorant when it comes to the factors that made the United States the great country that it is. Hint: it isn't just the Constitution."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"She has an interesting, though not really original, philosophy but her arguments are very blunt, long-winded and repetitive. Her characters, antagonist especially, were caricatures who seemed so unlike actual people. Within a few chapters I realized she had just taken Soviet style propaganda and turned it up-side down. Seems she decided that communism is pure evil so whatever is the opposite must be pure good.I had to skip the second half John Galt's 59 page speech. It was like she was trying to ram it into my brain. It was so insistent and repetitive.Even as a capitalist and an individualist Atlas seemed like an extremist vision, blind to the imperfections of capitalism and glorifying it with religious devotion."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"though rand did not &quot;invent&quot; the objectivist philosophy, she certainly popularised it -- and did a remarkable job doing so.

John Galt is the eternal 'I' within you. He is the spirit of enterprise, the spirit of life, the light of the day &amp; the soul of exaltation. This book allows you to find your 'I' within you. It brings you a story of men and women (very real ones unlike the Howard Roark of Ayn Rand's Fountainhead who an entire generation believed too idealistic to exist - these men and women do and have weaker and darker sides too) who dared to follow the most righteous path that the freedom within them dictated, even when the entire world required them to live otherwise. This is a story of the handful of achievers of this world who decide to stop living their lives for the benefit of others who exist without adding any value to this world. They agree to continue creating value, but to disallow any of it to the undeserving, completely. The story is of the philosophy of what ought to be and the creation of that world, even if only in fiction. The book has for ages remained a guidepost to the best of mankind.

Man is capable of great progress if we are free to produce, keep what we produce and benefit from what we produce.

Among its greatest errors are the one dimensionality of the characters. They are either good, or bad. There are no shades of gray. It is also filled with redundancy. There is no better example than John Gault's speech. The love story is clumsily handled. The writing is often mundane.The ideas, however, are so important that they would overcome five times that many weaknesses. The book is an unbelievably vivid illustration of the principals that make capitalism the premier system of government that man has ever devised. The threats to that system are illustrated brilliantly by showing how the results of well intentioned actions backfire."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I have read this book 4 times now, and I know I will read it again many times.

I fell in love with it since. I am surprised by the ferocity with which certain reviewers have bashed this novel and those of us who enjoyed it, insulting our intelligence and claiming that we enjoy the novel because it is on par with &quot;soap operas and daytime dramas.&quot; Also, the criticism of Ayn's lack of experience in the &quot;real world&quot; is equally vicious.Well, fools, did you know that Alan Greenspan - yes, that Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve - is an adherent of Objectivism? That he had even contributed to some of Ayn's works? Probably not. It is difficult to know those kinds of things when one is using the Argument from Intimidation (to use Rand's term)Look, I will readily admit Objectivism does not allow room for many things considered &quot;irrational&quot; yet proven to exist. But if you want to read the second most influential novel EVER, and are not the kind of person portrayed in the negative in this novel, read Atlas Shrugged.

Atlas Shrugged is best read with pen, paper, time, and the courage to analyze your own beliefs and motivations."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"&quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is one of the very few books of fiction that are indispensable to understanding the modern world. Although published in the 1950's, it has the unmistakable stamp of the Great Depression thruout.The story, involving Dagny Taggert (railroad heiress), her childhood friend &amp; lover Sebastian De Anconio (copper-mine heir), Dagny's business partner &amp; lover Henry Reardon (industrialist) &amp; the various movers &amp; shakers of their fictional world, exists primarily to illustrate the tenets of Rand's philosophy Objectivism. This philosophy, while superficially attractive &amp; logical, has thru the years proven it's basic unworkableness. Traces of it still linger however, especially in the financial platform of the Republican party.The reader of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; will often be surprised at Rand's ability to predict future events. The most remarkable of these is the persecution of Henry Reardon &amp; the theft of Reardon Metal by the government. Can anyone say Bill Gates/Microsoft?Unfortunately, by the criteria of a cohesive story-line &amp; believable characters, &quot;Atlaas Shrugged&quot; is a failure. Most of the protagonists are caricatures, written to illustrate facets of an idea rather than well-rounded individuals. The most glaring failures of characterisation occur in the cases of James Taggert (Dagny's weak &amp; nasty brother) who snivvles, whines &amp; squirms without cease for over 600 pages, &amp; the hero John Galt who is so brilliant, upstanding, square-jawed &amp; generally Gary Cooperish that he becomes a relentless bore. He even gives a speech on national radio at one point that lasts over 50 pages in my edition! (Boring!!)Yet with all it's faults, &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; is a must-read for any modern individual who wants to understand the &quot;big picture&quot; of politics.

It would be nice to think that everyone has the same chance, ability, etc and that those who hone and use their ability deserve to reap any and all benefits with no obligations to the rest of society,because anyone could succeed as long as they work hard and think hard. However in order for this to work, the rest of society would need all the same advantages all of the time. So this doesn't work. So what are you to do?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Altas Shrugged is a phenomenal novel. Although it is a long 1000 pages, it is well worth your time to read. This book is highly important, especially in today's world. It stresses how America is great because of capitalism. Futhermore, it goes to show how communism is the greatest threat to the American way of life.\\"So you think that money is the root of all evil?\\" said Francisco d'Anconia. \\"Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?Anyone who says that money is evil and that capitalism is bad is either one or both of two things: a hypocrite, or a communist who wishes the downfall of America.Atlas Shrugged should be required reading for all."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"This book screams out for an editor, an aggressive one at that. But alas, because of Rand's cult status she no doubt was able to ride roughshod over any attempts to rein in her voluble style.The book remains a classic, and despite it prodigious length should be read to understand Ayn Rand's philosophic perspective. Her characters suffer from lack of believability as does her story. Her treatment of evil is ham-fisted with her characters nearly caricatures who evolve into straw men easily knocked down by the equally caricature like heroes. Her philosophical perspective screams from every single page and is so heavy handed as to render the reader nearly senseless. Personally, I think she would have been even more influential had she crafted her tale with characters a little less caricature like.BUT, and this is a big but, hers is a worthy philosophical viewpoint that should at least partially inform every conservative or libertarian mindset. One should be very careful however not to be swept away by Rand but rather to carefully and rationally incorporate her ideas into an overall pursuit of truth.Rand rejects religion. I do not think that one needs to reject religion to appreciate the value of Rand's perspective for at the end of the day many of her ideas would create a more humane rational world fully compatible with a religious perspective. I am a paleo-conservative of the Reagan school who likes Rand a great deal but feel that religion and Western traditions are an essential part of a truthful perspective that informs my own viewpoints.My suggestion would be to read Rand with the same grain of salt that you would read any author. Maintain your skepticism. Do not surrender your mind to Rand but rather allow her to test and possibly shape your ideas."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Do you the reader consider yourself too easily confused and manipulated to judge an idea for yourself? Do you need someone to give your morality to you? Do you need the approval or input of someone else, anyone who sounds like they've made up their mind, in order to make up you own? If so then stay as far away from Atlas Shrugged as you can.I wish I didn't have to give the book a rating: that would be the harshest thing I could do to someone like I just described, making them resort to a permanent evasion of the ideas set forth in Atlas, a punishment they would give themself and richly deserve.I would like for once, just once, to read a negative review of Atlas that gives a clear, focused, well-reasoned, POLITE explanation of the reviewer's objections. I KNOW there are reasonable &quot;objections&quot; to aspects of the book (valid though they are they can't change it's earning of five stars): I've heard them made (ex.-- the characters have virtually no personal idiosyncrasies, but are rather highly focused portrayals of certain philosophical standpoints, and as a result are unconvincing portrayals of &quot;real&quot; people. This is true, and yet doesn't detract from the reality of the ideas and conditions they stand for, and to see Rand make the connections between these is fascinating proof of the power of inductive reasoning). If such a request is characteristic of a member of a dogmatic &quot;cult&quot;, then I am guilty as charged.All you need to destroy Objectivism once and for all is a reasonable argument against it. To find a good example of a single outspoken thinker that brought a ruinous case against an entire philosophy, I suggest you investigate Ayn Rand.These reviews rely on the honor system, meaning those who have not read a book aren't entitled to air their opinion of it (whether they develop a premature opinion of it or not rests entirely on their own conscience). By reading many of these reviews it is clear that this system has been abused by many: a true Objectivist would not do this.

Just substitute company names where obvious (e.g. Rearden Metal = Microsoft, Orren Boyle = Sun Microsystems, etc.) Ayn Rand had a special ability to create caricatures of people that we both hate and admire. These characters allowed me to finally articulate what I admire and what I don't. It's especially important to read this book realizing what Rand had lived through (i.e. the Bolshevik Revolution).

Atlas Shrugged is a masterpiece in its truest sense that will captivate the reader from the first page on.Atlas Shrugged is about the industrial giants in our country, the movers and shakers, going on strike and taking their ideas, work ethic, and abilities underground and away from society. In fact, the title of the book was going to be \\"The Strike\\" until Ayn's husband Frank O'Connor suggested \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" to her. This book examines what would happen should these individuals disappear, and explores reasons why they should want to leave. Rand explains that with so many \\"looters\\" trying to get their hands on their \\"earned\\" money (through taxes, gov't regulations, nationalizing industries, welfare, etc.), they are the ones that are the real victims; not the poor. Without these leaders holding the world on their shoulders, we would have very little, therefore, we benefit from their ingenuity and leadership. Before I read this book, my political ideas were slowly drifting towards the left. I would have said that the scenarios she presents were overly simplistic and exaggerated before I actually read her very compelling arguments strung throughout the entire book. She portrays several heroic figures in the book that are forced to fight the obstacles that our society and people put in their way; when all they ever wanted was to produce and earn an honest living, free of interference (I am aware that not all industrialists are that ethical in real life, but most are this way). Our society expects and relies on their virtue and work ethic to stay put, regardless of our society's demands and impediments. But what would happen if they finally say \\"enough is enough!\\"? Then what?One of the best elements of the book was Rand's ability to develop her many characters, both good and bad. Ayn Rand has an astonishing grasp of the English language and uses it in such a way as to persuade and to provoke thought. Throughout the book, I literally felt the range of emotions that Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden experienced. I was able to feel the fervor they felt to wake the people up around them, the passion they felt for each other, and the rage and frustration they felt as their companies collapsed around them. I was also amazed at how many times the \\"bad guys\\" would make statements that I myself would have made (\\"it's not their fault that...\\" or \\"...we should have a right to...\\" or \\"...everyone deserves a chance to...\\"), only to have those statements completely torn apart by one of Rand's \\"good guys\\" replies. She certainly has made me reconsider many statements that I have made in the past.Throughout the book, the four main protagonists consistently provide some of the most insightful soliloquies. The two that stand out the most to me are the 5 page speech on money given by Francisco d'Anconia (page 410-415 in the 35th anniversary edition) and of course the John Galt speech on the state of the world (pages 1,009-1,069). The money speech debunks the idea that \\"money is the root of all evil\\" and really opened my eyes to a new way to think about money: earned vs. unearned and the fact that it is a \\"product\\" of blood, sweat, and tears... and virtue. The John Galt speech, though long winded at times, clarifies almost all of Rand's ideas and expresses almost all of her \\"Objectivism\\" philosophy on how life and the world should be. She provides simply amazing and persuasive arguments to support her views on altruism, sacrifice, love, self esteem, religion, communism, etc, etc, etc.In response to many of the other reviews that I have read regarding this book, I wanted to make the following points:1. I've read that Atlas Shrugged (and most of Rand's writings) inspires and appeals mainly to the youth by capitalizing on their boundless energy, idealism, and navet&eacute;'s of the \\"real world\\". However, I am 31 years old (some may still consider this young) and have worked in the \\"real world\\" for over 8 years now, and no other book has ever inspired me to achieve my full potential as much as this book has. No other book has given me as much courage to struggle against the \\"doubters\\" we all have in our life, to combat the negative theologies that we have been raised with, and resist the constant pressure to settle for mediocrity, comfort, and complacency. No other book has motivated me to pursue my deepest desires and to find real happiness, love, reason, truth, and a fulfilling existence.2. It has also been said of her recently, that some of the ideas expressed in the book are \\"outdated\\" and are somehow not relevant to today's society. This claim is ridiculous and myopic. We have several examples in the current day of the type of government control and aggression that she demonstrates in this book. These include Venezuela and most of South America, countries throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and even Russia has recently started centralizing many of its control back to the government and inching further and further away from capitalist and democratic ideals. Even in our own country we see a steady progression towards socialist ideas from the 1930's all the way to the current day (health care, retirement, public education, welfare, public housing, the patriot act, etc.). I am not saying these shouldn't be debated in our modern world or are necessarily a bad thing, but Rand's concern is that the more individual rights we surrender and the more we allow gov't to take control, the closer we come to the devastating scenario she puts forth in her book. And she should know something about this progression since she saw it in communist Russia as a child in the early 1900's, and lived through the communist movements of the mid 20th century around the globe. We need to learn from history so that we don't repeat it, not ignore it as if it could never happen again. With that ignorant attitude, we are destined to repeat it.But this book doesn't just include her philosophies on politics and economics. Atlas Shrugged also deals with love, sex (R rated I might add ;-) ), courage, psychology, sociology, philosophy, human relationships, mystery, religion, and every aspect of life imaginable. These are all intertwined throughout and give the reader a complete and clear definition of what her philosophical views are. She leaves no stone unturned. It should be noted that regardless if you agree with her ideas or not, it is simply mind-blowing to be able to read a book that has an entire rational philosophical system within it.With all this said, however, there are several criticisms that I will comment on that does take away from the book, but certainly not my 5 star rating. 1. The good and bad guys are obvious. There is no attempt at creating a middle ground for Rand. You either love the characters, or hate them. 2. She can be a bit long winded at times to drive her point home. I actually appreciate this about her writings, but many of you won't. My uncle put it best when he told me before I read this book, \\"If it is worth saying once, it is worth saying a thousand times.\\" 3. The ending was a bit anti-climatic. It almost seemed as though a different author wrote the last 80 pages. I'm not sure what happened there. 4. Many will point out that the scenarios and outcomes in this book are exaggerated. Although this may or may not be true, this again is part of her writing style that you either like or don't like. I tend to like the direct and bold manner in which she writes because I myself am a passionate and enthusiastic person, and as I read this book, I could feel the emotion and intensity that she put into every single word she wrote.Overall, this book is the most influential book I have read to date. It is bold, inspiring, intense, courageous, passionate, and life changing. For anyone out there that knows they are destined for something more than they are doing right now, for anyone out there that is passionate about life and the pursuit of real happiness, and for those out there that feel burdened by people and the mediocrity around them, I can't recommend this book enough to you. I know I have been changed forever for having read Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Who is John Galt? This seemingly rhetorical question is brought up throughout Ayn Rand's epic novel Atlas Shrugged and is at the root of its mysterious plot. Atlas Shrugged is centered on Ayn Rand's philosophy \\"Objectivism\\"; a philosophy that portrays man as a heroic being and insists that he live for no one but himself.Ayn Rand transports us to an early 1950s America where all of the \\"movers\\" (bankers, industrialists, inventors, est.) of the world are slowly disappearing, causing it to fall into ruin. Atlas Shrugged primarily focuses on the story of Dagny Taggart, a strong, intelligent woman who is desperately trying to save her great-grandfather's railroad, \\"Taggart Transcontinental\\", from ruin as her brother, the CEO of the company, and his politician friends undermine Dagny's efforts with their attempts to make the businesses world \\"fair\\". 'However, Atlas Shrugged sometimes shifts its focus to other characters, such as Hank Rearden, the owner of Rearden Steel and inventor of the highly efficient \\"Rearden Metal\\", Eddie Willers, Dagny's loyal assistant, and even Jim Taggart, one of the many \\"Looters\\" of the story, whose subconscious desire is to destroy all of the producers of the word is causing nothing but turmoil.Ayn Rand's writing style is one that will keep you captivated throughout the entire story. From emotions to physical landscape, Ayn Rand is a master of description and has the unique ability to paint an extremely detailed picture in the reader's mind. Another unique aspect about Atlas Shrugged is the tremendous amount of dialogue. In one section of the story, there are 30 pages of nothing but dialogue! However, this otherwise extreme amount of dialogue gives the story a certain flow to it, which makes it even more enjoyable.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, and isn't intimidated by a book that might seem \\"too long\\" (Atlas Shrugged is approximately 1040 pages) The reader won't even have to agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy to enjoy this truly ageless novel. The story of Atlas Shrugged has something that appeals to everyone, from the romance between various main characters to the mystery of John Galt. In fact, the story is so compelling that Atlas Shrugged is going to be made into a movie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480239/). Hopefully, it will be just as wonderful as the book it's based on."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"It's essential to remember that Ayn Rand wrote in a highly stylized manner, more evocative of Hugo and Dostoyevsky than anything written in the 20th Century. This seems to be a major sore spot for many of the reviewers below who characterize her plot as contrived, her characters and unidimensional, and her dialogue as unrealistic.In fact, her plot is far better and more original than any of the \\"plot-driven\\" pot boilers of today. As for her characters, they are romantic idealizations of human beings, not a literal rehashing of specific people. Again, this is stylistic choice with many precedents among the great works of literature. It is, however, unprecedented to do it on such a scale as this. We see concretizations, for example, of many philosophical schools present in each of the novel's antagonists. As a didactic device, this is incredibly useful - yet, it's important to remember that this is a work of art, not a teaching tool. As such, they cannot merely be mouth-pieces for for a philosophy as they would be in, say, a Medieval morality play. They must be rounded out, given human attributes. Rand does this successfully. As a voracious reader, I know whereof I speak. Her characters are as real, and more so, as any intellectual you're likely to find in literature. Remember, Ayn Rand's passion was philosophy as well as literature. That her novels and characters are therefore philosophical intellectuals by nature should surprise no one.Re the dialogue, this too is much better than many of her detractors claim. Again, it is highly stylized, intellectual, and sometimes heavy. Yet it is artfully crafted and easily digestible.Again, as a long-time fan of Atlas Shrugged and a reader of countless other novels - from the classics to today's modern trash - Ayn Rand is, in the respects listed above, no worse than any and better than most.It's clear from many of the reviews that rather than write a review of the novel, they'd prefer to share the banal stories of how they once flirted with Objectivism, and later rejected it. Ignore them. Objectivists do not, as one reviewer stated, \\"wish death on 90% of the world's population.\\" Quite the contrary. Nor do we light cigars with twenties as we steamroll in our limousines over orphans and widows.Whether Atlas Shrugged changes your life or not is beside the point. Bottom line: it's a good read for any fan of literature - from the high school student on up."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" boasts an intriguing plot, but suffers from a saturation of Rand's philosophy: Objectivism is first introduced subtly, gracefully into the narrative, then pounded relentlessly throughout the second and third chapters. The metaphors and symbolisms in the book are striking, but like the characters, are used for the single purpose of driving home the immorality of a society that demands self-sacrifice. Rand's writing would have benefited enormously from good editing; the book likely could have been trimmed down a few hundred pages without losing its impact.All in all, it's a good read, but read it again and you'll wish you hadn't: the philosophy, which seems novel and impregnable at first glance, becomes the main character of the novel, pushing back all the elements that should have made this a work of fiction. Still, if you want to see a future ravaged not by a nuclear holocaust, but by human incompetence and irresponsibility, if you want to see an uncanny breed of heroes, then by all means, read the book. But you've been warned."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"The content is well known and I cannot add much to the discussion, other than to say it is thought-provoking and very applicable to our time. Amazing for a book more than 50 years old.The quality control on my copy of this particular edition was poor. Approximately 50 pages toward the beginning of the book were out of register, with the text skewed on the page, to the extent that the ends/beginnings of the lines on whole pages were truncated by as many as 5 characters. Those same pages were also not properly bound and came loose as soon as the book was opened. That said, once I got past that part of the book it was fine and I've enjoyed reading it. I probably would have bought a Kindle if this book were available in that format."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is one of the best books I've read in a long time. The times Ayn Rand speaks of forebode our times now. Today's government is running big business and forcing them to bow to lesser men, so it was in soviet Russia, from where Ayn Rand fled. This is a fascinating book, well written, on 50 cd's in audio. My husband and I are reading it at the same time.Everyone who sees what is happening in this era of government spending and fear-mongering should read this book, roll up their sleeves and stop Congress from forcing this final chapter upon us."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas Shrugged is the best piece of literature I've ever read. It is a masterpiece, a monument to achievement, a symphony to the triumph of the human spirit. It's the greatest book I've ever read.Only I haven't finished it.You see, the copy I received from Amazon.com is missing the last 50 pages. They are literally not there. Page 1141 is attached the back cover, with no other pages behind it to bring me to page 1192.If you're familiar with The Fountainhead, there's a moment when Roark has a few buildings in construction that would essentially solidify his status as an amazing architect: the most important of which being the Stoddard Temple. However, following the trial concerning the controversial building, Roark's other projects remain untouched, becoming skeletons of what could be. He's been cut off from his achievement by the incompetent masses.Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, like its predecessor The Fountainhead, denounces such incompetence. Several problems that plague the Earth--in the book and in real life--stem from people who refuse to use their rational minds. It is disgustingly ironic, then, that my copy of such a book is a defective product of incompetent workers. A person of reason wrote the book, men of reason created the printing presses, and men of non-existence defaced this wonderful work of art. Like Howard Roark, I have been cut off from my achievement--from my joy--by the incompetence of men who refuse to believe that A is A. This is not only extremely frustrating and outrageous, but it completely reinforces Rand's message and the importance of this novel. It stresses the importance of men of mind and the state of non-existence and indifference that plagues our world.Like Roark eventually finishes his buildings, I will complete this book. I will have to do so by catering to incompetents like Henry Rearden trying to obtain illegal amounts of copper, but it will be done, and I will finish it. I will because it is the single most important piece of literature I have ever read. Because it is a masterpiece. Because A is A."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"If you are a philosophy buff, regardless of your feelings about Rand's views, you need to read this book.

It details a progression of events that accompany a society that forcibly takes from the most productive members to provide for those that are less productive. While it is noble and compassionate to help those less fortunate, I think that it is up to each individual and family to decide how much they can help, not the government. It sure sounds familiar to what has been happening in America over the past 35 years."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"A sprawling novel of nearly 1200 pages, this book was first published in 1957 by the Russian immigrant, Ayn Rand, writing in English, a second language she had to learn. It has continued to be read, explained, interpreted, memorialized, and frequently reprinted over the last 50 years for its unapologetic defense of capitalism and its often overembellished, overdramatized lectures about Ms. Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. While very stilted and repetitive in the frequent monologues of its main characters, its profuse examples and unflinching conviction embolden it to worship the accumulation of wealth through the pursuit of capitalist ideals.The book is divided into three sections, each with a concise, inarguable statement of logic as its title. Part I, \\"Non-Contradiction\\", shows a world in turmoil in which the opposing forces of selfishness and selflessness are colliding. In Part II, \\"Either-Or\\", she explains why the profiteers - the \\"movers\\" of the world, as she calls them - are withdrawing their knowledge and refusing to participate in the system that the rule-makers - the \\"looters\\" of the world, as she calls them - have created. In Part III, \\"A Is A\\", Ms. Rand unveils her Utopian ideals, buffered with an uninterrupted speech of 43 pages by John Galt, to show why Atlas has shrugged only to once again take a strong grip on the world which he then holds in balance.The beauty of this book is in the clarity of its ideals and the certainty of its characters as they commit themselves to the necessity of living by Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy. However, when reading it, you must also be prepared to skim parts because the same messages are continuously pounded into your head like a throbbing headache - greed is good, need is bad; self-reliance is good, self-dependence is bad; individualism will triumph, collectivism will fail.Ms. Rand is certainly guilty of an excessive amount of simplification as she draws distinctions between ideas as large and somewhat nebulous as those of capitalism and socialism and, at her most insistent, seems oblivious to the essential role of government in providing roads, bridges, highways, courts, prisons, schools, libraries, parks, water and sewage systems, street lights, airports, harbors, tunnels, as well as the military, police, fire, postal, and hospital workers. Surely without that core of essential products and services provided by a collectivist, profitless government there could be no economic system of any kind, let alone the one she blesses so reverently. It also seems overly presumptive, I believe, to ignore the government created and enforced role of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and property ownership that play such an important role in a system of profiteering. Surely the abolition of these would topple a system of capitalism as quickly as it would take mobsters and racketeers to take over the role of adjudicating justice.Nonetheless, this is an important book for anyone trying to grasp the big issues which confront our world economically. But, like an excellent wine, if you drink it too fast, you will lose some of its finer points, and if you drink too much, you will be numbed by its inebriating qualities. While Atlas Shrugged is certainly a book to be savored, it is also one not to be overimbibed."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"By far one of the best books I have ever read. Whether or not you agree with Rand's philosophy, this book will make you think."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"In reading a good half of the reviews, people either tell you to read it or not read it. Many people spent paragraphs telling you what you should think of it and how you should not be bothered to read such trip and low brow philosophy(if it ever was) and trash in an overwhelming, unconquerable, epic 1070 pages, how her characters were paper and transparent and unrealistically heroic, how wrong she was, how the real world is not, cannot and should not be this way. The Looters of her novel.The people who side with Ayn Rand had only a paragraph or two and at most had a description on how it benifitted their life and that one should read it for their own analysis. That it is knowledge to be learned or to bolster freedom loving peoples ideals. The Capitalists of her novel.In fact you are handed in these reviews, a real life example and the essance of what she was putting on display in this novel. The simple fact that there are people who will tell you what to think and do and that there are people who tell you what they think and leave you to do what you will with that knowledge and that is your responsibility.In Atlas Shruggs, Ayn Rand asks the question of what will happen if all the people who DO things in a country go on strike when a goverment attempts redistribution of wealth, be it gold, property or ideas. What if they said no and refused to create wealth with ideas, ability and capital, for no goverment has ever created wealth but instead takes it and doles it out to those who do no such thing. The world would stop. This is in opposition to the leftists asking what would all you industrialists do if your workers went on strike. They would simply shrugg and make robots to do the work instead.Ayn Rand's Utopian system is simple.....there is no system, as in true capitalism. She understands the founders of this country far more then it's born citizenry I think. She champions the ideas that its the superiority of the individual that makes people wealthy and that one's self is the only one who can make one's self happy and successful. She shines a bright spotlight on Collectivism and its evils of forced charity which is and eternally stands as an oxymoron. She marvalously cuts down Political correctness and artificial equality.I liked the novel immensly and highly reccomend it. I find the heros (thats what they are) to be totally realistic, encouraging and refreshing and not unlike myself. Infact I found them to be very much like myself. I also found her antagonsits to be equally realistic especially given todays changes that are afoot in this country.In the end I find excerps from her novel word for word in todays news and political arena. Scary stuff considering how long ago she wrote this and where she was born.I am John Galt!"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I wish everyone would read this book. This viewpoint is rarely heard and is hampered by the authors delivery. Atlas shrugged in it's unabridged version is the epitome of verbose. Ayn Rand seems to believe that getting the point across is as hammering a nail, and hammering, and hammering until finally the entire hammers head goes through the wall. There are a couple of times where she can't stop hammering and seems to go mad making the same point. Many readers must get tired of reading pages and pages that would have been a good paragraph.Atlas Shrugged has a wonderful and important message but who will shrug first Atlas or the reader?"},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Maybe it just me, but this has been a difficult story to get into...I know I really should finish reading it, but it really lacks something to maintain interest. Maybe I just have a short attention span or something. There are certainly parallels to current events."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I didn't know that this book was more than 40 years old. Most of the books that I have bought on Amazon are used but in good condition. The pages are yellow with age. I guess I didn't see the small print if there was any. I will be more careful next time."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Atlas was the god who held the world on his shoulders; and when he had had enough-he shrugged.The first thing you need to know about Ayn Rand is that she didn't write anything without a good reason. Another thing you need to know is that this book isn't really a novel, or you could say it's much more than a novel. Atlas Shrugged is a big book by any standard. It's all about how very important ideas play out in the real world, the single most important of which is REASON. Unless society and the individuals who make it up, believe in, and live by reason, they will come to a bad end. Mankind will be \\"doomed\\" so to speak. In Atlas, the Great Day of Reckoning approaches-just like in the Bible. Society, corrupted by the stagnant ideas and beliefs of the mainstream, is collapsing under the weight of its own defects and inadequacies. John Galt and his secret band of conspirators hasten the day. They represent America's \\"men and women of ability.\\" The conspirators go on strike, but nobody except they know it; and the world grinds slowly to a halt.Rand believes passionately that ideas move the world and this book more than all her other works, reifies that idea. Beside reason, such concepts as independence, liberty, honesty, integrity, perseverance, and hard work are always exemplified by her heroes, as is their antitheses dramatized in her villains. Running throughout the whole (indeed throughout all of her works) is the theme: mankind's incalculable debt to men and women of creative genius; and as a corollary, what happens to the rest of us when these benefactors of humanity are removed, or remove themselves, from the picture?The question of course is: is she right? I've had considerable time to ponder that question. What's my conclusion? For the most part she is. But think of any great work or thing in the world; any book, any religion, any nation, any great leader or thinker. There are always flaws. Since we can all think for ourselves-when we have the courage-we can all decide what to accept and what to reject. All I can say about this book is that it is no exception. Still, it is one of the great achievements of our time. Anyone who is interested in the Big Questions (the great ideas, the meaning of life, etc) should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"ayn rand beseeches us to acknolowedge our duty to engage the modern material svadharma (not in these words). 'atlas shrugged' illustrates the dangers of rampant apathy, or wantonly misplaced idealism (on the part of the masses) in the midst of catastrophic collective illusion.she conveys the very nature of compassion; and it's not flowers for all (not yet!). the protagonists are modern arjunas. in today's world, maybe it's not possible without revolutionary change -- the essence is too diluted. this is a new scenario, that goes further by proposing a plausible contemporary social modus operandi.

Paul Ryan's obsession with her work. In fact, over the past few years, through the rise of the tea party movement, we have heard a lot of adulation for Rand, who has become an inspiration to and ideal of sorts for the conservatives in our country.Rand was an outspoken critic of government intervention and religion who believed solely in the power of the dollar. In fact, when she died, she had a 6-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign by her casket.She was not the only influential woman writer in the 20th century. In fact, there's another woman writer and risk-taker who was not only influential but also truly inspirational: Dorothy Day.Even though they lived at the same time, their views couldn't be more different. While Rand spoke of the power of capitalism and against any form of altruism, Day spent her life serving and fighting for the poor and the humble.This extraordinary woman, a prominent Catholic and current candidate for sainthood, espoused her religion's core teaching of pacifism, love for all and servitude to the poor. She strove to spread the word of the Catholic social doctrine -- of fighting for social justice and supporting workers.Just when Rand was writing \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" to push forward the value of individuals dedicated solely to themselves, Day founded The Catholic Worker, a paper devoted to publicizing Catholic social teaching -- of supporting workers and serving those in need without judgment or qualification.Day's support of unions, workers' rights and power for the people are long-held Catholic values. In fact, the Catholic Church played a prominent role in shaping America's labor movement.Just as Rand spent her life preaching the philosophy of objectivism, Day spent her life living and sharing Catholic social teachings. From the day she founded The Catholic Worker in 1933 to the day she died in 1980, Day espoused justice for all, servitude to the poor, nonviolence, equality and pacifism.As it lives on today, The Catholic Worker continues Day's work sharing the belief that everyone has the right to what is required to live a full and decent life, such as employment, health care and education. Her paper teaches us that workers have a right to earn a living wage in safe working conditions and form unions to protect themselves.Dorothy Day was proposed for sainthood in 1983 and made a \\"Servant of God\\" (the first stage of canonization) by Pope John Paul II in 2000. She was proposed for sainthood because she dedicated her life to the poor, to the workers and to justice everywhere.On Day's 75th birthday, the Jesuit magazine America devoted a special issue to her, singling her out as the individual who best exemplified \\"the aspiration and action of the American Catholic community during the past forty years.\\"While conservatives may hold up Ayn Rand as their leader -- many without even having read any of her books (especially those who may not know how strongly she spoke out against religion) -- the rest of us should take a look at some of the writings of Dorothy Day, which are still very relevant today.\\""},{"Title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I like this book very much you should buy it with the money you earned from that cool job you got yo."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],M={key:0},C={key:1};function B(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=m("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(y,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(e(),w(c,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",C,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const W=d(L,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-f9cf6e58"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/61.md","filePath":"quotesmag/61.md"}'),E={name:"quotesmag/61.md"},j=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
