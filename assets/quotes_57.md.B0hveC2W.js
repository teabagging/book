True, I would enjoy some footnotes to connect Skinner's ideas from this book to the rest of his writing and I'm wondering what would happen if we \\"upgraded\\" this book to take place in the modern internet society and taking into account all new things cognitive sciences and emotional intelligence have brought us over the 50+ years since this book has been written.

Is this better living through operant conditioning?This fictional community is the brain-child of the famous (and imfamous) behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner. Skinner believed that all behavior can be controlled by modification and 'positive reinforcement.' Well, here it is. A Skinnerian utopia.The book itself has no real plot to speak of. The central characters,a group of 2 university professors, 2 twenty-somethings fresh from army service, and their two girlfriends that have been invited to take a tour of the Walden Two community. The book (narrated by one of the professors) is the fictional account of the tour which gets extraordinarily specific. The communes education, commerce, child-rearing, and governing practices are well-examined and this book, whether you agree with good ol' B.F. or not, will have you constantly thinking from new angles. If you're anything like me (frightening thought!) you might find yourself actually talking back to the book. What a rare experience!The four stars are for both the writing- Skinner does much better than most psychologists crossing over to fiction- and for the wealth of ideas which are sharp, challenging and scary. Although in the end, I disagree with just about every idea Skinner remonstrates, this is a book that I'm sure I will reread and ponder over quite often."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"This influential book created quite a stir when it was first published in 1948, so much so, that many people actually started forming intentional, egalitarian communes and existing ones embraced many of the ideas of social structure presented in \\"Walden Two\\". Further, Aldus Huxley, author of \\"Brave New World\\", was so impressed with the ideas presented in \\"Walden Two\\", that he incorporated and expanded on them in his last novel, \\"Island\\". And many people feel this was his best work. I concur.The book is not a monument to fine novel writing and was not intended to be, yet it is fascinating and eye-opening as a fictional dissertation on utopian social structure can be. Huxley's \\"Island\\", on the other hand was beautifully written and requires no awareness of the psychology of social construction going on at the same time- neither book does, really. They are both interesting and thought provoking.Skinner's basic premise was that with gentle behavioral modifications using positive re-enforcement and academics, coupled with leveling the social playing field with no class structure our hyper-competitive, private enterprise, we could then concentrate all of our energies on education and entertainment, thereby removing most all of the ills and stress that conventional society suffers from- sounds enticing, on paper anyway.B.F. Skinner was a famous research psychologist who had a life-time of noted insights into the human psyche and his constant experimentation with behavioral studies led him to map-out, in a fictional utopian setting, a demonstration of what the supposed benefits of behavioral modification would do for a large group of people. He was not trying to be a novelist, rather he was submitting to a broader audience than his peers, a theoretic utopian society that the general public could assess on their own and no doubt, Skinner was probably keen to see how the public would respond- further studies of human response to mechanisms- his favorite occupation.His very clinical approach to human behavioral studies was often criticized, but he was always quick to point out that he had no interest in debate on his methods. The following two paragraphs are borrowed from Skinner's bio seen at the Muskingum College, New Concord, Ohio website Skinner pages. Material was compiled by Christa Swenson, 1999.\\"Skinner was never highly influenced by critical reactions, he is not interested in the right or wrong because they are either effective or ineffective, and arguments of no avail. For that reason he is not interested in psychological theories, rational equations, or other verbal systems that are required to be proven right.\\"- whoa. And:[Following the principles of Bacon, Skinner rejects verbal authority, stating, \\"I have studied nature not books asking questions of the organism rather than those who have studied the organism.\\"... \\"Observation overemphasizes stimuli; experimentation includes the rest of the contingencies which generate repertoires\\" (Dews, 1970, p18).]It is interesting to note about his life that he is mainly remembered for such famous/infamous experiments as his \\"Skinner Box\\"- a replica of the famous Russian psychologist, Ivan Pavlov and his \\"Pavlov's Dog\\" positive response contraption. To say the least, he was highly impressed with Pavlov's work, but instead of dogs, he preferred rats and humans for study subjects and behavior reaction, not dog saliva studies (however interesting that might be).So I would imagine that if Skinner were alive today, he would get a kick out of the reviews here that are somewhat unflattering and he would have no problem brushing them off as he would also see fit to do with the flattering ones.His Walden Two book was influenced by the writing of Henry David Thoreau's \\"Walden\\" (Note the borrowed title) and many other similar writers. No wonder then, that he was keen to let that influence mellow his somewhat starchy, clinical outlook when he wrote it. And we are thankful for that- it made for a much more human and pleasing read.Understandably, it does not please many that his story characters had embraced such social quirks as seeing no benefit in saying \\"thank you\\" and many other social graces- this is Skinner's personality coming through: social graces are a waste time. Level-headed, nothing-to-hide, and non-competitive people supposedly don\`t need that nonsense.Did Skinner miss something in the demonstrated efficacy of social courtesy? No matter, he lets many of his characters have their conventional, \\"good\\" social habits- he has to, to show contrast.The communal setting the book describes is egalitarian, fair and desires no material gain other than normal sustenance. Labor needs are divvied-up at the start of each day and earn the communards \\"work credits\\" to ensure that they work a minimal amount for their keep. Over-work is discouraged and considered counter-productive, education and entertainment are much more important and with a large labor pool, daily chores can be completed quickly.New incoming members must agree to the communities social dictates: \\"The Walden Code\\" , a set of easy rules of conduct for harmony in the communal setting. Administrative members called \\"Planners\\" have a bit more leeway and can over-ride the rules when dealing with the outside world. All social positions are on a rotating basis including work, to facilitate an even distribution of duties so everyone can gain experience of the total spectrum of communal life.So what became of the communities that formed on Skinner's ideas? Many of them are still going and the most renown one modeled completely around Walden Two, \\"Twin Oaks Community\\", is still at it. Kathleen \\"Kat\\" Kinkade, one of the founding members, wrote a book about the \\"real\\" experimental commune, \\"A Walden Two Experiment\\"- Foreword by Skinner himself.This assessment of the project was written about two years into the project and then followed by another report, \\"Is It Utopia Yet?: An Insider's View of Twin Oaks Community In Its 26th Year\\". Kat Kinkade is now the longest standing member and although she left the community for some time and then returned, she has a substantial history and intimate view of the project. Her assessments are an open, frank and honest look at intentional, communal living with all of it's inherrant ups and downs and is a fascinating follow-up to Skinner's Walden Two."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two is a work of fiction that gives us an outline for a modern utopia. In the book, six people - two college professors, a former student and his friend from the army, and the girlfriends of the two young men - visited a commune out in the country. The commune had been created by an old school mate of one of the two professors. When Professor Burris received a visit from his former student, Rogers, and Rogers' friend Jamnik, about T. E. Frazier, who had set out to create a modern utopia, Burris discovered that his old friend Frazier had indeed succeeded at creating his utopia. But even more interesting was that when Burris sent a letter to Frazier, a return letter invited Burris and some friends to visit and see Frazier's utopia, Walden Two. Rogers and Jamnik were delighted to accompany him and brought their girlfriends along. Burris also brought along another professor, Castle, who was intrigued by the creation of a utopia, a feat he had believed impossible. Together, the six traveled into the countryside to find the utopia of which Frazier had boasted.The visitors found that the members of the utopia worked short days, on average four-hour work days, had a great appreciation for art and science, used a hybrid economic system combining Marxism and capitalism that worked for the benefit of all members, and enjoyed happiness all the time. Frazier had thought the entire utopia through, and did many things very differently than the rest of the United States of America, from the communal raising of children, to new systems of education, and even to new ways of raising farm animals. He even used new ways of carrying food from the food lines of the communal mess halls to nooks in the \\"Ladder,\\" a long stairway that doubled as a communal gathering place. Frazier had created an efficient utopia in a corrupt world. Though they see it before their eyes, some of them don't believe it, and they try to look for problems in the system. Professor Castle is always on Frazier's heels, trying to find contradictions in the system and failures to achieve true fairness and equality; he even accuses Frazier of being the despotic dictator of Walden Two. But Frazier is always ready for any attack with a defense, and even an attack of his own at times. From the \\"Ladder\\" to the \\"Walk\\", Frazier's Walden Two Utopia was truly something to be admired.And how had he managed it? He had used a science called \\"Behavioral Engineering\\". In this system, adults signed contracts to abide by the rules of Walden Two and reinforced one another's behavior through their common acceptance of these rules. Children were raised to absorb and live by the values of this modern utopia, including the values of sharing, working their fair share for the benefit of the whole community, and maintaining impartiality. The adults used positive reinforcement to encourage appropriate behavior by the children. It seemed like a viable system, but I think an all too well known cynical writer, George Orwell, would have a field day with how this might go wrong if even one person failed to absorb the communal values and found a way to use the system for his own personal gain.Despite how good this community sounds, we must remember that this is a work of fiction. Though creating a \\"Walden Two\\" type of community could be a good start towards forming a fair society, I am not convinced that this model could work in a large society. In the small community, where everyone knows each other and trusts each other, there is a sense of loyalty that keeps the members subscribing to the ideals of the fair society. In a large society, nobody knows everyone and therefore cannot trust everyone, and this undermines trust in the system itself.Walden Two is worth reading if you're trying to find a way to create a modern utopia. But, if you are going to read this book, I also suggest reading \\"The Case Against B. F. Skinner\\", by Noam Chomsky. The essay discusses why Skinner is wrong about the malleability of human nature, and why this society would fail to attract enough members to be viable. Walden Two and \\"The Case Against B.F. Skinner\\" are very \\"hard reads,\\" and take a lot of time to fully understand the points that are being made. Take a month or two so you can read it slowly and understand the concepts that are being presented. If you do not understand anything, that is okay. The ideas are pretty hard to understand. I recommend talking it over with a political science teacher. Still, despite the difficulty, this book is a great read for an intellectual mind, and the essay is as well."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"\\"Walden Two\\" is a bizarre utopian novel by the notorious behaviourist B.F. Skinner. The novel (first published in 1948) is quite seriously intended, but nevertheless comes across as an unintentional parody of social engineering. Had it been a work of considerable antiquity, I'm sure Leo Strauss and Alan Bloom would have assumed that it *is* a parody!As classical utopian novels, \\"Walden Two\\" has no real plot. Most of the \\"novel\\" is a description of an imaginary utopian community, named Walden Two after the forest where Thoreau wrote his famous work \\"Walden\\". The similarity between Thoreau and Skinner isn't very striking, however. Walden Two may be surrounded by farmland, but it's really a large public housing complex with about 1,000 inhabitants, and obviously based on high technology. It has plans to expand and eventually take over all of the United States. Thoreau, as far as I know, mostly wanted to be left alone!The main character of the story is Frazier, the founder of Walden Two, who guides six visitors (and the reader) through the community and explains its ideology. Another character is named Burris. Apparently this is supposed to be B.F. Skinner himself, although Frazier is probably Skinner's real alter ego. Yet another character is an unsympathetic, useless and abstract philosophy professor named Castle, who is Frazier's main protagonist and constantly questions both him and the utopian society. The four remaining characters are named Roger, Barbara, Mary and Steve.Walden Two turns out to be a benevolent dictatorship ruled by anonymous Planners and Managers. They are not elected but appoint their own successors. The law of the community is called the Code and can be changed only be the Planners and Managers. The members of the community are not allowed to discuss any changes of the Code amongst themselves. The meaning of the Code is explained at mass meetings. There are also a kind of Sunday sermons. Children are taken from their parents immediately at birth and given a collective upbringing and education, based on (bizarre) behavioural psychology and conditioning. There is no sense of history. In fact, study of history is discouraged. Not even Frazier, who founded the community, expects to be remembered. At death, people are cremated and quietly forgotten. The important thing is the collective and the plan. Everyone in Walden Two seems to live in an eternal now.All problems are solved by behavioural engineering. If anyone has problems with the Code, he is considered to be sick and sent to a psychologist. A group of medical doctors have complete control of nutrition, physical training and sanitation. Even the tea service is managed according to scientific principles! Despite these authoritarian features, everyone in Walden Two is happy and contended. They only work four hours per day, and spend the rest of their time playing music, watching theatre or tending the gardens.And that, of course, is the point.What struck me when reading \\"Walden Two\\" was Skinner's unabashed elitism. He has a kind of benevolent contempt for the common man. Anti-democratic arguments abound. Society must be rationally planned by a scientific elite steeped in behaviourism. Elections are unnecessary and \\"freedom\\" is just an illusion. The important thing is to make the common people feel happy. Of course, people have no idea how to accomplish this, and the task should therefore be left to experts. But since people will be happy-happy-happy, what grounds are there for complaints? Two of the characters, Mary and Steve, join the community almost immediately. They are real simpletons and sign up because Walden Two has a high standard of living and provides them with simple pleasures. In other words, Mary and Steve (just listen to those common names!) are symbols of the plain folk Skinner both despised and wanted to \\"help\\" with his social engineering. By contrast, the intellectual Castle turns out to be quite impossible.Frazier openly talks about how Walden Two will eventually take over the neighbouring towns, buy up the farmers' land and force the local dealers to join \\"the cooperative\\"...or else, apparently. Frazier also reveals that all of Walden Two's inhabitants vote for the same candidates in the local elections. Both methods (economic compulsion and bloc vote) were used by Mormons to wield political power in both Nauvoo and Utah during the 19th century. Indeed, Skinner might have gotten the idea from a study of Mormon history (he mentions Joseph Smith in passing). At an even more candid moment, Frazier climbs onto a spot known as the Throne, assumes a position similar to the crucifixion, and fancies himself an equal to God and Jesus Christ! As for the inevitable parallels with Soviet Russia, Skinner's alter ego brushes them aside by accusing the Russians of not being radical enough. After all, they never abolished the family or religion.\\"Walden Two\\" is a fascinating, bizarre and interesting example of the darker sides of social engineering. As already mentioned, it could be read as an unintentional parody. One recurring scene in the novel is a flock of sheep seemingly conditioned to stay within a moving enclosure, but actually carefully watched by a large sheepdog. The symbolism is ambiguous. I suppose it's intended as a symbol of how people behave when *not* converted to Skinner's program. However, it may just as well be seen as a symbol of Walden Two. Indeed, Castle sees it that way.Somehow, it feels as if he has the last word."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"There is a lot of confusion about this book.Walden Two is one big dialogue on the possibilities of society design. Like Orwell's 1984 or Plato's Republic, it is about ideas. All that happens in it is a lot of gab about how we might or might not want to design a society, so it makes poor light reading. The book has little stylistic or rhetorical appeal, so if it became your favorite book it would probably be because you liked thinking about the things Skinner was thinking about.The concept at the heart of Walden Two is that of making our social institutions scientifically self-improving - matching up our needs and problems with any relevant solutions, and designing the institutions so that they will readily develop and take up scientific knowledge. The reader is invited to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of this via Skinner's sketch of one implementation and its consequences.That sketch dominates the book with little details, leading many readers (pro and con alike) to conclude that the details presented were Skinner's literal suggestions. I suggest sidestepping the issue by evaluating ideas rather than people, as Skinner provided us with no firm evidence of what he believed (in my opinion a definite, but not unrecoverable, flaw of the work). Walden Two was devised by the character Frazier, who has some rhetorical similarities to Skinner in his more rhetorical moods. On the other hand, the narrator shares a wealth of detail with Skinner, and particular is very distinct from Frazier. Heis named Burris (to Skinner's Burrhus), teaches unhappily at University, finds Frazier to be personally irritating and arrogant, and is interested in the possibilities of improving society and applying behavior, though often giving Frazier mild challenges. Of particular note, Burris admits quite explicitly that he does not understand the basis of the techniques that Frazier is using. They are wild future technology. All we see of them - via Burris - are a handful of brief sketches and a lot of results. Like the flying car or Newspeak, the implementation is not the point, but the consequences are. Once again, the book will be more interesting if you can separate out the overarching ideas.Walden Two is (by assumption, obviously not empirically) leaderless, policeless, and virtually free of any punishment, restraint, surveillance or coercion. The techniques do not involve any surgery or drugging. Anyone but Skinner, the steadfast determinist, would characterize them as minimal-impact, minimal-control, giving people as much choice as possible and using the same kind of incentives that now 'control' us, but in the pursuit of more leisurely, healthy, diverse, etc. lives. If Skinner had not been such a slave to his words, he could have conveyed this important nuance by simply using ordinary words. His utopia is really intended to be a utopia, explicitly different from the nasty controls that governments now use: surveillance and reporting to central authorities, beatings, war, etc.And this is really the point. After a couple of careful readings, the one thing I can noticeably identify Skinner embracing and defending is perhaps the one essentially utopian notion: that things now are being done in very wrong and ineffective ways (which they are), and that some mixture of technical knowhow and good-heartedness might under some conditions correct the problems and make things better for everyone. There is something deeply naive in this, in the age and perpetual lack of delivery of such things, that always arouses my cynicism. But in some ways it does get delivered - without anyone to act on this impulse, you and I would be working the dirt in fear, unhealthy and about as far from free as possible.Bottom line:Skinner's defense of essential utopian ideas is refreshing, and he presents a slightly different angle that bears useful comparison with other political utopian and dystopian novels like 1984, Brave New World, etc. However, the execution is poor on several counts, so Walden Two is a pass for anyone who really wants to get to the point or who is essentially uninterested in the topics described above.If you do read it, be patient and engage the topic on YOUR terms - not Chomsky's and not Skinner's, either!"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"I decided to reread this book not too long ago because I could remember little from my initial reading. I discovered many new nuances in the text that I picked up on immediately and had much fun with myself debating its many philosophical points. I would recommend this book to anyone, from the intellectual to the beginning reader, to the communist, to the libertarian.For a book with no discernable plot, it comes across very well as a fun read. The book is merely the story of the narrator (Burris) writing a book about Walden Two. Unlike 1984 with its dramatic, albeit melodramatic, story line, Walden Two is simply a first-person narrative of a party's foray into Walden Two. However, Skinner rarely allows one to see this by assailing the reader with a barrage of his thoughts, opinions and findings.There are, however, some shortcomings of this work, which warrant a one-star deduction. Skinner paints a wonderful Utopia and accounts for more of the minor details than most Utopia-oriented authors, but he makes a few glaring assumptions. Three come to mind as being the most detrimental to his argument. One) He assumes that Walden Two will magically produce enough goods to sustain itself with ample to spare for trade. Two) He assumes that a science of Behavioral Engineering is possible and implementable. And three) He assumes that this Behavioral Engineering will magically keep the Planners and Managers, the government of the community, from lusting after power, and that in this non-competitive-by-admission environment, people will still manage to excell past the norm. He attempts to support them, but he failed to convince me, no matter how I looked at the problem. Also, he is blatantly sympathetic to Russian Communism, although it was 1948 when he published the book, and Burris is so obviously a straw man concocted for Frazier to fight and convert that the last few chapters are almost laughable, if very poetic and well-written.All in all, I give the book and Skinner's tactics of argument four stars, but Walden Two as a community, one. Although it seems tempting with four hour work days and no competition, Walden Two seems, at least on paper, as believable as Lilliput or Fantasia, or any other fanciful land.Maybe Skinner should have made Walden Two a floating island and Frazier a green skinned dwarf, or something......."},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"Walden Two is not a story so much as it is Skinner's idea that by using the psycological techniques of a behaviorist a utopian society can be built (it can even be considered propaganda promoting the school of behaviorism). The book lacks story, there is little charactor development or anything thing of the sort. It is essentially a grocery list of items that should be in a perfect society.With that said I justify my rating.Walden Two is a the model of a utopia, set in the United States just after World War Two. Skinner illustrates what needs to be done for the happiness of humans, but not the bliss the few ruling class or even the bliss of the majority(as presented loosely in democracy) but the bliss of everyone. The main idea behind behaviorism is that humans are born with nothing and we are the product of our histories, everything that ever happened to the indivisual will affect that person's choices in whatever endevour the indivisual is faced with. All the problems within people are learned, they can therefor be unlearned. Within Walden Two those who were born into the society never learn these bad behaviors and those who have come into the society, by following 'The Walden Code' simply unlearn them. None of the problems of modern society linger within Walden Two because of the technology of behavioral engineering. Negative emotions like jelousy or greed or hate are not present in Walden Two because the circumstances from which they arise are not preseant. There are no pressures from society itself to corrupt man, he has no reason to be corrupted if all his needs are accounted for.While this exact model of a utopia may not apply to the modern world, it's basic ideas certanly do, all that would need to be updated is the technology. Humanity will not remain static, amoung its potential directions is one towards the utopian society another, the distopian society. I'd sooner be living the life of T.E.

All throughout this novel, readers wonder if they would really like to live in a society like this by weighing the costs and benefits. Written in more of a philosophical type of dialogue between the protaganists and the antagonists, the novel at first presents to be dull, but persistence proves to be worthwhile. This is a must read for any student or professor, as it is for anyone interested in the psychology or philosophy of the book.

Control is inevitable and you are controlled. You can learn to be a controller rather than a controllee and begin to enjoy the benefits of behavioral science.

A party of B.F. Skinner's academic colleagues and their friends journey to a utopian community outside Canton, Ohio whose residents only work four hours per day and live in a resort community. Today's SF fans would quickly recognize the setting as a perpetual SF convention. They meet Skinner the Behaviorist, cleverly disguised as Frazier, and tour the community from tea service to Frazier's \\"throne\\". A Code created by experiment and the ministrations of psychologists from birth forward keep everybody happy and productive. For good measure, Skinner treats us to a superficial discussion of true liberty and freedom, which no work of speculative fiction aspiring above the pulps lacks.The novel also serves as a view of the anxieties of America as it demobilized from WWII. Would swinging from wartime Keynesian spending to paying off the debts incurred defending the nation cripple the economy just as millions of young men demobilized? Three variations of fascism lay defeated by Communism and liberal democracy: which of the two systems left standing was best? It was too early to know that a combination of government policy, piles of war bonds in every patriotic American's mattress and a near-monopoly of industry would raise most Americans to heights of prosperity they could not imagine in 1946. It was certainly too early to get a complete picture of Soviet oppression and Mao Zedong was still fighting in the countryside.Skinner ends with a surprise: his characters' trajectories are exactly what a model assuming pure materialism would predict. Steve and Mary, representatives of the prewar working class, choose life at Walden Two, which is arguably better in every material respect than what they expected given their lives before the war. Rodge and Barbara choose the upper middle-class life of a new lawyer. Rodge chooses the outside more relucantly than Barbara to be sure, but the end of the book does not find him in Walden Two looking for a new fiancee. Castle and Burris live in the Faculty Club, which means the decent bachelor housing of the era: one or two comfortable rooms, with all of the necessities and some of the luxuries met. Universities offer cultural amenities comparable to Walden Two as well. So, in material and cultural terms, Walden Two is equivalent to the Faculty Club, which lets each professor's disposition choose his destiny.As a fanfic, I've wanted to offer yearly installments of Steve, Mary and Burris' life in Walden Two. Would Walden Two's studio apartments pale next to a Levittown's luxurious 700 square-foot houses, or would it take the split-level ranch that a factory worker of the 1960s could afford? Would the advent of television kill the community's endless round of live performances and barn dances? Would the cultural contributions of Steve Jamnik's Eastern European heritage be encouraged or discouraged, and would his (likely) Catholic faith survive? How would the first black couple entering Walden Two experience it, and some of their fellow communards emigrating from a fundamentally racist society? America's thermidor of the early 1950s awaited; would Walden Two survive Joe McCarthy?"},{"Title":"Walden Two","review":"The product was not what I expected, the cover wasn't even the cover that was shown in the picture.

Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!

Written around the 1600's, this play by William Shakespeare is best known for its tragic ending. In this play, betrayed by those he trusted most, King Lear is driven to the brink of insanity as his remaining power is snatched away. The dense rich language adds more meaning to the play, which is quite interesting due to the different twists in the plot, and the realistic portrayal of the diverse characters. This play, though hard to understand at times, is probably one of Shakespeare's best tragedies. This play is a \\"must read\\" book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Here is the full plot of the play (read only if you already know the ending of the book):The play begins as King Lear, the ruler of England, is giving his daughters his kingdom so that they can rule. However, he wants his daughters to express their love for him, and in return he would give them the land. The eldest daughters, Goneril and Regan declare their love and receive their land. The youngest, Cordelia, says that words cannot express her love, and this angers the king. He says that he will give her no land and dowry and she is married off to the King of France.The scene shifts to another important character Edmund. Edmund is the illegitimate son of Gloucester, and he is creating a plan to trick his father into believing that his other son Edgar is attempting to steal Gloucester's wealth and then intends on killing him. This angers as he Gloucester and how he to kill his traitor son Edgar.As the play unravels, readers see that Goneril and Regan begin plotting to steal whatever power the king still may have. As the story continues, the daughters' evil plans are revealed to the king as he realizes the Cordelia was the only daughter loyal to him and he regrets the decision he made earlier. As the play progresses the king becomes mad with the knowledge.The play now takes place in Gloucester's castles and soon Goneril and Regan both fall in love with Edmond. Gloucester also learns the plans to the eldest daughters and he warns the king. After Regan and Goneril realize that Gloucester has told the father, they name him a traitor and torture him. In the end, Edgar saves his father.The king leaves and heads for Dover. This is where Cordelia is waiting for her father. However, both the king and Cordelia are captured and imprisoned by the other daughters. Goneril, in the blindness of her love for Edmund, poisons Regan and soon is lead into killing herself. Edgar and Edmund duel. Cordelia was killed in prison and the king soon dies afterwards and then the play ends."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This is timeless Shakespearean drama, about a King and his three daughters, wrapped around corruption, betrayal and tragedy.

It's considered a masterpiece, and for good reason.But there is still one small comment I would like to make. Read the play. Then ask yourself who on Earth the character Goneril was. Um, she was the Queen of England. Not the wife of the King. The Queen. Albany was her consort.Lear was no longer the King. Regan was not the Queen. Cordelia was not the Queen. Goneril was. And had a Man with her attitude about power been the ruler, no one would think it strange.Yes, Lear is a tragic character, and it sure is tragic when he holds his beloved but dead Cordelia and asks if she is still alive. But Goneril is a tragic character too, and it is tragic when, upon getting clobbered in a battle, she decides to kill herself.

I mean, did Shakespeare actually know someone named Romeo? But that's not the point. This whole play sucks. I didn't get involved at all and I couldn't relate to none of the characters. Plus when my teacher said that Othello is actually black, I, as a white person, took offense to it. So to all you out there in cyber space, just avoid this no matter what.

I would love to have a whole Shakespeare set of these!"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"The Arden edition of King Lear (I believe this one is in its third printing) is a combination of both the Quarto and the Folio editions of the play. Of course, when you end up with a conflated edition (one that is made up of both) you are left at the mercy of the editor but, for my money, R.A. Foakes does an excellent job of integrating the manuscripts and often points out in the notes which and why certain choices were made.Other people have summarized the plot of King Lear here at amazon.com so I won't engage in that sort of review. I will concentrate instead on the particular edition and why I think it's among the best and then I will point out some things to look for in the play, things that I believe deserve close attention, things that will add to your enjoyment of the play.First of all the Arden edition - the book is basically divided into two major parts: the essays and the play. The play occupies the top half of each page, while the editorial notes and \\"translations\\" are found on the bottom. So, for example, when King Lear first lets us know about \\"divesting\\" his kingdom, Foakes tells us that this word is important because it sets an important pattern regarding clothes throughout the play.Sometimes the observations are incisive and surprisingly good, sometimes not as good. For example, when Lear starts talking about \\"By all the operation of the orbs / From whom we do exist, and cease to be\\", Foakes points out that the orbs are the planets (during Shakespeare's lifetime, the alignments of the planets was important - the word \\"disaster\\" actually means stars out of alignment - the kind of worldview that held the earth as the center of the universe was the worldview that Shakespeare inherited and lived in). But Foakes fails to mention that the orbs are also our EYES and in their full operation, opening your eyes can make one \\"exist\\" (as in we see them) and closing your eyes can make one \\"cease to be\\" (as in you don't see them). Furthermore, the orbs can be seen as being the eyes of God and us existing in them. Bishop Berkely's philosophy relied heavily on the idea that everything exists because God perceives it.Anyway, just realize that the greatest of notes are nowhere near as good as the greatest of care and attention when reading. Especially when reading the greatest writer that ever lived.Now onto some things I believe everyone should pay attention to. The word \\"love\\" appears in the play more than any other word of meaning (obviously I'm excluding words like \\"the\\" in the search). Now if you combine language that are related to eyes (sight, orbs, look, see, etc) you will also notice a great preponderance of these words. The same thing will happen if you combine the other senses (touch, feeling, smell, etc). Why is this of any import? Well, if you're going to write about something, you're going to have to use words. If something is important, you're going to want to drive that point home so you will be using some words more than others. This is an indication that the play you're reading is going to be about those things. So \\"love\\", \\"seeing\\", \\"nature\\", \\"clothes\\" and animals such as \\"dog, snake, wolf, etc\\" are words that appear a lot and are important.Sometime Shakespeare is so goddamn clever that you could spend a lifetime and not catch everything. For example, it wasn't until my 2nd reading of the play that I noticed he tells Kent\\"Our potency made good, take thy reward.Five days we do allot thee, for provisionTo shield thee from diseases of the world;And on the sixth to turn thy hated backUpon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,This shall not be revoked.\\"Notice the word \\"provision\\". The root of the word is pro-vision. It means to look ahead. Later on in the play Kent reappears, in disguise! Is Shakespeare having fun with us or am I reading too much into what could be an unintended use of the word? Let me put it this way - if I'm going to find morsels like this one, Shakespeare gets the credit.The words relating to seeing and feeling are especially important if you take tragedy to be an epistemological problem. If the tragic figure is one that denies a kind of knowledge (Lear and Gloucester certainly do this) then one can deny it by not seeing or feeling, hence the words that relate to the acquisition of knowledge through empirical means. Notice in the above verses that Kent will be told to re-appear, but he can only reappear in disguise. Lear has already denied his love and devotion. Kent must reappear as something else to allow Lear to \\"love him\\" again.Lastly, pay close attention to Shakespeare's doubling and mirroring. This is a favorite thing of his to do. I remember that the first time I read \\"Measure for Measure\\" I noticed doubling and mirroring on every page. Then I read it again and noticed these things every 5 lines. Then I read it again and started noticing them with ever increasing frequency! In King Lear the mirroring is much more subtle and even more rewarding. Notice how Goneril ends up \\"confusing\\" Gloucester with Lear when she tells him to \\"smell\\" his \\"way to Dover\\". From that moment on Gloucester and Lear become doubles and possibly even more and the reader becomes a party to the confusion.Reading Shakespeare is a mind blowing experience and King Lear is probably his greatest play (and that's saying something considering he also wrote \\"Hamlet\\", \\"Othello\\" and \\"Macbeth\\").Shakespeare wrote this play towards the end of his playwright's career. He had two daughters, one of which was a bit of an embarrassment to him. It's fun to hypothesize whether retiring was on his mind and if it was his own intent\\"To shake all cares and business from our age;Conferring them on younger strengths, while weUnburthen'd crawl toward death.\\"I cannot leave a review of King Lear without mentioning some important essays on it. A few years back philosopher Stanley Cavell wrote a review called \\"The Avoidance of Love\\". His reading of King Lear is revolutionary beyond belief. No student or lover of Shakespeare's plays should be without it. The essay has been combined with other Cavell essays on other Shakespearian plays and is available in the book \\"Disowning Knowledge\\". Amazon has it. It will blow your mind. Also, A.C. Bradley wrote a famous essay on King Lear that should be read as well.P.S. check out the cool and artistic cover which features a tree trunk splitting into three branches. Is it an allegory for the play? By golly, I think it is. That's Arden for you - quality cover to cover :)"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"Although RA Foakes' Arden3 edition appeared some years after those of Wells & Taylor (Complete Oxford) and Jay L Halio (Cambridge) it did not follow their precedent of issuing separate texts based on Quarto and Folio originals. These early texts (Q 1608 and F 1623 respectively) occasionally offer quite different versions of the play and reconciling them to form a single, coherent whole is a task that is, arguably, less elegant than the dual edition solution. By comparison, Arden's text looks cumbersome, with numerous Q and F superscripts surrounding passages found exclusively in one or other source.Foakes is well aware that his single, 'conflated' text isn't as fashionable as those of the 'revisionists' mentioned above, who believe that the Folio text of Lear represents Shakespeare's revised and final draft, and that modern editors should not pick and mix between Q and F but respect the integrity of the two early sources. While seemingly reactionary, Foakes is in fact countering the new orthodoxy of Halio et al. In his view, their 'dogmatic and purist stance ... abandons the idea of King Lear as a single work of which we have two versions.' He is cautious and level-headed in his approach, aware of the limitations of scholarly speculation and in presenting both Q and F variants he allows the reader to make up her/his own mind.Aside from this central controversy, Arden3 Lear has much to offer. Foakes reminds us of some key differences between the Jacobean world and our own: the original audience, he says, would have tuned in much more readily than us to puns and linguistic innovation; grasped the symbolic difference between crown and coronet; fully understood the distinctions of 'thou' and 'thee'; and recognised the constitutional impossibility of a monarch giving away his kingdom as though it were in his personal gift. The Introduction also presents illuminating discussions on loyalty and disobedience (in which Oswald could conceivably be seen as an ideal servant and Kent a bad one), on the problem of illusion in Gloucester's attempted suicide (IV.6) and on the influence of writers such as Harsnett, Erasmus and Montaine. Plentiful examples of dramatic practice from the play's long stage history are skilfully integrated into these discussions, while its equally rich critical history - especially that of the C20 - is helpfully evaluated. The conclusion is that there can be no return to Christian redemptionist optimism on the one hand or to totally nihilistic interpretations on the other. A recognition of the play's complexity, paradoxes and contradictions have led many to feel, in the words of Richard Fly, 'a deep distrust of all attempts at closure' in King Lear.Ultimately, therefore, this Arden3 is not as radical as rival editions. But it presents an honest, balanced and democratic version of the play in which judgements are occasionally forcefully expressed and occasionally left unresolved. It is comprehensive, authoritative and thought-provoking and should be of value to any serious student."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"The Arkangel audio CD's of Shakespeare's plays have an outstanding reputation. Most are really first rate and are quite enjoyable to listen to. Hamlet, MacBeth and Julius Caesar are very well done, complete plays well interpreted. Which is all the more baffling as to why Othello and Merchant of Venice are so notably bad. The overall productions and main players seem to have been chosen to project caricature rather than serious adaptation. That may be a fair point in a class room, but these two plays deserve a serious presentation."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"The rating of four stars is for the edition (R.A. Foakes's); the play is one of the greatest tragedies ever written, and of course deserves at least five stars.It is not easy to find a a truly satisfactory edition of this play. An advantage of R.A. Foakes's is that he offers us a &quot;conflated&quot; text, i.e. one that aims to reconstruct something like what Shakespeare originally wrote by taking elements from the best two early printings rather than giving us those separately or by settling for the one rather than the other. I don't think, though, that Foakes's reconstruction is nearly as convincing as that of earlier editors who presented conflated texts. I am often unhappy about his glosses, too, and about his rather &quot;trendy&quot; introduction. Even so, the introduction and the notes do give us most of what we need, so long as we approach this material with independence of mind.The PLAY is the thing, and whichever text we read it in (even, for example, in a text based just on that in the Folio), it is a great and moving work. Lear is an ageing king (about 80+), whose life has been sheltered and pampered. Although this equips him badly for &quot;real&quot; life, he is not intrinsically the evil tyrant that much current criticism tends to suggest - even his authoritarianism seems a matter of habit rather than anything else. At the beginning of the play he foolishly decides that he will give each of his three daughters a part of his kingdom. His intention had been to give the youngest daughter, Cordelia, with whom he planned to spend his &quot;retirement&quot;, the biggest portion. However, rather than simply proceeding with his plan, he asks his daughters to declare the degree of their love for him, and this is where tangible trouble starts.Goneril and Regan, both flatterers who seek their own interest at all times, butter him up, but Cordelia, who is honest, offends Lear's ego by refusing to follow her sisters' phoney example. He then offers the two eldest daughters 50% each, and disinherits Cordelia. Soon Goneril and Regan, contrary to what had been arranged, refuse to give him hospitality, and plan his death. Cordelia, though badly treated by him, tries to rescue her father, and the two are reconciled in a most moving scene, but she is killed and carried onto the stage in an immensely painful way by Lear, whose sanity had been temporarily destroyed by his daughters' and his own behaviour but who paradoxically gains new insight into life as a result of everything he experiences during the course of his suffering.His story is paralleled by that of the Earl of Gloucester, who similarly wrongly prefers a bad child to one who is good, yet is treated well by the good child, Edgar, who like Cordelia shows that love consists of forgiveness and generosity rather than anything else. Just as Lear learned wisdom through madness, Gloucester acquires it after he has been blinded by some of the most evil people in the play.It is in many ways a &quot;bleak&quot; play, not giving us any reason to hope that there is a God who looks after us in this life or one hereafter, and showing plenty of evil in humankind - amongst both women and men - but which also leaves no doubt as to what it means to be good, and provides consolation by showing us how good, and love, can endure even in the face of great provocation and suffering. - Joost Daalder"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"I love listening to British dramatizations of literary works! The Archangel Casts rendition of Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" is extremely well done. Shakespeare's original text is read in a vibrant fashion, complete with sound effects and music. The themes of jealousy, revenge, racism, and deception are clearly evident.The primise of this play concerns a Moorish general in the Venetian army who is in love with a Senator's daughter, Desdemona. The couple marry, much to the anger and chagrin of Desdemona's father, Brabantio. Before the couple can consummate their marriage, Othello is sent to Cypress in order to defend the island from Turkish invaders. Desdemona pleads to be allowed to accompany him, and is granted permission. She will follow her husband in the company of Iago, Othello's \\"ensign,\\" or servant, who has his own agenda. Iago is bitterly angry with Othello for promoting an officer named Cassio to the rank of Lieutenant when Iago feels he is the one who deserves the job. Iago also believes that Othello slept with his own wife, Emilia. Resolving to be avenged, the psychopathically evil and manipulative ensign concocts a diabolical plan to convence Othello that Desdemona is having an affair with Cassio. What follows is a psychological drama in which Othello wrestles with doubts and confusion as he tries to learn the truth and ultimately descends into madness. Move over soap operas!The cast in this dramatization is excellent. David Threlfall is unsurpassable as Iago. His soft, seductive voice, (almost reminiscent of melting chocolate), simultaneously throbs with pretended concern and demonic joy. His soliluquies will chill you as you listen to his remorseless tones crescendo into jeering laughter. Anne Marie Duff is wonderful as Desdemona, providing the listener with a portrayal of innocence and heartbreaking sadness and fear. A special note needs to be made for Clive Swift who portrays Brabantio so well. Swift portrayed Richard on \\"Keeping Up Appearances,\\" and I enjoyed listening to him in a serious role.My only complaint about this production is Don Warrington who plays Othello. His accent is very thick, and it might help you to have a text of the play in front of you when he is speaking. This is the only reason I gave this dramatization four stars, but please do not let this put you off. The production is excellently done and should be listened to.

I've been forced to abandon the endeavour because I simply can't bear the way the play is being destroyed by atrocious performances in the two major roles. David Threlfall as Iago simply butchers the lines; it's almost as if he's trying to sabotage the part. It's possible that he's intent on making the lines sound \\"naturalistic\\" and \\"modern\\" so he skates over his lines in a Yorkshire accent with no effort to elucidate their meaning, making the occasional emphasis of a word here and there in a seemingly random way. He clearly doesn't understand what he's saying. One out of many examples: in lines 43/4 of Act One, Scene One: he races over the words, \\"We cannot all be masters, nor all masters/Cannot be truly followed\\" by emphasizing the word, \\"followed\\" rather than \\"truly\\"! And this is typical: when he singles out a word, it is invariably the wrong one.And if Threlfall is execrable, Don Warrington as Othello is atrocious. Perhaps drawing the tenor of his performance from Othello's description of himself as \\"rude am I in my speech\\", Warrington reads his lines with an almost complete absence of expression! To hear him read speeches such as the \\"Her father loved me; oft invited me;/Still question'd me the story of my life\\" as though he's reciting \\"The cat sat on the mat\\" would be comical if it were a parody. However, this is an ostensibly serious offering! How the director let these actors get away with these performances is a mystery; surely he couldn't be so deaf to the meaning of the words as to give these desecrations the thumbs-up.The supporting roles are generally better played but then these can only slightly mollify the dismal impression made by the two main parts.

Richard III, by contrast, while a force of malevolence, is also just moreinteresting and intelligent than those around him. Iago has none of Richard's beguiling qualities, he islittle more than the sum of his own jealousies and hatreds. And so, when this noblest hero and thismost vile villain collide, the events that follow are tragic in the human sense, not merely in a dramaticsense. We mourn the loss of a superior being, in Othello, not just the general destruction of life.Othello is also distinguished by just how trivial are the provocations that set events in motion. Iagouses little more than a single prop, an embroidered kerchief, and his own treacherous words to bringabout a series of deaths and the fall of a great man. In this sense it is the most writerly of plays,reflects most fully Shakespeare's own confidence that he can take such slender threads and weave acompelling drama. One despairs of ever saying anything novel about Shakespeare, he's been writtenabout so much, but the thought occurs that Iago might represent Shakespeare himself. Consider that itis Iago's tongue and a flimsy plot device of his contrivance that force the action of the drama and hisjealousy of the handsome and much-heralded leading man that provides the motive. SurelyShakespeare, who so loved the device of the play within a play, might have relished the idea of a playthat's a simulacrum of his own profession? I like to think so.But in the final analysis, Othello does not capture us in the same way that some of the other tragediesdo. The main characters are so unambiguous that they lack a certain depth. The plot is so contrivedand so inevitable that it seems mechanical rather than natural. You can imagine a world in whichHamlet exacts his revenge without hesitating or where Lear realizes he's acting like a fool, but youcan't imagine a world in which Iago allows Othello and Desdemona to live happily ever after. That's apretty serious weakness.GRADE : B+"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"The recent Naxos AudioBook entry in their Classic Drama Series, &lt;Othello&gt; NA 320612), is so well directed by David Timson that it fairly boils along. Granted that some passages are read a bit too swiftly to be followed by those without texts open before them, but one gets the feeling that this is a play and not a 400 year old monument. There are moments, however, when one could use some extra noises-on, so to speak. When Iago gets Cassio drunk, a little more rowdiness from extras would be appropriate--but perhaps I am spoiled by too many film versions and certainly by the full chorus in Verdi's opera.Hugh Quarshie makes a more interesting Othello than a great one. He does not have that Paul Robeson voice that one tends to associate with the role, and he understands the part light years better than the Othello of that unfortunate film version a few years back. But his lightweight approach does not work when the mouth-filling flights of poetry make their demands after he is convinced of Desdamona's infidelity.Anton Lesser also makes a fine but not great impression as Iago. Perhaps he needs to use more variety of delivery when he is being &quot;honest&quot; with the other characters. After all, his approach to Othello should not be in the same key as that to Roderigo or even to Cassio. Iago is a supreme actor, so it takes an equally supreme one to play him.For once, we can hear Emilia (Patience Tomlinson) hesitate when she speaks of the &quot;lost&quot; handkerchief; although on a sound recording she cannot give us the body-language to explain why she betrays her lady for the sake of her husband. The Cassio (Roger May) is very good in the handkerchief scene with Iago and the hidden, miscomprehending Othello.The running time is just over 3 hours, 11 minutes longer than the venerable Shakespeare Recording Society with Frank Silvera as Othello and Cyril Cusack as Iago, now available on Harper Audio. There still might be available a very dull version with Richard Johnson and Ian Holm, but avoid it."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"By the end of this tragedy, for some unfathomable reason considered by many to be one of the greatest works of drama in the history of world literature, if not THE greatest, 10 characters wind up dead, 5 of them goodies: Cornwall's servant, Gloucester, the Fool, Cordelia and Lear; and 5 of them baddies (at least there's some balance and classical symmetry here): Cornwall, Oswald, Goneril, Regan and Edmond.The whole regrettable series of events is triggered by Lear wanting to hang up his crown and step down as King and take it easy in his dotage. So he decides to divide his kingdom between his three daughters according to how much he reckons each of them loves and honours him. The two that don't love him at all, Goneril and Regan, go completely over the top and convince their doting father that they love him to death, which, in a way, as it subsequently pans out, they do; and the one who actually loves him, Cordelia, is so nauseated by her two elder sisters' gushing insincerity and venality that she says tells her father that she only loves him according to her filial duty as a daughter and no more. This causes Lear to totally lose it, disown her and banish her, upon which the King of France takes her on the rebound after she's dumped by the Duke of Burgundy because Lear's cut her off without a cent.There follows treachery, Lear's descent into madness, torture, gouged out eyes, people getting stabbed in the back, people poisoning themselves and various other unpleasantness; in the end, the heroine gets hanged after everyone has totally forgotten about her being in mortal danger because they were too busy chewing the fat; and the main character dies of a combination of grief for the death of his beloved daughter, the strain of strangling her executioner and carrying her dead body after his frail constitution has already been severely weakened.It goes without saying that with a little bit of meditation and mindfulness on the part of most of the characters in the play the whole sorry mess could have been avoided.Catharsis? Schmatharsis. It's depressing. And I'm in good company for thinking so. Even that old bardolator, Samuel Johnson, found the ending \`unendurable' and thought that it should be changed. And he generally knew what he was talking about. Cordelia should have been cut down in time and spared. Lear could have recovered and recuperated with some decent medical care to see his daughter married (after sorting out a mutually satisfactory separation agreement with the King of France) to the eligible young man who saved his life. Thus this gratuitously ghastly tragedy could have been turned into a splendid comedy with a happy ending and a wedding.What more could one ask for?It would have made for a much better play. Even Shakespeare didn't always get it right. Sorry Will. 1 star."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"&quot;Bloody farce&quot; was the indictment of &quot;Othello&quot; made by the dramatist Thomas Rymer, one of Shakespeare's contemporaries. He was right. Perhaps he was right because &quot;Othello&quot; in his time had not yet fully enjoyed the fake aura of a &quot;master play&quot; that it has boasted ever since. &quot;Othello&quot; features the shortcomings and mannerisms of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, but without the benefit of the (sporadic) linguistic inventiveness that Shakespeare evinced in the other play (another of those wrongfully praised). In &quot;Othello&quot;, though, what we mostly see is an utterly improbable set of characters acting out in an affected, theatrical manner - even while pretending to deal with issues of real life, portraying genuine psychologies. Yes, there is lots of jealousy in this world, and murders do happen - but for anyone to fly off the handle the way Othello does in this play, one has to be supplied with much better and much more extensive corroborative psychologic evidence than what is offered to us in &quot;Othello&quot;! Instead, what we see is basically someone growing insane on the basis of getting to know bits and peaces of ludicrously circumstancial evidence, plus, thanks to a puppet cartoon character named Yago, some innuendoes and probings that are anything but devious or subtle. Yago's behaviour and aims are so obvious and laughable that one would think one was reading a comedy if everything wasn't presented to us in a deadly serious manner, clothed in the solemn literary forms of a tragedy. As a reader or viewer, you simply never get to enjoy &quot;Othello&quot;: instead, you spend your time working hard to swallow the improbabilities that the author presumes to present to us as having anything to do with life or human emotions. Similarly, the character of Desdemona is yet another prop on the stage; she serves to provide Shakespeare with more flesh to be disposed of at the end of the play. As in the similarly flawed &quot;Hamlet&quot;, there remains an artificially contrived heap of corpses left as the curtain falls down -yet as poetry, &quot;Hamlet&quot; still held some interest and therefore was to a degree palatable; by contrast, &quot;Othello&quot;, even as poetry considered separately from the drama, is unexciting and drab. To summarize, &quot;Othello&quot; is a wash-out. The present writer recognizes the right of the previous reviewers to find &quot;Othello&quot; worthwhile; but in the same way contrary readings should also be allowed to be voiced. If the present review could contribute ever so slightly to tarnish the impeccable image that &quot;Othello&quot; enjoys in most readers' minds; or if it at least prevented &quot;Othello&quot; from being listed in Amazon files with an absurd gross rating of five or even four and a half stars - then the present writer would feel vindicated; as well as recompensed for the hours he lost perusing &quot;Othello&quot;!"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"'King Lear' is probably one of my favourite Shakespeare plays and is currently the one most studied at A-Levels. It is famed for it's depiction of the infirmity of old age and complex family politics. In some respects I think it'd be rather presumptuous of me to attempt to review Shakespeare. Someone so well known and influential wouldn't benefit from my opinions on their work, plus there are more scholarly and concise reviews out there. But I can comment on these Arden versions. Of all the Shakespeare I've read I've always found the Arden copies to be well laid out and to have excellent commentary and notes on the text. They really add to your understanding of Shakespeares outstanding plays and introduce you to the depth in his work. They have superb paper quality and are bound well, withstanding repeated readings and intensive study. For your collection of Shakespeare you can't do much better than Arden publications, some are quite hard to get hold of but it's worth the effort.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This play embodies tragedy, and may be my favorite play by Shakes. Othello has wonderful elements - some of the most unbearable and longest dramatic irony of any play, a devilish villain whose true motives we are left to guess, a virtuous but flawed protagonist, the triumph of evil over good. Othello is a gut-wrenching play and should be appreciated for its sheer dramatic energy and passion. Certainly other questions are explored - such as the issue of racial insecurities even in a successful and admired man among prejudiced people. However, perhaps the most important things to take out of it is the sheer evil that Iago spreads around him, puppeteering the good characters with strings of wickedness."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This play leaves the reader with a feeling of despair. How could there be such evil in the world as is in Iago's heart? How could there be such jealousy as with Roderigo? And what of Desdemona's undying love...so powerful that with her last breath she denies that it was indeed her husband that took her life. The flood of emotion and pain in this book leave the reader feeling a great desperation for humanity. However, the reader will find humor in the irony and figurative language that is woven throughout the dialogue. This play exposes the darkest side of man with several thrilling murders and continuous deception. It also colors the most desirable characteristics of man...devotion, trust, and love. Read this play!"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"Othello is now one of my favorite Shakesperean plays, right behind Romeo and Juliet.

I found this hard to listen to and understand, sorry!"},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"\\"Othello\\" is sort of a companion piece to \\"Macbeth\\" -- both are about noble, upstanding men who are destroyed by their own weaknesses. But where Macbeth was ruined by ambition, Othello's destruction comes from his jealousy and gullibility. And the play is really ruled by the nastiest, cruelest, most devious villain Shakespeare ever wrote.That villain is Iago, a high-ranking soldier who has a grudge against the noble Moorish soldier Othello, who has just eloped with the beautiful Desdemona. Using a nobleman as his pawn, Iago first turns Desdemona's father against Othello, but the new soldier defends himself agains claims of witchcraft.But Iago's true plan is far more devious, as he disgraces Othello's lieutenant Cassion and plants Desdemona's handkerchief in Cassio's room. Othello finds himself confronted by a chess game of lies, deceit and suspected infidelity, and his jealousy reaches a fever pitch that can only end in death.Yeah, the real star of this play is undoubtedly Iago. This is the most repellent mixture of absolute malicious evil and crazy-smart intellect that anyone could write -- he is the person you love to hate, even as you admire how devilishly perfect he is at playing the chessmaster who whispers poison into your ear while playing your \\"friend.\\" He doesn't quite think of EVERYTHING, but he comes close enough that you would NEVER want to deal with someone like this.But this tragedy is also underscored by the depiction of Othello, a truly noble and loyal soldier who is turned into a deranged homicidal mess. It's somehow even more disturbing to see him deteriorate than it was to see Macbeth, because this guy was on top of the world in every way -- he was smart, eloquent, a brilliant soldier and a newlywed. And look what happens to him.And Shakespeare deftly builds up this tragedy with a subtle, interconnecting web of lies and misdirections, with the tension building slowly until something has to blow. His writing is typically powerful, generating some quotable phrases (\\"It is the green-ey'd monster\\") and lots of cynical, dark dialogue (\\"Who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch?\\").\\"Othello\\" is a strangely fascinating tragedy, with Shakespeare absorbing us again in the tale of a good man corrupted. Definitely a good, if harrowing play."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This review is not of Othello itself (which is tremendously good), but rather on this edition of Othello (ISBN: 9781411400399), which was edited by Daniel Vitkus and David Scott Kastan.I read a lot of heavily annotated books, and I have to say that the Barnes & Noble Shakespeare editions have one of the best book designs I've ever encountered. The various references materials (footnotes and definitions for archaic words) appear in a manner that makes the text very easy to follow.The scholarship is also top-notch. The annotations give you enough to make things clear without insulting your intelligence, or without overburdening you with unnecessary detail.

I was introduced to the ARDEN series by a class that required us all to be on the same page as it were, so I was at first weary to use them. Like all editions put out (Penguin, Folger, Barnes and Noble, Arden, etc) They all have valuable notes and references, introductions and essays on various subjects on the content, form and history of the play you are about to read. So half this book is taken up by the introdcution and history. Every Arden starts with the same couple of chapters on Shakpespeare. The editor, R.A. Foakes has a very in depth and interseting introduction to the text of LEAR which is worth a read, but of course, in my opinion, after you have read the play and tried to understand it for yourself.I personally prefer the way the Folger series of shakespeare is set up with text on one page and the notes for it are directly opposite the page you are reading, making note referencing while you read easy. Arden tends to give you notes on variations between the quarto and folio which is good, but when I'm reading a play I could care less about textual variations or how editors have fussed with changing one word to make sense of a thought. However interesting it sometimes is, I don't like looking down to read a note on a passage and its all about the textual variation, but will not explain the thought further.Final thought: Great Resource for reading LEAR, not the best for READING LEAR, especially for the first time."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This is a conflated edition of King Lear, with Foakes combining the two original sources. When the chips are down -- that is, when one cannot have both versions -- he tends to opt for the later (Folio) one. This is especially so in the last scene where this choice produces a somewhat less bleak ending.On each page of the play's text about half the space is taken up with notes. These can, by and large, be ignored if you want to enjoy the play, but can be highly useful if something puzzles you. They cover a variety of matters, such as the meaning of now obscure word, interpretation when it is not clear what word is actually meant, choices where the two originals have difference words, often explaining the choice, possible stage direction or ways of staging the play and so on. They are usually well done, though possibly excessive.A long essay introducing the play explains the editor's approach, comments on some critical issues, and comments on various stagings of the play. These are informative and often stimulating, with Foakes not being stridently attached to any one interpretation. There is available elsewhere an incredibly large amount of comment on all aspects of King Lear and how to interpret it, most of which Foakes wisely ignores. The play is the thing, and one of the advantages of reading it (as opposed to atending a production) is that one can contemplate the different interpretations and emphases that are possible. To a large extent Foakes sets this up, and then lets the reader proceed, rather than forcing a particular version, as happens (often very badly when directors want to demonstrate their originality) inevitably with a staged -- or filmed or audio -- production."},{"Title":"Tragedy of Othello","review":"This is a thoroughly edited and explained version of Othello.

Hitting her with his car gives her amnesia (what else?). &quot;Mary&quot; is in danger (of course). Can you guess who will protect her from what she can't remember?&quot;Private Vows&quot; is one of those stories where strong writing pulls in the reader, helping to disguise the weaknesses in the plot for a while. The strongest part of &quot;Private Vows&quot; is Steward's smooth story-telling style. Unfortunately, the story she's chosen to tell is thin and full of problems. Steward is able to cast a spell with her words and strong characterizations. Deep down though, she's not saying too much.Is &quot;Private Vows&quot; suspenseful? Occasionally. Is it pretty stupid? Definitely. Where to start? The premise is ridiculous, another book where all it takes is a bump on the head for the heroine to get amnesia. Worse, Mary's amnesia is so contrived that it just seems dumb. Mary remembers plenty of things when it's needed to develop her character. She just doesn't remember anything that might show who she is or what happened to her. (For instance, she remembers everything about her parents, but not their names.) Everything she remembers and when is conveniently dictated by the requirements of the story. Amnesia books seldom give an accurate depiction of what amnesia victims go through but this one had me laughing at how contrived it was. Poor Mary. She remembers everything except what she can't to keep the plot going. Give me a break.Other than Cole, Mary and Cole's cop friend, there are only two characters in the book. I looked at the cast of characters in the front of the book before I started reading and I automatically picked out the killer. (Once again, two suspect mysteries are bad mysteries). The mystery element is also poorly plotted. Mary and Cole's investigation spends too much time going nowhere. Too much of this book feels like they--and the reader--are treading water, waiting for a killer any smart reader has already picked out to make a move. Looking back after I finished the book, I couldn't figure out what took this person so long. How nice of the villain to stay out of the way long enough for Cole and Mary to fall in love.Any patience I might have had left with this book was destroyed by the last fifty pages. Then there's the final confrontation, which never would have taken place if the characters were using their heads. Their actions made no sense. The scene that sets this up had me shaking my head and saying, &quot;Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.&quot; A real wallbanger moment. The book continues with too much romantic hand wringing after the mystery is over that only pads the length of the story. We know these two are meant to be together. We know they will be together (romance novel, right?). Delaying the obvious for no good reason is dull and pointless. Worse, there is an unresolved feeling to the ending that undermines the essential happy ending romance novels require. I was uncomfortable with it.Steward sprinkles some chilling scenes throughout her book but the contrived and manipulative plotting and poor mystery weaken it overall. It's easy to enjoy Steward's storytelling if you don't think about the story and expect it to make much sense. The best part of &quot;Private Vows?&quot; If Intrigue keeps publishing amnesia books this bad, people will eventually stop buying them and they'll stop publishing them. That's a day we can all look forward to."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Generals McInerney and Vallely have consistently impressed me with their sober, professional analysis of the Wars on Terror and in Iraq.

Instead, read it as if your life depends on it. Because it probably does.The authors first describe the gravity of the war against terror. They demonstrate that fundamentalist extremists -- in many countries -- have repeatedly demonstrated that they have no qualms about using any and all means necessary to slaughter innocent civilians.

At the top of the heap, of course, is the very real scenario involving the simultaneous detonation of nuclear weapons in multiple U.S. cities.The second section of the book describes how we fight: both defensively and offensively.

Islamic Jihad... in addition, the al-Qaeda affiliate, Ansar al-Islam, was based in Northern Iraq...\\"Thus, Hussein's massive human rights violations, support of terrorism world-wide, and development and use of WMD's made him a first-tier target in the war on terror. The authors rejected a continuance of the containment policy because sanctions had been subverted by regimes like Syria; international support was wavering; and French, German, and Russion businesses continued to stoke Saddam's massive weapons programs.The final section of the book discusses how we must wage the war on terror... country by country. In some cases, diplomacy is recommended. In others, quick military action is advocated. The rationale, strategies and tactics are all discussed in compelling detail. Wrapping up, the authors state:\\"Our fight, however, is not against a religion. The vast majority of Muslims are obviously peacable people. Our fight is against those who... [would] ... turn Islam into a terrorist creed preaching global violence and revolution. What we can and must do is act against those regimes that train, shelter, and support the terrorists who are bent on killing us (Iran and Syria); put further pressure on Muslim states to curtail radical Islam within their own borders (Egypt, Pakistan); stop Muslim states from subsidizing intolerant religous beliefs around the world (Saudi Arabia); and demand, and bring about, an end to the WMD programs of rogue states (North Korea). We must declare a \\"no sanctuary for terrorists\\" policy and enforce it. [We] must be a faithful ally to those Muslim countries that openly oppose Islamist terror and ... stand for tolerance and liberalization... like Morocco, Qatar and Bahrain... [We] must promote economic, political, religious and social freedom through the entire Muslim world...\\"It is only in the book's afterword that politics are discussed. The authors state that they have purposely written the book from a military perspective.... not political. However, the Democratic primaries -- in which nearly every candidate denied the existence of a terror network and stated that only \\"al-Qaeda\\" is the enemy. The fallacy of that denial is described in great detail throughout the book. The corruption of the UN's \\"oil-for-food program\\", the intrinsic monetary links between Hussein and Europe, make relying upon either the UN or conflicted countries like France, Germany and Russia, a foolhardy and dangerous exercise. Unfortunately, the apparent Democratic candidate for President was one of these candidates.\\"The Web of Terror will want to influence America's presidential elections because [it] will not survive four more years of George W. Bush.\\" At stake is nothing less than the survival of the United States. Overstatement? The authors clearly demonstrate otherwise. Read this book. And get your friends and family to read it as well. It's simply that important."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"In examining the perspectives of these two news commentators and retired Generals, Endgame proves detailed, easy to read analysis for the Average American in understanding the War On Terror (WOT). This is essential reading if you'd like a primer on the Iraq and Afghanistan. It's a high level overview of the military politics associated with how the war has been conducted and executed by the top brass. It provides detailed commentary on what they did right and what they did wrong. It also provides very constructive criticism on how the United States can improve its tactics in the war on terror.While some folks have touted this book as Hawkish and neo-con oriented, its not necessarily fair to extrapolate the politics of a war where we are already committed 3+ years to winning and have been very successful. Critics of the war continue to drag out old news even as al-Zarcowi has been caught with careful, detailed and persistent efforts by the co-alition of the willing. These two retired Generals tell a great tale and paint Americas military in a positive light.It's a short read. It also talks about why Americans fight and to what end they bring their values to the battlefield against an enemy that really hates the West. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Two of the sharpest national security analysts around have teamed up to capture adroitly the single most vital issue in the global war on terror: we must focus on the mission of ultimate victory; nothing short of that will suffice. Generals Vallely and McInerney impressed us all by their clear, precise and on-the-mark analysis during the Iraq War. They have consistently seen through the crisis mode that most US media operates in to recognize the larger picture. They bring this perspective to Endgame in a way that makes it a most compelling read.Like it or not, we are a target for terrorists. Our very survival as a nation and as a civilization depends in our ability to recognize the nature of the fight and the absolute need to make a commitment to victory.The authors present a compelling case for how we can win and even more importantly they explain the 'why.' What makes this war so vital to our core existence? This is a book that deserves a prominent place in the desk of every American concerned with the turbulent issues of a dangerous, emerging 21st century world."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Only one thing detracts from this book: the lack of editing by an experienced writer and geopolitician. Besides that, the book is a fine exposition on the course America must take in the global war against terror. The two generals who wrote the book can justly claim they \\"got it\\" as pundits for Fox News. On TV, they swam against the tide and correctly analyzed - and predicted - our quick victory over the Iraqi Army. Now, in their book, they analyze recent history in Iraq and Afghanistan and make cogent and professional military comments. And they do it without talking down to the reader. An example: a main reason for the failure to capture Bin Laden in Afghanistan was total reliance by General Franks on a Pakistani blocking force along the border. Recent revelations about Pakistan's sale of nuclear technology to rogue states adds to the gravitas of that charge. The book then gets to the core of the issue in Chapter Eight, \\"The Great Cause,\\" in which the authors lay out a plan for destroying the global terror network. (Incidentally, they refute the notion that a cabal of pro-Israel, Jewish 'neocons' in the administration is setting US policy in order to benefit Israel.) In just seven pages (163-169) the authors remind us of the precepts that brought an end to the age of piracy on the high seas. Those axioms can also bring an end to the Islamic terror threat. Just as the dreaded Jolly Roger was destroyed by the cooperation of threatened nations, the denial of safe havens, and by dogged military pursuit, so can the Islamic terrorists be destroyed. This book is a fitting memorial to General Vallely's son Scott, who tragically died while serving his country. Finally, I take issue with \\"Jack of Toronto,\\" Dr. Robinson, and his one-star \\"humble opinion.\\" I read his biased review of a book on Senator Kerry's war record, and from that commentary and his uninformed opinion of this book, I must conclude he could use an editor himself - along with a vigorous undergraduate grounding in research and geopolitics. My own credentials, in case Dr. Robinson is interested, are: Columbia University, US Naval Academy, aircraft carrier pilot, Georgetown University Law School (Juris Doctor), and the International Security Affairs section of the Department of Defense. I also founded and edited The Journal of Defense & Diplomacy. If he did read \\"End Game\\" twice, he should read it yet a third time. So should we all.Iran Covenant"},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"I have found this to be a very interesting op-ed piece. I don't have any military or intelligence background; so I can't agree or disagree with the authors' assessments. However, they have been fairly accurate on the war in Iraq thus far.With that, the following will not be so much as a review of the book, but to refute statements written in an earlier review by Robert D. Steele.Mr. Steele begins by stating the authors' &quot;(assessment) is a one-track discourse on why we need to use our heavy metal military to wipe out Syria and Iran..&quot; In the book I read, the statement is false. In strategies against Iran, the authors' begin by imposing sanctions against corporations doing business with Iran's oil industry. Followed by approaching the UN to draft an economic embargo on Iran until its nuclear program is dismantled. If the UN route failed, forming a coalition with allies to impose the embargo would be tried. Next, if Iran continues to harbor terrorist organizations, airstrikes would be made upon &quot;terrorist sanctuaries&quot; in Iran. This doesn't sound like wiping out the country to me, Mr Steele.With Syria, they propose an ultimatum to their president. If they didn't comply, air/seastrikes would be made upon terrorist training camps and storage facilities. Afterwards, if Syria would still not comply, only then would they see a Saddam-like toppling. Again, this doesn't sound like wiping out the country.Mr. Steele writes &quot;It avoids discussing Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Central Asia, Muslim Africa, and Muslim Pacifica&quot;. On pages 82-85 I see a whole diplomatic strategy on dealing with Saudi Arabia. Indonesia, Africa, and Asia are mentioned in the book, but there are no strategies for them.Mr. Steele writes &quot;The book ends on two false notes.&quot; These notes may or may not be true. The above statement is simply his opinion, which can be debated among qualified strategists.As the review winds up, Mr. Steele takes pot shots at the authors and to Fox News Channel viewers(?) He goes on to write about the 13 pages of photos in &quot;air-conditioned&quot; settings. There are only 10 pages of photos, and I see the authors are outside in 5 photos of the 17 photos. Additionally, 6 more photos were taken absent of &quot;air-conditioned&quot; settings(3 of the photos may or may not have been taken from inside a car).Also notable, Mr. Steele does not mention Afghanistan or North Korea in his review. He also equates Iraq to the ignorance and arrogance seen in Vietnam-- another debatable item.Mr. Steele obviously has a bias against the authors, their philosophies, and/or Fox News. I'd take his one star rating for this book with a grain of salt.To end, Mr. Steele, without thought you are unable to form opinion. Don't confuse opinion with fact."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"My copy of the book ENDGAME arrived today, April 5th, 2004 as coalition forces in Iraq surround the city of Fallujah and a fortress-mosque at Kufa. While naysayer US politicians ply my negative thoughts and fears based on these events, Lt. General Thomas McInerney was on the FOX News network as he has been so many times since 9-11 to put the scene of conflict in perspective. And most importantly, McInerney, based on access to a plethora of inside information and reasoned analysis, calmly assured viewers of a successful outcome. He and Maj. General Paul Vallely remind us by this book of what our objective must be if we are to defeat terrorism.

I fear it is informed on precisely one point, the extremists' agenda. Particularly interesting is the appendix, with photographs of the author meeting key figures before the Iraqi war. One of these is Israeli Defense Minister Mofaz. There is another person in the room, whose face has been blurred for security.

The vast majority of us Americans dont share their ethnic or sectarian affiliations and must work to defeat their use of our blood and treasure at home and abroad.

The authors assert that by going after rogue states and the fundamentalist Islamic ideology, the US can defeat state-supported terrorism and the criminal minions who would love to carry this out. This book is straightforward, masculine, right-winged self-promoting tract (lots of pictures of the authors visiting the mid-East) which even entertains the possibility of nuking Tehran (or North Korea) in response to a hypothetical dirty bomb used by terrorists against the US.Whether or not you agree or disagree with the authors' scenario-mongering, you cannot fail to notice the lack of planning for what would come after a larger mid-East war and the authors' belief that somehow democracy would magically prevail wherever we wish it might. Why would not another gang of thugs replace a deposed gang of thugs? Exactly how would the US military prevent the spiral into chaos and warlordism in the mid-East? And how much would this cost? We have spent nearly $880 billion on Iraq and Afghanistan in four years. Is that wise?The authors are straightforward but not especially aware of the limits of power over thugs who could care less about democracy.

McNamaraEdited 23 August 2007 after a visit to the Middle East, and additional reflection on how Nations turn stupid. FOX News is, as we speak, leading a massive campaign to deceive Americans into thinking that we must attack Iran. Iran is Persian. They are running circles around us as our Army hollows out and our four carriers steam within range of Iranian Sunburn missiles. Adding two images and several hot links to books that make it quite clear that this book is by, of, and for idiots.Edited after over a year to reflect the deep impression that \\"Civilization and Its Enemies\\" by Lee Harris has made on me. Amazon does not allow edited reviews to increase the star level, so I will say that after Harris, I would raise this book to two stars with the following obervation: having the right instincts--wanting to go after Iran in particular, and Syria--does not justify lying to the public or failing to do your homework.Of the 3,000 or so volumes in my current library, I have only reviewed 950. I do not write negative reviews as a rule. This is my third exception to the latter rule. The most ignorant book was one on predicting revolution, the second most ignorant book was one on sources of conflict, and this is the third.The authors, who demonstrate how far one could get in the Cold War military without reading or thinking, call this a military assessment. It is not. It is a one-track discourse on why we need to use our heavy metal military to wipe out Syria and Iran and intimidate Libya and Pakistan. It avoids discussing Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Central Asia, Muslim Africa, and Muslim Pacifica. This is not analysis, this is flim-flam.By way of context in my specific criticism of this book, let me just note that the bibliography does not reflect any appreciation for strategy, e.g. Colin Gray's \\"Modern Strategy\\", or Col Dr. Max Manwaring and Ambassadors Corr and Dorff's \\"The Search for Security\\", or Willard Matthias \\"America's Strategic Blunders\\" or Adda Bozeman's \\"Strategic Intelligence & Statecraft\\" or Jonathan Schell's \\"Unconquerable World.\\" I looked in vain for any sign the authors might comprehend the strategic context in which their specific beliefs and recommendations can only be seen as ill-advised. For example, a reference to Shultz, Godson, and Quester (at least one of whom is a neo-conservative), \\"Security Studies for the 21st Century\\", or Robert McNamara and James Blight \\"Wilson's Ghost\\", or Dean Jeffrey Garten's \\"The Politics of Fortune\\", or Republican and conservative Clyde Prestowitz's \\"Rogue Nation\\", or Ambassador Mark Palmer's \\"Breaking the Real Axis of Evil\\". No cognizance of Kissinger, even.Never mind all those *democratic* thought leaders, like Senator David Boren et al (and including Bob Gates), \\"Preparing America's Foreign Policy for the 21st Century\\", or Joesph Nye on \\"The Paradox of American Power\\" or William Shawcross (a Brit) on \\"Deliver Us From Evil: Peacekeepers, Warlords and a World of Endless Conflict\\", or Paul Krugman's \\"The Great Unraveling.\\"I did not expect to find, but mention as a final setting of the stage for a very critical review, just a sampling of books relevant to getting the war on terror right: books like Chalmer's Johnson, \\"The Sorrors of Empire\\" or Derek Leebaert's \\"The Fifty Year Wound: The True Price of America's Cold War Victory\\" or Ziauddin Sardar and Merry Wyn Davies on \\"Why Do People Hate America\\" (which could be sub-titled, most relevantly for the authors under review, \\"and why doesn't America understand the real world\\"), or any of the last 100 non-fiction books on national security that I have reviewed here, generally to very favorable judgements by Amazon visitors.Finally, I contrast this book with Richard Clarke's book \\"Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror\\" which I recommend very highly. Clarke is real, these people are not.I finally figured it out. This is a puff piece of, by, and for FOX Cable News viewers.There are no footnotes in this book. It is a rambling opinion piece. Let us not confuse rank with brains, or opinions with thought. This is a double-spaced book that could probably be distilled to 30 pages of core reading, all summed up as \\"we're always right, no matter the cost.\\" This book also adopts the Richard Perle neoconservative game plan of using terrorism as a pretext to invade Syria and Iran. I assure each and every one of you, a universal draft is planned for after the election. Your sons and daughters will be sacrificed to the lack of strategic thinking that this book represents.The book ends on two false notes. Although the authors demonstrate a semblance of balance in calling for better public diplomacy and especially the restoration of the US Information Agency, they continue to emphasize money for guns and the early use of the military in expeditionary mode, rather that a truly transformative strategy that begins with understanding the full range of threats facing us (bacteria are more dangerous than terrorists), devising a strategy for dealing with those threats by using *all* of the instruments of national power, and then a balanced budget that achieves all of that without sacrificing the earning potential of future generations.Finally, we have thirteen pages of photographs where the authors proudly display their field trip photos, and what leaps out to the veteran's eye is that they were always in air-conditioned rooms and cars and never broke a sweat. As my good friend Robert Young Pelton likes to say (he is author of \\"The World's Most Dangerous Places\\"--you should all read it), these guys live and think in a bubble--they don't get into the gutter, they don't smell the shit, and they have no idea how close their fantasy world is to destruction from forces that are beyond their comprehension.Iraq, and the planned war on Syria and Iran, are indeed a recurrence of Vietnam in the sense that ignorance and arrogance among the elite in power, and apathy among the public and within Congress, are creating a most costly global quagmire that will shortly explode in Australia, Thailand, Central Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The authors have learned nothing from history nor from the many non-partisan American strategists and scholars available to advise them.I don't think this book is worth the purchase price, except as an example of the kinds of books, and kinds of people, that place loyalty to ideology above and apart from the public interest.The authors have one thing right: this is a battle of wills. They do not appear to realize that there are not enough guns on the planet to execute their strategy, and that legitimacy is an intangible value that was lost to America from 2001 to date. This book is a blueprint for a nuclear winter in which America self-immolates. An Israeli tactical nuclear attack on Iran will kick off the end of the American Empire, and that may well be the best thing that could happen, to awaken the somolent Republic. We must indict and impeach Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Rudy Gulliani, and we must indict and sentence to death Larry Silverstein for his role in the controlled demotion of the World Trade Center including WTC 7 which was not hit by anything, it was also brought down to destroy evidence and complete the highly profitable elimination of asbestor at the cost of thousands of NYC lives.

But it's clear here that in order to succeed, we have to win.It's also pretty clear that the best way to achieve this goal is by going after only our most embarassing clients first. So Saddam Hussein, while a total thug, was the easiest target, he being a third-rate dictator barely holding on. But because of the nasty things he did in the 80s, which were fine back then, we had to destroy him in 2003. So there's one.But the authors appear to be confused about some of our other clients, like Pakistan, or Saudi Arabia, for instance. While Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most autocratic regimes, where you can't even go to a movie, they're really nice guys because we make billions on black gold. No winning there, sorry guys.It's also nice to read Ollie North's intro, where he discusses how liberals screwed up and let this whole terror thing get out of control. Despite Ollie's own involvement in a massive terror operation, it's nice to know he's still around to point out the way to 'ultimate victory'.

The authors are military men who understand the region, its history, or work there, and have sound views of what is coming (and what is coming isn't going to go away by talking with eyes closed and fingers crossed).The authors see the problem in terms of eight countries and our dealing with them in a unified way rather than one at a time. Some are bigger problems than others, and the authors are clear about what should be done with each regime in each of the countries. Obviously, reality is never as simple as any plan, but in viewing them together it helps the reader make sense of the apparent confusion we are facing now.They also dismantle some of the notions about having massive force, or that Iraq distracted from Afghanistan, or that terror should be treated as a police action, and so forth. The last part deals with how we should be working on a nuclear Iran. It is all quite interesting even without believing that these two authors have solved the puzzle for everyone.

Overall the book is fairly interesting, and it's a quick read. The authors have some extraordinarily good analysis and describe things in a clear and intriguing manner. It's short and easy to understand, so it shouldn't take long to read it, and will definitely be worth it in the end."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"&quot;Endgame&quot; by McInerny and Vallely is a very important read which lays out the facts on all of the regimes that are players in the axis of terror. The writers suggest a variety of strategies for each and every member of that group, using everything from political pressure to possible military strategies. They also explain in detail why we are in this fight and the nature and goals of our enemy.Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"I believe these two generals are very insightful. Interestingly, we have even had recent denuciations of Islamist killing of civilians by Hezbollah and Hamas. That's a step in the right direction (I read it as please,Uncle Sam, don't come gunning for me.) Now, all they need do is show us by their actions they are out of the terror business. For example, turning in the weapons or showing us where they are hidden ie. which mosques and which tunnels, etc. and stop the suicide attacks.They may have gotten it wrong regarding Mr. Chalabi and the INC. This is a man I never trusted and the pristineness of the intel he presented at his INC Washington office seemed too good to be true. We shall see what else is learned about the two faces of Mr. Chalabi.Regarding the Iranians, Syrians and North Koreans, they are again on the mark. Beware, the double crossers, for example Mr. Gadaffi who apparently wants western petro dollars and to destabilize the Saudi regime by assasination if necessary.I certainly believe in the cockroach theory and it sure applies to Iraq. Al Zarquawi, his protectors (possibly Iranian Pasderan)and imported Islamist terror mongers certainly don't want democracy or anything resembling it in Iraq. Anyone who believes the surrounding Terror States of Iran and Syria, specifically, are not working feverishly to destabilize the country worries me.I hope some of our perennial Socratic doubters and nay sayers read this book as well. I know I have already lent out my copy to several people to read. Lets utilize this decisive plan and get the job done. Thank you, Generals M&amp;V."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Generals McInerney and Vallely articulate a clear vision of the global terrorism we currently face and present a well-crafted road map for America to defeat the threat. The authors bring decades of military and global security experiences to address a thorny problem - The War on Terror. They address the larger issue of the clash of cultures in a way everyone can understand. The lessons learned from September 11 are slowly fading from the memories of many of our elected officials. We, the people, have to hold their feet to the fire to pass effective legislation that enhances our national security. This author strongly recommends that all concerned Americans read this book."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"I recently heard Major - General Paul Vallely speak about the war on Terror, and the blueprint of the Endgame given in this book. I am writing this review in March 2005. He says that the United States has already in effect neutralized three of the major countries on the list of seven- terror states given in the book. Afghanistan, and Iraq no longer are terror- states, and Libya has owned up to its nuclear program and abandoned it. Syria and Iran are now at the top of the U.S. agenda. Only yesterday President Bush warned Syria to get out of Lebanon by May. Vallely is like President Bush encouraged by the present calls for democracy in Lebanon, in Egypt. He said perhaps a bit optimistically that Saudi Arabia has begun to change its educational system no longer allowing it to preach the anti- American and anti- Western hatred that brought forth Bin Laden plus.As a side note I would add that Valleley just returned from Falluja in Iraq where he witnessed close - up what he said is now the most terror- free city in that country. He commended the US Marines for their actions in rooting out the terror which had been perpetrated by Iraqis against their fellow Iraqis. I write this because one reviewer on Amazon had chided Valleley for talking about fields of battle he was not close to. Valleley as I understand it did two tours of duty in Vietnam.In any case the authors of this book believe that the US should hit at the state- supporters of Terror. They believe that it is a mistake to talk about a prolonged war upon Terror, and give a blueprint for decisive victory. They are not against diplomatic action and suggest that it must be tried fully .But if it should fail then the suggestion is that the US has the military means to defeat the terror- supporting states .Vallely cites surveys which say the US is very popular among the Iranian people a fact that the mullahs wish to suppress.Vallely's blueprint as I understand it was accurate in predicting swift US victories in Afghanistan and Iraq. And this he now thinks the US made a mistake by not setting up immediately a provisional government. His sense however is that while this may have cost the US nine months to a year the US is winning this war and on its way to victory.My own sense I am reluctant to say is a bit less optimistic. I am troubled at the thought of a Shiite superstate Iran- Iraq - Lebanon which becomes a dominant Mideast power. The Iranians are not about to give up their nuclear program. They have a China and Russian veto at the Security Council. They have oil money flowing in and support throughout the Islamic third and even European worlds.It seems to me that the Iranian question is the key to the whole war on Terror. Vallely believes that the US can in a matter of days without sending considerable ground - troops defeat Iran, and move it to regime change. It is not however at all clear at the price which would be paid for this especially by US's number one ally in the war against Terror , Israel.Vallely believes the Bush Administration now is on the right course, is more clear about its aims than during the first Bush Administration and is on its way to winning the war against Terror.I think that every human being on earth including those now imprisoned in the ' terror- supporting states' will breathe freer should the plan of the Endgame be successfully realized."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Like the part about also terrorist Gaddafi (Khadafi) of Libya quitting his nuclear bomb building project when he saw Saddam Hussein fall to US forces in 2003 and Gaddafi feared he (Gaddafi) may have have been taken down next. Book was revised in 2006"},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Endgame is a very well done review of America's challanges and opportunities in the post 9-11 era. McInerney and Vallely know thier stuff and pull no punches, no political correctness, just thier informed opinion of what has worked in the past and the direction America should go to defeat globel terrorism. It is a relatively short book, but like them or hate them, they will make you think and wish it was a longer book."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"This is a must read for anyone concerned about the war on terror. If you want an honest understanding of what is going on in Iraq. Both of these guys are retired generals. They were at the forefront before they retired and have kept abreast of the worldwide situation since. They have a clear understanding of what has happened in the middle east and what needs to happen."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"Retired military experts McInerney and Vallely reflect on strategy against terrorism. These two TV commentators have predicted several of conflicts with Web of Terror accurately and so this work on Endgame strategy is worth contemplation.They correctly purport continuing to take the offensive to them and any of their supporting cast of countries or allies that would aid and protect the ring of terrorist activities against our country.Correctly they deduce that the terrorists in the 80's and 90's saw our government as unwilling to challenge their attacks on American interests and even on our own soil with the First Twin Towers and the other overseas attacks, so they decided to step it up with 9/11.New government's continuing offensive threat to them both here and more importantly on foreign soil where they seek to operate out of is detailed here by these two excellent military strategists.I believe their frank and brunt summation that the Web of Terror does not want this offensive to continue is correct and should in itself be an enormous warning sign to Americans. But we have not only enemies outside but within as well, who seem to shy away from seeing this enemy and turn their crosshairs on what should be friendly targets.Especially impressed by their astute insight that the cultural image that much of our own elite media and academia projects to overseas is not what general American public is about or condones, but this only fuels Radical militants who are fueled by such immorals.This is fine work on dealing with terrorism which certainly has already gained enormous strides against terrorists, but needs to find more unity. This fine book should help aid more to realize taking the war to them is best strategy."},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"If you want to know what's going on in the Middle East, read this book.

A very special thank you to the authors for providing this type of insight. Are the decision makers listening?"},{"Title":"Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror","review":"The book was fairly thin and I got through it pretty quick (that may have also been do to the Iced Cafe Americano I was drinking).The book makes no mention of, nor does it acknowledge anything like 4GW. All of the commentary on US Forces is 3GW related. I didn't really find that part of the book interesting or useful. The suggestion that the Army Reserves and National Guard should be heavy forces (and not what I think: Military police, engineers, civil affairs, intel/counterintel, and logistics) is just one example.It did find several of the non-armed forces ideas interesting:* A new Five Freedoms as a global statement of values* reform of US Diplomatic efforts* Allow rapid appointment of vacant house seat in case of national emergency* Method for emergency succession of federal judges to Supreme Court vacancies in case of national emergency* Disperse Federal Agencies geographically across the US* Lay out specifically the rules and powers for Executive Branch to avoid confusion (and Lawfare opportunities, I think)* Special Terrorism CourtsI like the idea of Global Values/Aspiration statement like FDR's 4 Freedoms (of speech, from fear, from wants, of religion). The authors suggest the following Five Freedoms:1. Freedom of Education2. Freedom of Economy3. Freedom of Information4. Freedom of Person5. Freedom of GovernanceThis was the strongest idea in the book. I have been mulling over the need of the west and it allies and potential allies to have shared core values that they can rally around. FDR's Four Freedom just didn't seem to be quite right and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights is too lengthy to memorize. The author's Five Freedoms are short, get to the point, don't exclude allies and potential allies and work well as a meme.The other part of the book I liked was a the short section on Special Terrorist Courts (an idea I have blogged on before). Here are the highlights:* create special federal terrorist courts* Three judge panel that presides over the trial and acts as the jury* Special rules of procedure to protect witnesses and intelligence* provides security for judges and prosecutors* Another panel of judges picks the defense attorney(s) from a vetted pool (I am thinking a sort of Special Terrorism Courts Bar)Lastly, the book had a section on dealing with Iran. Here is the stated plan:1. Get a US Nuclear deterrence and shield in place - Regional Nuclear Umbrella2. Train a Free Iran Guerrilla Force3. Unleash US Air-power4. Coastal Navel/Marine Raids5. Raids from Iraq along the boarder6.

Luckily I purchased Under the Sea Wind, prior to sailing my small boat to an equally small atoll. This book gives the reader an appreciation and understanding of life around the sea. More importantly, it increased my situational awarenes to gleen some of the Ocean's less obvious life. Upon making landfall at Palmyra Atoll, I was more able to see the life occuring before me. This book would be of value to any cruising sailor, hiker, or motorhome wanderer. This book makes an excellent gift to the homebound and undermotivated friends. It is superbly written by one of the finest writers of this century and children love it's flowing pace of words. Perhaps the best advice is to read this fine work, next to that buy a copy for a friend."},{"Title":"Under the Sea Wind","review":"This is a very unusual nature book. Most nature books are based on first-hand experience and observations (e.g. see Henry David Thoreau, Edward Abbey, Robert Finch's books). While Rachel Carson certainly studied and observed the animals she describes in this book, she did not dive under the sea, thus a lot of the narrative is based on imagination (educated imagination, no doubt). The personification of the animals -- to give them human names and describe their feelings -- is also very unique in nature books. Nonetheless, these do not detract from the scientific accuracies of Carson's descriptions. As an literary book, these in fact make the book very much more readable. Reading it is like watching a Discovery channel documentary.I deduct one star not because of the book itself, but because of this Penguin edition. I believe there is another edition of the book with illustrations by Bob Hines, I think those illustrations are fantastic. This book contains the illustrations by Howard Frech, the same as the first edition. These illustrations are fine, but there are very few of them (I am not sure if the Penguin edition even includes all of the original Frech works). The edition with Bob Hines' illustrations are infinitely more fun to read, why did Penguin not use those? Actually, why not use both??"},{"Title":"Under the Sea Wind","review":"In this, her first book, pioneering environmentalist Rachel Carson takes specific types of animals and gives them enough personality and character to tell a story about them, as they go about a normal part of a day in their natural seaside habitat. Each of the chapters takes a look at a part of the land-meets-ocean ecosystem to depict wildlife interaction in a way that reflects actual settings and animal behavior.Written in a present tense, moment by moment style that is engaging, the prose seems effortless. Carson is undoubtedly an expert when it comes to the flora and fauna of the kinds of outer banks islands along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, and most of the readers who have vacationed anywhere from New Jersey to Florida will recognize many of the species she depicts. The narrative style allows Carson to inform as well as entertain her readers, with many fascinating facts about the birds, fish and other wildlife.I read this book while on one of the North Carolina islands, and found it fitting that the shore birds I enjoyed watching in flight or along the beach were portrayed in such detail. Yet, for me, there was a bit too much of \\"and the next moment, animal A ate animal B, and then at once, animal A was eaten by animal C\\". After the first three chapters of this sort of thing, I became a bit tired of the relentless repetition of the survival of the fittest approach Carson takes throughout the book.\\"Under the Sea Wind\\" received very good reviews in its first edition, but it sold poorly. After Carson's \\"The Sea Around Us\\" (1951) succeeded, \\"Under the Sea-Wind\\" was republished and gained a larger readership.Rachel Louise Carson was born near Springdale, Pennsylvania, on May 27, 1907 and lived until April 14, 1964. She was a marine biologist and nature writer, whose books were instrumental in advancing global environmental awareness. Her best known book is \\"Silent Spring\\"."},{"Title":"Under the Sea Wind","review":"I found this book to be a little different from the other ones I have read by Carson. She uses characters in a story setting that reflects actual natural history and animal behavior, making it an enjoyable read and not another dry marine biology book (pun not intended)."},{"Title":"Under the Sea Wind","review":"I had never heard of marine zoologist Rachel Carson. I bought her book 'On The Edge Of The Sea' in a 2nd hand bookshop in a bunch of other random Natural History because I liked the cover. After OTEOTS I read 'The Sea Around Us', and most recently 'Under the Sea Wind', the subject of this review.As with both her other books, Ms Carson's intelligence and heart leave glittering wakes through this overview of mid-twentieth century research on the sea, particularly its animal life. This is such a juicy book. Each creature she gives us, from whale to worm, is treated with a personal glee that endears them to us. She makes small stories of each of their singular lives. I now care personally about annelid worms. Who knew?Drawing back from the individual she then illuminates the ways in which each life is dependent on the whole, and the whole on each life. She writes like an angel about the world of the mundane; simply, in gorgeously structured, shiny prose and all the while informed by her own massive research. Her love for her subjects leads the way, and refreshes itself at every turn. Her sense of detail is immersive, and her sensibility of the marvel of forms is catching.There is something other than her brilliance that struck me about the above three books. Because Rachel Carson was writing in the years just before the spread of environmentalism, they are touchingly non-political in tone; no warnings, no fretting. They were followed by her last book, the enormously influential 'Silent Spring', a warning text that documents the ways in which the sea was suffering from human activity. Her love for the sea and its shores, so beautifully written in her first three books, is transformed into political awareness and activism. It's a good and lovely thing to witness. This author died in 1964 so we only have four books to fall in love with. Shame."},{"Title":"Under the Sea Wind","review":"The pictures in my mind as I read about life beneath the oceans and bays and following fishes from egg to adulthood and beyond are fascinating.

There's no more vastly experienced political journalist than Helen Thomas. Nobody else can touch her for duration at the White House and for personal, if not always flattering, attention from eight presidents. I agree with the poster who said that in places the writing in this book is not as tight as it could be, but it didn't matter to me -- the subject matter is as fascinating as can be, and I read the book cover to cover with great enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I started this book with high hopes. I, like millions of Americans, have watched Ms. Thomas render presidents speechless with her laser guided questions. That is why I am at a complete loss to explain why this book is so poorly organized, disjointed and, in some cases, factually sloppy.I noted at least a half dozen instances where the same anecdote was repeated again later in the book. At other times, she is describing something Reagan did, then slips into a story on LBJ. This would be fine if the transitions between these thoughts were not so sloppy.There did not seem to be any thought about breaking the chapters into smaller pieces on a given subject and then sticking with the subject. At times I got the feeling that I was reading Ms. Thomas' stream of consciousness thoughts rather than a puportedly edited memoir.One example of a factual error was when Ms. Thomas described that &quot;Congress voted 98-0&quot; on something or other. That wasn't &quot;Congress&quot; voting, it was obviously the Senate. Any good reporter would make this distinction in a newspaper article. How could Ms. Thomas or her editor miss something as simple as this?In addition to these weaknesses, I thought the book was less than insightful. I would have thought that Ms. Thomas could bring more color and personality to the Presidents that she has covered. Late in the book, her descriptions of the eight presidents she covered read like a dry history book. I can find these facts anywhere. I wanted to know the stories behind the stories.Perhaps the problems with this book could have been mitigated by an editor bringing some structure to the book. Unfortunately, the good anecdotes and stories got lost in the confusion and repetition."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Only a reader from Palmdale CA could so deeply miss the point of Ms. Thomas' Memoirs! Ms. Thomas is and will continue to be an inspiration from all aspiring writers. It is her grace and charm that allows her to skewer presidents with her questions, and still have the m celebrate her birthdays. Her book is insightful and educational, and one of the best books on politics from the inside looking out that I have ever read. Since it is her memoirs, I think she should be allowed and encouraged to blow her own horn. She's earned the right."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"This book lets you vicariously live the life of a reporter!

For example,on page 228 when she talks about Roosevelt and the entry into World War2, she sites the date of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as Dec.7, 1940 and that the President addressed the nation on that date. I believe that the &quot;Day of Infamy&quot; speech was delivered on Dec. 8, 1941.For a review of history over the past forty years, I feel the book should have been better edited."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Wonderful to read this chronicle of the life and times of Presidents and how they deal with the White House Press. Great sense of continuity of the office and challenges across several different presidential styles and terms.

Her writing style is informative and warm. Had quite a number of laughs and new understandings during the reading. Great Book! Well Done!! Read every word, raced through it! Must reread."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"The subject of Ms. Thomas' book, her decades at the White House, assures that this book will be interesting. I was, however, disappointed at the lack of organization; the book reads like a conversation with a person who keeps remembering things to throw in and that can be inordinately distracting. There are also a number of factual errors in the book, which I would have thought a careful editor would have found and corrected. I have read a great many books written by reporters (Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, David Brinkley, Lesley Stahl, Sam Donaldson, Charles Kuralt) and this was the only time I found myself distracted by the lack of organization of the writing. In the end, I found the book interesting, but not well-written."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I respect Helen Thomas for her fearlessness, tenacity, and the fact that she broke so much ground as a woman in the WH Press Corp. However, as other reviewers have noted, this book didn't have the bite of her questions at a press conference.I'm glad I read this book - parts were very interesting. Her insights into individual Presidents and First Ladies, the way they viewed the press, and the insidious transition from communications to spin and handling. She also takes the press to task for buying into this.The book is kinda wonky, and if you aren't a press junky, it wouldn't mean much. I didn't know there was so much to know about Air Force One - and even after reading it, was numb.Reading this book made me think that I had Helen Thomas at a loooong Saturday afternoon brunch, and she had begun holding forth. Fascinating premise. But after a while, you'd want a break - take a walk, see if they brought out more shrimp, maybe check the Blackberry. After a while (or maybe 30 pages), it would be irresistable to go back and see what she was saying now. You'd be rivited for a while, then your eyes would start to glaze over, and it's time to see if they have FINALLY brought out more shrimp. After everyone has had three glasses of wine, you're in a mellower mood to listen, and she's in a crazier mood to talk, so it all works out just fine."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"As a big fan of Helen Thomas, I could hardly wait for this book to be published. My only regret is that she left so many telling details out. Of course, if she had included all that she had learned while covering eight presidents, the book would have been to heavy to even pick up. I loved this book and it should be required reading in every college communications course in this country."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Helen Thomas often sounds like a curmudgeon which can probably be excused as it is probably a prerequisite for being a journalist. However, her account and opinions about the characters and events at the White House, her opinions about her compatriots in the media, and her perspective of the last seven administrations from the front row make for a terrific read."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I wanted to give this book at 5 star rating but the first two thirds of the book are written too much in the style of a quick note taking journalist and I found the writing needing of more narrative. The ' I was there and they thought I was a female tiger amongst men' message over and over again gets tired after a while. The photos of the author with the presidents are ok but Ms. Thomas should have included those moments in history that she was a part of, Nixon's resignation, Clinton intern scandal, Reagan--Iran-Contra, etc. Ms. Thomas' final third of the book is excellent. The writing changes. She elaborates and the book excels."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I have always assumed that this author would write a book that was full of nasty one liners and little back biting comments. I got that impress just because I have always felt her questions were very brash and aggressive (not that I have any problem with that). It turns out that the book had none of this aggressiveness. As a matter of fact I thought she went easy on all of the Presidents and First Ladies that she covered. The book started out with a rather dull, at least for me, run down of her life up to covering the White House. I was only interested in the White House coverage so this Bio bit of the book was mostly skipped by me.The author laid out her recollections in a nice way. She first covered all the major events within each administration in chronological order. She then did the same for the Press Secretaries, First Ladies and then the Presidents. All of it was interesting with a good number of details about the individual people involved. She had a lot of stories to tell and they filled the book up nicely. Again my only complaint was that it seemed to me that she pulled some of her punches. She really did not give Nixon a lot of trouble for Watergate nor Reagan for Iran-Contra. I thought she was toughest on Clinton, but that could be due to my own likes and dislikes of the Presidents in question. Overall I liked the book and found it easy to read and full of new facts."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"What an interesting lady she is..I really enjoyed this book.

She was a trailblazer who broke, actually shattered, gender-boundaries by reporting national news from the top level of US government. Thomas deftly describes her life as a White House correspondent in her book, Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times.The book's title derives it name from the fact that she traditionally had a front seat at the White House Press Conferences and was accorded the privilege of asking the first question (although she was moved to the back row during the Bush administration due to their difficult and cantankerous relationship). She is also known for her final salutation, \\"Thank you, Mr. President\\" an honor reserved for her to say at the culmination of each press conference.The book, published in May, 2000, is a bird's eye view of what it's like to be a ruthless journalist and an insider White House correspondent. Thomas began her career in the White House press corps in 1961, and has enjoyed the unparalleled vantage point to closely observe eight presidential administrations (she covered every president from the Eisenhower administration to the second year of the Obama administration, however, the book concludes with the Clinton administration). The memoir includes hundreds of entertaining tidbits, insider antidotes, intelligent observations and surprising revelations about presidents, first ladies and general political and personal hoopla.This is also a story about the struggle for women to be taken seriously as journalists in Washington DC, and Thomas' role as a real leader and crusading ground-breaker. She was the first female officer of the National Press Club and the first woman member (and subsequent president) of the White House Correspondents' Association. Thomas also opened doors for women by becoming the first female member of the prestigious Gridiron Club and Foundation; an elite Washington DC journalism organization that previously had not accepted female members. In 1972, she was the only female journalist to go on President Nixon's historic trip to China. Her contributions are both inspiring and impressive and transformed the landscape of political reporting for women journalists.The book's chapters are sometimes long and occasionally her narrative is rambling. However, Thomas' life is riveting; her coterie of acquaintances and friends staggering, and her story is amazing. She begins life as a child of immigrant parents (who arrived at Ellis Island neither able to read or write) and later infiltrates the top echelons of American power as one of the world's most respected journalists. As a result, it is not only a tale worth telling but one definitely worth reading.Beth Walz, AdventureWoman.com"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Helen Thomas is beautiful in every way. Her writing ability is incredible, her life in the front row at the White House was brilliant. Her honesty, brilliance and passion is to be valued and respected by everybody. An amazing read, you won't share this book even with your best friend, just in case you never get it back. It's a book that you can read over and over again and still learn more. Thanks Helen, hopefully people are inspired to follow their dreams as you have done. Thanks Amazon, I couldn't get it here in Australia, you came through for me again."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I liked doing business with them. The book came in very good packaging. I plan on doing more business with them in the future. Keep up the good work!!!"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"If you've ever wondered about the woman who for years asked the first question at presidential news conferences and also ended each one, then this memoir will be entertaining. Thomas had a long career and got to know every president since JFK pretty well, or so you'd think from this book which is chock full of interesting anecdotes and opinions. It is a bit repetitious and would have benefited mightily from tighter editing. One wonders if the publisher was a little too reverential to use the red pencil. Somewhere along the line, UPI, her employer, lost a lot of its power and impact, due to business turmoil. Still, Thomas soldiered on. She doesn't say much about UPI in the memoir, probably because she's still working, though for Hearst. If you follow the journalism biz, you'll want to read this one."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"The book is a true reflection of who Helen is and her commitment to the ideals and responsibility of being a \\"reporter\\". Whether or not you agree with Helen's political views; it is hard to argue with her views regardig the responsibility of the press corps."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Reading Helen's book is like sitting across the table from her at dinner and having a long conversation. One can hear her speak each word. That conversational quality is most attractive and quickly draws any reader inside.What makes the most significant impact is Helen's passion for accountability from an elected president. She clearly speaks for a free press and champions an aggressive news media as defense against tyranny. We Americans need to be grateful for the shouts, the questions, and the persistence of the news media."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Helen Thomas was intimidated by Franklin Roosevelt. But, eventually, she became well known for asking John Kennedy tough questions about women's issues. He often laughed at her queries, and I guess we now know why. My favorite quote from Thomas was about Ronald Reagan: \\"That man should never have gotten into the White House.\\""},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I was disappointed that Helen Thomas managed to pen no less than 3 times in her book that former deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster had committed &quot;suicide.&quot; Last October I had dinner with Helen Thomas at the National Press Club and handed her a copy of the addendum that was attached by the court to Ken Starr's report on Foster. The addendum was submitted by Patrick Knowlton the harassed and intimidated witness who is suing FBI agents and others for violating his civil rights. Helen Thomas remarked at the time, &quot;this should be reported to the public.&quot; To this date not one member of the American press, including Helen Thomas has told the truth about the death of Vincent Foster and Patrick Knowlton's story is noticeably absent from her book.It would appear to sit in the front row at the White House as long as Helen Thomas you have to keep your mouth shut. This what we call award winning journalism? Her book was very disappointing to me."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but was sadly very disappointed. Helen Thomas takes great pains not to rock the boat. She is in a position to make intelligent insider analysises, but she chooses instead to sit on the fence. She seems tickled pink that various presidents noticed her! And her birthday!!!! Sheesh!"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Just because she's been around awhile and was the FIRST woman to blah, blah, etc, don't assume she has any credibility. To be outspoken for the sake of being outspoken doesn't hold any weight with me. She epitomizes the liberal press and her reporting is unfairly selective. If you're going to do something - like reporting the news - for heavens sake, do it right!"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Empty rhetoric helps to empty your mind and bowels while you're in the bathroom.

Price , in this case, should be lowered though."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"On page 139, Ms. Thomas chides former President Johnson for giving the Pop a &quot;twelve-inch bust of himself&quot; when the Pope gave Johnson &quot;a fourteenth-century painting.&quot; I was looking for a fourteenth century painting in this book, but all I got was a twelve-inch bust of a self-absorbed (self-described) journalist. The Beltway has consumed another media-type. Save your money on this one."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I never really enjoyed her work and this did nothing to change my opinion. Just another annoying liberal with a mediocre book."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"As the first (and perhaps last) woman to &quot;beat up&quot; no fewer than eight US presidents in succession - figuratively speaking, of course -Helen Thomas certainly could not be accused of pulling any punches. Her book gives us a fascinating insight into the relationship between the elite White House press corps and the President, which comes across as rather like that between prison guard and prisoner: a certain affection develops, but at the end of the day it's still very much adversarial. Helen Thomas comes across as someone with very strong values of truth, honesty and public service, who has not shied away from asking the awkward questions of errant Presidents over many years. Indeed, you might even get the impression she enjoys being perceived as unrelenting and at times blunt in her attempts to present the truth to the public. Her book is a little disjointed in the early chapters, but soon settles into a (perhaps better-edited) chronological pattern, giving excellent insight into the Presidents, their wives, and the various White House staffers whose job it is to manage the news, but who rarely - if ever - manage to control people like Helen Thomas. This book is an excellent read, not too self-centred, but creating a strong impression of a dedicated reporter with a determination to get to the heart of the truth."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"The hours that I spent reading Helen Thomas' book have been a joy. If Helen has been re-reading her book, she must have filled in many more stories that have not been told. What a life Helen has had! As I was reading the book, I felt like going into the press room doing the routine of a White House correspondent every day and I could imagine the closeness that the correspondents had with the Presidents in the early years. &quot;Don't lie&quot; - her advice to any President. I hope journalists of today would follow her example of trying to be factual and objective, a quality that has been lost in the quest for circulation. The book has aroused my interest in the life of White House correspondents so much so that I have made a lot of efforts trying to track down &quot;Thank You, Mr President&quot; written in 1946 by Helen's colleague Merriman Smith. I have just started reading &quot;some of the things that were overlooked in the big news of the day&quot; as told by Smitty."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"The book began very slowly and I found the author repeating herself. I was hoping with each new chapter that somehow she would begin to discuss each president one at a time and not constantly jump between them from one paragraph to another. When Ms. Thomas finally did start recounting each First Lady from the past to the present and then continued in the next chapter recounting her stories of each President I was unable to put the book down. At that point I began to enjoy her writing and to gain a new insight through her most exciting career working for the press and spending so much time at the White House.In the end I found it to be a wonderful book well worth reading."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I believe it is near impossible to read this fascinating book and not come away with a tremendous admiration for Helen Thomas. Approaching 80 years young, Thomas continues to cover the White House as Dean of the White House Press Corps, and Chief White House Correspondent for United Press International (UPI). Thomas has covered the White House since the early days of the Kennedy administration. She has been daily witness to history in the making through her daily presence at the White House, or on travels with the President of the United States.Over the terms of eight U.S. Presidents, Thomas has clearly proven herself to be a fair, credible, and objective representative of the news media. Although \\"news\\" has increasingly become a cut-throat, opportunistic, money grubbing industry, Helen Thomas seems to have maintained perspective. She seems to be a principled, fair, yet uncompromising human being in an arena that is generally more interested in \\"scoops,\\" \\"ratings\\" and \\"sensationalism.\\" In her faithfulness to the finest tenets of her vocation, Thomas works hard to report \\"without a personal spin.\\" While she has reported everything from the most boring and mundane -- to some of the most critical events in history -- Thomas appears to have done so in all fairness and with a minimum of personal bias. Titled in reference to the front row seat she occupies at the White House during press briefings, Thomas, despite often unflattering reports; albeit fairly represented, appears to have earned the respect of almost every President she has ever covered. In this retrospective, she is able to acknowledge her own flaws and limitations. As a woman who has earned the esteem she has, Helen somehow has remained at heart, a fair and humble reporter. \\"What you see is who she is\\" to turn a phrase. Yet, it is equally important to note that Thomas' objectivity and fairmindedness has never made her a soft reporter or a pushover. Thomas is indeed a feisty, hardworking, often impatient and intolerant human being. She is not satisfied with lies and attempts to obfuscate the truth. She can quite obviously be annoyingly in her singleminded quest for the the bottom line of a story. In addition, Thomas possesses an innate nose for anything less than full disclosure. She will pursue a story until she has a true read on it -- without a thought to whose nose she may put out of joint in the process.In \\"Front Row\\", Thomas puts aside her usual objectivity and shares many of her long held personal views of the men who have occupied the Office of the President of the United States, their spouses and the staff who have surrounded them. Her account is a fascinating portrait of the strengths and weaknesses of each administration she has witnessed. I indeed hope that some of those whom Thomas has mentored -- directly or indirectly -- have taken her lessons to heart and brought their learnings into their work. In an era when the news media is often -- justifiably -- under attack, it would serve the entire industry well to read Thomas' book and to study her career more closely. If there were more reporters practicing their calling with the level of integrity which Thomas has consistently demonstrated, the American people would have far more faith in the the news media. I hope Helen Thomas carries on, and that her colleagues and the Presidents she reports on, learn a few more lessons from her. An outstanding read!James J. MaloneySaint Paul, Minnesota USA"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Written by a professional,told like a story teller on the front porch somewhere in a small town.

I read it in less than two days.This will make a valuable addition to any political buff's library."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I never noticed Thomas much until I saw her bit on Steven Colbert's famous slap in Bush's face at the White House Pres Corps dinner. I started reading more about her and listened to her on many different shows. I respect her a great deal, so was very interested in this book.Much of it is about her. Too much really. There is also way too much name dropping as well as anecdotes about her and her cronnies that were frankly rather boring. She aslo is rather contradictory. She prides herself on her journalistic integrity but doesn't understand why someone like Lady Bird would have been furious over her leaks about her daughters. She makes a big deal of her front row seat and on the many compliments and accolades that the various presidents bestowed on her. Such things got in the way of what really was an excellent look at the administrations that she worked with.However, it was in her chapters on Marha Mitchell, and the first ladies, that really make this book a gem. The former esp - we were always told by the administration that she was insane. She wasn't - she was speaking the truth about watergate, and no one wanted to listen. And for the most part does a good job outlining each administration's successes and faults.However, She was also far from being unbiased. Kennedy was the only democratic president who she had good things to say about. To hear her talk, Clinton's lies were much worse than Watergate or Contragate. She pretty much gave Nixon and Reagan a free pass, but spent pages ranting about Clinton. I don't expect someone working so long to not have opinions but for heavens sake try to put things into perspective.Since this book was written just at the end of Clinton's term, and since I know that her opinion of Bush Jr is less than stellar, I'd be interested in reading her more current book which talks about his administration. I wonder if she now sees Clinton with perhaps less myopic eyes?"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Helen Thomas tells her story of nearly 40 years at the White House with a great balance of history, personal experiences, and humor.Ms. Thomas is a fine writer who keeps the reader engaged in wanting to learn more about the office of the presidency from a behind the scenes view, the role of the media, the presidents' family life, and Ms. Thomas' own experience in becoming a Washington institution. It has altered how I view certain presidents, especially LBJ. I have also gained a new perspective on the media's role as a check and balance on our government (well, at least the responsible journalists).I was surprised at how quickly I finished the book. Well done!!"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"As I read this book I felt that Ms. Thomas was sitting in an easy chair across the room from me telling me an interesting story of her life covering the White House. The book gives an indepth, behind the scenes, view of covering the the White House, presidents, first ladies and families. Ms. Thomas explains many of the feelings and emotions that were not necessarily the stories but went along with the events. This is a very enjoyable book to read. I felt as though Ms. Thomas made me part of those exciting times."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"It's one thing to be a history buff and read about events of our country and the world. It's another to live it. Thomas has been an active part of almost every major historical event our country has seen for decades. It's a life the rest of us could only dream about. I thank her for giving me the opportunity to read about the behind the scenes events that have made up our history. The writing is very newspaper-like ie short and to the point. It's perfect for the busy adult who wants to pick it up for short spans."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"It's amazing that Helen Thomas should know every President from Kennedy through Clinton and that there is still so much to tell about them -- things we hadn't known or see in a new light through her account. It also is the story of one woman's integrity and constant determination to learn the truth. You wind up wishing there were hundreds more like her in the press and government."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Helen Thomas shots from the hip, and holds back no punches when it comes to evaluating the presidents she's covered."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"This book was a great read! As a long time UPI correspondent on the political stage, Helen Thomas has some stories to tell and she tells them well, in a positive and upbeat way. Yes, there was some 'jumping around' in the book - the events and antedotes Helen Thomas describes aren't written up in strict chronological order - but she can certainly turn an apt phrase and does so often in this book. I thought she portrayed the events and people in her life in a mature, insightful and entertaining way, without petty or grumbling judgements. She's upfront and proud of being a hard-eyed reporter out to get the facts - but notes in her book that quite a few of those individuals who fall under her scrutiny don't hold it against her. After reading this book, you'll know why."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"One would think that after having been a reporter for decades, Ms. Thomas would be able to write. One would be wrong. She apparently doesn't know what the word &quot;ironically&quot; means, nor the word &quot;quipped.&quot; She repeats ancedotes several times, even ones that weren't that great to begin with. She quotes presidents and first ladies complaining about the press, without seeming to realize that their arguments are often much stronger than her lame &quot;freedom of the press&quot; argument. Does the public REALLY need to know about Caroline Kennedy''s dead hamster? Does it REALLY matter what reporter called in a story seconds earlier than a competitor? And do we REALLY need to know about every award she ever won, every compliment she was ever paid? This book might have been much better if Ms. Thomas had retired first, and thought about her life's work with some perspective."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I found this disappointing, having hoped for genuine insight into the role and experience of the press and the White House. Instead it is crammed with random and often pointless anecdotes, in which the author's purpose seems more to assure the reader that her colleagues and those she covered valued her and paid attention to her. She portrays herself as a tough questionner, but this book can only make one wonder how effective a journalist she really was."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"I'm a fan of the tv show \\"The West Wing\\" and started reading this book to find out what the press corps is really like. This book has made me feel like I was there and gives the reader a 'backstage pass' to find out who the people who have been in the White House really are.She also gives some 'behind the scenes' information and her takes on the men who have filled the oval office since her time. Thomas also talks about how the press corps WAS before it was modernized.Even if you don't like her personally, this book is just so interesting to read."},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Reading this book is like living history through a legend's eyes!"},{"Title":"Front Row at the White House: My Life and Times","review":"Reading Helen's book is like sitting across the table from her at dinner and having a long conversation.

I won't go into too much detail of the stories that make up Twice-Told Tales (I'm saving that for the Library of America edition), but I want to take a minute to talk about this Reader's Digest Edition. It only contains the 'Twice-Told Tales', but those are some of Hawthorne's best known stories: 'The Minister's Black Veil' and 'Dr. Heidegger's Experiment'. It's a well made volume with nine illustrations that aren't very well done. Really, you are better off getting the Library of America edition of Hawthorne's Tales and Sketches. It's more complete, better crafted, and doesn't have those horrid illustrations. What is interesting about this edition are two reviews contained. One by Poe and the other by Longfellow. Unfortunately they are here 'in an adapted form' which is a problem Reader's Digest seems to have. It's nice to have them here, but it would be nicer if they were in the original form. I give a five for the stories, but a 2 for the Reader's Digest edition. So I've settled on a three for this review."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"I would agree, this edition is pretty lackluster. Not only that, the stories are inconsistent. Some are extremely well done, especially the better-known stories;and the writing is great, but the symbolic devices, such as paintings and mirrors, are way over-used.This lends a repetitiveness to most of the stories. The gloomy tone, revealing the hidden darkness of man, pervades throughout. For someone of his talent, Hawthorne repeats himself. I think his novels are far better than his short stories. I would recommend Scarlet Letter and House Of Seven Gables instead."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"This Modern Library edition of Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales is one of the better I've seen in a long while. (A reveiewer below has mistakenly reviewed a Reader's Digest edition of the stories in this space. There are no illustrations in this book, and contrary to that reveiwer's estimation, the selection of stories here is very wise indeed.) Any good collection of Hawhtorne's stories should include the classics such as &quot;Wakefield, &quot;Dr. Heidegger's Experiment, &quot;The Maypole of Merrymount,&quot; and &quot;The Haunted Mind,&quot; as well as a few of the lesser known stories, of which there are many. This collection holds an excellent mix of both, with an amusing and insightful introduction by Rosemary Mahoney, and very informative notes by Gretchen Short. Hawthorne was, and remains, the American master of the dark, psychologically driven tale. I would challenge anyone to read, &quot;Wakefield,&quot; &quot;The Gentle Boy,&quot; or &quot;The Hollow of the Three Hills&quot; without feeling at least a little frightened and thrilled. These are among Hawthorne's best stories in a handsome new collection. I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"A minister dons a black veil over his face he takes to his grave. A man abandons his wife and family for a home across the street, from which he watches her fill in the hole he left in her life. A scientist develops an elixir of youth he tries out on three worn oldsters who immediately resume the vanities of their youth.Nathaniel Hawthorne was master of the allegory, and in \\"Twice-Told Tales,\\" 39 pieces written during the 1830s and collected originally in two volumes, you get the glory of his earliest, simplest fiction. Not the best, necessarily; the later \\"Mosses From An Old Manse\\" has perhaps his best short stories, and later came classic novels like \\"The Scarlet Letter\\" and \\"The Blithedale Romance.\\" But from his mock-humble preface to his transcendental yearnings to his obsession with New England's Puritan past, \\"Twice-Told Tales\\" offers a concentrated primer as to what made Natty tick.The allegory is a limited model for fiction; where a central object is understood to represent a single idea. Sometimes here you get a very obvious point hammered home with all the subtlety of a very special episode of \\"Facts Of Life.\\" \\"The Great Carbuncle\\" introduces us to a group of people who seek a valuable stone, and naturally all fall short of their desire except a couple who realize no stone can outshine their love. \\"The Gentle Boy\\" alerts us to the peril of intolerance, while \\"The Threefold Destiny\\" tells us there's no place like home. Sometimes Hawthorne concludes a story by repeating the title in capital letters, like Jonathan Edwards delivering a sermon.Yet Hawthorne was evolving all the while. For all his dated stylings and roundabout locution, you find yourself catching in these stories, as well as the many sketches and contemplative essays also in this book, a number of brilliant passages, moments of entertainment and of wisdom that reach across the sea of time, as when Hawthorne gazes at the Atlantic in \\"Foot-prints On The Sea-Shore\\" and notes \\"the infinite idea of eternity pervading his soul.\\"The best stories here show Hawthorne's deep mind at full boil, like the famous \\"The Minister's Black Veil,\\" where the Parson Hooper appears before his congregation wearing a black veil on his face he never takes off. The irony is that Hooper is the same gentle soul beneath the veil, yet the veil still serves to cut him off, in a small but marked way, from those around him. Is he at fault? Are they? Hawthorne moves beyond allegory here by not giving a definite answer.The same is true to a lesser extent with the two other tales referenced at the outset of this review, \\"Wakefield\\" and \\"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment.\\" But Hawthorne's greatness here is more in the broadness of his focus, as he draws inspiration in everything from a town pump to shopping with a child and makes each a diverting ramble. He even shows an ability to channel mystery and suspense a la Ed McBain in his amusing and slightly bawdy \\"Mr. Higginbotham's Catastrophe.\\"Hawthorne didn't produce that many books, but what he did write he filled to the brim. \\"Twice-Told Tales\\" is an early rill from the pump worth a visit; if you tough out some occasionally stale notes you may find yourself staying awhile."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"The Reunion ReaperAs an English teacher at the high school level I cannot understand why so many of my colleagues do not care for Mr. Hawthorne's work. I would think that when someone gives Mr. Hawthorne due opportunity they will see the beauty and preciseness of his work. If you have not had the opportunity to read short stories that symbolize so much more than what lay in the contents of each story, I encourage you to delve into Twice Told Tales. Here you will discover a variety of work that taps into so many cavities of your psyche, not to mention discovering the experiences of a man who was obviously driven by man's seemingly natural inclination toward guilt and sin. Yes, there is a darkness and sadness to much of his work, but it is not morose or macabre like Poe. With Hawthorne humanity is in many ways, stripped away and we see, like in the \\"Minister's Black Veil\\", that we all hide behind a veil."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"Read this book slowly, because there aren't that many of it's type.Yes, the stories are uneven. The first two are so rocky that you'd perhaps think you've made a mistake--that these are the first inchoate rumblings of an unpolished master.But by the time you read story #3, Ministers Veil, you won't regret the wonderful prose, the delightful use of symbolism and allegory, the economy of construction-- in short, all that which puts Hawthorne on a very short list of American master writers.The only thing you might consider over buying this book, is one which includes ALL of Hawthorne's short stories. Young Goodman Brown for example, or Rapuccini's Daughter--maybe two of the greatest short stories in Western Literature, are not going to be found in this particular compendium of his early work."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"Hawthorne wrote this collection of short stories anonymously in the 1830's, first published in local papers. At the urging of a friend he signed his name and raised the money to publish it as a book in two collected volumes, a copy of which was sent to former classmate and famous writer Henry Longfellow at Harvard. Longfellow gave it a favorable review and thus launched Hawthorne out of obscurity and on the path to well known works such as The House of Seven Gables and his masterpiece The Scarlet Letter.Overall the collection is a mixed bag, some are clearly dated while others have timeless appeal. There are a lot of stories and only a handful will I remember and/or want to re-read in the future so it was a bit of a chore to read through them all. Hawthorne was honing his style so some of the pieces are dead ends, while others echo some of his later better works.My favorite stories include \\"The Minister's Black Veil\\" about a 17th century New England puritan minister who vows never to look at the world except with a black veil over his eyes - the reason why is the mystery of the story and revealed to us at the end. \\"Wakefield\\" has a similar theme of mysterious behavior, a man decides to walk away from home without saying he was leaving and then return 10 years later - it is based on a true story and in fact there are modern accounts of similar things happening. \\"The Gentle Boy\\" beautifully captures 17th century religious fanaticism, intolerance and historical forces concerning the conflict between Puritans and Quakers in New England. This story is probably his most mature and serious of the book. \\"Mr. Higginbothem's Catastrophe\\", about a rumor of a man's murder, is a riddle wrapped in a story, I was perplexed and enthralled to the end. \\"David Swann\\", about a young man who falls asleep by the side of the road, is a philosophical story about the nature of fortune and fate. \\"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment\\", about a liquid that makes the old young again, presages Robert Louis Stevenson and more recent movies like \\"Cocoon\\"."},{"Title":"Twice Told Tales (Volume 1 ) (The Works Of Nathaniel Hawthorne (12 Volumes)","review":"Twice-Told Tales by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Published by MobileReference (mobi).In your face, obvious, and heavy-handedly allegorical, still Hawthorne manages to pique my interest and hammer home his point.

Some friend should have told Denver not to do this book.Denver wrote this autobiography in 1994 at age 50 - too close to a recent divorce and not yet moving on happily.Who would have thunk it? - John Denver writes that he did cocaine, marijuana and LSD. He was repeatedly unfaithful to his wife Annie. His personal life was usually a mess. His second wife Cassandra was a fame and money grubbing opportunist who turned his life into a temporary hell. By his own admission, Denver drank to the point that he lost his driver and pilot licenses over it.I have always loved John Denver's music and I still do but this book taints it all a bit and makes me sad. Too often Denver succumbed to various vices and failed to really enjoy his many God-given gifts and all that they brought him. He writes that he was constantly trying to find happiness. He turned to sharmans and gurus and such constantly struggling to find answers to his emptiness and problems.Save your money and your time and avoid this book.Enjoy Denver's music for all the good that was in the man. His final televised concert - THE WILDLIFE CONCERT taped in 1995 about 2 years before he died in a plane crash - is among his best performances ever. He and the band sounded great - he looked great and he looked happy. It was run on A&E; cable and it is available on VHS, DVD and CD. That is how I will choose to remember John Denver. He left us with a treasury of wonderful music."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"The book is remarkable in its honesty. I found I could really identify with John's early life, the way he saw the world as a child and as a young man. It was sad for me to see how his personal life fell apart under the immennse pressure of stardom, something perhaps none of us can go through without scars.All in all, I feel that I now have a deeper understanding of John's music and his career. We hope he is finally at peace."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"As a big fan of John Denver, I find it hard to fault a book about his life, his career, and his growth as a human being. I found John to be a good story-teller and many of the stories did not show him in his best light. I think this book is honest and straight-forward; John doesn't try to sugar-coat any of his actions. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys John Denver's music - there is a wealth of insight into his motivatin for writing many of his popular hits and lesser known works, also"},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I bought this book when it came out in '94. It does contain some very candid stories about his personal life. I do not blame John for not writing a \\"tell-all\\" book. He did a very difficult thing, which is to let outsiders know about some sensitive private matters. How many of the \\"dirt-diggers and dishers\\" would be comfortable with telling strangers about their extra-marital affairs, fits of temper, depression, and drug use? John could have avoided all of that and focused on more up-beat family and professional stories. I think that he left out the meaty details out of respect for himself and those affected by his mistakes.Unless you are interested in EST and New-Age philosophies, you will be uninterested by his personal beliefs. I think that he could have expounded on where he stands with those beliefs. It leaves you wondering because I have heard him refer to God, Jesus, and angels prior to this book and afterwards.It is an interesting read for JD fans and curious readers."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"This is THE BOOK by THE MAN himself ! It is one of the most honest, objective autobiographies I have ever read. I think the author was being too kind and too much of a gentleman about several of the people in his personal life who used him and hurt him and who to this very day continue to make fools of themselves by pretending to be an essential part of the John Denver Story and legacy when they so obviously are not and never have been and John Denver himself states this about these individuals in his book ! In spite of these people not because of them, this creative genius succeeded and gave the world everlasting beauty through his lyrics, music and his love, respect and compassion for humanity and the preservation of nature. This was a very special spirit and a very creative soul whose genius burst forth brightly from his loneliness, pain and suffering and whose star will shine eternally for all of creation. Read this book and listen to his music because no one knows this very special soul better than he himself and no one can express who and what he was all about better than this wonderful man himself ! Why waste time and money reading about what others think when you can get the truth from the man himself through his autobiography and his music !"},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"This is an excellent book in Denver's own words about his life. And as all of Denver's material, it is very honest and allows one a rather intimate portrait of him. After reading this book, one comes away feeling that one was fortunate enough to know Denver personally. A good overview into his life and career and tha backgrounds of some of his better songs are given as well as his passion about ending world hunger and other charitable projects that he gave so much of his time to. One caveat though: he does not prtray himself as a hero, like so many of his fans try to fashion him; he reveals himself not only as a decent man in many respects, but one who had no problems whatsoever with cheating on his wife with impunity nor using any convenient drug that came within reach, and he reveals only a very limited understanding of himself. But it aslo a picture of a man who was constantly struggling to overcome his shortcomings and who was making real strides in his life before he was killed just a few years later."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"Take Me Home delves deeply into John Denver's music, life and relationships with his family and friends. As John Denver the musician, he addresses where many of his songs were coming from and what was going on at the time. John, the man, however, opens himself up for all the world to see, exposing not only his triumphs, but his shortcomings, insecurities and pain as well. It was a pleasure following John's road of experience with him.

I bought my book when it first came out and was dissappointed that it didn't have more personal information. Recently I paid over four times as much for another copy just so that I could understand more accurately how he thought. Maturity has lead to an increased appreciation of the candor in this book.Until and if Annie chooses to write about her first husband there will be no better source for the history of this remarkable man.

But then it seemed to drag about halfway through when he began to dwell on his activism. Certainly world hunger and the environment are important issues, but I was more interested in reading about his music and his craft as a songwriter. Not that he doesn't talk about the music, he does, but far less than I'd hoped. The one thing I did like was that when he did talk about a song he included a full lyrical transcription. He just didn't do it enough.There's plenty in the book about his home life, his marriages, his world view and relationships with his parents which was insightful and interesting. He admits to being a very serious person, and that definitely comes through. I was a bit disheartened by reading the book though, as I realized that someone who could be so charming and witty on stage, seems almost humorless off.There were also certain events he made no mention of. I was interested in hearing why he turned down the role (which subsequently went to Richard Gere) he was offered in \\"An Officer and a Gentlemen.\\" Nothing. I couldn't wait to read about the senate hearings on censorship (with Dee Snyder) in the mid '80's. Nothing. Nothing about \\"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\\" and the World Series, and only brief mentions of the Muppets and the making of \\"Oh God!.\\"I recently finished \\"Walk this Way\\" the Aerosmith autobiography, a great book about musicians who were tortured souls. This book spent much more time on the tortured soul rather than the music. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"When I first heard about this book, I thought it would be about his music.

Unfortunatly, JD didn't show his &quot;weird&quot; funny side and sensationalists who don't actually read the whole thing focus on the Aspen Chainsaw Massacre story. He was a great inspiration for millions of people and not recognized properly in his own county.

How ironic that a man marketed as such an all American boy was anything but."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I love John Denver's music. I HATED this autobiography: partly because it destroyed the myth of John Denver [not the clean-cut, wife-loving, nature loving man his music and image portrays], and partly because it was sloppily written [I would have expected a lyricist to care more about words]. Why did he write it? I'm not sure, but it reads like \\"venting\\", someone who is very unhappy and repeatedly blames others for his unhappiness. As a result of his \\"searching\\", he is filled with vague, new-age psycho-babble. He justifies cheating on his second wife by saying \\"Sometimes you have to be true to yourself, rather than true to the other, in order to keep the relationship healthy.\\" huh? His shaman brings his spirit together, which had divided into 3 parts, one just before his brother was born -- is he really carrying that resentment around for 50 years??I think we [usually unconsciously] expect those with talents to touch our hearts to be better human beings than we are, and we are disappointed when we learn they are fallible.

While I thought him handsome at the time, I was sorry to hear that he cheated so flagrantly during his marriage to her. But John's autobiography comes across as more honest than pure, more innocent and self-disclosive than not. Annie failed to join him on the road, they struggled with infertility on his part, and the issues of stardom and very independent lifestyles ultimately tore them apart even after they had adopted two children, Zachary and Anna Kate.John in the meantime sought to understand his difficult father, a stern military man, and he tried to face down the exploitative forces that chase a celebrity. He had legal troubles and money troubles and troubles with a music world that increasingly in a rock-and-roll era did not embrace his \\"country folk\\" style. He tarnished his image publically by embracing drugs and getting busted for alcohol, yet he tried EST and other self-discovery tools to make gains. He embraced world hunger and the ecology of the planet as personal causes, veered into a film career (that included stints with the Muppets and George Burns and Jacques Cousteau), and took up the aviation that his dad was famous for. And better than any other author I have read, he explains what it is to be a musician and songwriter, speaking right from the heart.Yet he was destined for a second marriage, both sublime and disastrous. With Cassandra Delaney, an Australian singer, he was able to conceive his only biological child named Jesse Belle after he had medical treatment. His joy at being able to attend her delivery is not to be imagined, yet his relationship with her mother was unsupportable. According to John, \\"Before our short-lived marriage ended in divorce, she managed to make a fool of me from one end of the [Aspen] valley to the other.\\"The tragedy of this autobiography, written when John was just 50, is that he very personally takes you through all of his travails and you have a sense that he had begun to connect his own dots and even come into a modicum of happiness, maybe even a bit of wisdom. Yet then he died at 53, in a tragic air crash unbesmirched by pilot error, ending a life that he had hoped would be much longer. It is such a gift that his music--and in this book his story--lives on."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"After being a John Denver fan for almost four years, I have been to his live concert at Wolf Trap and have been on a store rage for all of his CD's. His autobiography has a great struc- ture, telling it like it is, not trying to make it sound like him being the best.

Still, I hope John Denver knows that people are still out there, caring for the enviroment and still listening to his songs."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"A great book if you want to fully understand the music and songs ofthis great artist.

Still has some interesting parts and I did learn a few things about him. Worth the read if you are a fan."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"As an avid John Denver fan because of his music and message, I felt obligated to read his autobiography. Although it's a darn shame this book isn't in print anymore, it lives on in libraries and survives via used book sellers here on amazon. It was well worth the wait to find a copy.John kicks it off telling a little about his parents, how they met, what they did for a living, and where they came from, which explains a lot about the way John looked at life, but I'll let him explain that in the book.John even tells the reader about the \\"gamble\\" he took when he dropped out of college to pursue a folk music lifestyle in California, which he really captures well through his unique writing. He writes about his early and lifelong mentors and about his own personal backlash against the music industry which was caused by a lack of trust in some of those guiding him. He does however, give immense praise to Milt Okun and Hal Thau, which is good to read.The reader will even learn about the simple approach John almost always took to his songwriting, and how he views some of his songs today. You get a nice view of the social unrest in the country at the time as he makes reference and talks about how the war in Vietnam, EST, and Macrobiotics made their way into his life. Later on, John talks about the Reagan years, changes in the music industry, and changes in his family.In all honesty, this is one of the most genuine and honest autobiographies I have ever read. He openly admits his flaws revolving around his family life but it's also very cool to see how optimistic he was towards the end of his life. The book itself is very solid, has some rare and touching pictures of John with others, and includes a Discography at the end of the book. I don't just reccomend this to John Denver fans, I recommend this book to anyone, even my age group (I'm in college), who wants to learn about the unique journey of this country through music, pop culture, family, and overall optimism.Maybe its just coincidence, but the final words of the final chapter in his book say a lot about how prophetic John Denver was in everything he did... he starts off with lyrics to a song he wrote....\\"And I lay in my bed and wonder,After all has been said and is done for,Why is it thus we are hereAnd so soon we are gone.\\"The final words then read,\\"I'm not home yet, but I'm getting there.\\"Well said John, and thanks for your great vision and outlook on life."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"John really opens up here. For an entertainer to be as candid about himself as he is here...and there's a lot to be read between the lines as well...is very unusual. The reader gets a glimpse of the &quot;back stage&quot; John Denver. For all his laid-backness, he was extremely tough on himself, his own worst enemy, forever with a monkey on his back that demanded success and respect despite the lack of support he got from those who were most important to him. Self critical yet so caring, indeed his life was structured around the pursuit of approval. He bares his soul, admits to personal inadequacies, showing the reader that besides being the voice for all of nature, he was just a human being as well...a person who stumbles from time to time while attempting to do what he thought was best.I listened to the audio book which is read by John while he sat on his deck at his home in Aspen. He prefaced his reading by warning the reader/listener that from time to time there might be the sound of a plane taking off from the nearby airport but that there would also be the sound of a stream and some windchimes hanging nearby. Indeed there are those sounds in the background. Together, with his voice it makes for a very intimate setting... just you and John, sitting on his deck, enjoying his story telling one more time in what probably was one of his favorite spots. A very nice feeling to be with John again."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"This book is a must-read for those who hunger to learn about the human side of a man who, in the 1970s, captured millions of hearts through soaring music that celebrated life, love, and nature. The story shines a revealing light on John Denver. It's most interesting that he's holding the flashlight himself. What he paints is a picture of an honest and earnest, sometimes sad, man who loved music, life, his children, the earth, and his fellow man. He doesn't whitewash problems he experienced, but the reader also learns of the great environmental and humanitarian works that went largely unnoticed during his lifetime. When you close the cover on the last page, you feel as though you know the man. Now, that's what makes a good autobiography!"},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I opened the book expecting to learn more about the heroic qualities of a man who had given us songs about peace, searching for truth, loving the earth, and loving each other. Naively, I wanted to see John Denver as a hero; someone who had passionately searched for answers and found some of life's important truths. His music, especially during his heyday in the 70's, led me to that expectation. Instead, I closed the book feeling cheated; like his music didn't really tell the whole story. His image of a squeaky clean country boy who thought that his wife (\\"Annie's Song\\") and the majesty of nature (\\"Sonshine on my Shoulder\\", \\"Rocky Mountain High\\", etc.) were the most \\"far out\\" blessings in life was in conflict with the very confused, lost soul who failed in many of his relationships and never really found his balance. He wanted to make the world a better place for children, yet he failed to recognize that this starts at home. By his own admission, he was hardly a model father and played a very small part in his own children's lives. His songs made us feel that love was the most important thing of all, yet he didn't really know how to love, constantly cheating on his wife and failing in two marriages and many other business and personal relationships. John Denver created beautiful, inspiring music. And he poured much of himself into causes like the environment which he felt were important. That is noble. But after reading the book, I was left with a greater sense of the tragedy of his life than of its glories."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"Anytime an individual takes the risk of putting so much of his personal life on paper for all to read, he is to be commended. Although I first came to admire John Denver in the early 70s for his music, it was his work later as a naturalist, environmentalist and advocate for children that will remain with me as well. After reading his book, I had a better understanding of the events in his life that may have lead him in this direction. A look at his video self-portrait will also help fans learn more about him and the thoughts behind some of his most popular hits."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"This enjoyable and candid autobiography by Denver is a good overall view of his life. I personally would have preferred it if he had emphasized his musical and film career a bit more, and he could have easily done so by cutting some rather tedious digressions such as diet and psychotherapy techniques. Oddly, he also had little to say about his second wife and the children he clearly viewed with affection. But still it's a good balance overall, and fun to read.In view of his squeaky-clean media image, some people find his flaws a shock, in particular his free use of marijuana and alcohol and his inner turmoil manifested in conflicts with wives and father. Yet the positive side of Denver prevailed through his inspiring music and social activism. His well-known efforts in environmental protection, ending world hunger, and promoting peace are amply detailed here. Upon finishing the book one knows John Denver well, and he seems a likable guy after all."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I remember the first time I heard John Denver sing in one of his TV specials when my son was still a baby, now 30 years ago. I was sure he would remain a major star. His obvious singing skill and message with heart were, and remain, a winning combination. Unlike many of his avid fans, somewhere along the line I lost track of what John was doing as the years went by. I was shocked at his early death, but unaware at the time at the enormity of his contributions on so many fronts.Recently I came across several songs of his I had never heard before. I was enthralled, touched and saddened that so much of his work had escaped my notice for so long. The songs seemed so haunting. My immersion in the scope of topics, and what the songs revealed about their originator, brought me to a mild state of shock. I found myself embarrassed and guilty not to have taken the full measure of fruits of his extraordinary efforts seriously before.Needing more information about the man, to flesh out true intent of many of his works and learn more about his dreams, I found only 1 autobiography in the entire Washington, DC library system. Subsequently I found there were only 7 in the Montgomery County, MD, system. I was sad and disappointed to find so little has been written about him....His autobiography reveals the huge amount of courage John brought to many of his efforts, and in revealing the less flattering facts and deeds of his own life. In many ways the words in the book are a fuller extension of what he has already given voice to in his songs.How is an artist made? Many strong feelings and experiences of childhood and adolescence can give rise to the need for artistic self expression, especially when other outlets are difficult. Beginning with his boyhood and family relationships, John talks about the feelings and events that lead to his own use of the guitar and songwriting as a means to self expression, finding friends and relationships, and making the contributions he was so driven to make.John discusses the development of his musical career, while trying to balance marriage and the many issues with which all adults must cope. He describes the fabric of his many victories, losses and frailties in both his personal and professional life without shrinking from unflattering facts. We are given a rare view into how an artist translates the complexity of his thoughts and feelings into a communication to which others can relate. Often the most poignant moments in John's life led to his strongest and most striking compositions.It is rare that anyone relates such a brutally honest examination of his life and his dreams as in this book. I now have a much deeper understanding and appreciation for John Denver the man, his music and the environmental causes to which he gave so much time, effort and financial support. It seems to me he may well have sacrificed a great deal to be able to give so much to the rest of us. In the end, it remains up to us that remain after him to carry on the work he so poetically outlined and gave his life to.What's missing? Like John's life, this autobiography ends too soon. I hope someone will write more details about what John was doing in the late '80s and '90s. We have few in the Baby Boomer generation who have contributed as much as John Denver, without the acknowledgment he should have had during his lifetime. Only five years older than me, his life begs the question of each of us, asking what have we contributed and what will live on after each of us?"},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"From 1978 on I was a fan of John Denver, not because he was hip, not because he was dazzling, but because he was genuine, honest, and straight-forward. What I loved about his music and what I loved about his live performances is it was not a show. It came from the heart. This autobiography is just like his performances, it hides nothing. It is difficult to name autobiographies that paint an ugly picture of their author. I think people misunderstand how this book was written as much for John as it was for us. There is a lesson to be learned here about what works and doesn't work in living life. I am thankful to John for sharing with me what doesn't work. I learned from reading this book. I played his songs when I came to chapters that the songs coincided with. For such beauty to be created in the midst of a normal, flawed, human life, &quot;it amazes me!&quot;Think about your life story, all the stuff you did you are proud of, and all the stuff you did you are ashamed of. If you could imagine allowing everyone in to read about it all, then maybe you can begin to appreciate what it took to write this book.

The best way we could remember this special normal everyday man, is to teach people who to respect the environment.Even though he has yet to get any respect in newspapers we shouldn't fight the useless fight to get him more respect.

Book was reasonably translated into the made for television movie, \\"The John Denver Story\\", and it was the film which led me to the book. Overall he comes across as a humble, sincere guy with a lot of talent and strong social/environmental convictions with a difficult relationship to a demanding dad which was eventually healed. Apparently a brother took some exception to the portrayal of the dad, I believe particularly in the film."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I have been looking for this book for over 10 years. I was overjoyed to find it at a great price. The book is in excellent condition just as the book store said it would be and it was delivered to me in a timely fashion. Thanks"},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"After attending a live concert and sitting close to the stage, I was impressed by the true *musicianship* of John Denver. This was important to me since my career is in music. I thought the book was interesting, the story of a man whose life was tragically cut much too short. We will miss his songs and their message."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"While I enjoyed John Denver's music, my opinion of him as a human being dropped dramatically after reading this book that he tries to use to make himself look good. He attempts to portray himself a sensitive hero while putting up walls about many of the most personal times of his life. Instead of gaining sympathy he instead will disappoint fans who don't share his liberal political perspective and his immoral lifestyle.The first 35 pages are devoted to the first 20 years of his life and he gives few details about himself. Coming from religious grandparents (evangelical and Mennonites on one side, Catholic on the other), his parents didn't really go to church. Instead they dropped John off at a Protestant church on Sunday morning so they could have sex back home. He quickly grew to hate religion and instead acquired a New Age spirituality that focused on the environment. He also says that as a teen he began to believe that communism was more \\"Christian\\" than what churches were teaching!?!He moves to L.A. at age 20 but apologizes in the book for not doing drugs or sleeping with women when young. Of his California girlfriend he writes, \\"It breaks my heart to think how puritanical I was with her.\\" Huh? He feels bad that he didn't bed her? The worst is when he gets a doctor to lie for him in order to avoid being drafted into the military for the Vietnam War. He should be ashamed of himself for even admitting to be a draft dodger.There are major early life events that he doesn't really discuss in detail. The family moved from state-to-state but he says little about locations where he lived. His favorite uncle died and Denver coldly reports it in just a single sentence. John's three years of college are summarized in one paragraph. His first two records in another single paragraph. While we're looking for behind-the-scenes details to songs and TV shows and concerts and family, there are few. He barely mentions his movies and only alludes to his TV specials in a sentence or two. Some of this may be because he claims to not remember details--like what parts of \\"Take Me Home Country Roads\\" he wrote! He says someone else started it but he wrote the bridge and \\"maybe\\" a second verse. How can a guy not recall what parts of a #1 song he wrote?Yet he devotes too many pages to the Mitchell Trio throughout the book, to praising immoral manager Jerry Weintraub and he spends more time on his accountant than on some of his famous recordings! As the book goes on he starts getting preachy and heavy-handed about his pet causes like environmentalism. And he spends way, way too many pages defending his involvement with the wacky EST movement.For a guy who claims to be a \\"love everyone\\" pacifist, he certainly shows a lot of anger and hatred toward those close to him. He starts cheating on his first wife almost immediately after they marry and blames her, saying she should have been on the road with him to meet his sexual needs! He puts down his brother, who went to serve in Vietnam. He also has negative words about various friends and relatives.Near the end of the book Denver starts to get crazy, talking about faith healing, meeting a swami at an ashram, claiming he almost committed suicide by jumping from a hotel window with his guitar, getting a girl 20 years younger pregnant, going to Russia to proclaim the wonders of communism and condemning Ronald Reagan for some of Denver's own problems! It's all nonsense and makes the reader wonder about the singer's mental state. In every case he defends himself and shifts any blame to others, while never appears to have a conscience except his claim that his morality involves bettering \\"the earth.\\" The guy should have started at home but he ignored his kids (who are barely mentioned here) and his wife (who he slams throughout the book).This memoir isn't particularly well written and its \\"voice\\" is really that of the co-author and not John Denver. It needed better editing to get rid of the constant repetition about certain subjects and the glaring errors (like claiming that his first TV appearance in 1970 \\"was at a relatively early stage in the development of television programming\\" even though the medium was over 20 years old!). It was written three years before his tragic airplane death, and now reading the early chapters of how his father was one of the great military airplane pilots makes how John died even more sad.Denver claimed spirituality but didn't want to follow any organized religion, called himself a \\"Midwestern conservative\\" but supported far-left liberal causes and was really from the South, didn't believe in morality or marital fidelity, thought being a draft dodger was a positive and perceived communism as a great way of practicing the gospel. If you agree with those things you'll enjoy the book. I, on the other hand, found him to be a pathetic person who was a bad role model off stage and not anywhere near as caring as he claimed to be."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"excellent. loved the book , loved the man. just wish there was more about his childhood. wish someone in his family.

BOOK WAS IN GREAT SHAPE WHEN RECEIVED IT, ALMOST LIKE NEW."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"I have, from the first, admired John Denver: His sensitivity to everything in this world and beyond, his often child-like enthusiasm that too many of us have lost, his autobiographical songs that reverberate in your soul and probably helped heal his heart. They did help heal mine.He and I were much alike. I too know about growing up under a strict, but basically fine, father, and the ache of being a sensitive soul. I know diamond and stone days. I too went to the Rockies in the summer of my 27th year, though a 6 day, 2600 mile trip sure didn't do them justice. I just hope John didn't have a migraine (an altitude headache) the first time he went there.But my title is very telling. He writes songs better than his life story. But the two skills are entirely different. The ability to match words with notes, in the rhythm of the music is a wondrous, magical skill, far beyond writing poetry or even prose, miracles in their own right.I'm thankful he wrote his autobiography but much more thankful he wrote all those songs of praise, \\"anger and warning\\"."},{"Title":"Take Me Home: An Autobiography","review":"If you are a fan of John Denver's music, this is the best CD that he ever made! The audio-book is read by John Denver. It is very interesting to hear John talk about how \\"Annie's Song\\" was created while riding on a chairlift; how Bill and Taffy Danoff worked together with John making \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\", and how his long estangement from his Father was finally bridged with flying lessons. John talks about life on the road and the problems that he and Annie could never settle. He doesn't make excuses for his divorce from Annie or the chainsaw incident at his home in Colorado. John Denver just tells it like it happened."},{"Title":"Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Understanding Children's Worlds)","review":"This clear, brief, and practical book is based on extensive research and outlines an intervention to prevent bullying. Dr. Olweus's work has become the standard approach to bullying prevention, reflected in such programs as the University of Colorado &quot;Blueprints for Violence Prevention&quot; project ... As a counselor and trainer specializing in bullying prevention, I find this book indispensable, and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Understanding Children's Worlds)","review":"I was elected to my local board of education and we recently received a credible complaint from a parent that harassment of her son was being overlooked by school administrators. Accordingly, I felt obliged to read up on the issue of bullying. This book sets forth both the problem and the recommended solutions. Prof. Olweus is Norwegian and his studies primarily involve Scandinavian schools. Accordingly, questions came to my mind such as \\"Is Norway a more homogenious society than the United States? If so, are there any differences in both the problem and the solutions in a more ethnically heterogeneous society?\\" I don't know the answers but, the reader should keep these issues in mind when reading this book.Prof. Olweus describes the problem and he sets forth well organized solutions to the problem which require involvement of teachers, administrators and parents, and further require communication with all students, even those who are neither bullies nor victims. The one problem I have with the book is that there are very few case histories and specific examples given. The book proposes solutions but does not provide a case history in which the specific solution was successfully applied to the problem at hand. Reliable data and sound recommendations are important but a few specific examples of how these recommendations worked would be helpful. For example, Olweus recommends that parents of a bully apply sanctions if the bullying behavior does not improve. He states, \\"The consequence should be associated with some degree of discomfort or unpleasantness, but corporal punishment must not be used.\\" OK, fine; but what are specific examples of \\"discomfor or unpleasantness?\\" Where are the case histories giving examples? Without these, the book does not provide as fulfilling reading as it otherwise might. This book is well worth reading and I recommend it with the reservations expressed above."},{"Title":"Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Understanding Children's Worlds)","review":"This easy to read book provides a comprehensive review of the dynamics of bullying-a must read for school administrators, counselors and teachers."},{"Title":"Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Understanding Children's Worlds)","review":"I have not read this book but I certainly plan to. In the late 1980s, i.e. before the publication date of this book, I read another book, \\"Aggression in the Schools: Bullies and Whipping Boys\\" and a number of articles on bullying, all written by Dan Olweus. I had been searching for literature about bullying, and each and every path lead to Dan Olweus.Bullying has been around for centuries or longer, and we all have seen it, and most of us recognize it when we see it. But nobody had written about the process of bullying, what constitutes bullying and what sets it apart from other forms of abusive or aggressive interpersonal behavior, until in the !970s Dan Olweus for the first time described and defined the essence of bullying, with the triangular interrelationship between the prototypical \\"bullies\\", \\"victims\\", and \\"bystanders\\". From early on Olweus had emphasized the equal importance of identifying, understanding, reforming and training the victims and the bystanders, and not just bullies themselves. In his interventional studies he was able to further confirm his observational data and the hypotheses and theoretical framework derived from them. Olweus was the first person to systematically develop and implement anti-bullying programs (in Norway).Mr. Olweus asked the important (nowadays seemingly obvious) questions: What predestines or causes a child to become a bully (or a victim or a bystander), and what kind of adults are bullies, victims and bystanders - untreated and treated - apt to become?Olweus's earlier book \\"Aggression in the Schools: Bullies and Whipping Boys\\", albeit a pleasantly brief and easy read, is still the best, and sufficiently comprehensive, introduction to the phenomenon of bullying, not only for its historical value but also for its heuristic merits.Dan Olweus started his truly seminal fundamental work on the the subject of bullying four decades ago and remained a lonely voice for most of those decades, despite the problem's widespread and ubiquitous hold on mankind. I feel very happy and relieved that in the past few years bullying has been finally taken by its horns and has entered front and center stage, in the United States and around the World, and Dan Olweus has been thus fully vindicated. Apparently things had already started rolling a few years earlier in Norway in the anti-bullying sphere, Mr. Olweus's personal and scientific stomping ground.So who else could be more qualified to write about anti-bullying programs than the very first authority on bullying, Mr. Dan Olweus?"},{"Title":"Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do (Understanding Children's Worlds)","review":"Dr. Dan Olweus is widely regarded as the father of bullying research and prevention.

They need others the government, teachers and parents to handle their problem.Bystanders are to become snitches, which makes them targets of bullies, too.

Kent shows a good knowlege of Latin and Greek, yet his representation of New Persian in the comparisons are, at times, very inaccurate. Kent relies on the transcription solely and admittedly changes some of the characters with others that usually represent completely different sounds, yet his key is not an easily understood one. His treatment of the grammatical features are a bit disorganized at times."},{"Title":"Old Persian: grammar, texts, lexicon (American oriental series)","review":"Professor Kent's monumental book is still the most widely used work on old Persian. Although it is old (about fifty years old), it provides us with a complete overview of the inscriptions and their transliteration and transcriptions.

In this non-fiction account of those times, Fleming outlines the successful counterintelligence effort which was used to bring the rampart smuggling under control.A bit dry, but Fleming fans will appreciate the Bondesque style the story is recounted in."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"Ian Fleming started his writing career as a journalist before discovering his imagination was both an easier and more lucrative source to work from, yet always strove to play reporter in the guise of presenting background in his James Bond novels. Fleming's one attempt at a non-fiction book thus held promise, yet fails to deliver.\\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is based on a series of conversations Fleming purports to have with a diamond-smuggling investigator he names \\"John Blaize.\\" I say purports because Blaize's words, both as quoted by Fleming and in an introduction supposedly penned by Blaize, sound very much like Fleming. \\"The trouble with diamonds is every stone carries the germ of crime in it,\\" Blaize explains.The trouble with \\"The Diamond Smugglers\\" is not so much its sense of unreliability but that it's boring. Instead of capers, we get a geography lesson of coastal Africa. The device of channeling the narrative second-hand creates an automatic disengagement with a series of unimpressive tales about investigations undertaken for the great diamond mining interests of the time by what came to be known as the International Diamond Security Organzation, or IDSO. From what can be gathered but is never directly said in this book, the IDSO didn't exactly accomplish very much, yet Blaize adopts a stultifying self-congratulatory tone from beginning to end.Smugglers, Blaize tells us in his introduction, \\"will hear of this book and read it, out of fear or vanity, to see if their activities have been revealed or their names mentioned.\\" Or perhaps for a laugh at the authorities who tried so fruitlessly to root them out.Stories include an investigation into how Liberia, not one of Africa's more diamondiferous nations, became a clearinghouse for diamond export. In one case, a small-time smuggler who keeps a diamond in a vaseline jar is snitched out by a pretend-friend angling for promotion. At one point, the IDSO tries to run a double agent, but he comes back with nothing.When another double agent dies in a plane crash just as he is on the verge of cracking a case, Blaize labels it \\"curious\\" and leaves it be. We are told of great criminal figures who spirit away some diamonds and melt into the shadows, but Fleming and Blaize assure us we are safer not knowing their names.As journalism, this wouldn't merit a segment of \\"60 Minutes.\\" The book is only worth reading for the view it gives us of James Bond's creator switching gears, apparently while researching his Bond novel \\"Diamonds Are Forever.\\" The best parts are when Fleming sets the stage for his conversations with Blaize, in levanter-battered cafes or beaches, where we get that sense of place Fleming conveyed so well. Some humor, too: At one point, in Morocco, Fleming and Blaize avert suspicions about what they're up to by pretending to have a captured coelacanth, a \\"living fossil\\" fish whose discovery was all the rage at the time, in a bathtub.Fleming pronounces himself impressed at the end with this real-life \\"secret agent,\\" calling him \\"a professional to his fingertips.\\" Yet the only thing John Blaize has in common with James Bond are his initials. Otherwise he comes across as a boring bureaucrat with some dusty second-hand stories to throw up. Fleming, in passing them on so breathlessly, seems to have been a bit of a dupe."},{"Title":"The Diamond Smugglers","review":"This book by Flemming is interesting and well written.

While I wish it included the Divine Mercy chaplet prayers, and it lacks information about the the most recently added rosary mysteries, it does have a comprehensive collection of traditional prayers, such as the explanation behind the rosary, the chaplet for Infant of Prague, and devotions for the Sacred Heart, and several others too numerous to name.Its advantage over the \\"Essential Catholic Prayer Book,\\" is the inclusion of prayers for specific modern concerns such as the media, single mothers, people who are depressed, the homeless, people who live alone, people with chemical depndencies, abused children, and many others. I received one before going to college as a gift, misplaced it over the years through several moves, and searched through many prayer books before I decided that this one has the broadest scope. I wish the paper back version were available, because the leather version, which I had to order to replace it, is more chuncky and does not tuck into trendy hand bags as neatly.A positive aspect of the thick pages is that if you wish to underline prayer lines that speak to you or one of the several passages included for meditation or background information, the ink will not bleed through the pages. It includes background information about devotions and different passages about Christian topics such as angels, the power of the Holy Spirit, Mary as a role model, and the symbolism of the crucifix.

They would be wonderful foruse in newsletters, invitations, scrapbooks, decorativepainting, etc. Most of the illustrations are of women andchildren, but there are some of men, scenery, and special occasions such as Christmas, Easter, winter, and spring. A companion book by the same author is'Vintage Spot Illustrations of Children, 795 Cuts from theTeens and Twenties'."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"There are a lot of ways to learn a language, and PHP is a popular one because it's dynamic.

I already knew a little bit before I bought this book and another book here. It's not a book for learning PHP from scratch, its for showing you how to do things with PHP that are very useful and innovative. I also purchased PHP and MySQL FOR Dummies by Larry Ullman, so this should help me in starting my business. :)"},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"Along with \\"PHP in a Nutshell\\" by Paul Hudson, \\"Ajax Hacks\\" by Bruce W. Perry, and \\"Visual Quickpro Guide PHP 6 and MySQL 5\\" by Larry Ullman, PHP Hacks is a phenomenal resource for ideas for using PHP.One of the many things I like to use with PHP is graphics. (I prefer to Use iMagick over GD since it is more object oriented). You can create dynamic images using PHP. It is also my strong belief that given future versions of PHP, sound, animation, and interactivity (like in Adobe Flash) could be developed using a PHP script. (But don't tell Adobe that. It would be like the oil industry finding out people can run cars on water or compressed air.)PHP Hacks is a remarkable resource to jump start your understanding of PHP."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"Broad book, covers a little html, a little CSS, a little javascript - RSS, XML, MySQL etc. A lot of functional and usefull PHP hacks."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"If you've worked with PHP for a while, you probably already know some of the hacks in this book - I did. But it did give me several ideas and I definitely picked up some new tricks and tips from it, so it was worth the buy for me. I love the \\"hack\\" books - I always learn something new!"},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"This is a very real world book, and gives some good examples with accurate working source code.The XML feed handling with Regular Expressions, I was able to put to good use within a matter of minutes."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"Please don't buy this book - even not if you are a PHP beginner. The hacks in there are for beginners and even for them it's not worth buying the book.The samples are just wrong, have security issues and are known by everyone that has ever coded seriously.So save yourself some money and buy another book, but not this one... the first O'Reilly-book that's really bad."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"I tried several of the hacks in this book and quickly scanned some others. It offers numerous ideas for dynamic web page presentation. Hack 11, \\"Put an Interactive Spreadsheet on Your Page\\", provides a fresh way to present tabular data in an Excel-like grid format, using a proprietary solution called ActiveWidgets. I downloaded the free version of the ActiveWidgets code and ran this hack. It is giving me ideas for how to present the kind of tabular data that might look good on a web page. At no cost, you can study a given bit of PHP code and decide for yourself if you can put it to further use.I also tried Hack 10, \\"Send HTML Email\\". It works fine as stated, and for the first time I learned how to construct a multipart email. That is what prompted me to implement the hack, I have always wanted to do exactly this. I have some work to do with my sendmail mail transfer agent (MTA) software for this to work even better. The hack can be improved by showing how to avoid the problem of the MTA writing the wrong from and to email addresses and how to work around potential mail relaying issues. The bottom line, however, is that the code presented works as indicated.I experimented with Hacks 4, \\"Build A Breadcrumb Trail\\", and 12, \\"Create Popup Hints\\". These work acceptably.An exciting hack that I haven't tried yet is #44, \\"Scrape Web Pages For Data\\". I would like to use this one to scrape weather-related data from http://nws.noaa.gov/ for my zip code.Another attention-getter are the hacks presented in Chapter 8, \\"Testing\\". I have not tried these hacks myself, but I think unit testing needs more attention in web pages that utilize heavy scripting, and I'll be sure to experiment with these hacks in two projects of my own that are currently ongoing. I definitely feel the need of automated testing.Other good points about this book is that it offers hacks which cover graphics tricks such as implementing Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG deserves attention because the image renditions possible are stunning, and you can render them right now. Recent builds of Mozilla and Firefox support SVG natively and you do not need the Adobe plugin with these browsers. Author Herrington neglects to state this in Hack 28. When you see the graphical renditions you realize they are worth implementing in your PHP code.I like the numerous screen shots the book provides. They offer a way to check my own results against what he suggests or shows are possible.I would have given this book a 5 star rating if I had seen hacks that implement PHP Data Objects (PDO) with databases such as MySQL and SQLite. PDOs have been available in PHP for a long time now, I use them in most of my coding because they work so well and offer a cleaner interface to the database engine than the \\"traditional\\" PHP code taught in a lot of books. Likewise, there is a focus on PEAR programming, but in PHP version 6, which is now in development, there is no longer a default install of PEAR. Herrington also didn't test his Hacks code on different platforms. He appears to have settled on the Windows versions of Firefox 1.x, Apache server, and PHP. There is some reliance on Internet Explorer. I can see the results when I test his hacks in Mozilla and Firefox on the Linux OS. Indeed, it doesn't look like Herrington did extensive research for the book; otherwise he would have quickly learned that SVG is supported natively in Firefox. There is too much code printed, and not enough discussion about the code itself. I can download the example code easily enough; why print it at the expense of discussing it? The book index also needs improvement. You can see entries for \\"ActiveWidgets\\", for example, but not a related one for \\"widgets\\".I ran all my tests of these hacks on Fedora Core 4 Linux, running MySQL 5.0.18, SQLite 3.2.x and higher, and development versions of PHP 6 available from http://snaps.php.net/ . I did not test these in Microsoft Windows XP.This book belongs on your desk as you code PHP. I recommend studying it for the ideas it offers."},{"Title":"PHP Hacks: Tips & Tools For Creating Dynamic Websites","review":"'PHP Hacks' by Jack Herrington truly is a book of hacks, tips, and tricks that I have found to be very useful.

(Maybe the Recipes book came out first and \\"Hacks\\" was the next best word for the title, who knows). But these hack/tips are based on fundamental technologies such as reading/writing XML, preventing double submission on ecommerce sites, making use of design patterns in PHP, great UI tips ( I immediately put one of them to use, which had a url to a popular dhtml library I didn't even know of).A major portion of the hacks involve excellent user interface advice such as dhtml menus, generating images, etc..Excellent real-world MySQL tips that include a basic login system, or a PHP recipe that you can use over and over to auto-generate sql CRUD (create/read/update/delete) PHP code. And the other way around. Auto-create mysql code from xml files that contain the schema for the tables.Also recipes that involve basic knowledge in adding a paypal buy button, php unit testing, testing with simulated users. I shouldn't even attempt at trying to be specific with the types of tips. There are so many of them, varying through different levels of categoriesI'd consider it a must-have for all PHP coders. And the reason why I say this, is it's very likely that you will find value in your situation, in at least 2 or 3 of the included \\"hacks\\", that would easily cancel out the price of the book.

There are several. This is NOT one. Strangely, it walks you through installing PHP as if you were a beginner, but then it dives right into the hacks with no real discussion of the language. And there are no details about the lines of script within each hack -- you're essentially being asked to take each hack as a wonderful black box from on high.If you already know PHP pretty well, then you know you can find nearly an infinite supply of great scripts for free on the web (for example, at PEAR, the PHP Extension and Application Repository). Many of them are updated based on feedback and have detailed explanations and discussions to go along with them. Why pay for a small sampling from a book?And if you're a PHP programmer and want a reference book for looking things up quickly, well, this certainly isn't THAT either.So I'm again left wondering, who does that leave?(Edit: I think O'Reilly is a great book company.

It is the only guidebook that has the hours that everything is open and how to get there. All of the information in it is highly reliable. I highly recommend it if you plan on spending more than a few weeks in Prague, although I supplemented it with the Eyewitness Guide to Prague and the Rough Guide to Prague.However, it offered little advice on which the best places to eat and stay and visit are. It also has very few pictures, which is unfortunate, because out of the thousands of beautiful places to visit in Prague, it is helpful to be able to see which buildings appeal to oneself the most before choosing to visit them.If you plan to stay in Prague for longer than a week, this is an essential book to buy. However, for quick trips to Prague, I would suggest buying the Rough Guide to Prague (it offers good advice about where to go) and the Eyewitness Guide to Prague (it has tons of pictures). Also, if you plan on spending more than a few days in Prague, buy the Lonely Planet Guide to the Czech and Slovak Republic - there is so much more to the Czech Republic than Prague, and taking a day trip or two outside of the city is time well spent."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Prague (Prague, 4th ed)","review":"The Lonely Planet series are usually great books.

If you are strapped for cash, this book will serve you well."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Prague (Prague, 4th ed)","review":"In the past year I have had the chance to travel to Prague, Paris, and London, and for each trip I brought along a Lonely Planet city guide. These books are simply the best. In previous travels I have tried books by other groups, but Lonely Planet has never steered me wrong. The books are accurate and up-to-date, and offer advice for all modes of travel (economic, social, time constraints, interests, and so on). The history and culture sections are useful but not too long, and the same is true of the descriptions of the various sites and sights. Don't travel without one!"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Prague (Prague, 4th ed)","review":"I couldn't find the current edition, so I had to settle for the third edition. However, I found it extremely useful to have on hand from consulting the Metro map to small area maps. They can't replace having a good map of Prague, but they can help you find and identify sights in an area and nearby restaurants. Complete pronunciation would make the small Czech language guide in the back more useful since Czech is not a language you just start speaking. I don't understand why Lonely Planet no longer makes their cities guides in a pocket friendly size. I loved being able to cram the Melbourne guide in my pocket when I wandered around there. It is debatable on just getting the entire Czech and Slovak Republic guide instead of just the Prague guide, since there is a large amount of overlap. If you're just visiting Prague, I would recommend getting this small volume, but for more widespread travel in the Czech Republic, the complete volume is your choice. I took both, and probably could have done without this city guide, but didn't want to take any chances on missing out on anything in Prague, even though Prague has more than enough to offer for several visits. Included are several day trips outside of Prague, such as to Terezin, a nearby concentration camp and site of a clever ruse. Worth half a day visit, though fairly depressing. If you're going to spend more than a few days in Prague, this is essential. For just a weekend you will still get some use out of it, though it might overwhelm you with all the places to visit in Prague."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Prague (Prague, 4th ed)","review":"I love Lonely Planet Guides and have used them for many trips in the past, but this book was certainly not complete. One example is the lack of info on marionette shows. It's one of the most popular things to do in Prague and this book only mentions marionettes once, in a short paragraph about the history of theater in Prague. No mention on the places to see a show or what to see. Also, I have never had a travel guide that didn't mention ANYTHING about the train station in the city!! This book did not even have one piece of info on the train stations or how to find them, how to travel from other cities to Prague or how to get to other places from Prague. We had planned to go to Vienna from Prague and had no idea where the train station was, how to get to it, or how to find a train schedule. Thankfully our hotel was able to fill us in on this info.

It provided me with maps of places like St Vitus' Cathedral and Prague Castle that were hard to come by even at the ticket office for these places.

So you can find the cheap stuff as well as the expensive stuff. Historical details are interspersed throughout the books, too, which can make for a more in-depth travel experience. This particular guide was written in a personable style and was full of useful information.

But actually being in Prague and using the book to get around to different sights and restaurants was extremely difficult.Instead of having a chapter on a specific neighborhood with everything in that neighborhood, they have a chapter on neighborhoods, then shopping, then eating, then drinking, then entertainment, etc. Having to flip to the eating section, then flip back to the neighborhood section, then flip to the map to see where it was located was very time consuming and annoying.Another thing I didn't like was that the writing on the maps was much too small. I have perfect reading vision and could barely make out the street names and numbers."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Prague (Prague, 4th ed)","review":"I lived in Prague for a month and relied on this book if only for the maps.

Whether it is the absurdity of just getting by (The three most important things in life) sharing the wonder of discovery (Saturn November 3) or showing us that it is still possible to live your life by your own rules and still succeed. Harlan's view of the world is honest, savage, vicious at times but never intentionally mean for mean's sake. He shares a wonderful truth about what the real meaning of marriage is in &quot;Djinn, no chaser&quot; that plucks away the romantic crap and common perceptions and leaves us with &quot;..You are strong when I can't be and I am strong when you can't be. Nobody gets it right all the time&quot; He also tells a heartrending and chilling tale about the nature of love in &quot;Grail&quot; I won't ruin the end of it, but it tells of the strength of the human spirit even when the love story does not have a happy ending. All in all, this runs the full gambit of emotions, smartly written and guaranteed to make you think"},{"Title":"Stalking the Nightmare","review":"I love Harlan Ellison's writing. Haven't read him for years and wanted to reread some of his stuff. It seems as though the publisher simply cut and pasted the contents into a new format without regard to pagination and footnotes.

And why isn't Harlan bitching about this?"},{"Title":"Stalking the Nightmare","review":"The version I read is actually the 1982 release. With an introduction by Stephen King and an amalgam of short stories and essays, Stalking the Nightmare is an entertaining read. As with any collection of tales from a single writer, some stand out more than others. In this case, the most memorable ones include:\\"Grail\\" - in which a man spends his life searching for true love only to learn that it's an artifact that has been traded around the world.\\"The Outpost Undiscovered by Tourists\\" - A parody of the three wise men in modern times after searching 2000 years for Christ. They now drive a Rolls Royce and sleep on air mattresses while fighting the \\"forces of chaos\\". Eventually, they find the savior in The Manger, a hotel by Hyatt, and surrounded by various folks including accountants, pet-store owners, and hairdressers.\\"Night of Black Glass\\" - this one interested me mostly as it was written in 5 hours in a B. Dalton bookstore window after news anchor Tom Brokaw challenged Harlan to write a story based on one line: \\"August afternoon a person walking along a rocky beach in Maine picks up a pair of broken sunglasses.\\"\\"Djinn, No Chaser\\" - a young couple walks into a mysterious antique shop that materializes from thin air. They purchase a cheap lamp before the owner kicks them out just as the shop vanishes once more. Later, the couple finds that the lamp contains a sadistic genie who turns their lives into a living hell, sending the husband into an asylum. Later, his wife discovers a way to turn their situation completely around...\\"Invasion Footnote\\" - another farce about a megalomaniacal robot hell-bent on world domination, until his own kind turn on him. Predictable but funny.\\"The Hour That Stretches\\" - Harlan fills in for Jerry Pournelle as a guest on a radio show and decides to allow callers to phone in one-line prompts to which Harlan will conjure up a story premise on the spot. After awhile, it becomes an exhausting exercise for Harlan, until the final caller...\\"The Day I Died\\" - not so much a story, but a series of possible ways in which Harlan will die, with exact descriptions and dates ranging from 1973 to 2010.In my opinion, the first three essays are actually more interesting than the stories.\\"The 3 Most Important Things in Life\\" offers moments from Harlan's life that deal with sex, violence, and labor relations. The latter of which is an incident that occurred when he was hired to write for Disney...and fired within hours of arrival.\\"Saturn, November 11th\\" details Harlan's visit to JPL as a guest of Jerry Pournelle when the Voyager satellite begins sending pictures back of Saturn and its moons.\\"Somehow, I Don't Think We're In Kansas, Toto\\" is a recount of Harlan's ludicrous experiences with Hollywood when The Starlost TV series went into production based on his story, \\"Phoenix Without Ashes\\".All told, Stalking the Nightmare is an enjoyable read and further evidence of Harlan's vivid imagination and reputation for fearless, and even experimental, storytelling."},{"Title":"Stalking the Nightmare","review":"What can I say about the writings of Harlan Ellison that has not already been said, some of it in court, assuredly. Funny, insightful, irreverent, and powerful, his style shines through no more clearly than in this collection of his shorter works. From the deadpan imitation of Ellison's style by Stephen King in the introduction, to the nonfiction accounts of Ellison's failed attempts at creating a TV show and writing for the Walt Disney Company, this book will have you laughing, crying, and contemplating the meaning of life, as any great work of speculative fiction should."},{"Title":"Stalking the Nightmare","review":"I've been an avid reader of Harlan Ellison since the 1970's. I wish more of his books would become available as e-books since so many of them are long out of print. I've always liked this anthology for the introduction by Stephan King and his own introduction that's really a story."},{"Title":"Stalking the Nightmare","review":"I bought this book for my uncle and hope he is enjoying it as much as I do. It's one of Harlan Ellison's best collections and I recommend it anyone who appreciates a master wordsmith and storyteller. The foreword by Stephen King is hilarious, and the introduction by Harlan is worth the price of the book alone. A great potpourri of stories and essays -- Harlan at his best."},{"Title":"The Happiness of Getting It Down Right: Letters of Frank O'Connor and William Maxwell, 1945-1966","review":"This isn't a thick book, because there just aren't that many letters between Maxwell and O'Connor. I only picked it up because, after reading a few of O'Connor's short stories, I immediately decided that I needed to read every word that was ever written by or about this man. Except for one lousy biography, I didn't regret the time at all.But this, honestly, isn't a great collection. The letters start out rather dry, and even as they get more affectionate, you still don't feel like there's any meat there. They discuss their families, and how much they like them, and how badly they want to see each other - but regarding their opinions on anything else, or an idea of how they went about writing their works, one gets very little: a lot of frustration about writer's block and some comments that are only useful if you're already familiar with Maxwell's novels (I've only read So Long See You Tomorrow, which isn't mentioned in this book) and O'Connor's later New Yorker stories. And - except for The Ugly Duckling, a story that Maxwell inexplicably didn't like - most of O'Connor best work did not come in this period. The most moving part of the correspondence, actually, comes when his creativity starts to dry up - and anyone that has read his Collected Stories can feel his genius exhausting itself towards the end.A lot of it, too, just reads like little notes passed between friends - I imagine they saved their weightier ideas for when they could see each other, or could have long conversations on the phone. None of them have the literary feel that Chekhov's letters do - those are works of art, as letters often were when it was hard to see people face to face or just pick up the phone. The letters are often just summaries of events - this story is going well, this one not so well, the kids are fine - that were updates between friends: they're not interesting for an outsider, unless you're curious whether the family lives of happily married writers are as ordinary as ours (yes, they are - all happy families do indeed ressemble each other).The part of this book still sharp in my memory is the remembrance that Maxwell wrote of O'Connor after he died. It's just a few pages, but the weight of years of affection and respect are there. A beautiful piece of writing. And one meant to be read - which is more than I can say, I'm afraid, for the letters. Spend your time on their books: you'll get a better sense of what their lives were about."},{"Title":"Heartstrings and Tail-Tuggers","review":"Many of us are familiar with Penny Porter's delightful stories as they appeared in The Readers' Digest. Finally, she has collected them in a hardbound edition with wonderful pen and ink illustrations by Marilu Savage sprinkled throughout the book. The main characters of these stories are farm animals and wild creatures who are marred in some way; but, Ms porter's love and family values shine.These stories are inspirational in their love and nurturing care for all things, whether its the harsh Arizona desert, young children that arrive in middle age, or wild animals that most people would leave for dead or just shoot in order to end their misery. Ms Porter reveals that common sense and devotion to all living things are their own rewards. Her writing style is clear and concise. One only hopes for more than the abridged stories that frequent The Readers' Digest. These are stories that will keep you amused. They are perfect for bedtime stories and armchair traveling."},{"Title":"Heartstrings and Tail-Tuggers","review":"HEARTSTRINGS &amp; TAILTUGGERS is simply wonderful, a collection of Porter's animal stories depicting life on a ranch in southern Arizona.

It deserves a wide reading in the United States where, unfortunately, Agacinski and her ideas are virtually unknown.Agacinski argues that it is the different roles enacted by the two sexes in generation that should be the basis for the organization of society. This means, among others things, insisting on parity between the voices of men and women in societal decision-making. It means a rejection of all things forcing androgyny, because androgyny always conflates to androcentrism. It means a real embrace and recognition of the interdependence of the sexes written in the mixity of all human generation. It means a rejection of artificial reproductive technologies that hide either the contribution of the mother or the father to offspring. It means undoing millennia of sexual hierarchy that makes women appear a mutated, inferior version of a man.I found myself underlining nearly every sentence, my brain exploding with new thoughts at every page. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Read it, and see the future--a future that would be heaven, or a future that would be hell--depending on the choices each human society makes with reference to women."},{"Title":"Contrastive Rhetoric: Cross-Cultural Aspects of Second Language Writing (Cambridge Applied Linguistics)","review":"This text was assigned for my gradate contrastive rhetoric course, but my entire class is stuck reading it on an ereader from the library that is temperamental at best.

It is a must read for someone trying to enter the conversation on CR, but for now I'm sticking to the electronic version and reloading my browser when it crashes.

This is very hard to find, but worth the search. Charlotte Fairlie was proud of her position as headmistress of Saint Elizabeth's-even if it meant a lonely life for someone so young and attractive. School intrigues and petty jealousies made it imperative that she not play favorites, and forced her to remain aloof...and alone! Then she decides to accept a student's invitation to visit her on a beautiful island off the coast of Scotland, and Charlotte finds herself falling in love with a handsome laird. But an ancient legend and a living girl become obstacles to an idyllic romance. Believable and an easy read."},{"Title":"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D.","review":"James Boswell took his friend Samuel Johnson on a tour to Scotland in 1773, and both of them wrote books about the trip. The edition that I have is the one edited by Iain Galbraith and published in Germany (in English) in 2000. The only footnotes are Boswell's, and not only are they printed in very small print, but the modern reader is left hanging because Galbraith provided no footnotes. The Latin passages are not translated. The old-fashioned English sometimes has to be read twice before the modern reader gets the sense. For example, \\"there's an end on't\\" means \\"that's all there is to it.\\" The reader gets a vivid picture of Scotland in those days, but it sometimes seems that the real focus is on Johnson. This book is a sort of prelude to Boswell's famous biography of Johnson."},{"Title":"Visual Effects in A Digital World: A Comprehensive Glossary of over 7,000 Visual Effects Terms (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Graphics)","review":"Karen E.

In the past, I often had to search the net for certain terms and descriptions that had me baffled...but no more. For those of you who are considering buying this book, know that it isn't a book full of pictures (Although it does contain 32 pages of colour stills); It isn't a book detailing visual effects work in particular films; It is what is says - 'A comprehensive glossary of over 7,000 visual effects terms'.

In Kingdom Come it's a fight just to get out of bed every morning. Great book from a great new voice."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"There was a PBS feature about Dobry on ArtBeat Chicago. It documented him at work in his studio. He doesn't use a projector. I think he is being confused here with Ed Paschke, whose review is on the back of the book. Paschke was featured on ArtBeat Chicago himself just recently and described his use of an opaque projector in his work. Paschke and Dobry are friends. That may be the confusion. Paschke uses &quot;technology&quot;. Dobry is &quot;old school&quot;. I think Dobry's work owes a lot to his mentor, Paschke, but the ArtBeat feature is highly reccommended for anyone who wants to see how Dobry works.As for his writing, it's beautiful. Kingdom Come is a moving work. It is everything Dobry's paintings are, and more. five stars!"},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Kingdom Come is something very special, that is something that must be said outright. Anyone who knows anything about Dobry knows that he also writes about the mob in the stock market. Why? I don't know. As good as he is writing fiction, I wonder what his fascination with the mob is. Calling Dobry a &quot;pedophile&quot; and a &quot;homosexual&quot; in a book review? A &quot;pedophile&quot;?? What book was this guy reading? I don't believe that review was serious. Say what you want about Kingdom Come, but to write a review claiming there is pedophilia in it, I have to wonder if that review itself wasn't written by a mobster, or if the reviewer himself just doesn't have some serious issues he has to deal with. The erotica in Kingdom Come, what little there is, is hetero-erotic consenting sex amongst adults.The imagery is dark and written masterfully. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Gary Dobry is nothing short of a great writer and great painter. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Dobry's paintings are big, like a movie screen is big and the images are bigger than life. I admit openly to being moved by his artwork and was quick to buy and read Kingdom Come. The juxtapostions of time and space he uses work well with the telling of his story. Dobry writes, &quot;Most of us have to be hit over the head with a 2 X 4 before we see stars&quot;. For me that line says it all. The ending is a &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; kind of ending. I only wish it was longer."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Gay fiction? I don't think so. This book is great page after page. Can't wait for this guy's next one. This cat can really write!"},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"It's clear from Dobry's art he uses a projector to produce what is on the canvas. When it comes to writing he can't do this.

Think of the trees who died for what? Gary Dobry's vanity?"},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Gary Dobry is certainly a boxer. He also seems to have a gift for convincing people that he writes on par with Bukowski or Miller, when the truth is that he pales in comparison. A visit to his website shows that he trained Danny Bonaduce for the 'Celebrity Boxing Match' show on Fox a while back. How can someone write about artistic integrity and living the 'Continental Lifestyle' while nonetheless perpetuating CELEBRITY BOXING? Don't be fooled by the pseudo-artistic posturing. The fact is, Dobry's writing reflects his lack of originality. This book is dry, boring, and unoriginal."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"Kingdom Come has all the drama of getting a root canal, along with all the pain that accompanies it.No one writes read-into-the-night stuff like Jay Marvin. I have devoured &quot;The Committe&quot; by this talented man at least 100 times. Reads like a scandal ripped from today's headlines.I believe Mr. Dobry began as a boxer and evolved into a writer. There are times when evolution shouldn't take place. Kingdom Come isn't all bad. It does motivate one to want to elevate themselves above someone like Gary Dobry and his purbling, sterile writings. And it is inspiring to know that just about anyone can get a book published.What really amazes me is the humbleness of Jay Marvin. Here's a man whose clearly a superior writer, artist, and poet when compared to Mr. Dobry, but yet he remains a man of mystery. I suppose that is why he's so popular.I am not saying that people should not purchase Mr. Dobry's books.....what I am saying is, your money might be better spent on purchasing some of Mr. Marvins art work, or buying his book (which is a classic in every sense of the word) entitled &quot;Punk Blood&quot;.When it comes to writing, poetry, and art, Jay Marvin does everything right and Gary Dobry does everything wrong.Have a Great Day, everyone."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"This book could have been a three star. Looks as if the author is &quot;pumping&quot; his own book by giving himself two five star ratings. Typical in this type of authoring and this forced me to give only two stars although it could be a three star. What I found interesting about the book, other than its ranking on Amazon which I think is low, is the graphic depiction of a man who is in the &quot;closet&quot; and wants the reader to feel his captiveness. I did. He portrays sex with men as sex with women. His sexual positions even depict his lust for young men possibly even older boys. Still, he is trapped and unable to express himself fully in the &quot;straight&quot; world. He finds shelter in &quot;his&quot; macho world but wants nothing more than to tell the world he is trapped as a female in a male body. At the end he sort of admits being homosexual is ok but not disclosable to the reader except for one or two paragraphs.The author is not bad. He seems to be too hung up on boy-boy sex acts in some doorway and not driven enough to tell the reader why he is the way he is. &quot;I am in the closet as a gay man because....&quot; Did he have a poor childhood? What? If he would have answered this question and maybe several more in his writing I would have had greater respect for this piece as an art form and him as a writer. I came away feeling like sex with a man while being a man needs to be cursed by the gods. Not so.Maybe the next book the author pens will include a different view as a gay man who is out. High heels and a sharp pen.A copy of this review will be posted on PlanetOUT."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"I remember Dobry from the All-Elvis Art Show at the old World Tattoo Gallery in Chicago.

I ordered his other book too."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"The author is a painter, and a very good one, and his prose seems like it was painted, written, in the violent strokes and drips of an abstract expressionist. This seems appropriate since Dobry was a boxer as well. Death is always omnipresent in Kingdom Come. It seems to be always hovering in the &quot;jaundice sky&quot; beneath the &quot;purple cumulus clouds&quot;, it's in Chicago's &quot;gray landscape of concrete and elevated rails&quot; and it is certainly within the confines of the Parisian cemetery, &quot;Pere Lachaise&quot;. Most effectively, it is in the ring. The Bullfight ring, as well as the boxing ring. &quot;Vultures&quot; are &quot;perched&quot; on the rings of the rope. They smell death. His cut-man, who the book is dedicated too, is his guardian angel who is there for him in his corner helping him to win his biggest fight. This was a great read. I hope Dobry puts down the brushes long enough to write another."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"I saw Gary on TV and went out and bought his books. I liked In Good Faith better of the two because it evoked all kinds of emotions in me. Kingdom Come is more &quot;literary&quot;, for lack of a better word.

He explained his &quot;old school&quot; approach to painting. There were no &quot;projectors&quot; or nothing like that. What left the biggest impression on me was this big, muscular boxer painting such delicate details. It was very impressive, and so is his writing. Can't wait for his next one."},{"Title":"Kingdom Come","review":"I met Gary at his art opening in DC earlier this year. His paintings were beautiful and he was a very sweet, and MUSCULAR, guy!

Murder? Yes, two murders and a suicide but that was only a sidebar for the supposed plot about the home-grown terrorist group, Posse Comitatus. Do not order this book expecting a novel, like I did. It is an autobiographical look back on Ms. Fitzgerald's glory days as an M.P officer. Did any male character in the book not fall in love with her?After spending 17 years of my life at Fort Huachuca or in Sierra Vista, I did expect some descriptions. Several times Ms. Fitzgerald refers to \\"Sierra Vista, the town outside the main gate.\\"Ms. Fitzgerald must have angered her editor or published the book herself without a second read. There are so many errors! The editor should take an English course to learn the difference between \\"your\\" and \\"you're\\" which were faithfully switched. I've been to Blacktail Canyon-it isn't spelled Black Tale. The grey hared colonel was amusing--I assumed it was meant that the colonel was gray-haired. The two most annoying errors throughout the book were \\"starred\\" instead of \\"stared\\" and \\"sense\\" instead of \\"since.\\" The two funniest errors were \\"cereal numbers\\" (3 times!) instead of \\"serial numbers\\" and \\"plane clothes\\" instead of \\"plainclothes\\" and my favorite was \\"physician heel thyself.\\" Of course I know it should read \\"heal.\\" The glaring errors distracted from the thin story.I agree with Ms. Fitzgerald's message of our borders are porous and we will pay a price for that. My own 30 years of military and government service has shown me that. So while the book is really lousy, Ms. Fitzgerald, keep up the good work trying to inform people what the real world outside US borders, the shopping mall, and the McDonalds is like."},{"Title":"Murder at Fort Huachuca","review":"What a spooky story!

I loved it!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"It is valuable to imagine the personal experiences not recorded in history or the Bible. Love stories are not my favorite thing, but I very much appreciated this aspect wrapped around this most famous couple."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I read and loved Two From Galilee in my early teens, and then promptly forgot about it. I re-discovered it recently when browsing books in a thrift shop; I saw the title, had a moment of deja vu, and decided to buy and read it again, wondering how I would like it after an intermission of 30-some years.The answer is that, as an adult, I think I appreciate the book even more than I did as a teen. Having a much vaster reading experience than I did then, I can better appreciate Marjorie Holmes' skill as a writer. She brings the story of Mary and Joseph to life in a truly lovely way. Her writing is tight, with no wasted words, and yet she manages to wonderfully flesh out the characters of Mary and Joseph, as well as a whole cast of supporting characters made up of their family and friends. She creates motives and emotions that are absolutely credible, while at the same time remaining true to the Biblical account. Although some elements were questionable to me -- I highly doubt whether practicing Jews at this time (and poor Jews at that) wore wedding rings, and I am also skeptical whether such Jewish women wore rouge or earrings, even on special occasions -- they were relatively minor details that didn't significantly bring down the story.I like, also, that Holmes made Mary a real and human woman. Although much of the book is focused on Mary's near-perfection in character as well as physical beauty, and I was afraid for a while that she was going to be made out as a sinless saint with a halo, thankfully the author gave her just enough human frailty to keep that from happening. And although Mary was depicted as being her parents' first born child, the author avoided (again, thankfully) implying that she was \\"immaculately conceived\\", a doctrine that is taught by at least one major religious organization but which has absolutely no Biblical basis.What is best about Two From Galilee is the way that Marjorie Holmes makes the story of Mary and Joseph a true love story, suggesting that perhaps part of the reason they were chosen to be the parents of Jesus is because of the great love they had for one another. Holmes infuses their relationship with passion and feeling, but never allows it to become tasteless or tawdry. She makes these two icons of the Bible real without cheapening them.I enjoyed the book so much that I am now going to read the two sequels -- Three From Galilee and The Messiah -- which I've never read before! Two From Galilee is, I believe, one of the earliest examples of Christian fiction as we know it today, but it is still one of the best."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I DID NOT RECIEVE THIS IN A TIMELY MANNER THEN CONTACTED THE SELLER HE REFUNDED ME AND SENT IT OUT 2 DAY.

The spine has never been broken."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book was suggested in a home-school catalog as a book to help my children understand the customs at the time of Jesus' birth. It is, plain and simple, a romance novel. Some of the more adult references were beyond my children, but I still found myself explaining things to my seven year old that I didn't want to explain to her until she was older. I enjoy a good love story, and so do my three pre-teen girls, but we were not interested in this love story as it was written."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book is sweet, so long as you remember it is pure fiction. It is a poor representation of historical fiction, of which the title and subject matter give the impression of being. Historical facts about Judaism, about Israel, about the birth of Christ, etc., are poorly researched and presented as fact (for example, scholars agree that Jesus was probably born in May, not December, etc.). Enjoyable read, but not to be confused with factual events of history."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"All Midsomer Murder DVD are great.

I really enjoyed it and have passed copies of it along to others."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I truly enjoyed this book and the perspective it gave on the life of Mary and Joseph. How often we hear the story of Jesus the Christ's birth and yet can easily overlook the faith that it truly required of Mary AND Joseph. I know I can easily forget the persecution they may have suffered, the shame and mockery of their family, community and so forth. Yet they could hold their heads, humbly, high because they knew the mission that GOD had blessed them with and assigned them with.The author did a wonderful job of bring the characters off the paper and giving them personalities! I felt as though I was with them every step of the story. I could see their joy at their betrothal, the saddness at being mocked and shamed by society, the fear of the trip to Bethlehem and the joy of what it meant that the Messiah was finally coming!!!I highly recommend this book. It gave me a whole new appreciation of the story of Jesus' birth and the power, protection, provisions, love and grace of the Merciful, Loving GOD!!!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Just to feel the world into which our Savior was born is such a blessing.

It makes the story come to life. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This is a great story especially at Christmas time. It is much better than the movie The Nativity. It is a love story of Mary and Joseph.

Lacexcepted with tradition based stumbling blocks to their growing relationship.and embodies all of the fears that they had to sort through and nice with. It doesn't soft pedal the significant obstacles in their way. A lot of effort went into creating an authentic backdrop and story setting. The main characters, Mary and Joseph felt authentic."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Four and a half stars for this beautiful fictionalized account of the nativity.

I'm so happy to have found a book to replace her worn copy!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I first read Two from Galilee several years ago, during the 70s. I have since read it more times than I have kept up with, to the point that I have to skip a year or two so that I don't get extremely tired of reading it. This book has sometimes been the only thing that really kept my spirits up during Christmas, amidst all the commercialism and getting caught up in the materialistic aspect, never having enough money to DO Christmas the way you would like. In other words, this book brings me back to what Christmas is really all about...that the creator of the universe was willing to wrap himself in human flesh to communicate to us that He loves us and to give us a way to bridge the chasm between us and Him. I recommend it heartily, especially at Christmas."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"During the holidays, I like to read books that drag me back into the true Spirit of Christmas. I have never found a book which does this better than Two From Galilee by Marjorie Holmes. What is so precious about it? It is the love story of Mary and Jesus. What better way to be swallowed up in Christmas joy than through the eyes of the young parents of Jesus struggling to comprehend and fulfill God's will?I have read this novel through many Christmas seasons and it always warms my heart and my soul. It's an easy read- just the escape from the chaos you need this Christmas season.See more reviews at Godisbiggerthan.com."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book is a wonderful dramatization of the story of Mary and Joseph, how they would have gotten together, and the problems they faced as they became parents of the Christchild."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I have given this book out as gifts to my friends and family. I don't usually read historical fiction but I loved this book and the whole series. It made me feel like I was actually there living along side Joseph, Mary, and Jesus of Nazareth."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Although the author cautions from the beginning of the book that this is just a book of fiction, you can't help but think, \\"It could have happened like this.\\" The story is a fictional account of Mary from the day she \\"becomes a woman\\" until just after she gives birth to Jesus. I think this is a wonderful book and one that every Christian should read at least once (I try to read it every Christmas, although I don't always make it) along with it's two sequals, Three From Galilee and The Messiah. The old familiar stories, heard from childhood in countless Sunday Schools, comes alive in a whole new way. You see exactly what each of the characters actually gave up. It becomes a story of a young girl, called to do extraordinary things, while those around her mostly believe that she has done wrong. And Marjorie Holmes has a great gift; the characters in her book seem so real you almost believe that it HAD to have happened that way and with those people. This is not a \\"preachy\\" book, really. It's a great book about a young girl called to a great role in history and how she and those who loved her lived through it."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Two From Galilee: The Story Of Mary And JosephThis is a warm and infinitely touching story of the human aspect of the birth of Jesus Christ. It takes the story out of the bible and brings the human aspect home as you hear how this wonderful miracle affected two people and strengthened their faith. Marjorie Holmes wrote a wonderful book that people will enjoy for generations."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"What an interesting book. Written many years ago, it was new to me. I developed real empathy for Mary and Joseph as I understood what it might have been like to have experienced their young lives as real human beings in historical Galilee. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I am often asked why I enjoy Biblical fiction, and I've been told that I should just read the Bible instead. Well, I do read the Bible, but these works of fiction give an added dimension to the people, enabling me to relate to them more closely. I like experiencing what daily life was like for Mary and Joseph, the obstacles they faced, and how they adapted. It gives me a deeper appreciation for them as real people, and when I go back to reading the Bible, I feel better inspired to understand their plight and to learn from it! This is a beautiful portrayal of the deep love these two Biblical people shared. Not much is written in the Bible about Joseph, so I enjoyed getting to \\"know\\" him in a more personal manner."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I would tell anyone who would like to read &quot;Two from Galilee&quot; they would be reading a very close to real life version of what may have taken place concerning the life of Mary and Joseph. Of course it is not taken word for word from the Bible, but the author knew the customs and the way of life for the Jewish people and went from there. It is truly a wonderful love story about Mary and Joseph and how they may have coped with there unexpected news of Mary being chosen to bear the Son of God. I truly loved the book, in fact I just recently read it again for the second time. I usually read a book one time and put it away, this little book was just as moving the second time around(I read it the first time right after it was published, and just reread it again)"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Using vivid word portraits, the author blends scripture, tradition, and creative imagination into a fictional re-creation of the courtship of Mary and Joseph. This is the foundational piece of the trilogy... which continues with &quot;Three From Galilee&quot; and concludes with &quot;The Messiah&quot;."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"When a friend recommended this book to me, I didn't really know what to expect. After I started reading &quot;Two From Galilee,&quot; I absolutely fell in love with the book. Marjorie Holmes did an excellent job in portraying the characters in this novel. I could relate to Mary and Joseph and until reading this novel, I to failed to realize that they too were capable of feeling &quot;human&quot; emotions. I loved everything about the novel and am so looking forward to reading the next one, &quot;Three From Galilee.&quot;"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I take the time to read this book every December to slow down and take the time to remember what Christmas is truly about."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book amazed me at how captivated I was with the story. It begins with the innocent love of Mary and Joseph, and for the first time it really struck me how much love they had for God and for each other. The book progressed into her pregnancy and from then on I couldn't put it down until the little Savior was born. The emotions she described were down-to-earth ones and I realized the reality as I read. Excellent piece of work!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"My first introduction to this book was as it was being read on a Christian radio program about 20 years ago. I was captivated and had to read it for myself! That year, Christmas came alive as never before. Marjorie Holmes had to have been inspired and anointed of God to produce this magnificent work. It has been perhaps my all-time favorite novel for all these many years since and I can only recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"While of course this is a work of fiction and should not be taken as Gospel, it challenges the reader to see a side of Mary and Joseph beyond the Christmas images so often portrayed in nativity scenes. I think it is refreshing to see such a human, down to earth potrayal of the boy and girl who would become the mother and foster father of Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"My mom suggested I read this book after she found it at a church library book sale. She said she had read it when she was around my age (17) and loved it. I was skeptical but read it having nothing else to read. I was hooked by the first chapter! I've always viewed Mary and Joseph in a non-human way I guess...not that I believe they're deities or super-natural or anyway more \\"important\\" then everyone else...but I didn't think of them going through the same struggles of passion and desire and going through the wonders of falling in love, not have any idea of what was to happen. It spoke to me about true love and purity and holiness in a way I didn't expect. Definitely a great alternative to the romance novels we see today."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book was written from the perspective of Mary and Joseph, and it gives the reader a look into the customs and challenges they likely faced. I would recommend this book to people of all ages, it is an easy read, and well written."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Loved the book and loved the series. The Sunday School class read the books together. We all loved them."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"A friend recommended Two From Galilee for my Christmas reading -- I'm SO glad! The author drew a very vivid picture of the love story between Mary and Joseph and how the news of the coming Messiah affected them. As the days of Christmas have approached, I have the images of the difficult journey of Mary and Joseph as they went to Bethlehem. I highly recommend it to everyone. I could see reading it with a church group in anticipation of the season!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful read for any time but especially wonderful for Christmas. I enjoyed every word of it. I had owned this book in paperback for years but had never read it. The kindle version is awesome. This is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This has been a Christmas favorite for years! I read it every Christmas. I'm so glad to have it in my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"It is always fun to wonder about the stories behind the stories inside of the Bible.Here in this tale we look at Mary and Joseph, not as strangers in the Christmas tale, but as a couple in love, a couple given the responsibility of bearing the Savior.How would Joseph have felt, not as a man betrayed by an illicit affair, but as a man who realizes God has taken his place in giving Mary a child? What would it feel like to be told that you could not be intimate with the woman you love?Told from the standpoint of the young couple, this is a warm favorite, especially nice at this Christmas season.CAUTION - while this story follows the canonical Bible, it does not follow the Catholic traditions."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"Well written, easy to understand, and I now have a totally different perspective on the holy family and the Christmas story."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This book is by far the best I've ever read. Ms Holmes thrills us on the beginnings of the greatest journey ever."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"My favorite book. I keep giving it away so I bought a new copy. I would be prone to forget Joseph's part of the story if not for this novelization of Mary's begetting of Jesus."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"A great biblical story. It goes into quite a bit of detail you don't find in a bible about Jesus' life."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"This is the story of the lives of Mary and Joseph from the Annunciation until the birth of Jesus. The few Biblical facts are accurately portrayed, however, it is so much more. The village of Nazareth is brought to life, peopled with believable characters.Realistically portrays the reactions of the people of a small town, Mary's parents, Joseph's family, Mary and Joseph."},{"Title":"Two From Galilee.,","review":"I read this book many years ago and it helped me bridge the gap between everyday life and the miracles that have occurred. Its a very unique blend of biblical influence, and more modern reactions of how people might react to a virgin's pregnancy and her husband to be. It shows people as less than perfect but trying hard. I think its a marvelous book and it makes you appreciate life. It shows the differences between life now and in Israel waiting for the messiah."},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"Starting from the fundamental principle of forensics, that \\"every contact leaves a trace\\", this book presents a fascinating study of the techniques that we have all heard about in countless trials and on television dramas and crime reconstruction, but which until now have remained mysteries to the outsider. Chapters on poisons including alcohol and drugs, documents and handwriting, sudden death, fire, blood and other body fluids, identity, trace and contact evidence, ballistics, time of death, criminal psychology and the handling of forensic evidence present a complete picture of a science which involves much more than post-mortems.Recent and earlier famous cases are covered in detail, including those in which Dr. Erzinqlioglu was himself an expert witness. If you've ever wondered how the pattern of blood splatters can yield so many clues, or why it is so difficult to establish exact time of death, you will find the answers here.The author is a leading forensic scientist who carried out more than 500 murder investigations around the world."},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"Over the years, I have read many books on forensic science. Some are popularizations aimed at the general public, some are textbook-like and aimed at professionals in the field while many others are aimed at various levels somewhere in between those two extremes. I would classify this book in the third category - just short of being a textbook (although I can see this book being recommended as supplementary reading in forensic science courses). The author discusses the basic principles of forensic science. He covers different techniques used in much of the field and offers his professional opinion on many cases that everyone is familiar with. The book has been written with a careful choice of words which is indicative of a careful scientist. Reading this book was both a great pleasure for me as well as a learning experience. It's a real page-turner that is difficult to put down and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"Dr. Erzinclioglu is very talented as an informative writer. The topics covered in this book are pretty basic - it is a great intro to forensic science book. He covers things such as time of death, cause of death, the method of poisoning, fire investigation - in the context of explaining the methods used to investigate each one. He cites many investigations as examples, and most of them are the more obscure that we have not heard about already, (at least if you leave in the US and not Britain), unlike a lot of other basic forensic texts that use cases we all may know about.One of the more interesting cases discussed in this book under the chapter \\"Words and Images\\" is the Shroud of Turin. I recently watched a show on DSC not too long ago on this same topic, but the author brings up quite a bit of evidence that was never even touched on in the show.This is one of those texts that just makes you feel smarter and more informed after reading it, and those who are seriously considering a career in this field will probably feel drawn to the author in the sense that this is a person you would like to meet and train under. I look forward to reading their other works.In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to begin researching forensic science without throwing themselves into it headfirst. This will give you the basic principles and ideas that you need, as well as a basic understanding of different techniques used by investigators. It is a good foundation to build from in your learning process."},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"Interesting material on (e.g.) -- abrasions, Bertillon, bite marks, cadaveric spasms, Chechen hostages, chloroform, Arthur Conan Doyle, drowning, Dunblane, ethnic groups, fingerprints, genetics, ground-penetrating radar, haemoglobin, Hitler diaries, identikit, J F Kennedy, Libyan Embassy, maggots, Georgi Markov, mass graves, narcotics, 9/11 [five pages], nitrogen, Occam, polygraphs, quicklime, radiocarbon dating, Rasputin, ricin, Rwanda, security in bomb blast areas, sexual differences, Shipman, steganograhpy (hiding messages in long computer files), taphonomy, teeth, vitreous humor, Waco (edited down from a long list).What interested me also was the philosophical aspects here. We all know philosophers never say anything useful on knowledge - they are paid to be evasive. But in forensic investigation, theories and observations and witness statements all contribute to the final result. There are two pages on 'expecting the unexpected', trying not to be biased by preconceptions. Interesting comparison of crossword clues with real life - all the bits have to fall into place, and it may be as unexpected and yet as satisfactory as the solution to a 'cryptic' crossword. This of course is somewhat idealised - in practice there are investigations as with Dr Kelly, or JFK, or Diana Spencer where truth takes second (or third..) place."},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"I agree with the first review and believe it essential reading for anyone trying to \\"get away with it\\". It is a plausible fusion of probable motives and credible methods, even if it does dwell at length on events during the middle ages more than on current, well covered cases (NO, despite the promise on the book jacket, he never did explain \\"why the gloves didn't fit O.J.Simpson\\").The only logical and factual errors that I noted (page 168-9)was that careful analysis of the Graf Hindenberg fire's origin was NOT were seeping H2 was likely/designed to migrate. Also H2 gas is 15x lighter than air, so there is a distinct difference in the mixing ratio/speed if it is released and can flow UP (top of the dirigible), versus the bottom where the heavier O2 would have kept it contained and poorly mixed. Readily available films indicate the fire racing downward along the zeppellins' sides at improbably fast speeds, whereas the light H2 would have forced the flames UPWARD.For those interested:...\\"nasa hindenberg\\" etc. wherein these items:\\"Regardless of much speculation, translation of a letter handwritten in German on June 28, 1937, by Hindenburg investigator and electrical engineer Otto Beyersdorff states \\"The actual cause of the fire was the extreme easy flammability of the covering material brought about by discharges of an electrostatic nature ...\\" Recently, NASA investigator Dr. Addison Bain has verified this finding by scientific experiments that duplicated the vigorous ignition by static discharge to the aluminum powder filled covering material. Spectacular colors of this type of combustion were produced from the burning skin of the giant airship. Dr. Bain concluded that the Hindenburg would have burned and crashed even if helium would have been used as the lifting gas. Dr. Bain noted that the particular type of aluminum powder particles, which are flake like in shape, are particularly sensitive to electrical discharge.\\""},{"Title":"Forensics: True Crime Scene Investigations","review":"I read this book over two brief sittings, having bought it because I was curious about what forensic scientists do. I was disappointed with the book; quite a lot, actually. After finishing it, I returned it to the bookstore from whence I purchased it and GAVE it back, not asking for a refund. After all, my favorite bookstore is not a library, and the quality of the book was not their fault.Why the negative reaction? Two main reasons: lack of sufficient technical detail (often prefaced with the qualifier 'xxx is too technical for the present discussion, but suffice it to say....')and a striking example of scientific hypocrisy that the book spends much of its time cautioning against.First of all, I would appreciate being the judge of what is 'too technical. I am an engineer and I am not afraid of big words or complex subjects. Include it, if YOU understand it, and leave the migraines to me, please.The other example of which I speak is Dr Erzinclioglu's rant denigrating the entire issue of sociobiology. After holding forth his considered 'scientific' opinions on faith healing and use of psychics in a previous chapter, notably thin for any references to double blind experiments, specific researchers, institutions or organizations involved in hard research in this area), he then neatly dispatches a considerable amount of research in the area of sociobiology by equating it with pure behavioral determinism. This is a gross oversimplification of sociobiology; reductio ad absurdum in its finest form.Sociobiologists, contrary to what Dr. E says, do not postulate that humans are behavioral automatons. They postulate behavioral propensities, based on sound anthropological and other-species research, coupled with logic which strives to uncover potential survival value associated with group tendencies toward a certain behaviors. Such behavior does not preclude the exercise of free will, it seeks to uncover collective tendencies (i.e., probabilities, Dr, E.; another word frequently mentioned as applicable to 'evidence', not apparently considered applicable to sociology?) It is admittedly a soft science, but all of the tomes I have read on this subject are quite encumbered with such items as footnotes detailing who did the research, the locations of peer reviewed publications of same, and the specific research cited. Even in the lay literature.His approach to explaining sociobiology is publishing an either uninformed or intentionally simple minded opinion, rather than presenting EVIDENCE refuting its tenets. Even his arguments against it are demonstrably thin, based as they are on a misstatement of its basic tenets. If this is an example of his work, I recommend that some of the folks he help put away get a better lawyer and challenge the forensic evidence! They might be free in no time!Any points he earned in his earlier chapters were pretty much forfeited by this intellectual faux pas. I appluad his recommendations regarding being open minded in the pursuit of truth, and I fully recommend that Dr. E read his own words and revisit sociobiology, perhaps this time aided by actually reading some of the considerable literature, both popular and professional, available on the subject.Save your money on this book. I recommend an hour watching the Discovery Channel on cable, instead. It's cheaper, more entertaining, and more informative."},{"Title":"Single Variable Calculus (Student Solutions Manual)","review":"If you're buying this manual then chances are that you aren't stopping at Calculus III.

These excerpts are for outdoor folk of any kind, for those who cherish the earth or want to do so more, for hikers and those who enjoy just a sunset or fresh breeze. She has cast a wide net and cites from many ages and cultures and genres of literature, 160 or so indexed authors, passages that are old and welcome friends (like Maclean's \\"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it\\" and Muir's \\"Climb the mountains and get their good tidings\\") and many more citations that are new and unexpected gems, even touches of humor like Woody Allen's moose in spats or Marge Piercy shooing the hunters (caw, caw). As in all anthologies everyone will have some favorites that have been left out or will find some selections cited and wonder why. The passages are spiritual and responsible, but without any touch of theological tediousness or political stridency. Bachleda shows us just the beauty, spirit, poetry and wonder of holy earth. Her selections are arranged loosely according to the theme of the hero's journey from desire and need, to marveling and adoration, comprehension and joy, connection and unity, redemption and grace, recognition and compassion, to hope, resolve and beyond. One might read it in that order cover to cover -- which unless done a little at a time would be like eating a giant box of chocolates at a sitting -- but a system of marginal symbols for the elements of nature, the seasons of the year, and the religious sources of the quotations facilitates random access depending upon your location or mood.

And, the adventure begins . . .

He drives it way out into the country at the end of an old line and, once there, the family \\"homesteads\\" a farm from scratch.This is really an inspiring story and will generate most kids' interest in agricultural pursuits. It's also a great book to get young people interested in reading if they haven't previously shown much ambition in that direction. I can hardly say enough good about this book and, at age 55, I STILL re-read it once in awhile.My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"This is a warm tale of a family facing hard times in the immediate post WW II era, when the face of American life was changing. Pa, a trolley car driver, learns that his job will be lost and his beloved trolley car replaced by a smelly old bus. Rather than cave to the bus trend, he and his family (and their new friend, Mr Jefferson) drive the trolley to the end of the line and build an idyllic life in the country, farming and raising lots of livestock. Overall I loved this book, especially the emphasis the author places on the importance of children's input in family decisions. The only thing holding this book back from a 5 star rating for me is the running theme of Pa being \\"the boss of the family,\\" and Ma resisting her urges to question his decision making. This is pretty easily overlooked, though, and makes for a wonderful story about farm life. It reminds me of the Laura Ingalls Wilder books, only about 80 years later!"},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"I read this book many times as an elementary school student.

This hardcover copy in particular. I loved the way the book felt and I loved the story and it will always be one of my favorites"},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"The \\"Trolley Car Family\\" was my favorite book as a child. I read it over and over again. It was written in 1947 at a time when life was much simpler, maybe a happier time. At least the author, Eleanor Clymer, made it seem so. It's a story of a very \\"functional\\" family. One wonders if there is such a thing. It always made me happy to read it and reading it as a \\"mature\\" adult gave me the same warm feeling. I didn't want it to end. I'm sure I'll read it again one day.

But it's the mid-1940's, and surface cars are being replaced by busses. The company would be happy to keep him on if he'd transfer to one, but he doesn't like them--\\"They won't stay on a track,\\" he complains. But without a job, how will the family live? Then Sally has her Great Idea. Pa has asked to have his old trolley car instead of the month's severance pay he was offered--\\"it's a lot bigger than this house,\\" he says. So, asks Sally, why can't they live in it? And it turns out the trolley company owns an old abandoned farm outside of town which it's willing to rent to him for a good deal less than their tiny house costs them. With the help of their neighbor, Mr. Jefferson, a milkman with a horse of his own, they haul the trolley out to the farm. Ma Parker acts as if they're out in the wilderness, but the kids soon discover a spring, an abandoned barn and orchard, and the farm family across the road, and Pa, who grew up on a farm, finds the country life appealing. So does Mr. Jefferson. By the end of the summer Sally's idea has borne many unexpected fruits, including a new job for Pa. This upbeat and often humorous story is strangely relevant in these days of uncertain economy, slippery jobs, and foreclosures, and it may also interest kids to learn how very different life could be only 70 years ago."},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"The Trolley Car Family is a good book for anyone who likes adventure. It is a good book to read yourself or read to your kids! It says \\"gosh\\" a few times but everything else is clean.I liked it because the people got to live in a old trolley car. They also have many funny adventures, like the time they accidentally left the baby in the rain.I like how the four kids and the parents and the once grouchy neighbor all become good friends."},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"I was so pleased when I searched for The Trolley Car Family and actually found it here on Amazon. My copy from my childhood is a tattered but beloved book that ranks as one of my all time favorites.When Pa Parker loses his job as a trolley car driver, he decides to hold a family conference to decide what they should do. Pa doesn't want to drive the new replacement for the trollies...buses. So he and Ma Parker and their four children take one of the old trollies to the end of an old trolley line and decide to actually live in the trolley and make a go of it on their own. Except that their cranky but soft hearted neighbor and milkman decides to come with them and pretty soon the adventures begin, they meet new friends and become even closer as a family.This book is timeless in that it is based on the values of friendship and family that are still important today, though maybe not as prevalent. Ma and Pa Parker love their children, the children respect their elders and are happy running through the apple trees and just having fun, even with the chores they have to do. Just think... no tv, no computer and no cell phones! And everybody was happy!Just a nice little children's book that I can't recommend highly enough if you can get it!"},{"Title":"The Trolley Car Family","review":"I ordered this book because I remember my dad bringing it home to me when I was in first grade.

The 'model' that it's on is only suggested in a few strokes; you want whoever is looking at the illustration to imagine themselves, or their clients, in that outfit. And I was used to poses that showed the garment off to best effect, but really had the minimum of character to them. All well and good - but HOPELESS for costuming, where suddenly I'm trying to 'sell' my designs to the director/producer (and sometimes the actor). I'm trying to convince them that the image I have of the character in these clothes is going to tell the story that they want to tell. So i needed to add character and personality to my sketches.If you have the same problem; if you're looking for the same thing; then this book will be a godsend. The author covers exactly how to create character in the pose, then how to give personality to the face. She gives ideas to show youth, children and teenagers, middle age, old age. She gives basic details of muscles and anatomy to make your figures look more alive, and discusses lean and ample frames (something else that isn't an issue in fashion illustration). She gives easy concise drawable cues for emotions, and details of facial features for full, 3/4 and profile views. She even gives basic period figures for Egyptian, Greek/Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, Elizabethan, 18th Cent, Regency, Victorian/Edwardian, 1940's/50's, and contemporary styles. This section is the essentials of the Georgia Baker book boiled down to the kernal of good stuff and is of amazing value if you need to start sketching today - NOW - and can't wait a 6 months till you've got the whole thing nutted out yourself. There's good stuff on hands and feet and shoes. There's great examples of how stiff fabrics and soft fabrics hang differently. There are at least half a dozen really good examples of non-human characters (wolf, crocodile, ostrich etc)that are perfect for learning from.This is a really large book. It's chock full of valuable examples of the author's work, in all kinds of periods and for all kinds of characters (the play and character is always specified, so there's a point of reference you can use to see how the author has nailed the PERSONALITY of the character in her sketches.) About 3/4 of the costume illustrations are in colour - the book feels lush and inviting to read through.Some down sides; there is a double page on hats for male and female - I would have liked more, although I guess some other examples do offer hatted characters. Sometimes really valuable points are hidden in small notes amongst illustrations. The font is quite a small point, and can be slightly hard to read in poor light (like in many costumer's workrooms backstage!) Nowhere that I have found (that doesn't mean it's not there) does it tell you to work LARGE and then reduce down later by photocopying to render. If you start off drawing at the kind of scale used in the book then you're going to be disappointed when it all looks cramped and the details aren't clear. It also doesn't seem to mention (again it could be my oversight) that it's easiest when starting to use a thin paper like Zeta pad, so you can retrace your figures and improve/add what's missing without erasing all over the place. I would have liked something on drawing SPFX makeup and prosthetics - some aliens or monsters. I would have liked a LOT more on sucessfully showing hairstyles (period and contemporary), something I personally struggle with.However, this is absolutely and definitivly the best book I've found (and I think I've tried them all now) on costume drawing for theatre (or film, for that matter).If you are in the industry and want to improve your sketches, buy it now, you will NOT be disappointed. If you WANT to be in the industry, buy it yesterday and practise everyday. Sometimes you get the job you want just because your drawings look better than the next person's!

The audio readings are quite exceptional.Although I have read a wide range of poetry for some years, I am rather new to listening to poetry on audio tapes. As I much prefer to read rather than listen to tapes, I only by chance bought this tape of selected poems by Keats.I was rather familiar with the better known poems of Keats and thought that I had a resonable appreciation of his poetry. But these superb readings by Spaeight and Edison added an entirely new demension to my understanding and enjoyment. On longer road trips I find that I cycle through the tapes two or three times, much as I repeatedly replay favorite music.The readings include The Eve of St. Agnes, La Belle Dame San Merci, On First Looking into Chapman's Homer, To Sleep, &quot;When I have fears that I may cease to be&quot;, the short song &quot;I had a Dove&quot;, and the classic Keatsian Odes - Nightingale, Autumn, Melancoly, Grecian Urn, and Psyche."},{"Title":"Blow negative!

The \\"hero\\" is Sampson Greice, an obvious stand-in for Hymam Rickover, who pushes ahead various innovations that will make obsolete the diesel-electric submarines of two world wars and take the US Navy into the next century. The story is largely told through the eyes of Lt. Joy, a former destroyer sailor now consigned to submarines. In the years immediately following the end of WWII, Joy finds himself reluctantly aboard Greice's aging submarine, but manages to make something of a transition to the otherworldly ways of the \\"Silent Service\\". Through other crewmen, Joy learns the two marks that have made Greice an outcast among other officers: his unconventional ideas about the next generation of submarines (subs with steam engines? subs armed with missiles? Subs with vertical launch tubes?) and the fact that he's pretty much hated by his superiors. After a complicated string of events - thankfully depicted from within the sub - Joy gets his dolphins, yet is nearly killed in a catastrophe that all but destroys the sub and virtually ends Greice's career. Joy, once a man willing to follow a crowd, nevertheless matures, tracks Greice down to an obscure Naval Research command, and joins his crusade to bring the navy into the next century (even as the present century wasn't quite half over).\\"Blow\\" is fun - probably more now than it was when first written. In an era with cookie-cutter \\"Pat Robinson\\" novels, it's refreshing to find something as old as \\"Blow\\" which has a very period feel to it.

While Admiral Rickover was outspoken on many issues, Greice speaks barely a word for the first half of the story - and much of what we know of him comes from his enemies. Unlike the real Rickover, Greice actually has experience with subs as fighting machines. That said, the book also gives short shrift to Greice's resilience - after the tragedy early in the book, we lose sight of him and don't meet up with him again until he's ensconced in the command that will create the first generation of SSN's. How Greice managed that bit of career resurrection is not quite explored, and we see little of subs themselves once he goes to work on the nuclear navy.That said, \\"Blow\\" is still a must-read, a biting near-satire of the technothriller before that term ever really existed. \\"Blow\\" gives us insecure and in-over-their-heads submariners in dangerous ships instead of the typical mechanized officers in cutting-edge submarines.

(A Dell book)","review":"\\"Blow Negative\\" is an absolutely fabulous read. It is a fictionalized story (it does not track actual history all that closely) of Hyman Rickover, the father of the US nuclear submarine. Sampson H. Greice, the protagonist, is really not much like Rickover excepting that both in \\"Blow Negative,\\" and in real life, one man with a vision was pitted against most of the US Naval military establishment. The Navy, in common with all military institutions, is inherently conservative (and rightly so, since lives, and possibly the survival of the nation, are at stake) and the creation of the nuclear navy was not an easy birth.The real story here is one of military politics. Captain Sampson H. Greice is a maverick naval officer with a sky-high IQ and a personality that is, well, different. But he has a vision--that submarines should be powered by a nuclear reactor that can run virtually forever, without the need of oxygen. As we all know in the modern world, this revolutionized submarines for all time. But in the 1950s when this idea was introduced, then-Captain Rickover faced furious opposition from the Naval establishment.\\"Blow Negative\\" is a very funny story and a wonderful read. It reads true-to-life as far as the nature and attitudes of professional military officers and sailors too! This novel moves at an excellent clip, engages the reader at every turn, and never stalls. I have read very few books that gave a \\"feel\\" for the military the way this novel does. While the hero of the book, Sampson H. Greice is different in many ways from Adm. Hyman Rickover, the basic qualities of the two men are similar, and both were heroes.You will not find a more engaging read about men and submarines."},{"Title":"Blow negative!

He correctly distinguishes between new technology that causes existing social interactions to be more efficient or faster, and those that make truly new social mores. For the latter, he suggests that biotechnology may ultimately fall in this category. Its potential for life saving or life extending advances may cause far reaching social upheaval.His views are a good counterpoint to much hype about technology. Naturally, he cannot resist remarking on the Y2K imbroglio. How this was largely puffed up in an echo of the dot com and telco zeitgeist.

It even dares suggest that earlier times experienced more fundamental changes!"},{"Title":"Church Affairs","review":"Interesting book that stirs up many questions one may have, that go unanswered. This book was not written as a book, rather, it was simply a recorded speech Nee gave over the period of several days at a conference (to other apostles?)Possibly the hardest issue to swallow that Nee puts forth in this book, is that only apostles have authority to establish elders in a city. I would be interested to know if Nee thought that after an original class of elders has been established, if this original class has authority to appoint new elders as well, or will they always have to wait for an apostle? Chances are though that Nee's crowd already understood this, which is why he didn't expound on this.The only reason I give the book a low rating is because I wonder about the quality of the translation. Did Nee really speak this way, or was his translator just not very good?In general, Nee puts forth some radical views, which are rather thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"I bought this book for a friend of mine for Christmas.

Instead, he spends about half his time interjecting why Wilhelm and Jung were wrong in their handling of the subject. If that was his original intent then he should have just titled the book as \\"A Study of Why Wilhelm and Jung Misinterperted the Secret of the Golden Flower\\".I think this Classic Chinese Book of Life is so short and sweet but yet so profound that this book is still worth buying.I can just hear a Chan Buddhist Master saying \\" Yes Mr. Cleary I know you wrote this book but did you bother to read it?\\""},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"I must say I was impressed with this book, which I found by helpful coincidence. I class it in the \\"top texts\\" on Direct Methods and Nondual teachings, as well as practical application (if that is what you're after).The method is really quite simple, and can also be found in many nonduality teachings and schools. Here it is described plainly (and remember the time period when this was written), though it can get poetic and flowery in parts. The method basically involves attention to awareness itself, and the turning of the \\"light\\" of awareness from external objects onto itself.This practice will likely suit those with some meditation or mind disciple experience, since it does involve fixed attention for periods of time- however, beginners can still get something from this, even just through short periods during the day.Cleary's translation itself is clear, and shows that he is beyond just a scholar and actually practices the method itself (in the later notes).. unlike previous translators such as Wilhelm, or scholars attempting to define concepts and terms in the text. (For some reason this book has prompted reviewers here start scholarly debates on Taoism and Zen.. not sure why).

P. Blavatsky. He seems to translate one word at a time with the result that you understand each word as you read it, only to find that the sentences are incoherent. Since Cleary has been prolific, not hard considering how carelessly he translates, his translations flood the market making it unlikely that others will be published, particularly of works, such as the Secret of the Golden Flower, with a limited market. We can avoid reading Cleary's translations but then cannot find others by more competant hands.Cleary translates philosophical terms with rather vague English equivalents but never indicates the Chinese term in question. Thus with terms such as \\"essence\\" and \\"primal spirit\\" one realizes as one continues to read that their meaning is entirely obscure. Of course, the Chinese used terms with multiple meanings that often must be pondered to be understood, as do Western philosophers. \\"De\\" of the Daodejing\\" is an example. It is not exactly the same as its usual English translation as \\"virtue\\" but close enough. In the case of Cleary's vague terms one actually has no idea of what they mean. \\"Essence\\" has no equivalent in Chinese philosophical writings, nor does \\"primal spirit.\\" There are various Chinese terms that might be translated as \\"spirit\\" but we have no means to determine which is in the original. The book is elegantly printed but of more value would have been the Chinese text on opposite pages, or at least a glossary.What most frustrates is that one can glimpse what the original text is saying just enough to wish that an understandable translation existed. Sadly, none does. Though Wilhelm's is much better, it is still inadequate because he lacked the concepts to fully understand the text, as did other Westerners of his generation. We can excuse this in him because he exerted himself to trying to understand. One cannot say the same for Cleary, who significantly, never appears at academic conferences in his field."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"I have read with some dismay the more negative reviews of this wonderful translation by Thomas Cleary. In humble opinion (after nearly 30 years of practice and initiations with Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Pinor Rimpoche, Yogi Ramaiya, Juramidame, amongst others) those with sufficient awareness will receive clear and direct instruction and this makes this particular volume no less than excellent. Ignorance and inferior awareness will certainly viel the truth. Also recommend those with desire for liberation to study the Diamond Sutra and the Sutra of Hui Neng (the 6th Patriarch)."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"You can make reading this book as simple or as complex as you want. I think it all depends on how ready you are not only spiritually, but also how much studying you have already done on the subject of the Human Energy Field. A good book to read before you read this one is \\"Science of Breath\\" by Swami Rama.Both fascinating books, and you can't complain about their prices."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"Hard to describe the quality of impact this book and author's translation has had on me. Not for beginners to Taoist thinking and practice. For me, having come to understand the basic principals of Taoism, this is useful as a series of instructional meditations. Thomas Cleary provides some of the most readable (to me) translations of Taoist and Buddhist literature. His notes (the entire second half of the book) provide helpful framing of the translation. It's necessary to remember that this way of thinking comes from a culture and language that has almost no overlap with Western reductionist mindset and language, so English is a very difficult vehicle for communicating it's ideas. Cleary does a fine job of helping bring this spiritual view of the world to my very very Western mind."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"The book itself is exquisite. It took years for me to arrive at a point wherein I could comprehend its wisdom. I ordered two copies and gave one to a friend. The copy I kept was a defective edition with pages out of sequence. Because of its nature as a timely spiritual treatise, I decided to keep it anyway and &#34;go with the flow.&#34; Someday later on, I'll order a copy whose pages are in the correct order."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"I have been a practitioner in the Tibetan Vajrayana for over thirty years. This short book, which I have put into daily practice has corrected mistakes in my practice to such an extent that I feel I have wasted thirty years. This, of course, is not entirely true. Because of the extensive study during those years I could appreciate the depth of Cleary's translation and commentary as one who has successfully practiced this meditation.With practice, the book gets more and more profound and the practice more refined. It subsumes the whole of the Buddhist canon and that of Taoism and Confucianism and Christianity as well. In particular it brings one to the realization that scriptures, while valuable, have the danger of enmeshing one in words and concepts. On a more personal note, it has helped free me from trying to reproduce past experiences of enlightened mind, which are now just memories and therefore also concepts and ideas.I have waded through Stopping and Seeing, also translated by Mr. Cleary in volume V of his collected translations, and would advise against it. It is very similar to Ashvagosha's Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana, translated by D.T. Suzuki, which I studied at length many years ago. After your practice has reached a certain point, perhaps it might be of value to study such treatises.Another thing that commends Mr. Cleary's translation is that he puts his commentary at the end so the translated text is presented without distractions. For this I am also grateful.One thing that is not addressed in this or other meditation texts, nor by the meditation instructors I have had, is the basics of sitting meditation. I spent years \\"on the mat\\" working through bodily problems such as back aches, legs falling asleep and painful tensions that can be avoided by a few expediencies, to say nothing of the fact that posture is essential to integrating one's entire being in the practice.First of all, it is important that the body be relaxed. One should not waste precious time trying to assume unfamiliar and strenuous asanas, e.g. the Lotus posture, but should sit on a cushion, e.g. a Zafu, that raises one's butt and use a mat, e.g a Zabuton, that protects one legs and ankles from hard surfaces.Secondly, it is necessary to sit with the back straight and the spine unsupported. However, one needs to relax into this position, like stacking a pile of coins, once they are straight, you can let go. You do not want to let go entirely because from time to time tensions arise, for example you begin tensing your back, neck or legs. This subtle awareness will allow you to immediately relax such tensions and again let go. In this way you can eliminate years of trial and error on the mat.I would add that this relaxing into the posture is the same approach you should take to the meditation itself."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"Cleary writes an excellent translation of a foundational text. This is not a book that can be understood unless one has a general familiarity with Taoism and Buddhism. As a person follows either one of these disciplines, he or she may use the book as a sort of a gauge as to the depth of understanding one has gained. Each time I reread the book, I find that the content becomes clearer. In this sense it is excellent. It compliments other books in an eastern philosophy student's library."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"I had difficulty with this book. As I've stated before, findingEnglish translations on any text is difficult, because Chineseideograms are themselves sometimes associated with differentmeanings based on context, and because, especially with regardsto religious symbolism and internal alchemy, the symbolism canbe quite esoteric.This book is divided into sections. The first is Cleary'sdirect translation. The second is his commentary for each verse.The last is an afterward regarding the &quot;technques&quot; espoused inthis book relevant to modern life.Personally, I would have found the commentary more usefulintegrated directly after each verse. The translation is stillhighly symbolic, and the commentary adds a little tounderstanding what is trying to be said. As it is, I foundmyself re-reading the translation verse by verse, at the end ofeach verse thumbing to the appropriate commentary. I did notfind the direct translation so poetic that the interruptionswould have destroyed any aesthetic sense from reading it. Atthe very least, commentary at the end of each chapter wouldhave been better.To a layperson like me, this book provided illumination inglimpses only. It was hardly direct, clear, or straightforward.A very strong working knowledge in Chan Buddhism or theCompletely Real School of Taoism would have served me well, butalas, I don 't have that. The symbolic content was franklyoverwhelming, and it wasn't until I re-read along with thecommentary that I had a sideways understanding of what the goalof &quot;turning the light around&quot; actually meant.In fact, much of this book is written like a dissertation.Cleary spends much of his commentary efforts explaining whyhis translation is superior to Wilhelm's, and why Jung'stheories are therefore misguided and/or incomplete since Jungrelied on the Wilhelm translation. I found this decidedlydistracting, but scholars may not.For someone well-versed in this type of meditation technique,this analogy-filled work may provide insights in stages. Oneverse may be striking now, another verse revelationary onlyyears later. To me, trying to get a handle on the basicprinciples and goals, this was like trying to see Michelangelo'sDavid through a stained glass-window. The color, the frillydesigns, the artistry of the window obscured my vision ofthe very clearly masterful sculpture beyond.Cleary would have been better-served writing an introductionemphasizing required reading prior to reading this. Forsomeone who claims to actually practice this technique, henever talks about the symbolic in more real terms-- even inspeculation. &quot;Midnight refers to stillness, and water tohidden knowledge, and fire to creativity...&quot; and commentarylike that led me to respond not &quot;Of course! Brilliant!&quot;but rather &quot;Thanks a lot, that really helped... not.&quot;I will likely re-read this book in a few years, and hope mysecond time around proves more rewarding. Again, I did gainsome small insights... I think."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"This translation by Thomas Cleary is truly an inestimable work of high level instruction for piercing the veil of lower consciousness and greatly increasing the soul's ability to recognize and comprehend truth in whatever form it is presented. The practice of the 'Golden Flower' itself is a method whereby the mind becomes attuned to reality in a way that inhibits the degeneration of consciousness and begins to restore the life of the heart and soul for the practitioner who truly desires to ascend. Thomas Cleary's work itself is highly valuable to all english speaking persons today as it adds greatly to resources which were previously unaccessable, and his high comprehension of Chinese and other languages in translation brings spiritual truth as it was told by sages of old one step closer to the human heart."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"FYI: You might want to read the Translation Notes at the end of this book before tackling \\"The Secret...\\" Some books are better read backward. Another tack would be to read Cleary's \\"The Essential Tao\\" before tackling \\"The Secret...\\".\\"The Secret of the Golden Flower\\" is about a Taoist method of turning our attention from involvement in exterior mental objects to focusing on our interior essence or source of mind. Making our inside the outside, being aware of the projector and not merely the screen. A theme alluded to in the \\"Matrix\\" movies, what is real and what is simulation and which is better, choices, choices, choices. The \\"Secret\\" is about discovering that we have free will, that we choose our reality, that we are not only observers of but participants in reality. About finding ourself, our true self. We choose to see the glass as half full or half empty, same glass of water, different perceived reality, the power of intention is a great mystery, the mysterious pass. Looking at reality as though it is something completely exterior to us creates separation from reality, separation from ourselves, the Fall into Duality. This is the root cause of much of our World's inhumanity to Man and Nature. We are estranged from our lives. It's only a movie. We are focused on things instead of essence. We have taken the blue pill believing that ignorance is bliss. It is not. Ignorance is the source of pain and suffering for it is ignorance that clings to that which cannot be grasped, the simulacra. Ignorance is being attached to things outside ourselves, temporal things. We, on the otherhand, are eternal. Truth is found within. There is a spark of Divinity within each of us. One way of waking up to the truth is through mind altering drugs, the red pill of \\"The Matrix\\". Another way is through Meditation and Prayer and Study. I suggest the latter though a combination of the two ways is an ancient tradition. Love is the elixir of the Gods. The spiritual journey is about looking at reality from within ourselves, about coming into a conscious relationship with our true or eternal selves. Awareness focused on awareness.Paradoxically, to transcend our rational mind we must begin with our rational mind. It is mind that dreams, and it is mind that wakes up. Taoism is about unifying our two minds. Waking up is done in \\"The Secret...\\" through the meditative technique known as \\"turning the light around\\". The purpose of this \\"switching\\" exercise is to free us from attachment to the limited mind of conditioned consciousness so that we can tune in to the liberated mind of primal spirit, our original self, our whole self. The \\"conscious spirit\\" is the mind-set of feelings, thoughts, and attitudes, conditioned by personal and cultural history, bound by habit to specific forms, the temporal self, the ego. The \\"original spirit\\" is the formless essence of awareness; it is unconditioned and transcends culture and history, the eternal self. Form is created by that which is formless. Our essence is a part of the formless essence of ultimate reality, the eternal Tao. Intuition belongs to the original spirit; intellect belongs to the conscious spirit. The essence of Taoism is to refine the conscious spirit to reunite it with the original spirit. To live fully awakened lives within the realm of dreams, the ultimate form of lucid dreaming. Love breaks down all barriers. It isn't that we are trying to change the world, it is just that in changing ourselves, the world changes. Though his laws are without sentiment, without favor or prejudice, God is an eternal optimist. God is a God of Love, even tough love.To borrow phrasing from another book about Taoism, \\"Every Day Tao\\" by Leonard Willoughby, the \\"Host\\", original primal spirit-the Eternal Tao, God, wants his/her \\"Guests\\", you and me, to take our shoes off and sit a spell. The purpose of redirecting our attention is Not to destroy the conscious spirit, the ego, it is to refine it so that it can function properly as a subordinate functionary of the original spirit here in the everyday world of duality, the Matrix. The problem isn't the material realm, the problem is our attachment to it. To be a proper \\"Guest\\" we need to behave in a mature fashion, a refined fashion. Methods of reversal, such as turning the light around, are used to put our horse in front of our cart, to put things straight again. To see reality as and for what it is. To make us whole. To combine our two minds, our rational and irrational minds, into a harmonious and balanced whole. The Universe is an organic synergetic whole. The Universe is not one, nor is it two. It is an irrational, beyond rational, whole number between one and two, a unitive whole, nonlinear. This is a great mystery to the rational mind. We are a part of that whole. The Moon is reflected in a thousand ponds. By no longer being fixated on conscious spirit or its objects the intellect functions efficiently in the world, unattached to form we are able to be all that we can be. The spiritual life can then be lived to its fullest in the mundane world, the way of the Bodhisattva. The way of Neo.Being still, while a necessary exercise for introspection, is not meant to be a permanent position. Balance is fundamental, and it is dynamic. We are to avoid excessive stilling as we would avoid excessive excitation, as we would any extreme. Go to yin, go to yang, balance the two, do not dwell at either extreme. With that said, few of us are in danger of being too still for too long. No extreme is a proper subject of fixation. Fixation itself is an extreme. Cults are the result of fixation. Fixation is unbalanced. The Taoist wants to live a balanced and thus spontaneous life free to move from yin to yang and back again, not a contrived existence in a forced middle ground. Taoism is about making the conscious decision to make the shift from free will to free flow. About going with the grain of reality. The Master Taoist surfs the current of the Tao from one yin wave to the next yang wave to another yin wave, and so on. Balance is dynamic.We learn to practive what we preach by direct experience, not by any prescribed belief system. Turning the light around is a direct experience. Once we find that we can turn the light around we are well on our way to living an independent life governed by will and not circumstance. The mature Will chooses free flow. To fight the current is our fate, to go with the flow is our destiny. To attach to yin or yang is a blockage. It is our higher self, spirit, that directs the current. Trust is an essential part of the Taoist's way of life. The Taoist trusts him or her inner self.Turning the light around is not culture specific because it is not based upon forms, but on the formless. Cultures are for the most part form specific. The average Chinaman or woman is no more aware of the inner life than the average citizen of any other culture. Most people are asleep in the Matrix of form. Most people do not want to be unplugged, or at least aren't ready. Those that awaken to the inner life are to date in the minority. The Creator has given us free will. To awaken is a choice. No one can wake up for us. To date most people are content to be things, to define themselves by things, by the outside. To awaken is to redefine oneself, to establish a new identity. This is not easy. The status quo has a lot of inertia. The energy to overcome that inertia can only be found within.Contemplative or Philosophic Taoism is transcultural. Religious Taoism is seemingly a bit of an oxymoron to us here in the West. We have been burned by Religion and Personality Cults far too often. Religious Taoism is the practice of Philosophic Taoism. The yin and the yang of it. Form is not so much the problem as attachment to form. This is true of any religion and its forms. The \\"Secret of the Golden Flower\\" is about developing perception independent of cultural forms so as to allow for autonomous conduct. About being free from attachments to a reality outside oneself. To see things as they are, not as they are locally defined. In this way one becomes a part of a transcendent interior culture that has no national boundaries. True Taoism is very democratic and egalitarian, as is all true spirituality. A citizen of the eternal Tao is able to think deliberately rather than compulsively, for he or she is psychically free. The more real self, the eternal self, the unconditioned self, is that self that can distinguish between one's various selves without becoming divided, without becoming attached. We are awareness. The Taoist is concerned with both the supernatural and the natural. Life is good, even with the bad. Yin cannot exist without yang, and vice versa. Night without day is a shadow. Life without death is dead. Life is bittersweet. This world of form is not only our temporal home, it is also our school. The Philosophic Taoist reaches for the stars with both feet on the ground. We are a microcosm of the macrocosm. True Taoists are not elitists, they are realists.The \\"Secret\\" can be a difficult read, but I feel it is worth the effort. If I have gotten carried away I am sorry. I write to focus my own thoughts as well as share them. I will revisit this review and make it more succinct and hopefully less redundant and more clear. As mentioned above, \\"Every Day Tao\\" is a good read. Then there is \\"Tao: The Watercourse Way\\" by Alan Watts, and so on. Of course Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu are must reading."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"Being asked to review this book is like trying to review the Bible. This is a practice as well as a doctrine. Cleary's reputation and gifts speak for themselves. Therefore I will show rather than try to tell:IVTurning the Light Around and Tuning the BreathThis doctrine just requires single-minded practice. One does not need to seek experiential proof, but experiential proof comes of itself. On the whole, beginners suffer from two kinds of problems: oblivion and distraction. There is a device to get rid of them, which is simply to rest the mind on the breath.The breath is one's own mind; one's own mind does the breathing. Once the mind stirs, then there is energy. Energy is basically an emanation of mind. Our thoughts are very rapid; a single random thought takes place in a moment. Inward breathing and outward breathing accompany each other like sound and echo. In a single day one breathes countless times and has countless random thoughts.So should one have no thoughts? It is impossible to have no thoughts. Should one not breathe? It is impossible not to breathe. Nothing compares to making the affliction the medicine, which means to have mind and breath rest on each other. Therefore turning the breath should be included in turning the light around.When you sit, lower your eyelids and then establish a point of reference. Now let go. But if you let go absolutely, you may not be able to simultaneously keep your mind on listening to your breathing. You should not allow your breathing to actually be audible; just listen to its soundlessness. Once there is sound, you are buoyed by the coarse and do not enter the fine. Then be patient and lighten up a little. The more you let go, the greater the subtlety; and the greater the subtlety, the deeper the quietude.Eventually, even the subtle will be interrupted, and the true breathing will appear whereupon the substance of mind will become perceptible. This is because when the mind is subtle, breath is subtle; when mind is unified, it moves energy. When breath is subtle, mind is subtle; when energy is unified, it moves mind. Stabilization of mind must be preceded by development of energy, because the mind has no place to set to work on; so focus on energy is used as a starting point. This is what is called the preservation of pure energy.Buddha said, \\"Place the mind on one point, and everything can be done.\\"If the mind tends to run off, then unify it by means of the breath; if the breath tends to become rough, then use the mind to make it fine. If you do this, how can the mind fail to stabilize?Generally speaking, the two afflictions of oblivion and distraction just require quieting practice to continue unbroken day after day until complete cessation and rest occur spontaneously. When you are not sitting quietly, you may be distracted without knowing it; but once you are aware of it, distraction itself becomes a mechanism for getting rid of distraction.As for unaware oblivion and oblivion of which you become aware, there is an inconceivable distance between them. Unaware oblivion is real oblivion; oblivion that you notice is not completely oblivious. Clear light is in this.Distraction means the spirit if racing; oblivion means the spirit is unclear. Distraction is easy to cure; oblivion is hard to heal. Using the metaphor of illness, one that involved pain or itch can be treated with medicine, but oblivion is a symptom of paralysis, where there is no feeling.A distracted mind can be concentrated, and a confused mind can be set in order; but oblivion is unformed darkness, in contrast to distraction, which still has some direction.Oblivion means the lower energies are in complete control, ruling in negativity and darkness. When you are sitting quietly, if you become drowsy, this is oblivion. Repelling oblivion is simply a matter of tuning the breath. The \\"breath\\" in this case is respiration, not the \\"true breathing.\\" Nevertheless the true breathing is present within it.Whenever you sit, you should quiet the mind and unify your energy. How is the mind quieted? The mechanism is in the breathing, but the mind alone knows you are breathing out and in; do not let the ears hear. When you don't hear it, the breathing is fine; and when breathing is fine, the mind is clear. If you can hear it, the breathing is rough, which means the mind is cloudy. Cloudiness means oblivion, so it is natural to feel sleepy. Even so, the mind should be kept on the breathing.Just maintain a subtle looking and listening. What is \\"looking\\"? It is the light of the eyes spontaneously shining, the eyes only looking inward and not outward. Not looking outward yet being alert is inward looking; it is not that there really is such a thing as looking inward.What is \\"listening\\"? It is the light of the ears spontaneously listening, the ears only listening inward and not outward. Not listening outward yet being alert is inward listening; it is not that there really is such a thing as listening inward.Listening means listening to the soundless; looking means looking at the formless.When the eyes do not look outside and the ear do not listen outside, they are closed in and have a tendency to race around inside. Only by looking inward and listening can you prevent this inner racing as well as oblivion in between.When you sink into oblivion and become drowsy, get up and take a walk. When your spirit has cleared, sit again. It's best to sit for a while in the early morning when you have free time. After noontime, when there are many things to do, it's easy to fall into oblivion. Also there's the need to fix the length of time of meditation; it is only essential to set aside all involvements and sit quietly for a while. Eventually you will attain absorption and not become oblivious or sleepy."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"Despite its billing as a layman's Taoist guide, this book will only make sense to those who are ready, and for those it is transcendental. Ready or not, buy it anyway."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"This book is a good new English translation of the original Chinese text, and nothing more. The reader has to be familiar with Taoist text to unlock the full secret of the golden flower. Cleary seem to have a personal grudge against the translator of the original English version of this book and in doing so it leaves the reader disillusioned as to what exactly is the secret.If you like Taoist literature this book is invaluable, but if you want to learn the meditation technique get you hands on Wilhelm's original translation. Better explanations can be had from Wilhelm."},{"Title":"The Secret of the Golden Flower","review":"If there's one thing about Cleary's translations of various works from the East, it's that he manages to make the text look very exact and highly obscure at the same time. That is, the words themselves seem carefully chosen, but it's hard to decipher what they mean.I am of above-average intelligence and am no stranger to Buddhist or Taoist thought. Nevertheless I found myself reading and re-reading and then re-reading again many of the passages in this translation, and sometimes still turned the page wondering what the hell I'd just read. I've had this same experience with Cleary's translation of the Tao Te Ching, but unlike that book I cannot refer to other translations of Secret of the Golden Flower when I'm stuck (don't even suggest the Wilhelm &quot;translation&quot;).

HOWEVER, I must also caution that the book might be a bit daunting, or overwhelming, for the individual to work their way through on their own. As such, I would characterize the book as &quot;superb&quot; in an HSP support group setting, but perhaps only &quot;good&quot; to &quot;very good&quot; for an individual. That was certainly my personal experience after I bought the Workbook. I made a number of &quot;false start&quot; attempts at working through the exercises in the book by myself, but it wasn't until I got involved in an online &quot;HSP study group&quot; (not so diffuclt to find, by the way) that I managed to get all the way through. Having completed the workbook, I will say that it was a thoroughly worthwhile effort!Here's what you get:This Workbook is essentially a journey of Self-Exploration for HSPs. The early chapters address how to identify and become familiar with your sensitivity; subsequently Dr. Aron takes you through sensitivity in childhood, in social intereactions, and eventually in the context of the workplace and adult (intimate) relationships. Finally, there are sections &quot;deeper wounds&quot; and psychotherapy; medical and health issues, and finally Spirituality. There is also a discussion on setting up, and working within, an HSP group setting.The focus of the chapters is generally on self-examination, &quot;re-framing&quot; past negatives related to your sensitivity, and practical suggestions for ways to go forward. Each chapter has many exercises which are mostly designed to be done in writing, as they require considerable reflection before formulating an answer. This is definitely where a &quot;group discussion&quot; setting becomes most helpful.To get the maximum benefit from the workbook, you DO have to be &quot;emotionally honest.&quot; As such, some of the exercises may be quite difficult to some readers-- since they ask you to look at parts of your life history that may be very painful, as well as areas in which you may feel that your sensitivity is (or has been) a &quot;character flaw.&quot;Final thoughts: Highly Recommended (9 out of a possible 10 bookmarks), especially if you have a support group-- or maybe just a couple of HSP friends-- with whom to share feedback on the exercises."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook","review":"This follow up to the book on the same subject is excellent.

Some are more vulnerable in certain situations than the others.Your self-awareness on the HSP scale is going to get much more in depth, much more refined, more 'sensitive' so to speak. And, that is a very good think.

Her workbook is not at all overwhelming and can be done at your own pace and as in depth as you want to go. I thank Elaine for standing up for those of us that while at times may be in the shadows are certainly not invisible.

That is - if this type of person understands the trait and how to work WITH IT, rather than fight against it or merely hide from life because he or she is so embarrassed about it.

I already know I'm highly sensitive, and so is my daughter (5 years old). Not sensitive in a cry baby way*, but sensitive as in aware of everything, aware of emotions in the room, aware of the lady bug across the yard, aware of things most people walk on by. I was hoping this book would help me (and my daughter) with building some boundaries, help to quit taking other people's \\"bad stuff\\" as our own, quit thinking the worst when bad emotions do happen. As an HSP, I do hurt more, deeply. I also love more deeply too. Also, I didn't like the point in the book about HSPs not being risk takers. I have always been a major risk taker, as an HSP, I hurt more deeply, therefore, I remember not to do the thing that hurt me again, and I am also way more adept at coming up with new ways to do things that keep me from getting hurt, frustrated, tired, etc., again next time I do certain things. It seems like a lot of the population are not very good at lessons-learned. I wish I was more blissful unaware of better ways of doing things, of pain of others, sometimes it really drains my energy. I have always been a risk taker, even in small things like fashion, I'm always ahead of the game, but maybe I'm just more aware of the trends or start a new trend because I am different than others.

This book, and it's companion, the Highly Sensitive Person -- validates what you're feeling or what you go through in life as a \\"HSP\\" (or, let's be honest - BPD sufferer) -- but it doesn't give you any real, helpful tools to try to overcome your sensitivity.I would be apt to recommend any type of DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) book, or even books like Byron Katie's \\"Loving What Is\\" or \\"I Need Your Love -- Is That True?\\" over this."},{"Title":"The Highly Sensitive Person's Workbook","review":"Foreword:I don't fit into any of the neat categories that people write books (&amp; enneagrams) about.For example, I'm neither a &quot;typical female nor male type&quot;.Women are &quot;supposed to be&quot; easily startled by creepy crawlies (which I am), but they're also &quot;supposedly&quot; more fluent, and more capable than men of smooth transition from one topic to another (which I'm *not*, because I get extremely fazed by constant changes of topic).=====================In a similar vein, re: Highly Sensitive People:I have many of the characteristics of an HSP, but:(1) Prozac had no therapeutic effect on me whatsoever(2) I'm not artistic(3) I lack any PSI abilities whatsoever(4) I'm not all *that* disquieted by noiseand so on...Still, I'm very sensitive to peoples' moods, feelings &amp; atmospheres, cry easily, am an &quot;over-thinker&quot; thus getting overstimulated...So I challenge readers of this review to try and classify me according to any of the literature currently available.And so, I repeat, not everyone can be categorized into a neat package of &quot;clustered tendencies&quot;.

Once one's status as an HSP is established, by way of this book's sensitively provided self-tests, the book then goes on to provide the tools to categorise one's sensitivity-type (ST) even further. The rude and insensitive sector of the population (RAIPs) would no doubt be surprised to learn that there are several types of HSP, with different levels of sensitivity depending on the life domain. Introverted, creative, sociable, and worried HSPs everywhere will be grateful to have these tools at their fingertips to increase the depth of their self-awareness on the HSP scale.My own self-awareness journey, however, has been hampered from the beginning by the gaudy colouring of this book's pink and yellow striped cover, with bright green and red overlaid font.

It includes interesting case histories of unexplianed dissappearances and teleportation, and even a few related to time dislocation. However, my main criticism with the book is that is deals mostly with very old cases. The first couple of chapters deal mainly with ancient cases- which could be attributed to legends and myths. The later parts of the book deal mainly with cases from the 14th to early 20th century. if you are sceptical before buying the book, this book will probably not be sufficient to change your mind; but if you read with an open mind, this is a pretty enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Supernatural Vanishings: Otherworldly Disappearances","review":"Davies has written an enjoyable case history book of tales of those who vanish.

I consider myself very middle of the road politically, and believe me, there is nothing objectionable here. The authors are very careful to present both sides of various debates, and those debates are always framed as two sides of a story - and they don't take either side, they just report the controversy and let the reader decide for himself.After reading this book and taking this course, I feel that I understand the newspaper and TV news much better.

I think it fails its job at giving the average college student a good understanding of the macro economy.When explaining simple concepts that should be easy to grasp, the book loads the reader down with obscure mathematical equations and other gobblygook. On rather complicated topics where additional details would help, they try to condense the topics making it difficult to see the big picture. To figure out what I was supposed to learn, I had to use other sources to help me out (i.e. websites and other business books). I also think the authors are poor at making comprehensible analogies.Perhaps the most annoying aspect was the author's injected liberal opinion. In a few chapters, they innuendo their griefs about how businesses are unfair to poor people and that successful individuals should have their winnings reallocated to the less privileged. They also gripe about how not everyone can find a job in a capitalist society. It seems that the authors have little understanding of concepts like competition and motivation to be successful.If you are a course coordinator considering this book for a macroeconomics class, please do your students a favor and seek a different book. As a student, it is more helpful to have a book free of opinions. A book that uses clear explanations rather than confusing lines and charts.

This is not a book that should be read cover to cover in a one or two sittings. I suggest taking it a chapter a day and meditating on each element of Franciscan spirituality in order to look for the deeper meaning of what Bodo is trying to convey.As a whole, I felt that the book started off very strong. The opening chapters are potent with very deep, hard hitting challenges stemming directly from the life of St. Francis and the difficulty of trying to follow a Franciscan form of spirituality. As the book went on, however, the content drifted from a meditation on Francis' life to a memoir of what it has meant for Bodo to live as a member of the Franciscan order. The end of the book returned to Francis in a strong way. This is reason I give the book only 3.5 stars.All things considered, it is a very good book, a worthy read for anyone. You don't have to be a Franciscan (or even a Catholic for that matter) to appreciate the kind of spiritual life that Francis was striving for. This is well worth anyone's time to chew on these thoughts and ask, \\"what does mean for me today?\\""},{"Title":"The Way of St. Francis: The Challenge of Franciscan Spirituality for Everyone","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know who Saint Francis was and why he was so influential in the Church even to the present day.

Fr. Bodo presents Francis as one would present a close friend with whom one is intimately acquainted, and as I have been reading, it seems that there are insights as well as tools with which to embrace Franciscan spirituality in this modern world. I'm not sure that it's a book I can ever say that I have read fully, simply because it is a book to which I will often return; like a devotional reading that one uses in order to be immersed in teaching that is life changing. For anyone interested in knowing more of St. Francis, this is the book. I am now looking forward to Fr. Bodo's other teaching regarding the Franciscan way of life."},{"Title":"The Way of St. Francis: The Challenge of Franciscan Spirituality for Everyone","review":"This book was not exactly what I was looking for.

The chapters are brief, yet they are laden with depth, wisdom and selfless spirituality. I particularly found the chapters on prayer to be intensely profound, helpful and also practical. This book is not written as a &quot;how to manual&quot; on living a God-centered life. What it does is, it sets St. Francis as a role model, an example of living a spiritual life, and it is up to the reader to discover how to follow through with those examples in their own lives."},{"Title":"The Way of St. Francis: The Challenge of Franciscan Spirituality for Everyone","review":"Bodo's &quot;The Way of St. Francis&quot; is a very satisfying read for novices to Franciscan spirituality or veterans.

During those infrequent times, your patience will be well rewarded."},{"Title":"The Way of St. Francis: The Challenge of Franciscan Spirituality for Everyone","review":"This book examines the life of St. Francis from the viewpoint of a modern-day Catholic priest of the Franciscan order.Technically, I grew up a Catholic (albeit my parents almost never took me to church). In my teens, I became sincerely interested in the Catholic church and even considered the preisthood. My parents discouraged me. After some disappointments having to do with the parish where I grew up , and especially after the sex abuse scandals, my interest in Catholicism stagnated. I became an atheist; then I became interested in Chinese philosophy, Judaism, and I started attending Protestant churches. About twelve years ago, I officially went Protestant when I married my wife who is Protestant (specifically Methodist).Having gone to church almost every Sunday, I have spent much more time in the Protestant church than I ever spent in Catholic church. Not-with-standing this, at times I feel a hint of nostalgia for the Catholic church. For example, I was watching the stations of the cross on TV with Pope Benedict on Good Friday and found myself becoming deeply moved. I suppose my feelings about Catholicism as the religion of my youth has led me to this book.Indeed, the book is as much about Catholicsm as it is about St. Francis, and I have come to appreciate the Catholic tradition that is more so based upon the hierarchy, as opposed to Protestantism which is based more towards the individual and the congregation. It is the idea of total and complete submission, that is the essesnce of St. Francis. Indeed, the author, at times describes the union St. Francis and God to be a marital, even a sexual union. Sometimes, as I read this book, I even winced and said to myself, \\"this is getting weird.\\"But it is the idea that St. Francis was so holy that he wanted to be in a state of complete submission to the Lord. Francis's defining moment, indeed, is when he denounces his own father and strips naked before the bishop (and the Lord). It is, in fact, a bit unsettling, extreme, and not the image that I always had of St. Francis as this gentle man who preached to the birds. No, St. Francis is a complex, very human, controversial man who is at odds with his earthly father who he rejects completely in order to give his total self to God. God, ideed, becomes his father, mother, brother, sister, and lover.The author doesn't always present the life of St. Francis chronologically; indeed, he skips around. I was not confused by this; In fact, I thought it added a personal touch. I found myself discovering St. Francis from the outside in, rather than the inside out. As the pages of the book go on, the reader goes on the personal journey with the author as he discovers all the more profound aspects of the life of Francis and how it relates to our understanding of Christ and the church.Indeed, the author really shares his heart with you. At times, he even ventures to criticize the Catholic church itself and he struggles with the idea of the papacy as an institution that, at times, conflicts with his idea of American democracy. Although, he comes to submit himself to the pope, he admits the conflict within him, which points to this book being written on a very human level as opposed to a beautiful story about a plastered saint and a religious way that is nothing but a beautiful path to God. Indeed, the author focuses on how difficult it is to be a Christian.It is a very human portrait of a very human man, and a church that is also human, as well. It has deepened my understanding of the Catholic faith, and now that I understand some of the nuances therein, I find that, even though I have a long past of being disapointed by the church, I have also managed to also see the Catholic church to be something beautiful as well."},{"Title":"The Way of St. Francis: The Challenge of Franciscan Spirituality for Everyone","review":"This is a wonderful book by Murray Bodo,one of the great Franciscan theologians.

This book really matters if you want to deepen your thoughts, clarify the way, and to study the practical life of Francis. In learning how to live as a secular Franciscan in today's culture, it is very helpful to have the opportunity to reflect on how to access a daily practice beginning where you are and with your own thoughts and reasons.The journey of reading The Way of St. Francis manages to make it a very personal one simply because while dealing with the pragmatic this book is also a meditation. Bodo is able to shift the course of one's psyche, such as to allow the spirit to rise and do the listening as one reads. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is serious about his or her life and learning how to love."},{"Title":"How God fix Jonah,","review":"If you love words, their meanings, their sounds, and unexpected usage this book calls out to you. It is filled with Bible stories that are written according to the way that a young African lad would sound telling the stories in a mixture of his own language combined with the new language he is just learning, English. Read silently, you will discover immediately that it is pleading to be read aloud. Read it to children or adults, or a mixture thereof. When I discovered this unique book I had great success reading it to a large group of men, women, and children. They were entranced, mesmerized as they listened attentively. The applause at the end of my sharing was tremendous! Discover, too, individual stories in this book which were originally published as picture books. You will find so many uses for all of these books if only you will read one aloud -- just once!"},{"Title":"How God fix Jonah,","review":"Observing the closed book,one is captured by the clean and clear-cut designs in shades of black, white and gray on the cover. Upon opening it one sees a repetition of color in the illustrations that are depicted in black and white block prints.The way in which the story poems are displayed invites one to read because the lines are usually short and a certain rhythm can be felt. The messages are very clear if you understand the dialect and if you have read the explanations be the author. This is very important. To neglect these interpretations will defeat much of the joy to be obtained from the reading. I enjoyed the special language immensly.It is wise to follow the designated age/grade levels for the best use of the material. Here is an example: I gave copies of 'How God Fix Jonah\\" to two families that include grandnieces and nephews. One little five-year-old, who is an accomplished reader for her age, opened the book immediately and tried it out. In a little while she came over to me with the book in her hands. I asked her what she thought about it. She answered, \\"It sounds a little strange.\\" I tried to explain that this is the way some foreign people talk before they know how to speak English very well. I suggested that she have her parents read it to her. On the other hand, an eleven-year-old has kept it on her nightstand ever since she received it eight months ago.There is a great advantage in having this group of stories compiled and kudos are in order for the author's daughter and the publisher for their collaboration in bringing this work to fruition."},{"Title":"How God fix Jonah,","review":"It is a praiseful book in a differnt cadence.It is powerfful book in its illustrations."},{"Title":"Giant Steps","review":"Giant Steps is an auto-biography of Kareem's first 30-35 years. A lot of people know Kareem as a sullen and bitter man and with good reason. But after reading his perceptions on his own life, you start to get an idea of what shaped Kareem and made him the man he was and how it shaped the man he is today. Raised in NYC, he was always a hoops phenom, always the tallest kid around, and after a few years, he became acutely aware of his blackness. A high school coach spitting a racial slur at him for \\"motivation\\" and a bus ride to racially insensitive North Carolina opened Kareem's (at the time his name was Lew Alcindor) eyes to racial inequality. He developed a keen interest in Islam (Kareem mentions the differences between the Islam he believes versus the Nation of Islam that Muhammad Ali believes in--very interesting take on this) and his own race.After high school, it was on to sunny California and UCLA to play for John Wooden. The UCLA campus, chock full of white folks and scholars, was a bit different from the jazz joints he'd be hanging out at in Harlem.From the US's two greatest cultural epicenters to Milwaukee? From the year-round paradise-like weather of LA to the frigid temps of Wisconsin? From the shelter of John Wooden's hoops program to the spotlight of the NBA and its aggressive media? Life can't change a lot more than that. And Kareem definitely had his difficulties, which he addresses and doesn't attempt to excuse.You can feel Kareem's edge throughout the majority of the bio. The unforgiving chip on his shoulder weighs heavy on him, and after reading and understanding what pushed a bit more you can begin to sympathize with his personal struggles.Near the bio's end you can literally feel weight sliding off of him. It's slow, it's gradual, and it's not complete, but it's the start of something. The \\"Giant Steps\\" title can refer to a lot of things in Kareem's life, New York to LA, LA to Milwaukee, college hoops to pro hoops, Wilt Chamberlain's friend to Wilt's enemy/competitor, but I believe the biggest steps Kareem takes are the steps toward acceptance of himself and others.A companion book to Giant Steps is \\"Kareem\\". \\"Kareem\\" is a bio/diary Jabbar kept during his final season in the NBA. The second book picks up right where \\"Giant Steps\\" left off. His remarkable growth after his 35th birthday is clear to the most unobservant reader.Kareem and his co-author clearly express his development in rich language. This isn't just for hoops fans. \\"Giant Steps\\" is for anyone curious about race relations in America. Anyone curious about what it means to be truly different (7'1\\" black Muslim/basketball player in America in the 60s-80s--not too many of them around) and be forced to feel those differences every second of your waking life should take a look.\\"Giant Steps\\" shows an angry, but passionate young man develop into a thoughtful, (somewhat) outgoing adult capable of contributing much of what he's learned to younger generations."},{"Title":"Giant Steps","review":"This is a decent book. Being an autobiography, it focuses more on the personal than the big picture, which is what most people would be interested in. However, while it often spends an inordinate amount of time on minor episodes in Kareem's life it is a solid book. My only big criticism of the book is that it glosses over his career after around 1977. He says little about Magic Johnson, his relationship with him and the great Lakers' teams of the 1980's and their dominance of that decade, their legendary rivalry with the Bird-McHale-Parish Celtics.

It a simple story, told in a straightfoward, spare fashion. Yet within the framework of this simple story lies a profund piece of work that has an impact on the reader that, like the most beautiful music, lingers long after the last note fades into the night.Makine, for those not familiar with his work, was born in the Soviet Union in 1958. He emigrated to France as a young man. He writes in French. (Music of a Life was nicely translated from the French by Geoffrey Strachan). At the risk of setting out what may sound like a hackneyed cliche, Makine's work for me combines the grace and elgance of the best French writers and the deep soul and conviction of the best Russian writers.Music of a Life is set out as the re-telling of a conversation had between two strangers on a train moving slowly west from Siberia sometime around 1958, the year many thousands finally won their release from the labor camps that dotted the Soviet Far East. Two men sit together. One older man, wearing clothes that mark him as someone just released from the Gulag strikes up a comnversation with his fellow passenger. The story is set out in the voice of the other passenger. As the train moves on the older passenger and the narrator exchange slowly. At some point the older passenger, Alexe Berg, slowly sets out his life story.In 1940, the young Alexe, a classically trained pianist of great talent and promise, was preparing for his debut recital. On approaching his family flat after the dress rehearsal he sees a pre-arranged symbol indiccating that his parents, supposedly dangerous members of the intelligentsia, had been swept up by the NKVD (pre-cursor to the KGB). Alexe makes his escape and finds himself hiding out in the Ukraine in 1941. The devastation of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in June of that year engulfs the Urkaine. Alexe comes upon the body of a dead Soviet solider, a peasant, and assumes the dead soldier's identify. Although this provides him some protection from those who might still seek his arrest, Alex realizes quickly that he must maintain this identity at all costs.Alexe makes it through the war in one piece and, in fact, finds favor with a Soviet general, who keeps him at his side as an aide de camp during the rest of the war. Alexe's survival remains dependent upon his being thought of as a simple peasant. After the war, Alexe finds work with the general's family. The general's daughter takes a liking to the young 'peasant' soldier. Alexe becomes enamored of the daughter. The daughter, whose piano-playing skills are somehwat limited, if earnest, decides to teach the young peasant Alexe a few simple tunes on the piano. These lessons lead, inexorably, to the book's climactic moments.The book leaves the reader (or at least it left me) contemplating the choices and compromises we sometimes make with life. It left me contemplating the question as to how much of myself would I compromise, how much of myself would I keep hidden in order to maintain some small amount of freedom in an unfree world.As I noted at the beginning, this is a simple story, simply told. Yet, as with music, sometimes even simple combinations of notes creates a beautiful mosaic of sound. Makine has done this with the graceful combination of notes that makes up his Music of a Life."},{"Title":"Lifes Music","review":"The book is a story within a story. It begins with a narrator giving prolonged description of a railway waiting room at some snow-bound station in the Urals where a cross section of \\"homo sovieticus\\" wait dully for an indeterminate number of hours (or days) for a Moscow-bound train: the symbolism being that home sovieticus will put up patiently with anything. The narrator feels a revulsion about it all; but among the crowd is Alexei Berg, a musician with whom, when the train finally arrives, he shares a carriage, and he learns about the musician's story: this makes up the bulk of this short book. In 1940, on the eve of what was to be his first performance in Moscow, Alexei has to flee from the police who have come to arrest his family; flees to the Ukraine where he experiences the attack of the Germans in 1941; he assumes a false identity; we hear how he survives the war; lives under the false identity for some years after the war; then, briefly towards the end, that life in post-war Stalinist and even post-Stalinist Russia was arguably even more dangerous, certainly for him personally, than the war had been. As he tells the story, he becomes individualized beyond the homo sovieticus, but as he merges into the crowds on the arrival at Moscow, the narrator's inner voice again murmurs that description: it was, after all, a life not that untypical of those of countless Soviet citizens during those years. But the last few pages pull Berg out of that anonymity again...The other two books by Makine which I have reviewed on Amazon - \\"Human Love\\" and \\"The Life of an Unknown Man\\" - dealt with aspects of Soviet-related experience in an original way. I felt that \\"A Life's Music\\" fell short in that respect: as I said above, Alexei's experiences were not so untypical, and so I found this story nothing like as rich or impressive as the other two."},{"Title":"Introduction to Technical Mathematics","review":"Introduction to Technical Mathematics (5th Edition)This is a new textbook with an ENORMOUS amount of typos!

With the postulate of cost minimization, he demonstrates convincingly how various kinds of organizations can be placed into the analytical framework of economics. In my opinion, this organizational theory needs only some slight extension to become a comprehensive one that includes all organizations under the private property system. With this extended viewpoint, all seemingly complicated issues of organizations can be placed into a unified and systematic framework of analysis. This is the power and beauty of his organizational theory. My opinion is that Henry Hansmann has made path-breaking contribution in the study of this filed, following R. Coase, A. Alchian, and S.

I loved that she was tough without lossing her femenine side.In this book Linda Howard uses a lot of elements that sometimes are missing in a romance novel.There isn't just a happy ending, the characters suffer as we all do in real life.The author also shows the toughnes of that place and time.All in all I loved this book, I liked that the characters were strong and even though they suffered they overcame that pain."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"She writes so wonderfully and her characters are very human. Although the storyline was intense I didn't find it &quot;dark&quot; at all. Reading is meant to be entertaining and or educational. This was both because the early days in the west WERE not easy. There was some violence and a certain ruthlessness in order to survive.That was the reality of that era just as arranged marriages to acquire property were. Jake and Ben (Sarratt) watched their parents build their &quot;ranching kingdom&quot; and then saw them slaughtered for it. They did whatever they had to to survive and get their land back and revenge against the murderers. The &quot;heros&quot; are filled with anger and hate. Should we expect them to behave like choir boys. I don't think so. Some of their behaviour was totally unacceptable. They sure needed counselling in anger management. But all these was back then to change lives and influence behaviour was understand,love and forgiveness. Fortunately Linda's heroines, who don't have an easy time of it, have those qualities in abundance. So the story works. If you don't like realism you won't like this book. It's not fluffy but it is excellent. I only rated this a 4 because I would have liked the ending to have been a little fuller with the redemption of our heros although LH makes it clear they are on the right path."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Scorching love scenes, realistic plot, intense dialogue,and to sum it up : extraordinary.

It's not the author's best work, but it's interesting. In most romance novels, there is an event which separates the couple after they get together. Too many authors disappoint me with their lack of creativity and credibility and use the following event. The couple assume incorrect things about each other based on lack of \\"normal communication.\\" For example, if one had given a straight answer to the other's question there would have been no conflict. In this book, I was impressed with the author coming up with a conflict based on miscommunication, but no one was lying or being vague. Victoria was honest but Jake didn't believe her, and his reasons for not believing her were logical. That was well done, Ms. Howard. Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: thirteen. Setting: 1866 New Mexico cattle ranch. Copyright: 1990. Genre: historical western romance."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I always enjoy Linda Howard's books.

I may be doing it wrong, so forgive me if the way I wrote it is wrong.I loved this book so much. I read it in 5 hours. I have worn out every book. That I now own three copies. You can actually visualize the whole thing. It is as if you are apart of the story. I wished it could have gone on forever I sure did not want it to end. The book starts out fast paced and keeps you spell bound until the end. I wish that there had been a book about the younger brother. I highly recommend this book. It is defiantly worth keeping."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Ever since the night he saw his parents murdered and he and his brother almost killed, Jake Sarratt has patiently plotted, planned and waited until the day he can return to Sarratt Kingdom to claim back his birthright. Now after twenty years, he can finally savor the taste of victory so close to him, that of claiming back their land and killing the men responsible for his parents' murder. But in all his careful planning, never did he expect the complication that a woman would bring to his plans.When her family suffers the devastation of the Civil War, Victoria Waverly makes the ultimate sacrifice by marrying a vulgar, but rich, rancher who pays her parents for the honor. With her younger sister and cousin in tow, she heads to the New Mexican ranch and marries Frank McLain. But what Victoria doesn't realize is that her new husband's property was stolen from the Sarratts years ago, and that one of her husband's gunmen, Jake Roper, the man she can't help but be drawn to, is actually the rightful owner of the ranch. And after Jake fulfills his vow for revenge, Victoria is in for a tougher ride when he tries to convince her to marry him.I couldn't wait to read A LADY OF THE WEST as I enjoyed reading ANGEL CREEK, which is another one of Howard's western novels. Jake and Victoria's story is actually a darker romance and there are also more action scenes in this book. Jake is your typical gunslinger, brave and ruthless, while Victoria, despite her Southern and aristocratic upbringing and seeming gentleness, is a woman of quiet strength and determination. I liked how Jake takes the risk when he makes it his responsibility to protect Victoria and her very vulnerable sister Celia. Although there is a part when he acts like a total jerk, you have to keep an open mind and think of his past and how much hate has consumed him after losing his parents as a kid. In the end, he more than makes up for this by the way he atones for his mistakes.With its fast-paced, engrossing and sizzling sensuality, this book is a very enjoyable read that also features a secondary romance that is quite poignant. Just a warning to those who gets the volume that contains both ANGEL CREEK and A LADY OF THE WEST, read this first to give you a better background on Luis Fronteras, the secondary character."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"At the beginning of this book you meet Jacob & Benjamin Sarratt who are 13 & 11 who have just witnessed their parents being murdered & their mother being raped. Jake & Ben took off & were both shot while trying to escape. The book then starts 20 years later & you meet Jake Roper who is truly Jacob Roper Sarratt working as a gunman on the property that was stolen from his murdered family by McClain. Jake is planning his revenge when Victoria arrives to marry McClain. Jake's plan was to kill McClain & take the property over but now that McClain has married that means the property would go to the widow. His only option is to murder her as well or marry her. Good thing he's instantly attracted to her & wants her as his own.I really enjoyed this book & the other characters add a lot more to this book. The abuse & rape is a reality & I don't mind it every now & then because I don't expect all books to be the ideal fairy tale romance. Although it's not acceptable I believe Jake had very good reasons for being the way he was. Although I recommend this book it should only be read by people that can accept a reality. If you are looking for the picture perfect romance then this is the wrong book for you."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I put off buying this novel many times just because of the negative reviews I read. But, what a surprise that the story is so compelling and heart stopping and such love...hmmm...Jake's and Victoria's hard to gain love is the center of the tale and although some might says that the way Jack shows his love is brutal, I found it romantic and real. Howard's precission on development of the relationship is perfect, not to mention that the plot of the story is never flat boring. I enjoy reading this novel so much that I read it in two seats!The truth is &quot;a Lady of the West&quot; talks realities, passion, love and understanding of the era of 1860s in Texas. It begins with the intro to the SARRAT's half million land of ranch kingdom, the families to be borned on the land and the killing to possess the land. then of course... the healing of a new generation. It is a very unique story, wouldn't mind to reread again.."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"The other one was Angel Creek. Linda Howard's Alpha male exudes sexuality and both plot and character development on many levels are superior, even to her later books. Angel Creek is an extension of Lady of the West in that a minor character from LOTW emerges as part of the plot in Angel Creek. Howard has multiple relationships ongoing in both books. The story is very satisfying and you hate to see it end. Howard is the best of her genre."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Its only the 2nd Linda Howard book I've read and now I want to read all of them! This book has strong characters and a great plot. I didn't want it to end, I wish all books could be this good!"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"First off, this was not a western. It was a VERY long-winded story about one of the most prudish, overly-modest, and physically naive women I have ever come across in print. Chapter after boring chapter went on and on about her and her shocked modesty. This was also not a romance. When the heroine was forced to sleep with the hero, she described her so-called night of passion as \\"painfully intimate.\\" And the \\"hero\\" was no hero at all as he did not have one endearing quality throughout the entire book. It did not shock me that he dabbled in domestic violence.There was also absolutely no story here. Ninety-nine percent of the book took place in the same dull house and dealt with the same flat characters who discussed their same boring thoughts on the dictates of modesty. Even the characters who were supposed to be villainous were a total bust. The only one of interest was Angelina, the raunchy ranch prostitute and she didn't stick around for long. Can't believe this one made it to print.I did enjoyed Marsha Canham's western, UNDER THE DESERT MOON and Nora Roberts' LAWLESS."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"(Warning: Spoilers throughout) I had a hard time \\"rating\\" A LADY OF THE WEST. It started out really well and I was enjoying the story. I liked the fact that Jake was a man scarred by loss and was going to fight to regain control of his parents' ranch; I liked that Victoria was a cool, unawakened lady but with a core of inner strength. She even had enough guts to marry a man she barely knew, in order to keep a roof above her relatives' heads.The romantic tension between Jake and Victoria is nicely kept at \\"sizzle\\" and there is a good buildup to Jake and his brother Ben's seizure of the ranch.But after that point, midway through the plot, the story went pffft for me. Jake morphed into a controlling, domineering hero with a constantly hard you-know-what, making up for lost time with Victoria. Victoria morphed into a miserable little wifey because Jake was excellent in bed, but would just never say those three little words. I will say that Victoria did continue to show flashes of her old gumption and strength, but unfortunately she was also always inwardly boo-hooing due to Jake's unrelenting emotional coldness.I see that some readers took offense to a scene where Jake hits Victoria right across the face. It's certainly not the kind of scene I like reading in a romance novel, but somewhat in Jake's defense, Victoria is telling him she's pregnant *exactly* three weeks after their wedding. He thinks she's carrying the child of her late husband, the man who killed Jake's parents. Jake thinks she's trying to pass off the late husband's baby as his own.While I'm not crazy about the scene (or Jake's immediate assumption that Victoria is tricking him), the author made Jake's reaction *almost* understandable if not admirable. Unfortunately for me, there's nothing much that Jake can do afterwards which makes him any less of a jerk with a chip on his shoulder. In fact, although he regrets hitting her and realizes he made a big mistake, Jake *still* won't 'fess up to Victoria that he loves her.Luckily there are well-written subcharacters in A LADY OF THE WEST who propel the story along, and two smaller romantic subplots involving Victoria's female relatives which helped maintain my interest. But after resolution of the ranch's ownership, which occurs midway through the story, the book was a letdown. The two main characters lost something for me and their now-consummated romance lost all of its tension. It's a chore to wait around for the hero to finally say \\"I love you\\" to the heroine, and this is one of those books where it doesn't happen until the last few pages of the story."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"This was not your usual light romance set in the West. This was one tough and dark book. The hero, Jake, is really bitter, even with reason, and pretty much stays that way. Victoria, the heroine, is one tough woman to put up with it all.Spoilers ahead:He his her! This is not okay If he wanted to make sure she was not carrying another man's child, he should have waited for awhile. He rushes things, then blames her because he may not be the father.I hated that the little sister died. I do not read this kind of book for sadness, but for entertainment. I was glad to catch up with Louis in \\"Angel Creek.\\" That horse should have been let go after he killed the first person (or shot).All said, this is a book that sticks with you, so I stretched it to a 4. If the characters wre real, I would have hoped they would mellow with age."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"This book grabbed me from the very beginning. It started so dark, with the rampage of McClain against the Sarratt family. I instantly got drawn into the story. I'll just say it. McClain is a bastard.Victoria was the bride of McClain, bought and paid for because her family was made poor during the war. She traveled to Sarratt's Kingdom with her cousin Emma, and sister Cecelia. Jake and Victoria had chemistry from their first meeting and I enjoyed watching their game of cat-and-mouse. I enjoyed the buildup that Ms. Howard put into these two characters and their story.This story also had great side characters. I cared about Emma and Cecilia as much as I did the main characters. I enjoyed their relationship with each other and with Victoria. They really were a family and made for a great part of this story. I also enjoyed the relationship between Emma and Ben. Their first meeting was a bit steamy and I knew something was going to happen there. There was also the sweet friendship between Luis and Celia. They made me smile.On page 220, Jake pissed me off and I almost didn't finish reading it. But I loved the characters enough that I wanted to finish their story, so I continued on. Then about page 228, I went \\"Oh wow\\" in spite of myself.Since I'm a reader and not a reviewer, I have a habit of including spoilers when I write about what I've read so I've marked the next two paragraphs as spoilers. Read them at your own discretion.***SPOILER***I've seen A Lady of the West categorized as an abusive book ~ I don't know that I agree with that. Jake did hit Victoria once ~ not purposefully, but he did do it when he thought Victoria was lying to him about being pregnant. He believed the baby was McClain's, even though McClain could never consummate the marriage with Victoria. So he was taken over by rage, thinking Victoria was trying to pass off his enemy's baby as his own. I'm not sure \\"understand\\" is the right word, but I guess I understand how it would happen. It doesn't make it right, but it doesn't make me altogether hate Jake for it either. Then, there's the fact that Victoria slapped him too.***END SPOILER******SPOILER***What ended up happening to Cecelia was heartbreaking. I guess I knew was going to happen when she dropped the apple into Rubio's stall (and the fact that I read about it over at Book Binge), but it didn't make me cry any less. When Luis carried Cecelia's lifeless body back to the house, I lost it. I cried for everyone involved. Cecelia was just discovering what it was to be a woman when her life ended so tragically. She was simple and sweet and really was loved by all the other characters who lived at Sarratt's Kingdom.***END SPOILER***This book was Excellent and is staying on my keeper shelf. I laughed, I cried, I got angry ~ It just made me feel so many things and I know the characters will stay with me for a long, long time. I cared about them all ~ or at least the ones I was supposed to. I definitely recommend this one."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I liked it. I like Linda Howard and thought this one was good as well. Not her best but a good read."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"PLOT SUMMARY:Frank McLain murdered Jake Sarratt's parents and stole their ranch. He also tried to kill Jake, age 13, and Ben, age 11, but the boys got away and plotted vengeance. Now, 20 years later, Jake is incognito, working as a gunslinger for McLain. McLain marries Victoria, an impoverished blue blood from the war torn South. She only agrees to marry McLain because her family is starving. She comes from Georgia to live with him in New Mexico, bringing along her younger sister Celia and cousin Emma. Jake and Victoria fall in love, but it's not a joyful experience for either of them, filled with misunderstanding, pride, and misjudgments. Even though they marry after McLain dies, they don't resolve their feelings until the very end of the book. Meanwhile, Jake and Ben regain their stolen heritage, wiping the McLain stain from the land.MY RESPONSE:This story was rather dark and grim throughout. I never laughed, not once, not even a chuckle. McLain was a sick psycho. Jake was a throwback to male dominance. I grew irritated with his lack of communication. He expected Victoria to trust him, but he never explained anything to her (like, not telling her he would return when he left the ranch). The jerk got mad at her for not trusting him several times, but they barely knew each other, and he was incognito for a large chunk of the story. This happened numerous times. Irritating.Worse, he didn't trust HER when it mattered most. He treated her badly more than once. Except for his kindness to Celia, I felt ambivalent about Jake until the last bit.However, I did like Victoria -- a strong and sympathetic character who didn't take Jake's crap lying down -- well, not until it was time to &#34;lie down&#34; with him, to my disappointment. Wish she'd made Jake grovel. A lot.I also liked young Celia. The only light moments in the book involved Celia's penchant for practical tricks and asking &#34;sensitive&#34; questions about horses, kittens, etc. I liked Luis and Celia's romance, and almost cried at a certain point in the book.The third romance involved Ben, Jake's brother, and Emma, Victoria's cousin. It was fine. I liked Emma. I was glad things worked out for her."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I've read quite a few Linda Howard books. Her earlier work which this book is, is much better than her more recent work (ie Ice & Prey)Ok so first up the controversial hero Jake. Yes he did hit Victoria across the face but what were the circumstances??He thought Victoria was trying to pass another mans baby (his nemesis by the way) as his baby. Do I agree with what he did? NO WAY but stop & remember this was 1800's in those days women had no value & a woman in this position could've been killed by an aggrieved husband & no one would've blinked.Victoria GAVE AS GOOD AS SHE GOT. She moved out of their bedroom & gave Jake the silent treatment for 3 MONTHS!! Jake apologised soon after the slap but Victoria didnt accept his apology or talk to him.Then the next 6 months Jake (after realising his mistake & trying to make amends) knew Victoria still hadn't forgiven him & was probably going to leave him after the baby was born. She made him feel miserable for 9 months to pay for what he did.So given her limited resources & status as a woman of 1800 I think Victoria did admirably to stand up for herself & protect her family. Yes she was prissy but that's how all women were raised in those days.This is definitely not a warm & fuzzy or humourous romance. There was a pervasive dark cloud over this ranch & much tragedy but once Jake let go of the past he was able to build a happy healthy future with Victoria. So this book isn't for everyone but I enjoyed it"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"After reading this story, taken as a whole, I have the lingering feeling it was missing something-- oh, yes-- a heart. The tale of revenge in the old west was gritty enough, I'll grant, with multiple violent, graphic rape scenes. The protaganists- two brothers who survived a family massacre- have nutured their hate and plans for revenge for 20 years. Enter three hopelessly naive women from the war- torn South, one of whom has been sold as a bride to the brothers' evil enemy, and let the good times roll. Oops, my mistake, there ARE no good times in this book. Victoria, the bride and supposedly the strong one, is determined to hold her head high despite the physical and emotional abuse of the Major, her despotic husband, on an isolated ranch which is a world unto itself. She comes to depend on Jake, a mysterious ranch hand, who promises to keep all the other ranch hands away from Celia, her literally too innocent to live sister. Jake, in the meantime, is blackmailing/enticing Victoria to kiss him as often as possible. Jake's reasoning for his actions are simple. Not only is Victoria smoking hot, she is also very vunerable and will be the legal owner of the ranch once Jake kills Major. Jake reasons he will either have to marry or kill Victoria too in order to get full control of the land, and it would be a shame to kill someone who he wants in bed so badly. Love is really not on his side of the equation. Jake is, of course, one of the two wronged brothers. Moving right along, The women try and fail to escape- thanks to the perpetually clumsy Celia- and Jake suceeds in his coup to take over the ranch in a hail of bullets. Victoria marries Jake and develops a hopeless love for the man, despite the fact she is told literally he will kill her if she does not marry him. Victoria becomes pregnant, tells Jake the news, and he promply backhands her against a wall hard enough to split her lip because he thinks the kid has to be her first husband's. The logic of his reasoning that, even if this was the case, it was a betrayal, escapes me since he KNOWS she was the major's wife. Anyway, he says she'll have to send the baby far away once its born since he'll never raise such a child. She grows a bit of a spine a this point and moves out of the bedroom, telling him she's gone once the baby arrives. As a reader, at this point, I am shouting at the book - why, oh why, woman are you not making your way to El Paso, the closest outpost of civilization?! Why wait until the baby comes?!! No, its luuuv. So, naturally, Victoria will hang around for more abuse from a man who hates the child she carries, even though she is innocent of wrongdoing. Victoria's cousin Emma falls in love with Jake's brother who clearly states, over and over, how he wants sex not marriage. And Celia, too stupid to live Celia (god, what an irritating character!), dies under the hooves of a wild horse she like to bring apples to. Well, the women who survive do end up with the brothers. It's not exactly a happy ever after in my opinion, but perhaps everyone does deserve each other. I'll give the author credit. The book is not boring. However, it is not romantic either. I did not like or root for either the Hero or heroine. I will not be revisiting this particular old West again."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"So sad that such a good book was not edited or proofread when converted to Kindle. It is full of typos and garbled sentences that were not in the printed version. Amazon should take responsibility and send out a better edited version to those of us who have purchased this book."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"This was another great story by Linda Howard and I would recommend it. She doesn't sugar coat her stories, they are very realistic and factual and I count on that when I pick one up. Thank You Linda for giving me a chance to escape to another place and time, keep \`em comin!"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"The first Linda Howard book I read was All The Queen's Men, and since then I have read almost all of her earlier and later work. She writes sensual stories, erotic, passionate, usually great character development. I was disturbed by this book in many ways that I haven't been in reading some of her other work. This hero is abusive, emotionally and physically to the heroine and that I just cannot abide. Many of her characters from other books are certainly flawed, like most real people are, but this I just couldn't take and I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I've loved Linda Howard's books ever since i first read After the Night, which remains my favourite book EVER!But unfortunately i didn't like this book at all, or more accurately i didn't like the main characters. Jake didn't have that special quality that all of LH's other male characters do...tenderness combined with strength, he was very harsh and i really objected to the part where he hit Victoria. Victoria was okay but again she just didn't have those special qualities that make me admire Linda's female characters so much.To anyone who's never read Linda Howard i strongly reccomend you read her other books before you read this one."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"The only other Linda Howard book that I really enjoyed was &quot;Angel Creek.&quot; &quot;A Lady of the West&quot; is an exceptional book but sometimes I wanted to strangle the hero in the story, Jake. He was violent to the heroine and even struck her while she was carrying his baby. This book was also about hate, and hate was the dominant theme in the book. But all in all, an excellent book."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"If this was the first Linda Howard book I ever read, I would not have read another. If forced and abusive sex turns you on, this is the book for you. I read it to the end to give it a chance, but was completely disappointed."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"This is my favorite of all of Linda's books. A very naughty bit of literature, but I like it! Pretty hot though, so be careful."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I love Linda Howard's books. This book had everything: tears, love, fighting and more. I loved it!!!"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I love Linda Howard. However, this was the first book I have read where her lead man, Jake, fell short. This book reminded me of a Diana Palmer read, which often includes rough and abusive *heros*. I took issue with the physical abuse, which included slapping a pregnant woman and knocking her over, forcing sexual situations and emotional battering that went on throughout the book. I am a big fan of Cry No More and Kiss Me While I Sleep - this book was not of the same type."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I am a avid fan of Linda Howard. As an author she has consistently given me many, many hours of reading pleasure. I'm usually the first to line up to grab her next release, and constantly search for any previous books I have missed before finding her. I can't tell you how many times I have re-read her work. However... I was greatly disappointed and disgusted when reading this book. I DO NOT approve of violence directed toward women, even in fiction. I don't understand how a woman can fall in love with a man who demonstrates violence toward her. I certainly DON'T want to read about it. No more please.. I would not like to waste my money in this way again."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I love Linda Howard normally, but in this case I would recommend that you steer clear of this book, as it might well turn you off her forever. I would have given it less than one star if I could. To cut a long story short, this book contains scenes of rape and domestic violence, which I found deeply offensive and disturbing - especially since these crimes were committed by the so-called hero! At one point the hero seriously contemplates murdering the heroine in order to gain control of his family ranch. Instead he marries her, and proceeds to make her life misery. I know some women think that, in a historical context, such things are okay, and if that's your opinion, fine. However, most Linda Howard fans love the tenderness and protectiveness displayed by her heroes, and there isn't ANY in this book."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I have recently developed a serious crush for Linda Howard books, but this one was rather disappointing. My overall impression was that it all seemed very barbaric. All male characters treat women like possessions and the hero is no different. I refuse to go with the idea that sex, no matter how great, solves all problems and heals all wounds. The tragic events were sad, but very flat, and the book ended without a proper heart-to-heart conversation between the two main characters. Realistic maybe, but not what I wanted."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"As many times that happened to me I read first the sequel \\"Angel Creek\\" before this one. This time that was perfect because if I had read this one before I'd never read \\"Angel Creek\\".The book's first part was fairly good. But as the love story goes on the book gets boring. What I didn't understand is why one of the girls had to die, that part was just pathetic."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"i was put off when he slapped her, no man should ever hit a woman no matter how angry. that was when the writer lost me. the hero is irrational and cruel. and the heroinne was a weak person that put up with her physical and emotional abuse. He slaps her and she sits in the grass and sews?Then when she wont go back to their bedroom he gets angry? i guess i can understand that years before women were treated badly, but it doesnt mean one likes to read a romance about it.then he forces her to have sex when she is kicking and screaming, if that's been me i would have shot him where it would have hurt. So after he forces her to sleep with him he cant understand why shes not panting after him for a treat like some dog. The mysteries of life!It was kind of disappointing cause i always like l howard books, even the recent ones that no one likes. She has an amazing talent of grabbing your attention and not letting go till the last page, so i guess i'll keep reading her books despite this one, i'm no one to judge, i just don't like men who hit women, so if i sound a little mean in my review i guess its just my temper =), oh well."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I've enjoyed lots of Linda Howard's books, but I must say that there are quite a few that left me disappointed. A common problem being, the hero gets away too easily after treating his lady shabbily. I was thoroughly disgusted by the hero in this book. He actually slapped her so hard, she slammed into the wall!! Gosh.... and he got away with it later, as if it was just a petty quarrel over who's to do the dishes! For a great story, try Son of the Morning or Midnight Rainbow. There are many other great stories from Ms Howard, but I enjoyed these 2 the most! ^_^"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I have read many books of Linda Howard and I must say I was rather disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors. I have read nearly all of her books and have had A Lady of the West in my &quot;to be read&quot; stack for over a year now. I had not chosen to read it because of its three and one-half star overall rating. I wisely use the tools offered on this site and seldom read a book rated less than four stars. But I wanted to read another Howard book and picked up A Lady of the West. I was able to determine three things rather quickly:First: This was unlike any of Howard's other books I had read.Second: The hero's behavior is politically incorrect - to say the least. He is the first hero I have ever read who hit the heroine and he also plays the &quot;forced seduction&quot; game which many of us would consider rape.Third: I quickly realized the overall rating on this book must be due to the hero's mean-spirited behavior rather than the quality of the writing. Sure enough, when I checked the reviews, most of the negative reviews are because of the second item detailed previously. Make no mistake - this is a dark book.Victoria Waverly is the daughter of a formerly wealthy, Southern family who has been impoverished by the Civil War. Victoria is basically sold into marriage to a wealthy rancher, Frank McClain, and is bravely attempting to do the right thing for her family. Once she meets her future husband, she is repelled and frightened. He is one bad villain and Victoria has no idea that he killed and literally stole the large ranch he now calls his own. But Victoria is ever vigilant - intent on protecting her family from literal starvation - especially the two family members who have come with her to live at the ranch. She must consider her cousin and her younger sister's situations as well. She believes that they will be safe and taken care of at the ranch. She is a strong yet gentle heroine written in true Linda Howard fashion. She is surprised to find that she is strongly attracted to one of her husband's main men, Jake Roper, and finds his actions towards her frightening yet very sensual.Jake Roper is a hired gun and one of the best. Twenty years ago, his mother and father were murdered; the two sons wounded and assumed dead, in a takeover of the large Sarratt ranch. He finds himself almost obsessed with his boss's new wife and finds it most inconvenient. You see - Jake is planning revenge on Frank McClain. He hates the man and will avenge his parents' death at the hands of this worthless thief and reclaim his family's home.Actually, I found Lady of the West to be out of the ordinary with a fragile tenderness and strong sensual overtones. There was not a boring page and the book contains several strong and very interesting secondary characters. While considering the reviews, I read repeatedly that this book is a product of its time - written either in the 1980s or 1990 at the latest. It is a book that holds a common thread with many books written during that timeframe - mistreatment of women. Now, I was personally appalled when the hero struck the heroine. I had never read that before - at least not the heroine. But I also read it as part of the overall story. Yes, it was very wrong for Jake to treat Victoria in such a manner. But he was never glorified for it. He certainly was not proud of himself. I know situations such as this occurred much more often than we want to admit. This story takes place over a hundred years ago - women weren't always treated with a lot of respect. But I am certainly not defending the hero. He was definitely a tarnished hero - he never gets rid of that stain. And THAT is part of the story. This is a story that contains revenge, hate, and mistreatment by many more than the hero. Taken with the context of the story, a mean hero only plays out his part. I don't think that Jake is ever redeemed of this behavior. That is one thing that makes this an unusual romance - it's HEA ending has a few spurs - and the ending is probably closer to reality and therefore, the sting.However, buried in the midst of this mistreatment is one good story. As expected in a Linda Howard book, the sensual scenes are strong and rate 4.0 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines). Somehow she pulls out a story that actually has three separate physical relationships developing without the book appearing as too sensual. Try to read this book within the context and I believe you will enjoy it. But remember - it is one tough story."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I have not picked up a Linda Howard book and not liked it. This book was no exception. I had looked at the reviews and was not sure how this book would be. Hearing how he hit her and all he did was \\"want\\" her and all that. I thought the story would have Jake as the biggest butt and Victoria as weak willed, under Jakes thumb. Not so, was the case. It took just a little while to get started, but once I got through the first 30-50 pages, it all came together and took off on a wild ride. I loved the lead heroine. Vicotria was great. She did not take Jake's crap and gave as good as she got. Yes, Jake does hit her but first of all, it did flow with the story line, he did not get away with it what so ever. He never thought it was OK. No, none of it makes it right, but you can see how it fits in there and the outcome the action is surprising. Yes, Jake did talk an aweful lot of \\"wanting\\" Victoria, but it was to the point of obsession, something the reader should be able to figure out is not just lust. That he does want not just her, but all of her, and that he equates feelings with sex. So, while you know how Victoria feels, you have to look at Jakes actions to see how he feels. Very intraciate. I love how it all got blended in together. Jake was very dominate, but such a sweetheart, I couldnt help but love him. It took me not even a day to read this book. Near the end of the book I cried. When it was over wanted it to go on for just a few more chapters. This book is not like her newer releases, not a romantic suspense. The story does have its own darker plot, but nothing too serious. This book was great! I loved it and it will go on my keeper shelf. I dont know when I will get to read it again, it made such an impression, I dont think I am likely to forget this story any time soon. Victoria is one of my all time favorite heroeins. I really liked her, Jake was a great guy too. Usually the guy is too much of something, overbearing, rude, mean, too cockey, something, not Jake. And Victoria was strong and very likeable. They had an underlying heat through out the whole story. You could feel it. Please get this book and you'll love it. As long as you dont expect it to be like every other story (I dont know why people do that. Stories are suppose to be different with different plots.) Lady of The West has it all."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"A long time ago (like four years back), in a far away land (California), I was introduced to Linda Howard's books by my best friend ... and I hated them. I found them drab and terribly long and would've had more fun poking myself in the eye with a fork and swirling it around. Then, a few days ago, I was walking through my local grocery store, restless and in need of some greater fulfillment than what I had gotten from another book I had just finished. I stood in front of the book section for at least a half hour perusing their small selection. A bit reluctantly (but desperate now), I picked up the Linda Howard book, remembering how my best friend had oozed out praise for this author. So I thought, &quot;Ah, what the hell,&quot; and man, was I ever shocked! A Lady of the West has been one of the best, if not the best, book I have read in years! It had everything a western should have: shoot outs, legends, bloody revenges, ranches, cowboys, the whole nine.The book starts with a short history of Sarrat's Kingdom, and how things came to be the way they were, taking the reader back more then a hundred years. Then Howard goes to tell of how the Sarrat's became over thrown and how the evil Major came to get a hold of the land. The time frame is post-civil war, and out of sheer desperation to save her family from starvation and death in the war ravaged South, Miss Victoria Waverly allows herself to be sold in marriage to the Major. She takes West with her her little sister, Celia, and her cousin, Emma (who was left with no other relative but the Waverlys by the war). There, for the first time, she meets her husband and Jake Sarrat (kept incognito to his nemesis by the name Jake Roper).The intent (plot) of the book was clear from the beginning: Jake Sarrat, who's parents were killed by the Major 20 years ago, has come back to take back what belonged to him. What kept me glued to the book until the wee hours of the morning was the &quot;how&quot;, not the &quot;what&quot;. How was he going to do it? And one was kept waiting to see what was going to happen next.The romance was a bit slow to start and perhaps could have been done a little more smoothly with more interaction between the two main characters and the hero's &quot;sudden warming up&quot; to the heroine I thought defied his character (he melted too fast) but the story going on around them was good enough to the point where how they fell in love and/or whether they fell in love was second place. Towards the end, their misunderstandings and emotional misunderstandings became frustrating to me. Why didn't either one just spit it out, get on with it! Come on now! But their pride and ignorance kept bumping heads and had me bumping heads with the wall right along with them.Howard's sometimes brutal reality was definitely one of the elements that kept me turning pages. She spared no one from reality. All too often in romance novels, next to nothing horrible happens to the hero or heroine themselves. No real great lost or tragedy to them, just to the people around them. Howard brings you to the pinnacle then saves you just in time. Through out much of the book, I was caught in a series of &quot;Oh no.. Oh no! .. Oh ... no... I can't believe this is happening! She (Howard) can't let him do this! She (Howard again) has to save them! &quot; and gasps of shock then of relief when by what HAD to be fate, the plot twisted and temporary respite was found. I would definitely rate this book a 4. This book was so good, I snuck it to work just to read what was going to happen next! (And I have NEVER done that before with any other book!) I only keep it from gaining a 5 star rating because I thought the hero's feelings were a bit forced to create a romance. I have definitely changed my tune about Linda Howard now though and will be writing my best friend to thank her for trying to introduce me to her books oh so many years ago. Her attempt to convert me into a Howard fan was slow coming, but successful."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Okay, I just wanted to say that the synopsis above doesn't say enough for this book! Yes, it's about a woman sold into a loveless marriage to a ruthless rancher, but that rancher is *not* Jake; he is the ranchhand who, with his brother, was the rightful heirs to the ranch until the current rancher (the husband) killed their parents and tried to kill them as kids. Victoria only married him to provide for her family because the Civil war had ravaged their southern plantation (in other words, her family SOLD her to this rancher). She is resigned to a loveless marriage to someone she comes to find is a ruthless murderer until Jake and his brother take back what is rightfully theirs, and Jake lays claim to Victoria's heart. It's a realistic story, with several tragedies that would have made me cry if I'd been the type, many action sequences that would make a choreographer dance in delight, and (never forget) a heart stopping romance plucked right from the mind of one of the greatest romance writers. :) Believe me, you will like this book. The lady is proper but she has a backbone of iron; you wouldn't want to mess with her! Buy it; you certainly won't regret it. :-)"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Southern born and bred Victoria Waverly was practically sold to her husband so that her family could eat. Despite her coolness, she proves that she can stand up to Jake, the rightful heir of Sarratt's Kingdom. Jake finds himself attracted to the aloof Victoria and decides to have her when his plan to regain his land comes to fruition. The secondary love story between Ben and Victoria's cousin Emma was good, too. The way the author depicted life in the West seemed so real, I felt like I was there. The only part that disturbed me was when Jake found out Victoria was pregnant. He believed it was her dead husband's (who also killed his parents to get the land). When she tried to tell him that the man couldn't perform his husbandly duty, he treats her shabbily. The heroine was a better person than I. I found it hard to get past what Jake did, even though it didn't happen to me. By the end of the book, I was nearly in tears (if you read it, you'll find out why). I hope there will be a sequel about future Sarratts."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"A Lady of the West is a dark book which is bound to disturb yet intrigue the reader at the same time. Make no mistake, this isn't your usual, light hearted fluffy romance designed to give you butterflies in the stomach. It opens with a brutal scene which sets the motion for a chain of events in the story's present. This scene also gives you great insight into the hero's character- why he is the way he is (not that it is justifiable), why hatred consumes him and why he is so driven with revenge.*** Warning: SPOILERS ***I know a lot of people were offended that Jake struck Victoria... I was, too. There's no doubt that this act was wrong and inexcusable but to be honest, I thought it fit in with the overall dark tone of the book which had to do with the core of hatred the hero fed off since his parents were murdered. Jake Sarratt is NOT one of the nicer heroes you see in the genre- nor was he supposed to be, given his history. Most of the time, stories like that irritate me- stories where the hero is wronged and takes it out on the heroine. I didn't feel this way while reading this book, because Linda Howard portrays the character's angst and trauma so convincingly. You don't excuse the hero's actions of course, but you do see it coming in the context of ALOTW.Victoria Waverly, though ladylike and genteel, did not take kindly to this either, and she made certain Jake knew it. It was amusing how consumed he was by her, and touching how she was able to make him forget the legacy of his past.Aside from that issue, the chemistry between the couple is amazing. Linda Howard is a master at writing his/her interaction, and the contrast between the gentle lady and the tough gunman- the unwanted attraction between them, the secret meetings, etc. make for a very exciting romance. Jake can't get his hands off her, eventually falls head over heels for her, while Victoria is ashamed (due to her strict upbringing) for being unable to resist his advances, but eventually she succumbs to it...and gains her own personal happiness.The side characters also manage to be interesting without overshadowing the main characters. Major Maclaine is disgusting and so is the slimy Will Garnet- I was extremely gratified when Jake gave the latter his just desserts. Celia Waverly (Victoria's sister) is a bit of a simpleton, but matures when she meets her match. Ben Sarrat (Jake's brother) and Emma Gann's romance also blossoms into something beautiful to see.Overall, ALOTW is an excellent romance, one that will entertain, anger, and ultimately affect you. I would recommend this to anyone who could get in the mood for a dark romance, and a lively Western. While reading this, never once did I doubt Jake's love for Victoria...it was just a matter of him realizing it and getting over the issues which plagued him. Once he gets around though, he becomes very tender and protective towards her and their baby. The story ends none too perfectly, but it shows a glimpse of hope and of the couple looking forward to a new beginning. :)"},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"Years ago Jake Sarret and his younger brother, Ben, watched his mother and father murdered, and were driving from their land by the evil Major. Now 20 years later he plots to kill the man who killed his family, and take back his land. He works on his old ranch for the Major under the name Jake Roper, waiting for the right time to have his revenge. His plans change however when the Major marries a young southern lady, Victoria Waverly. Even as he finds himself more and more attracted to her, Jake cannot get past the fact that she willingling married a man who he hates so much. Victoria, traped in a marriage with a very cruel man finds herself attracted to Jake, but holds herself back from him. Jake promises to protect Victoria, and her cousin and younger sister who traveled with her, but when Victoria finds out his secret she doesn't know if she can trust him. Does he really care for her, or just for the land he once lost and could regain by marrying her after the Major's death?This was yet another great book by Linda Howard.

In fact I read the first 8 chapters overnight and was late to work the next day, LOL. It was a fast paced book and was such a page turner. I can't wait to read it again!Whoever has given this book a bad review isn't able to cope with reality. What A Lady of the West tells is all real - and wonderfully written at that.VERY heated love/sex scenes.Very strong characters.Very good details about the western time period.Very very awesome.A must have. A definite keeper. One of my favorite books."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"First, yes this contains spoilers. I gave this book two stars because the portion up until where the hero actually hit the heroine, and draws blood, was very good. I was surprised that all of a sudden it seems like a switch was flipped on the hero. He went from rough but good protective man (which is great, and I love reads on alpha males), to a husband that strikes his wife, feels really no remorse, and then demands she move her stuff back into their bedroom. I also thought of the Heroine as strong up until that point, but she actually refuses to leave the hero, even when after hitting her he tells her she can leave him. He also gives his token word not to hit her again, which I feel is in every pamphlet under warnings for battered women.So, good book up until page 291, and then it was over for me. The Hero just starts doing selfish acts. No husband would keep a horse around that killed a family member because he wants foals. The author also makes an attempt to tidy the Emma/Ben story line but it comes off as he is marrying because she gets pregnant.So two stars for a good read before page 291, and then it goes down hill. I love Linda Howard too, but this was wrong."},{"Title":"A Lady of the West","review":"I really enjoyed this Howard book. The story moves and the characters crackle with emotion. I had trouble putting it down. The lady in the story is delicate and strong with a backbone to match the hero, who happens to be very much larger in size than she. I love ladies who can meet the challenge of a strong man and make him see the error of his ways. That happens in this book, he is laid low and I applaude her for introducing us to another heroine who will not lie down and be walked over. Bravo Linda!"},{"Title":"Scripture twisting in the seminaries (Trinity paper)","review":"Dr. Robbins' book is rabidly opposed to what Robbins calls &quot;rabid feminsim&quot;. Unfortunately, this book doesn't really contribute anything to the discussion of the role of women; Robbins argues against those Christians who are trying to make radical feminism acceptable in the church. Well and good, but it has been done before by many theologians--anyone familiar with the history of the debate surrounding women's rights will know that for most of history, church has been a spectator sport for women, which is what Robbins wants. I think Scripture backs him up in regard to his thoughts on women's role in church. However, Robbins goes beyond that and wants to apply church principles to society, arguing that women should have no say whatsoever in political realities. God Himself doesn't go that far. Robbins abandons his standard of sola scriptura on this point and appeals to &quot;nature&quot;, statistics, and tradition to support his point; none of those can work. Scripture in fact allows women to hold political office (it wasn't common, but neither is altruism--rarety doesn't make something wrong), to own property, to conduct business, to handle her own financial affairs, etc. Robbins has handled a problem that exists only for those to whom Scripture is not the sole authority for faith and practice; in handling it, he abandoned that standard himself.Robbins' book gets three stars for being a thorough critique of the misinterpretations of Scripture that radical feminism has brought into the church. His abandonment of sola scriptura in an effort to make life a spectator sport for women is why this book didn't get five stars."},{"Title":"Earthblood","review":"Earthblood (1966) is a standalone SF novel in the far future of the Retief Universe.

Later, the guard threatens to kill Roan and he is that Roan will surely kill him.Roan is visited in his cell by Stellaire. She shows him around the ship and introduces him to Iron Robert. Raff is enamored with Stel and spends much time with her.Roan also spends time with Iron Robert. When the Iron Man is hurt in a fight with a more massive saurian, Roan gets Iron Robert back aboard the ship and insists on having the doctor treat his injury. After the casts are removed, Iron Robert is completely healed. The crew is amazed at his recovery.Then the ship is attacked by another warship. Stellaire is pinned by a steel beam and dies in the fire. Dread is impressed with Roan's Terran looks and takes Roan back to his ship. Roan insists on taking Iron Robert with him.This tale brings the pirate ship into the range of a Niss battleship. Dread insists that Iron Robert be left behind on the pirate ship. Roan leads an attack on the Niss ship with his sixty foot armed lifeboat.This story has remained in my memories since the original publication in If magazine. Then I read the hardback and read it again a couple of decades ago. It is an exciting and meaningful tale about a lost empire and a scattered culture.This novel is also included in an omnibus of Laumer & Brown tales:Earthblood & Other Stories. In 1966, Laumer also publishedThe Time Benderand Brown publishedSybil Sue Blue.Unfortunately, Brown died in 1967 at the age of 41. She was just beginning a promising career.Highly recommended for Laumer & Brown fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interstellar adventures, armed and unarmed combat, and a touch of romance.

A coming of age story!"},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"Despite the title, the book says much about how Western culture developed into modernity and post-modernity, and how that impacts Westerners on many levels, and little about how all this explains \\"the roots of global rage.\\" Pearse also does a good job explaining how traditional (pre-modern) cultural values make sense in their context and are in many cases more stabilizing than Western ones.The title topic is certainly touched on, but no more. Even where the cultural differences are cited as the cause of this rage, there is little exploration of alternative hypotheses such as competition for resources, perceptions of exploitation, jealousy, and, in the case of political Islam at least, a specific goal of defeating Western culture and bringing a different one into play even in \\"Western\\" countries.Despite this, the book is a brief, well-written, well-structured look at the development of Western values and modes of thinking that we now take for granted. It raises many questions about whether some of these values promote our survival or are ultimately self-destructive.An example of a Western cultural value Pearse discusses is that of progress. He shows how, until roughly the 18th century at least, social and political legitimacy depended on tradition, links to the past, so that change was either rejected or justified as a way of getting back to a past golden age. This pattern still is the common one in traditional societies. Since that time, though, progress has become a underlying assumption -- everything is getting better over time. One result of this is a devaluation of tradition, ancestors, and our history, which are all now seen as simple, unenlightened, oppressive, and so on. This attitude is so at odds with all the rest of the world that it contributes to the rest's dismay over what it sees as the West's anti-value stance.Good reading, at a popular level. The ideas are quite important for all Westerners (especially since the survival of Western culture is one of the questions in doubt) and particularly for anyone working in a cross-cultural situation. It is written from a Christian perspective but in such a way that it neither evangelizes for that perspective nor makes it necessary for the sense of the book."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"I spent 2 years in the Far East while in the military years ago, mostly on the island of Okinawa, but with temporary duty assignments in Thailand, Taiwan, and Japan. Although, I suppose, most of the local residents knew that their personal experience with Americans was only a small snapshot of the total picture, I certainly wondered what they thought of us, based on the many carousing GI's with seemingly little regard for morality and with money to spend. In many respects I thought way too many of us were very poor ambassadors for America. Just what do non-Westerners think of America and Americans? Based on many poor examples of those they have come into contact with, based on motion pictures and Western television programs, perhaps not very highly. But, on the other hand, America is also known for our impressive prosperity, our freedom, our stable government, and for our generosity. Meic Pearse attempts to analyze just how America is viewed by non-Western nations, and why many of them feel threatened by us, and many others go beyond that and hate us. Meic Pearse, at the time of writing this book, was associate professor of history at Houghton College in Houghton, New York. He received his D.Phil degree from Oxford University in ecclesiastical history.The book has a Preface, an Introduction, eight chapters, and a Conclusion. The chapter titles are as follows: 1. Barbarian Juggernauts, 2. On the Importance of Being Earnest, 3. How to Be Sinless: Human Rights and the Death of Obligations, 4. Killing the Past: Tradition, Progress and Unprogress, 5. Impersonal States, 6. Imagined Communities, 7. Divided Lives, Infantilized Culture, and 8. Observations in Passing?Many of us Americans think, and frequently say, that America is the best country on planet earth, and we do so with patriotic pride, and we seem to be amazed that not everyone around the globe agrees with us. We seem to think that everyone, and we do mean everyone, wants to be an American, and if they don't, there must be something wrong with them. To entertain even for a moment that we Americans may be culturally, or in any other way, inferior is something that we will not or can not do. Yet Pearse asks us to do just that, and even near the beginning of the book. In the Introduction he writes \\"there are several factors that make it increasingly urgent for Westerners to obtain a clear view of what makes their own culture tick so that, seeing themselves, they can more clearly understand why the rest of the world considers them - as it most assuredly does - to be dangerously seductive, but domineering, barbarians.\\" Lest I start getting hate mail for even reviewing this book, let me assure you that I am a patriotic American and there is no other place that I would rather live. However, I am also a Presbyterian, so the idea of introspection and self-critical analysis is not foreign to me without feeling that doing so necessarily means condemnation. Pearse is also obviously of this opinion. A passing reference to the possibility that we might be barbarians in the eyes of others might be hard enough to let go without expressing our own rage, but Pearse has a whole chapter on the subject.In Chapter 1, Pearse repeats the charge again, but with much more detail: \\"The truth is that Westerners are perceived by non-Westerners (if we can make such a huge generalization about a truly global phenomenon) as rich, technologically sophisticated, economically and politically dominant, morally contemptible barbarians.\\" There, he said again. But he goes on, suggesting that we are gleefully oblivious to our own imperfections (of course, all present readers excluded), writing as follows: \\"Very many, especially Third World, people have the sensation that everything they hold dear and sacred is being rolled over by an economic and cultural juggernaut that doesn't even know it's doing it . . . and wouldn't understand why what it's destroying is important or of value.\\" Clearly not everyone is going to agree with this assessment, but it would perhaps be useful to at least consider his arguments before dismissing them. To appreciate his arguments, of course, requires reading the book. This review cannot contain the details. However, a brief selection may be of help: \\"Why barbarians? For despising tradition, the ancestors and the dead. For despising religion, or at least for treating it lightly. For the shallowness and triviality of their culture. For their sexual shamelessness. For their loose adherence to family and, sometimes, also to tribe. For their absence of any sense of honor.\\"In Chapter 2, Pearse discusses hypocrisy and suggests that postmodern Western societies have, to some extent, thrown off hypocrisy, but at great expense in doing so. \\"When Jesus denounced hypocrisy in the Pharisees, he did so while speaking to an audience who believed, as he did, in traditional moral codes in their full rigor. He called on his followers to be above hypocrisy. If postmoderns are guiltless of this failing, however, it is not because they are above hypocrisy - but because they are beneath it. Without in the least detracting from Jesus' denunciations of Pharisaic moral double-dealing, I would venture to suggest that our circumstance is one that the gospel writers - indeed, any premodern sources - did not entirely envisage. To be guilty of hypocrisy, one has first to accept the validity of the morals upon which it is predicated - and our culture, uniquely, does not.\\" Maybe the term \\"barbarian\\" isn't so bad after all. That term suggests some sort of cultural inferiority. To suggest that America is morally inferior is an even greater outrage. But before we dismiss it, perhaps some reflection may be in order.Chapter 3 gets even worse, while more subtle. Pearse claims that the concept of \\"human rights are essentially an invention of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment.\\" He further claims that a human right is \\"a moral right that is claimed simply by virtue of one's existence. This, we have observed, is a concept foreign to Scripture, and indeed to the entire world before the eighteenth century.\\" So what's wrong with this? \\"The only obligations, in human rights discourse, are corporate, not personal.\\" What is needed to meet human rights, where they are championed, are governmental programs, entitlements, and increased taxes. Such things are not to be called charity, as charity would be an affront to the rights of the recipients. That is at least one reason why faith-based programs are opposed by some. For not only is charity potentially an affront to the recipients, it also carries the implication of personal obligations to those providing the charity. Our society seems to revel in group guilt, while it denies personal guilt. \\"As members of a group or groups, we are full of ridiculous self-loathing: as individuals, however, we acknowledge no shortcomings (certainly no specific ones) at all. To do the latter would be to accept the burden of obligations, which would be to hamper our freedom, and to compromise our rights.\\" \\"We wish not for people to give to the poor but that financial support to be supplied; not for individuals to care but for care to be given; not for people to provide for the needy but for provisions to be made.\\" We carry this even to the care of our elderly parents, as if it is the government's responsibility and not our own. It is the government's responsibility to provide us with health care, and to rebuild our homes after being destroyed by natural disaster and we failed to have appropriate but available insurance. The trend is to remove all personal obligations whatsoever. This is how, in our society, to achieve sinlessness. The only sins are corporate, of the group, none for the individual. Now, of course, this is presented somewhat as a hyperbole as our society is not homogeneous, but, in my opinion Pearse is making a valid point. \\"Little wonder that the sense of personal sinfulness, even among Christians, is largely superficial. And that superficiality is reflected in our lives.\\" So what does Pearse charge those of us in the West with in this chapter? He charges us with being superficial. We are superficial, immoral, barbarians that just happen to have a lot of money and power. Perhaps we are beginning to see why others may not think so highly of us.In Chapter 4, Pearse charges that Westerners have separated themselves from the past. So absorbed with progress, there is no room for tradition. Part of this, in America at least, is the result of our melting pot society.Chapter 5 isn't so much a criticism of the West as it is an explanation of how we differ from many other societies. In my opinion it describes one of the ways in which America has excelled. The American political structure is law-based almost to a fault. We sometimes complain about how there is a law controlling or regulating almost everything, and one cannot possibly know all of these laws. But what is the alternative? Pearse refers to our society as an impersonal state, whereas many others may be referred to as personal. As he describes it, in a personal state elected or appointed officials have personal authority, as opposed to simply applying laws that have been enacted. This has been very helpful to me in understanding other societies that can seem arbitrary and even corrupt but where that is not necessarily the case. There may not be a library full of laws. Rather, a local official is charged with using his own good judgment in making routine decisions to uphold order and administer justice. While I think the impersonal method of the West is superior in that it is less arbitrary, more just, and less open to corruption, his analysis is very helpful in understanding differences. For example, as Pearse explains, \\"The world over, outside of the sheltered confines of a few Western countries, it is expected as a matter of course that policemen will use their authority to extract payment from members of the public.\\" That is, in such societies the simplest form of taxation is often used: extracting payment for services on the spot. This can, of course, lead easily to corruption, but it is helpful information.The rest of the book, in my opinion, fades away with a confusing whimper. Or at the very least I am not willing to follow the author. It is one thing to step back and review what is good and bad about our society, to think critically about who we are and how others may perceive us, but it is quite another thing to seemingly long for a premodern, personal society as if it has been demonstrated to be superior. Clearly, those of us in the West should not be adverse to evaluating the society in which we live, however imperfect we may be in that evaluation. It is a good exercise, and this book is helpful in doing it. However, the lessons learned from such an evaluation are another matter. I think Pearse has contributed to an understanding of why the rest may hate the West, but the reasons he discusses do not necessarily indicate that all the blame resides with us. For one thing the West is very diverse, and not everyone in America, for example, hold to uniform values, as Pearse readily recognizes. Many in America are moral, and hold traditional and family values every bit as much as those he describes in other societies. What's more, many of those in other societies immigrate to America and continue to hold to their values even though there may well be pressure in America against those values. Also, I think it must be said, and Pearse does not say it, not very well anyway, that even with the differences that Pearse describes between the West and other societies, hatred is not justified!"},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"This book presents a very carefully-constructed, logical approach to the complex issues that separate the West and the non-West.As a Westerner currently living in a non-Western country, I found myself nodding and saying, \\"Aha!\\" a lot of the time. Pearse's arguments and contrasts between contemporary Western culture and other cultures are on the money!Pearse uses a good balance of historical examples and statistics to support his claims and arguments. Though he writes from a Christian perspective, he does not come across as judgmental or morally superior. In fact, he levels a number of criticisms against Christians (using the pronoun \\"us\\" to include himself among the criticised). Then, in his closing remarks, he concludes that any future sustainable society that grows out of the Western culture (or anti-culture) will likely be founded on a religiously diverse collection of cultures which are both convinced of their own beliefs and tolerant of others.As a few other reviewers have suggested, the title of the book feels a bit misleading. The first half of the book is quite true to the title, but the second half continues with a strong focus on the failings of western culture and the danger the West poses to itself, rather than in relation to the non-West. As such, the book's title is perhaps only a starting point. A more accurate (but less succinct and certainly less catchy) title might be: \\"Problems in Western culture (or anti-culture) and their Impact on the Relationship between the West and the Non-Western World.\\"Overall, this is a very readable, challenging book, full of striking insights and wisdom."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"This is a noble book. The author writes from a Christian perspective to a presumably Christian audience, challenging them to embrace their own history and its values as a means of entering into any meaningful dialogue with other cultures who hold opposing values. He incisively points to the West's redefinition of \\"tolerance\\" as a breaking point with its own history as well as with that of non-Westerners. Whereas the rest of humanity has viewed tolerance as the ability of groups who share opposing viewpoints to negotiate a peaceful co-existence, the modern West has redefined tolerance as \\"a dogmatic abdication of truth-claims and a moralistic adherence to moral relativism.\\" Moreover, the modern West uses its cultural influence and military might to impose this anti-values system on the world. Pearse goes on to chronicle the manner in which this way of thinking threatens to unravel traditional culture. He concludes with a call back to traditional morality, asking Christians to engage the non-West from a staunchly Christian perspective rather than abdicating Christianity's truth claims to the relativistic culture of the West. His point is that the non-West will be more inclined to enter into a dialogue with an honest, self-embracing religious culture than with an a-historical, self-consciously morally relativistic culture.Pearse also takes the reader on a historical journey, discussing the manner in which pre-Modern Western society once adhered to a common set of values which was maintained through personal relationships imbued with loyalty (think: Western Civ. 101/ feudal relationships). The past was also marked by a commingling of personal and private life, free from the stark division between these spheres which has come to characterize modern existence. He carefully examines the way in which his pre-modern culture was maintained, even discussing some of its reinforcing elements as mythical. Yet he holds up this constructed reality as starkly contrasting our present, constructed reality, as a better example of how to exist. His call to Christians to return to traditional values is a call to an older social reality that he readily admits is as much a construct as the present day.Pearse's premise seems right that the Modern West is very much out of step with its own past and with the rest of present-day humanity in its turning away from traditional values and in radically redefining tolerance. But he fails to address what is inherently right about the perspective of all of history and the rest of modern humanity. What is it about their constructed reality that is inherently better? Other than that to agree with them (and to \\"rejoin humanity,\\" as he urges) will alleviate conflict and at least appear less brash?"},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"I am so glad that the connection between social ills (serial boyfriends, unstable partners/unfaithful partners) and fertility and the possible crisis is brought out in this book.

Pearce's argument is, seen through the lens of Karl Popper's \\"The Open Society and Its Enemies,\\" an old-fashioned historicist line of reasoning that things were morally better in pre-Enlightenment days, that the West has since morally declined, and that we need to return to an earlier state of grace in order to regain what we have lost.At first glance, this seems like a reasonable thesis, but upon analysis, it falls short of the historical facts.If anything, people acted morally worse in these earlier socieities, with the norm being, with no concept of indivudal rights, to do violence to your fellow humanity, not the contrary that Pearse implies. Pearse's argument ignores the fact that pre-Enlightenment soceities and current non-Western societies were and are predicated on the abuse of power, the suppression of the individual by the state, tremdendous economic inequities, and the core notion that the group, not the individual, should determine and judge individual action.The central reason Enlightenment notions rose to prominence was that enough people were tired of religious superstition, political repression and social inequality. If the rest don't like us, it is they who need to change, they who need to make a genuine attempt to observe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"Meic Pearse is a traditionalist and a Christian. He defines the \\"clash of civilizations\\" in terms that at their core relate to his belief in the moral and spiritual infallibility of the Bible. Thus on pages 77-79 he defines human rights in terms of Biblical scripture, concluding that the sort of human right \\"that is claimed simply by virtue of one's existence\\" to be \\"not derived\\" from \\"Scripture\\" and therefore not something he is in agreement with.We can see that Pearse IS in agreement with the Muslim belief that laws come from God and not from human beings themselves. So it is not surprising to read this: \\"Normal people (that is, the rest of the world)...cannot exist without real meaning, without religion anchored in something deeper than existentialism and bland niceness, without a culture rooted deep in the soil of the place where they live.\\" (p. 29)Nicely expressed, but I wonder, do these \\"normal people\\" that exist outside the West--would that include humanists and agnostics, Buddhists and Hindus, Taoists and Zen Buddhists, Jains and Vedantists--indeed mainstream Christians, Jews and Muslims--or is he just referring to the subset of people who follow the fundamentalist expression of the Middle Eastern religions?It is also not surprising that Pearse echoes the reaction of some fundamentalist clerics in the West. e.g., Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, who declared after the World Trade center was hit by terrorists that essentially we had it coming. This view is one that I find abhorrent because, while it does not exactly condone such murderous acts, it tries to shift the blame from the murderers themselves to aspects of the American culture that they--Pearse, Robertson, Falwell and others, along with the fundamentalist Muslims--find threatening to their world view.In truth, Pearse's is a rearguard action against not just Hollywood and commercial America (the usual whipping boys), but against the basic tenets of democratic society. We can see this in his statement that \\"human rights are essentially an invention of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment\\" whereas, \\"Traditional systems of morality worked on the principle of obligation: act this way; don't do that; you must; you shouldn't.\\" (p. 64) Again he is in strong agreement with the traditionalist interpretations of the three Abrahamic religions.My problem with those who worship \\"the Bronze Age God of battles,\\" with those who find their authority in ancient texts and their behavioral guidance in tribalism, including intolerance of other points of view and the use of violence to resolve differences, is their utter irrelevance to, and ignorance of, the real issues the world faces today. The fundamentalist interpreters of religion are Dark Age relics of a mentality that cannot possibly come to grips with the very real challenges of science, globalism and the postmodern world. How a God that has a bad temper in whose image it is insisted that we were made, a God that apparently has a beard and an alimentary tract (what would he need that for?), a God that seems not to have any kind of grip on his world, but must resort to suicide bombings and tanks and guided missiles in order that His will be done--how can such a God of the tribe and superstition hope to cope with the 21st century?Pearse seems to think that people who do not accept this God and his authority are atheists (he uses the term again and again to describe those in disagreement with his views) who hold values \\"not as an alternative to traditional values but as a negation of them--as anti-values, in fact.\\" (p. 29)This then is the problem. It is not so much that Pearse is in disagreement with Western culture. It is much worse than that. What he perceives as Western culture he calls \\"an anticulture.\\" In other words, he and those who think like him have values and culture. Those who disagree with his primitive view of religion, do not. He sees only the culture of the mass media and the mass mind. He doesn't seem to realize that people like David Hume and John Locke, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, existed, and he clearly turns his back on the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights in which men are declared to have inalienable rights. In other words, Pearse would be a Christian fundamentalist Muslim--if such a creature existed, finding authority not in science or the Declaration of the Rights of Man, or in the cultural traditions coming out of the Enlightenment, but instead following only the authority of Scripture--which of course means following the authority of Scripture as interpreted by the clerics currently in power, as it had always been until the rise of the modern world.Finally I don't think \\"they\\" hate us so much as Pearse likes to imagine. The anti-Americanism that we see expressed today is largely a result of the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq and the unilateralism of his attitude. After all, it could be said that they \\"hate\\" us in Europe too. America still has an enormous amount of good will in the world, and we are looked upon by hundreds of millions of people as the best hope for humankind and admired for our democratic way of life and our system of government with its checks and balances and its respect for individual human rights--something that authoritarian people like Pearse do not fully appreciate."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"Very timely, very frightening, and very poorly written. A difficult read. Meic Pearse is like the speaker who likes to hear himself, but substitutes the written word - a lot of them, with a lot of syllables, and vague meaning.The subject matter is too important to be presented in such an obtuse and confusing treatise, but worth the struggle."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"With a confrontational title like \\"Why the Rest Hates the West\\" you might expect a scathing talk-radio-style diatribe about the evils of the uncivilized non-western world. Or you might have expected the author to blame Western imperialism, Judeo-Christian religious history, and ecological shortsightedness for terrorist attacks.Refreshingly, the book offers fodder for neither set of extremist views. Instead it's a reserved and rather academic (although readable) study in the differences between the post-modern West and the rest of the current world and all previous world cultures. In taking the high road though, I get the sense that the author might have titled this book \\"A History of Post-Modern Western Civilization's Moral Failings and their Long Range Impact on Global Demographic Shifts\\" and the publisher's publicist probably played a role in the \\"Hate\\" title despite little content in the book supporting it.The author makes several keen observations on differences between the current west and non-western worlds. He details that the post-modern world has rejected its own religious heritage (despite the cries of the American left in the days following the 2004 election, the U.S. is not in danger of becoming puritanical although the U.S. does have a larger percentage of practicing Christians than many European countries). He looks at the west's history from the Renaissance, Enlightenment, Reformation, through the Victorian, post-Victorian, and finally post-modern ages. He observes the effects of all of these upheavals on the institution of the family.His first main conclusion is these changes along with industrialism have combined to devalue social institutions like the family and local communities while elevating the importance of individualism, nationality, and human rights. It is however the institutions of family (including ancestors) and local communities that all previous world cultures and the current non-western civilization still hold dear and it is this distinction (not religion itself or militarism) that separates the west from non-west today. The pre-industrial non-west can't afford the luxury of \\"individualism\\" - families need to stick together for mere sustenance and survival. Nationality is expressly rejected by Islam. And abstractions such as \\"human rights\\" mean little to anyone struggling day to day for clean water and food. Pre-modern societies who don't know where tomorrow's meal might come from also favor stability over change, so even an \\"evil\\" dictator who is stable is preferable to a change that might endanger the family's day-to-day living. Divorced from the reality of day-to-day living by hyperprosperity, the west can afford temporary instability in the name of the long term march of freedom and can't understand how anyone could deny the value of freedom.While he doesn't say so explicitly (unfortunately) the inevitable conclusion I drew from the book up to this point is that the west, in its all-knowing all-powerful elitist style fails to understand that today's west took some 500 years of history to evolve. But we then turn around and try to force 500 years of \\"progress\\" down the rest of the world's throat in the name of \\"freedom\\" or \\"human rights.\\" If the rest of the world is to find \\"freedom\\" or \\"human rights\\" they're going to have to find it on their own terms, in their own time. Neither the approach of democracy at the point of a gun nor the approach of peaceful mediation to convince the non-west of the intellectual superiority of \\"tolerance\\" and other western values will advance real freedom's march by a day. (These are both laughable approaches considering the arbitrary geographic boundaries imposed by the west \\"joining\\" vastly different religious sub-cultures into pseudo-countries.)He concludes the book with an unexpected twist: he ties all of the post-modern west's rejection of religion and tradition to staggeringly low birthrates in Europe, birthrates so low that they point to a population implosion. Along with rising senior citizen populations thanks to longer life expectancy, economic struggles result from an imbalance in the ration of workers to retires. These trends open the door to a flood of immigration to fill the European void and the current trend is this immigration is decidedly non-Western. The new immigrants aren't westernizing, are holding dear their traditional values including family which means higher birthrates in their populations, leading to the conclusion that \\"western\\" culture as we know if today in Europe will cease to exist within 100 years and will be equally balanced by the influx and growth of non-Western traditions. He paints a slightly different picture for the U.S. where the birthrate is at least holding steady at the minimum population rates but points out that immigration will reshape the U.S. as well. The only alternative is for the west to re-adopt traditional values.And with that, the book ends. Not with a conclusion that the \\"rest\\" hates the \\"west\\" but that the current west is not viable because the population is not self-sustaining and that the non-west will overtake the west via population growth.While in general he makes many good points and I felt I learned from reading it, there were things I didn't like about this.First: the disconnect between the title and the material. He made very little effort to link his lengthy discourse on the last 500 years of western history to \\"hate\\" for the west from the rest.Second, while the issues of family and local community are important to many people non-western world, I think he vastly understates the role of religious differences in creating and maintaining the current divide. Millennia of religious differences and western military domination the last several hundred years are hatred's foundation. The fear that the western non-traditional values will be part of the west's cultural steamroller only adds heat to hate's fire.Finally, on the population sustainability note, I thought he failed in not connecting that if the non-west sees the west's non-sustainable birthrates, the non-west may fear the west will take the only other route available to any demographic that can't sustain through procreation - converting others (the non-west) to western culture."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"This book is an excellent analysis and critique of the ills of contemporary Western culture, and their relevance to the relationship between the West and the rest of the world, particularly in the light of international terrorism such as the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.The author's basic argument is that the contemporary West lives in a state of nearly complete disconnection from the reality that most people inhabit or have inhabited both now and throughout most of human history. In many, if not most places in the world, people struggle for daily survival, living in the ever present shadow of death and chaos. As a result, they understand the importance of moral order and a belief in the transcendant that gives meaning to life. We in the West, on the other hand, enjoy political stability, technological sophistication, and a level of comfort and safety unparalleled in human history. Largely padded and pampered from the harsh realities of daily survival that most people have to contend with, we have largely discarded a belief in the transcendant and have replaced objective morality with self-centered hedonism. As a result, the author argues, we have become infantile, technologically sophisticated barbarians, and this is how the rest of the world largely views us. Furthermore, our great power and influence around the world, causes many people from more traditional cultures to view us as a threat to decency, moral order, and the survival of everything they hold dear. As a result, the West is hated in many places. As a result of their often condescending attitudes towards those they view as less advanced, Westerners are often completely incapable of understanding these realities.The book is succinct, reasonably short, well written and well argued. The author lays out well the historical factors that have led to our present situation, as well as the crisis that is currently facing the West. He also does an excellent job of critiquing the condescending attitude held by many westerners towards traditional religious and moral beliefs, and showing how even our much vaunted \\"tolerance\\" and acceptance of other cultures is really a joke. What is needed, he argues, if there is any chance of saving the West, is a return to some kind of solid, public moral commitments, and a resurgence of public religious beliefs. Things don't look particularly hopeful on this account.All in all in excellent book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"Having lived nine years in Central Asia, I was a bit nervous upon receiving this book. Was it another book bashing American culture and totally missing the point? The author himself identifies that modern tendency as \\"self-loathing\\" and demostrates how that tendency only serves to exacerbate the problem. What follows is a balanced view that forces Western readers to realize that the rest of the world sees reality through a different filter. The result is a very accessible and understandable reading of the current situation in a way that academically lays out the scene rather than trying to bash one culture or another. Highly recommended to the lay person who wants to get an honest glimpse into what may appear to him/her to be a highly irrational reaction among nonwesterners."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"It takes a great deal of education, experience, and faith to write a book such as this. Originally a series of lectures, the author has developed some useful, and calmly articulated, thoughts on both why there is a disconnect between the \\"West\\" and \\"the Rest,\\" and why the West is on a downward spiral to oblivion in practical terms, with the triple whammy of declining birth rates (non-replenishment), increased longevity (generally among those who are not necessarily productive in their older years), and substantial apathy among the self-absorbed, self-righteous, and largely clueless teen-agers and 20-30 \\"me me me\\" generation.There are many books that I have reviewed here for Amazon that support this author's personal reflections, and his citations of those books that did stimulate him are more than adequate. A few themes made by the author strike me as worthy of emphasis, for they provide a road-map for any Western society that wishes to survive into the 22nd century:1) Morality matters. It is a historical force. Will and Ariel Durant emphasized this in their \\"Lessons of History,\\" and many strategic confrontations have borne out the point. Tribes and nations that become amoral ultimately decline and fall.2) Western myopia cannot be understated. The ignorance of the West regarding global realities and the relationship between Western behavior (inclusive of US support for 44 dictators, immoral and predatory capitalism, virtual colonialism, and the general view of others that the West is \\"barbaric\\" in sexual and other matters of fidelity and integrity) and how others view is simply unrealistic.3) The West fails to understand that the rest of the world, where faith and integrity and loyalty to the family and tribe are often all that keeps the entire society from disintegrating in the face of more primitive environments that we ourselves experience, wants to be modern but not Western--modern with cultural cohesion, not modern with the commoditization of the individual, which both the author of Lionel Tiger (\\"The Manufacture of Evil\\") credit with destroying family, community, tribe, and nation.4) The author excels at discussion how Western individuals today have lost the context of history, the reverence for tradition, the utility of specified morality. Westerners are \\"out of touch\\" with the lessons of history, out of touch with the implications of our selfish decisions in the present that have implications for the future generations.5) The author discusses competing concepts of legitimacy, and here he goes into nuances all too often lacking in \\"objective\\" Western analysis of competing social models. He sees the value of personal versus impersonal authority in the context of societies where bureaucracy is not yet developed and kinship remains the foundation for trust.6) The author, educated at Oxford, would agree with Philip Alcott, brilliant Cambridge scholar and author of \\"Health of Nations,\\" in dismissing most nations as false constructs inconsistent with their tribal and religious networks and beliefs. This is as true of the \\"Nine Nations of North America\\" (Joel Garreau) as it is of most of Africa, where colonialism heritage is that of inevitable genocide.The author concludes, as one would expect of a Christian moralist, that \\"Nothing less than a massive cultural reversal is necessary. We need to rejoin the rest of the human race.\\" He focuses on the renewed relevance of religious and moral vision, and here he would find common cause with David Johnson, distinguished author of books on \\"Faith-Based Diplomacy\\" and the vital role of religion in fostering reasoned dialog between West and East.Apart from restoring the role of morality within our over-all culture, the author concludes that we must become informed--like it or not, our lives are bound up with those of everyone else all over the world. Here he is in tight agreement with both President David Boren (former Senator) of the University of Oklahoma, and David Gergen, advisor to multiple Presidents of the United States (most of whom did not listen too well). We must internationalize and modernize our educational system, restore the importance of history and international studies, and give life to the finding of E. O. Wilson from \\"Consilience,\\" to wit, that the sciences demand the humanities if they are to be in the service of humanity.This is a most thoughtful book, reverent in its arguments, one that reminds us all of the value that can be had from listening to or reading the careful reflections of a man of the cloth, born in Wales, educated in England, and now speaking to all of us."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"The author definitely has a strong Christian world-view, but is refreshingly different from the usual gushings of the relgious-right and the conservative talk-show crowd.I would hope non-religious readers would keep an open mind, think through some of the arguements Meic Pearse makes, and not \\"write off\\" the author because he comes from a historic Christian world-view.I would also hope religious (i.e. conservative Christians) would think through how culturally entrenched their version of \\"American Christianity\\" may actually be, and realize God is not a Republican - or an American.While not necessarily an \\"easy read,\\" I'd recommend this to anyone who is looking beyond the standard arguements and views of polical left or right."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"As Afghanistan and Iraq keep heating up, Meic Pearse's Why the Rest Hate the West offers one of the most profound yet accessible critiques of why we find ourselves under attack.

It's not \\"the economy, stupid.\\" It's a cultural conflict with people who value tradition, community, and a form of external morality more than progress, autonomy, self-expression, and individual human rights.

In recent years, political correctness, tolerance for anything but intolerance, and open mindedness have become popular. Yet, if anything, that has made things worse, because as minds have been opened, the brains and hearts have fallen out, crushing values and morality underneath. Readers are given a history lesson in this concise volume, but a lesson with a difference. The past is traced not so much by what happened but by going to the heart, seeing the effects of history on values and philosophy. Although highly academic, it is not incomprehensible to the average reader. ***Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"While the title is somewhat misleading, and quite likely a publisher cheap shot for selling more copies, the book is an engaging read.It tracks the motivations at work in contemporary western society and tracks the changes in attitudes over the years.There is an implicit assumption that the societal forces at work in old America/UK/Western world are the forces at work in the \\"problem nations\\" of the world today.So the book can be used as a useful tool of understanding the mindsets of the rest of the non-western world, the angle of the importance of religion in premodern societies is very relevant to understanding the Islamic citizen's mindset.The author seems to suggest that current Western foreign policy stand of demoncratizing countries or of forcing globalization through them is not the best way of \\"progress\\" for them. The forces of cultural change take hundreds of years to evolve (the western society serves as a good example of this)."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"Asking Why?Have you ever turned on the television and seen five or six Iraqi / Middle East bombings of United State troops or terrorist bombings on countries located in modernized Europe? Then, have you proceeded to wonder, if only as a fleeting thought, why the rest of the world hates us enough to bomb us? Ever since the United States has concentrated it's military power in the Middle East, the western world has seen an increase in the attacks on us by other countries around the world. Many American and Europeans simply brush it off, claiming that only extremists and terrorists hate the west without reason, but there is a sensible story behind this sometimes violent hate against us. The book \`Why the Rest Hates the West' by Meic Pearse is a great insight into the mind of non-westerners. It gives reason, and the thought process behind many points they have against us, and you just might walk away from it with a greater understanding of the rest of the world.There has been one word that has been held prominently in the United States for many years: tolerance. In fact, it was one of the pivotal principles this country was founded upon. It was first meant as an agreement to accept the difference between people and their culture, or between a monolith society and the minorities that live amongst it. Recently, it has been warped to mean to completely ignore the differences between people, and to deny the different cultures that have slowly been disappearing into ours:\\"Tolerance is a feature that, unless it is distinct to one country, makes it indistinct from others-especially over time. This, of course, may be a price well worth paying if the alternative is intolerance. And if the matter were to be left there, this would all be fine.\\"That is just on quote from Why the Rest Hates the West explaining why out view on tolerance is so twisted. This book will help you understand the real meaning of tolerance and how the western world often misuses it.Besides the present condition of the west, this book also talks about how we got to be the hated, and now in decline society that we are, and why the rest of the world's downtrodden opinion of us has slowly soured into hate. One example would be how Meic Pearse explains that we have detracted away from integrity and instead started to accept \`being true to oneself' in its place. It will help you understand how we got to this point, which will in turn hopefully help you decide how to help reform our society.For anyone who is confused as to the western world's standing point to the rest of the world, I recommend this book to you. It can at first be harder to read, with some advanced wording in it, but it's easier once you get into the flow of the deep insight into the unrest of the world against the west."},{"Title":"Why the Rest Hates the West: Understanding the Roots of Global Rage","review":"I was \\"forced\\" to read this book this week for a class taught by Dr Pearse, and having read it, I'm glad I was. I've seen criticisms that the title is misleading, which, I suppose, is true in a way, as the point of the book isn't so much looking outward at other cultures and what they see in us than a critical review of ourselves from within and from the perspective of a historian, but the book certainly explains quite adequately what reason the rest of the world has to hate us. It is our focus on our own rights, the (often tyrannical) fight against traditional morals in the name of \\"tolerance,\\" and the sexual freedoms that we preach (which, by the way, are quite conclusively shown, in my eyes, to have the exact opposite effects of what they are intended for, the intent being greater love for oneself, and satisfaction in desires), not to mention the fact that we expect everyone else to accept our views as axioms. but that's not really the point.Dr Pearse elaborates, upon introducing the Western perspective, that these tenants of our society are not constructive values, but rather destructive antivalues. The focus on individualism and entertainment in our culture and the drastic expansion of free time due to our \\"hyperprosperity\\" have the effects of cutting down the importance of family in our lives from a young age and making marriage less of a cooperative fight for survival, and reproduction less of a source of honor, continuation of the family, and sheer survival once one reaches \\"retirement age,\\" than a source of emotional support and mere companionship. I can't do justice to the arguments, or even the conclusions, without simply rewriting his entire book word for word, which I don't have time for, given how much of a tyrant professor he is (SAVE ME!). Anyways, read the book. It's good. It's even entertaining. and if you pay attention, you might even come away with a better understanding of why the rest of the world doesn't like us. In the conclusion, he even gives his own suggestions as to how to fix it all (without delegating the responsibility to the politicians). I'd even recommend it if you just want to shoot down his arguments, but try to keep an open mind. I'm sure he'd really enjoy reading a reasoned argument against him. He even says in the first two sentences of the preface he was hoping to cause trouble when he lectured on his main point.Well, I have to get to work on his next reading assignment, so that's all I have time to say about it.

It is actually more about the late 50's to mid-Sixties US. It had a few nice photos but spent more time on the Moon and Mars Landings and the Cold War than it did on the Space Family Robinson. I was tremendously disappointed. Also, it could have been edited a bit better...many quotes are used as chapter headings and as photo captions and then often in the middle of the text as well! It looks real nice but is not worth the money. The best part of the book was the two-page interviews with most of the actors telling us what they have been up to since the end of the series. Don't buy this unless you are a real LinS fanatic. For great photos of the classic series I recommend the LinS Arcade Series Entertainment Utility CD from Sound Source Interactive instead."},{"Title":"Lost in \\"Lost in Space\\"","review":"After reading this book I can honestly say I don't know what to make of this book. While the author does look at the original Lost in Space TV show, he rambles all over the place. At first, I understand that the book is meant to be sociological in nature. Cotta Vaz compairs the 60s to the 90s and the real 1997 to the fictional 1997 of the Lost in Space universe. Some topics deserve to be in this work. Looking at the space race, the cold war and 1960s pop culture help readers understand the context in which the show was produced. However, the author starts to stray into areas that are way off topic. For example, pages are devoted to Zippy the Pinhead, computer generated art, Spawn, AI, Robot war competions and other irrelevant topics. The main problem seems to be a lack of focus on the part of the author. There is some material that is right on the money. Inverviews with Bill Mumy, Jonathan Harris, Marta Kristen, June Lockhart, Dick Tufeld and Bob May are very well done. Inexplicably absent are interviews with Mark Goddard and Angela Cartwright. A biography of Guy Williams is also missing. In short, this book is a missed opportunity. It could have been a great look at Lost in Space.

This new approach to psychology aims to educate the client to: (1) analyze their emotional thoughts, (2) challenge these troublesome beliefs, and, (3) replace them with more rational ideas. This approach works well with lesser psychological conditions such as anxiety, anger, depression and neuroticism.This book is aimed specifically at fear/anxiety/worry. It has plenty of exercises you can work through to help you learn the approach. Ellis teaches that there are three ways that worriers thinking can go wrong: catastrophic thinking, absolutist thinking and rationalization. Next we learn about the \\"ten nutty beliefs that we use to let people and situations needlessly push our buttons.\\"While I found this book interesting I began to rebel when I found that I had to learn ten false beliefs that can send me astray. To be fair Ellis does say that only the first four are the most common, but the whole thing had started to feel a bit like preparing to sit an exam. I felt that these ten specific beliefs could have been the subject of a separate book.Another possible criticism is that this book contains absolutely no reference to experiments to demonstrate that this approach works. If you are the type of person that needs evidence to prove an idea to you this may not be the book for you."},{"Title":"Capture the Saint","review":"I've been a long-time fan of Leslie Charteris \\"Modern Robin Hood\\", Simon Templar, AKA, The Saint. Some of the earlier works from the 1930s and 1940s are period pieces now, and a little anachronistic, but the character of the Saint still feels fresh, and after Charteris retired from writing new stories, he licensed the character to other authors to continue and update the saga, with variable degrees of success.Burl Barer is obviously another fan like myself. His 1993 compendium, THE SAINT - A Complete History In Print, Radio, Film, And Television, is a work of love that takes in pretty much everything Saintly that had been produced, from his origins in 1928 up through the last TV series in 1992. I understand that there may be an updated version coming out that takes in further Saintly things, like the 1997 Val Kilmer movie (for which Barer also wrote the Pocketbooks paperback to go along with the film). Like Sherlock Holmes, The Saint just seems to go on and on.So, when the time came to write a new addition to the Saintly mythos, Burl Barer proved to be a great choice to carry the character into modern times. The fresh feel that Charteris originally put into the character comes through in this updated version set in the 1990s. Considering that when the first Saint book appeared in 1928, Simon Templar was depicted as a man in his early 20s, by the 1990s he'd be a spry old codger in his 90s. Literary characters age slowly, though, and Barer manages to suspend disbelief, and make his Simon Templar a more mature, more experienced version, perhaps a little grayer, but still handsome, vigorous, and passionate about seeing Justice done. The plotting is fast paced, and as convoluted as anything Leslie Charteris ever produced, and the villians are updated for modern times to a ring of predatory pedophiles, and dealers in methamphetamine on the West Coast of the U.S. There is also a homage to the Charteris stories in characters and references that turn up from The Saint's previous adventures in the United States, which fans of the series will appreciate.This is a story I had been wanting to read for a while, but it only came out in paperback, and is now out of print, with used copies listing here on Amazon for about $75. This puts it out of the price range of casual readers, and leaves it only for serious collectors. That's why I was happy to find it had been reissued for the Kindle, at a price of $1.99. I heartily recommend it to all existing Saint fans, and for readers new to the character, this would be an excellent opportunity to get an introduction. I hope more Saint books from Burl Barer will be forthcoming, and that they will end with the traditional notation on the last page:\\"Watch For The Saint. He Will Be Back.\\""},{"Title":"Capture the Saint","review":"Burl Barer captures Leslie Charteris' SIMON TEMPLAR perfectly in this fast paced and incredibly clever adventure based in Seattle, Washington. Wise, witty, and dangerous, the Saint goes after a predatory pedophile preying on Seattle street kids...but there is more than one plot unfolding, and the Saint has some competition in the modern piracy game from a drop-dead gorgeous Diamond Tremayne.

Simon being Simon, he cannot resist, and the reader is taken on a rollicking ride of swashbuckling adventure.

The version of the Saint presented here seems rooted in the wonderful radio stories that starred Vincent Price. The Seattle based plot is interesting and filled with local color but as always with The Saint the element that keeps the reader turning pages is the character itself. In this case he is presented as a celebrity a situation that gives the Saint himself opportunity to offer humorous comments about his own reputation, history, and character. In effect the star of the tale is able to step off the stage and speak directly to his fans the readers, a very clever and entertaining device for which the author deserves credit. The jaunty writing style adopted by Mr. Barer in this story gave the mystery the feel of a personal visit with a legend and brought that legend to life."},{"Title":"Capture the Saint","review":"I have been a big fan of the \\"Saint\\" for years.

It provides a comparison between the great wave of Jewish and Italian immigrants to New York at the turn of the last century, and the present wave of immigrants from Asia, Latin America and the former Soviet Union. Foner's account look at where immigrants live, how they work, immigrant women in particular, the sting of prejudice, the matter of ties to the old country and going to school. She seeks to refute the view which uses the success of the first wave and selected members of the second wave as a stick to beat everyone else. By and large she succeeds. She reminds us that one reason why many Asian-American have excellent education and social mobility records in the United States is because they were well educated members of the middle class back in Asia. She points out that it took a couple of generations before Jews experienced middle class status and high school graduation. She reminds us that despite fears of America becoming increasingly balkanized new immigrants are more &quot;american&quot; than previous waves because of the world of mass culture. There are nuanced discussions about the mixed blessings of wage labor and increased independence. There is an interesting chapter on how Jews and Italians were viewed in the past as non-white, and how Asians and Hispanics are becoming increasingly &quot;white.&quot; There is much in here that counters the widespread moralistic underclass discourses that have made The New Republic the fashionable magazine of our day's Vanity Fair. There is a nuanced discussion of the effect immigrants have on black employment. Some pundits, shedding crocodile tears for African-Americans suggest they would be better off if immigrants were not taking their jobs. But in fact, as Foner points out, many immigrants are not directly displacing blacks because they work in niches where blacks either were rarely employed or actually excluded. On the other hand, working in sweatshop jobs often makes them less attractive to native workers and helps lower wage rates. Often employers use stereotypes to immigrants' benefits and blacks' detriment. On the other hand by increasing the New York population they encourage African American strength in public employment and stop the decline in business that comes from a falling population. So why does this book only get three stars? Well, many of its insights aren't particularly new, that they may be a revelation to readers does not mean they are to people who study the topic. There is little about politics of immigrants, either electorally or through such measures as unions. There could be more about class in the book, both within immigrant communities and within the problem of New York as a whole. It is not that the subject goes unmentioned but it is noteworthy that there is no entry under the index for &quot;Gulliani.&quot; The result is nourishing, but bland; it could use a little more bite."},{"Title":"Disney's Kim Possible: Badical - Books #1-4 Boxed Set #1: Chapter Book (Kim Possible)","review":"I received these books as a gift from my Mom, and they are okay, I guess.

Surprisingly, only one of the stories (the last one in the volume, \\"Dead Woman's Grove\\") is set in Portugal. It and the first and longest story (\\"Deus ex Machina,\\" set in the Netherlands) involve consummated romances (fornication in the first, adultery in the last). The relationships in all six of the stories are cut off before the rake narrator tired of his conquests and was ready to move on, with several involving the tragic demise or removal of the woman before an agreed-upon rendez-vous in Spain or Italy or Turkey, and another with the quarry slipping away before agreeing to a rendez-vous.None of the stories is at all sexually graphic. The shorter stories (the middle four) are slight. \\"Deux ex Machina\\" and \\"Question Mark\\" are the most entertaining (with considerable irony turned on the narrator's youthful self), \\"Dead Woman's Grove\\" the most melodramatic. (I'm surprised it hasn't been turned into an opera.).The collected writings of Manuel Teixeira-Gomes's stories invoke the pre-World War I era of cosmopolitan European seduction games. With storm clouds of another war massing over Europe in 1934, when the stories were written, the balance between nostalgia and laughing at the youthful seducer's self-infatuation is tipped more to the former."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book would be a good presentation of the classic Walden if you tore out the introduction by Bill Kibben. While the annotations are helpful, the introduction is over the top, making out Thoreau as an environmentalist and climate change advocate. Totally self-serving on the part of McKibben.

They read Thoreau's book on \\"civil disobedience,\\" which advocated passive resistance (Peaceful protest). Another thing that surprised me was the way that Emerson and James Russell Lowell degraded Thoreau in their speeches at Henry's memorial service upon his death. During the memorial these two so-called friends of Thoreau called him a lazy braggart, a societies maverick & a drop out! Perhaps by societies standards he was a rebel but certainly not the worthless ne'er do well that these men painted him. Thoreau sets out to build a cabin on Walden Pond in order to be at one with nature. Thoreau was at heart a naturalist. He resisted paying a tax which he spent one night in the Concord jail for. This was to prove a point. He lived at Walden Pond for 2 years. Upon returning to society, he continued to write his books. He said that, \\"most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Henry David Thoreau was born July 12, 1817 & died May 6, 1862 of T.B.

Thoreau, as a surveyor, measures Walden Pond with tools, with his literary genius and muses on the enterprise that comes from the industry of ice-cutting in the Winter.Thoreau stresses Nature and how wonderful he awakes to Nature and daylight; he had a question during the night and felt that Nature answered it with the dawn and the glorious world of creation. In one of his most memorable descriptions, Thoreau says about the Pond, Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.Thoreau talks about his successful strategy in surveying the Pond and tells us that he was thankful that the Pond was made deep and pure for a symbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless. He talks about the formation of puddles on the Pond and how he could see a double shadow of himself, one standing on the head of the other, one on the ice, and the other on the trees or hillside. He creates a metaphor with this description, one of Thoreau on the Earth and another of his transcendence into the ice of Walden Pond.Joyce Carol Oates prefaces this book with an introduction that ends with her saying that the universe is wider than our views of it. In Walden Pond, we can broaden our view and transcend into the earth's beauty with Thoreau."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to read and also very dull.

Meticulously written, Thoreau omitted no detail while writing this book (exact measurements and precise calculations litter his accounts), and after nearly 300 pages of painstaking precision, it can leave one physically drained. Don't get me wrong though, throughout a lot of the book, Thoreau had some genuinely interesting things to say about life, such as living without material possessions and superfluous and excessive items such as clothing, housing and belongings, and I also found Thoreau's experiment of living in almost complete isolation truly inspiring and at times exciting. In &quot;Walden,&quot; Thoreau writes about many things that are still done today, such as the observation of insects and the construction of a house. In conclusion, I found &quot;Walden&quot; an interesting read, that everyone should at least just look through, since it is a classic, but I found it at times to be very dull."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I chose Walden to read because it is considered a classic.

I was very impressed that we not only found the book,at a very good price,and it was delivered in a speedy amount of time.Thank you."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"First things first: if you are reading this review, it is probably because you are considering not just Walden, but Walden on audio. Does it work in that medium?Have no fear: not only does Walden not LOSE something by being read, it probably gains something from Mel Foster's excellent performance. My first experience with his reading was the production of William Bernstein'sA Splendid Exchange, and it was disappointing -- flat and lifeless. But he did a fine job with James Kugel'sHow to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now, and this is terrific, too; I'll assume the mediocre job with the Bernstein was the producer's fault.Now, to the book. So much has been written about it, both on Amazon and elsewhere, that there is little more to say. But I will say this: if you read it in college, or if, like me, you merely PRETENDED to read it in college, pick it up again later in life. It is worth reading, and studying, and savoring.Walden is thought of as the urtext of nature writing, particularly American nature writing, but that really understates the matter -- thus, my assessment of it as an \\"underrated\\" classic. It is really so much more: an essay on the nature and purpose of human existence, an exploration of human nature itself, and an example of how we can see the sacred in the mundane. Indeed, one could argue that Thoreau was not so much writing about nature, but using nature as a way of seeing the supernatural -- looking THROUGH nature to grasp the reality of the unseen.And forget any notion you may have had about Thoreau, the dreamer: this is actually a very practical man, who strives hard to show that what he is doing can be a model for what all people should do. Not that they should go live in a cabin, but rather that they can and should seek their own unique path of existence. (Thus, the different drummer). It is no accident that the first and longest chapter is entitled \\"Economy\\": Thoreau wants to demonstrate that following a different IS possible if we prepare ourselves. If he is not fully convincing that anyone can do anything they want and make it stick, he is, in my view, unanswerable in his assertion that we cannot and must not be satisfied with what we are given, or what tradition or even our own habits tell us what we \\"should\\" do. If for nothing else, Walden is must-reading for anyone, young or old, religious or atheist, American or citizen of any nation. Or even no nation."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"How does one review a classic? In this day of eco-spirituality, Thoreau is a must-read. This edition is easy to read, but not the best quality paper. I don't expect it to have a long shelf life.Thoreau is one of the saints of American ecology. His writing takes one to a different time and place, and yet one in which the rape of the landscape was already taking place. I suggest following Walden with Annie Dillard's marvelous Pingrim and Tinker's Creek.Emerson's essay on Thoreau is a happy bonus."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I concur that this is indeed the best edition of Walden. The editing by Mr Cramer is superb, as well as his Afterword. The format of the book is better than any other I have seen. I am glad I bought it. You will not be sorry you did."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Strangely surprising how pertinent many of Thoreau's perceptions, opinions and insights on habits and values are to modern day society and culture. And impressive how vehemently he professes these views in some sections. No sugar coating here. This is raw stuff, presented with language and skill we've lost over the years.My favorite quote: \\"One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels\\"Thoreau is inspired and inspiring."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"It has been 40 years since I first slogged through this classic. This time, I thought, it would go much easier. But, I find that my penchants have not changed any more than Thoreau's dispositions. For me, it was the same old slog.Of course, Thoreau has earned his place as an immortal. Of all the Transcendentalists, he is the one with clear opinions about moral issues. He knew slavery was evil, the Mexican War a land grab, civil disobedience a honorable course. Were he still alive, I'm sure he would be goading us yet. He would likely favor the Sierra Club and Greenpeace. Perhaps he would be advising Native Americans to retain their savage edge. In a world of finite resources and new gizmos every Christmas, \\"Simplify, Simplify\\" would still be his clarion call. Given his scorn for government, the military and do-gooders, he would probably hold libertarian sentiments. Vegans would love him. I don't think he'd be hogging the cameras though- to interview him you'd have to search estates, reservations or Hindu monasteries. My point is that Thoreau is still relevant to many current events and many disparate groups can cite his influence.But all this does not improve Walden nor does it make Henry a more appealing sage. For whom was this minimalist tract intended in the age of industry? Thoreau does not seek converts. He lays out his way with indifference to its reception. Walden is filled with classical references and quotes from Hindu scripture. Surely, Henry must have reflected on some of his less bright Harvard classmates who had gone on to run railroads or manufacture vanities. \\"The most delicious piece of brag in literature,\\" said John Bourroughs.After his death, Emerson quoted one of his friends: \\"I love Henry... but I cannot like him, and as for taking his arm, I should as soon think of taking the arm of an elm-tree.\\""},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Henry David Thoreau, as his many devotees (including this reader) know, is as relevant today as he was 150 years ago. His writings are available in a variety of hardback and paperback editions most of which are considerably cheaper than this book. So why purchase this particular edition. There are two reasons that seem to make sense: if you read and reread Walden a hard copy is more durable than a paperback; and this edition includes an excellent set of notes placed side by side with the original text which is a real convenience.So what about the book called \\"Walden\\" and Thoreau himself? Well those many folks who are devoted readers of course understand the importance of Thoreau to American letters. For someone who might like to read either Walden or one of Thoreau's other writings out of curiosity or necessity (required reading) there is one thing that this reader finds particularly interesting about him and his works: Thoreau was a practicing philosopher who created a set of values and proved their validity by living them. \\"Walden\\" among many things is an account of how the practice of such values can effect the way one lives.In academic philosophy there is a branch called \\"axiology\\" which is the study of values. Many a modern professor of philosophy would undoubtedly fault Thoreau for failing to build a value \`system' based on recognized philosophic criteria. Well, this is the difference between a professor of philosophy and an actual philosopher. Thoreau did not profess a philosophy he lived a philosophy. The values that he developed if adopted today by an individual would be just as practical and lead to the same level of happiness as in his day. Reading through Walden provides a running account of how to deal with mundane chores necessary to live (and live well) and to deal with the more cosmic issues of space and time (as understood by the individual). There are of course other tangible benefits that come from reading Thoreau, but obtaining a philosophy for living is certainly among them."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden has always been a big influence on my life since the first time I read in school. To this day I ask myself, \\"Do I really need all these things that I'm stressing about?\\" And then, I think of the few things in life that are really necessary. It's a healthy reality check and a great re-read."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Back in high school this was required reading...not the whole thing but a decent chunk. Pretty much all of us became obsessed with this book and we'd talk about it all the time, both during and after class. Our teacher was really good at his job, but this is also simply and amazing book. It's really a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I was thinking about how I found out that Thoreau's birthday was one day after mine. It was coincidence that one of my instructors told the class about her father's devotion to Thoreau's work. Then I realized how much he is quoted when people talk about living in a thoughtful way. If you need a reason to live life more fully then read this book. I didn't agree with everything he said but just from his writing I could see his personality and imagine talking to him about modern living and how people lose a lot because of it. He wrote about living in the woods (exciting huh!). However, it comes across as more of an account of his inner journey than just his experiences at Walden Pond. His view on spirituality was more about individual search then just sticking with what you were taught. Thoreau said he'd rather have truth than love and other things people strive for (and truth is something that you have to search for, rarely does it appear on your doorstep). People still read \\"Walden\\" after 150 years for its call for simplicity, which most spiritual leaders (like Jesus of Nazareth) acknowledge as a way for humans to live happily. Even if you don't read the whole thing, read the last page because it is very inspiring. Also, check out his essay \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers\\" because I think it is just as fascinating as \\"Walden\\"."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Many people have the misconception that &quot;Walden&quot; is all about how to survive in the wilderness, this completely misses the soul of the book. Thoreau didn't do his &quot;experiment&quot; to see if he could survive in the wilderness, he would have gone much farther from civilization for that. Rather, Thoreau wanted to live life on his own terms in a setting that allowed him to contemplate life on a higher scale then simply &quot;getting a living&quot;. As he states his life philosophy &quot;Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!&quot; ask yourself what it is that you NEED to make you happy, and live only for that."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden was written as a backlash against consumerism and conformity. Thoreau built his own house with affordable and left over materials and sustained himself for a very small amount of money. The philosophy that he offers is one that many of us could benefit in listening to. Do we really need the most expensive cell phone on the market, or will the free model do? Do we really need a designer bag? Does it make us any happier to buy a house that is so elaborate it will add ten more years before we can retire?Walden questions what is truly important in life and what things are unnecessary burdens that we allow society to place on us."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I guess I'm not surprised, scrolling through the many reviews of this book, to see that quite a few find it to be a tedious waste of time. This is, after all, America, where thinking critically is in critically short supply. If you are a literalist, if you've been weaned on airport novels and other pseudo-literary junk, if you are unable to relate to a multi-faceted jewel that sparkles on every imaginable level, then by all means stay away from this book.The tone of several reviews reminded me of the student in my Latin class who said one day, as we were reading a selection from Ovid's Metamorphoses, \\"This is stupid!\\" \\"No,\\" I responded tranquilly, \\"You're stupid.\\" Some people apparently expect an encounter with a great author to be a cheap turn on, like a video game or a shot of Jack Daniels. Not surprisingly, when the engagement requires the use of one's brain or at least a modicum of intellectual effort, many have to throw in the towel. The irony, of course, is that these are exactly the sort of people Thoreau was railing against in Walden.Walden, boring? You might as well say the Iliad, Hamlet, or the Canterbury Tales are boring. Walden is quite easily a work that ranks with these world-class masterpieces. Thoreau's magnum opus grows in stature with each passing year, and he ranks at the top of American prose stylists.Walden is a heroic epic, a farmer's almanac, a poem, a pastoral, a fire and brimstone sermon, an autobiography, a philosophical treatise, a journal, an annual report by a man who was the sole stockholder in his own extraordinary enterprise. It is a vicious critique of the unexamined life and a brilliant paean to the richer and more rewarding existence which is open to anyone who wishes to discover it.Like a stone tossed into a pond, Walden's influence will ripple through all of the ages to the very edge of eternity. If there ever was a book that could dramatically alter one's perception of the world, Walden is that book."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden itself gets 5 stars, but this free ebook is just plain incomplete. Pretty frustrating to be reading this and to all of a sudden come across missing parts, i.e. when Thoreau is enumerating his living expenses, all the information is missing. Instead I spent the $0.99 and got a complete and well formatted version ASIN: B0056OZR26 which also has an illuminating preface by Emerson."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book is a description of Thoreau's experiment with living deliberately. From 1845-47, Thoreau lived in a small cabin that he built himself on the edge of Walden Pond, on the outskirts of Massachusetts. His brother had recently died of tetanus, and as a memorial, Thoreau wished to write an account of a week-long trip they had taken together on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, some 7 years earlier. Living in simple surroundings on the pond allowed Thoreau the time to undertake this project, which resulted in the book \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers.\\" But in Walden, which was written several years after the events took place, Thoreau doesn't discuss his work on the Concord and Merrimack book at all. Instead, he lays out his philosophy of his approach to life and nature, juxtaposed with many observations of local flora, fauna, and characters.The first chapter, Economy, is an extensive tract, didactic at times, arguing for frugality and simplicity. When one remembers that this was written in the 1850s, long before electric carving knives, mp3 players, video games, or even cars, it is remarkable how clear and relevant his message still is for today. Page after page of this chapter is filled with quotes worth pondering, writing on the refrigerator, or even committing to memory. Subsequent chapters are a mix of observations on the local environment (e.g. The Ponds, Winter Animals), or Thoreau's dealings with others (Visitors, Brute Neighbors). The last chapter, Conclusion, in which Thoreau sums up his experiences living at Walden, returns to a more philosophical bent.This book speaks to all, generation after generation, and reading after reading. It frequently appears on syllabi as an assigned reading, which is too bad. While it provides much material for discussion, I'm not sure that Thoreau would have wanted anyone to be compelled to read it. As with any book, it's much more rewarding to work your way through it on your volition. Out of all of Thoreau's books, this is my favorite because of the balance it achieves between philosophy and observation, as well as for the ideas it describes."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I took only one book (Walden) recently when I packed light for a trip 240 miles down the Haul Road along the Trans Alaska Pipeline to the farthest north truck stop at Coldfoot. We live in Barrow, Alaska and wanted to get away to a simpler life for a bit.The tundra colors were spectacular and when we finally got to trees they were all gold and red. And there were caribou, dall sheep and musk ox.Our room at Coldfoot was very basic --two small beds, a chair and small closet ---that was it. No data ports, no TV, radio or phone.So we read a lot and I felt fortunate to have Thoreau with us.Even when it rained heavily and we had to shorten our daily hike, Walden Pond was there to recharge me, hopefully help me get out from under in this heavily consumer society.I love this man's insights, and am sorry he died at the early age of 45. This book is so current today. Please read it and share the ideas.Oops, now I am communicating about \\"Walden\\" over the Internet on a fairly new computer. Well, maybe will have to read the book again. Enjoy friends!!Earl"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I will not comment on Walden itself, because that is a matter whether you accept it to be a classic or not. My review is on the quality of this edition, which is superb. The book is a pleasure to hold--the paper is heavy and smooth, the print is sharp, and the award-winning illustrations are an added bonus. Unlike the other hardcover bindings out there, this is not an annotated version, so you get a pure uncluttered copy of the masterwork itself."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854. Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges. Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from. Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text. The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004). Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.\\"The Annotated Walden\\" by Philip Van Doren Stern was first released in 1970. The editor had also worked with the writings of Thomas de Quincey, Edgar Allan Poe, and Abraham Lincoln. In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes many \\"extras\\": an extensive Thoreau biography, details about the original publication, a lifetime chronology based on Thoreau's journal entries, photos of people and places featured in HDT's life and in Concord, selected woodcuts illustrative of the time, a bibliography, an index, and an annotated version of the essay CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- shed some light on the more complex references and turns of phrase. But Van Doren Stern was preoccupied with editorial minutiae: alternative phrasing between the final text and similiar journal entries, or how the final text differed from a previous draft or manuscript. As a result, these stylistic notes dominate the margins that should really offer more explanation of interest to the general reader, often making the annotations less than useful or interpretive. The index is merely a general one and doesn't help to pinpoint key passages. On the other hand, the volume is very visual and is more comprehensive than the others because of the photos, biographical material, and addition of CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. The text of WALDEN used here is a photographic reproduction of the printing used in the very first edition, which also makes thisvolume unique.Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal. Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\" (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life? Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses? Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph. He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more. His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\" Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories. At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\" So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\" (\\"Conclusion\\") Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time? Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript? Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life. Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement. Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with \\"It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau.\\" In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text. Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others. I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three. Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that \\"Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in\\" is NOT about fishing atall.Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions. Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions. If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book. If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his. Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by JeffreyCramer. It's a worthy addition to the Thoreau legacy."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I haven't picked up a free book for a while because of poor formatting issues. As I tried to read this one on my Kindle something kept bothering me. It wasn't until I was on the second page that I realized what was wrong.For some reason the entire book is off center. The right side flows all the way to the edge of the page. However, the left side starts off away from the edge. I tried to change the font to a larger size, but this just made it more noticeable.The text being off center doesn't seem like a big deal. However, I never got past it. It annoyed me so much that I ended up removing it from my Kindle because I just couldn't read it this way."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Beautiful, affordable, and edited by an undisputed expert on Thoreau's writings, this is by far the best edition available of this classic work. I cannot recommend it too highly, especially to anyone who, like me, re-reads WALDEN on a regular basis. Good size to fit into a bag or purse yet large enough for ease of reading, Cramer's scholarship is worn lightly so that the beauty of the words can shine through. This will be the standard edition for years to come. Buy plenty of copies--one to keep for yourself, the others to give as gifts."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Thoreau moved into the woods at Walden pond in Concord. However the book isnt about living in the woods. Its about stepping outside of \\"civilization\\" so that he could look at it objectively. From his perspective you see how much of the worlds misery is just stuff we bring on ourselves. like the following:\\" I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of.\\"He goes on to explain how once we have the items we need to maintain them, improve them, and in the end we end up slaves to the things we own. He looks at how we spend every waking day storing up treasures to mold or rust in a treasure room.He then goes on to look into what work is actually needed to sustain our lives. Once he has discovered this, he is amazed at the mountains of free time he has left. He uses that time to get to know the wolrd that we live in. Sort of in a \\"Song of Myself\\" sort of way.In the end this book was an inspiration to me personaly, to leave the fast paced chase of the dollar for a more relaxed and less stressfull life style. Now I chase waves and try to help out in my community. I find that I have tons of free time, and I don't even feel guilty if I waste it lying on the beach.Its not the sort of book that you get in the first read through, you will find yourself at the office or in a meeting and suddenly a passage from the book will pop into your head and suddenly it will make sense.I know this review is a little touchy feely, but if you read this book, and understand its message. It is a key to a secret club where you realize that \\"Hand Scraped solid Manchurian Walnut Floors\\" are in the end just flooring. And the truth is that Artisan Tibetan vase that you bought for such a fortune will one day be sold at a garage sale for a couple of bucks.Its a book that looks at the silliness that we take so seriously.

Why do some love and others hate this book? I think some people who secretly envy or at least understand Thoreau's experiment of leaving the shackles of society will love this book. Just the first pages you can see here on amazon when you click look inside, have some great thoughts that resonate with me. I truly loved this book including the section on civil disobedience.I think your love or hate of this book will be determined by the type of person you are, no judgement on either type (diversity makes life interesting) from me, just an observation. The people who loved it are just as right as the ones who hated it.There are parts where it can ramble some and those are obviously harder to get through but well worth it in my opinion."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"The message of Walden is interesting, but Thoreau's writing ruins it. Not only does he excessively go off topic, but he also is not able to effectively communicate what he is trying to say.As for this edition, it is very good, and that is where the two stars of my review come from.If Thoreau were to publish Walden today, editors would refuse to let him do it."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I first read my dad's copy of Walden when I was in high school. It's a 35-cent paperback edition that, if I recall correctly, my dad picked up while he was teaching in East Africa in the early 60's.Somehow the book survived his motorcycle ride from Africa to the Middle East and Europe, an ocean voyage, and the subsequent pilfering of the motorcycle's saddlebags on the docks of New York City. It has spent another 40+ years on our family's bookshelves, in at least 6 states and the District of Columbia. It's now a loose collection of pages held together by a rubber band.This book has seen a lot of the world, but it's not for that cachet of adventure that I love it. It's for the sense of adventure found inside its pages -- the sense of adventure Henry David Thoreau found in staying in one place.\\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived...I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.\\"What follows is part nature observation, part simple living, part transcendental philosophy, all recorded during two years in which Thoreau didn't venture farther than he could walk in a day. The ultimate message of Walden is one of introspection: explore thyself. But in the process of exploring himself, Thoreau explores the world around him. He watches the birds, the mice, the ants, the weather. And, ultimately, it becomes one process.\\"In the midst of a gentle rain...I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me...Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me...There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of nature and has his senses still.\\"That's the spirit that keeps me coming back to this book again and again.Originally posted at thenaturalcapital.com."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When I presented Walden to my students in my 11th and 12th grade philosophy course, many of their initial responses was something along the lines of, \\"This guy is jerk... a whiner...and poser.\\" I said, \\"Well you know he was put in jail for his ideas right?\\" They were shocked that such simple ideas could be condemned. As we progressed through this immortal masterpiece, they began to see the simple beauty and obvious application of Walden and the discourse of Thoreau in general.Walden is suitable for anyone looking to scale back their hectic life and appreciate the emotionally and intellectually tactile world that is so often muted by the chaos that is modern life.

There was quite a bit of moralizing, but it somehow felt okay, coming from where and who it did. This book will definitely drive me closer to the practice of writing and will certainly haunt me each time I walk in the woods, or by a pond.I am surprised it took me so long to read this one but however one feels about the call to live simply, the book itself is full of good writing and, I would say, the fruits of good journaling and a careful eye.Highlight: The last chapter is, possibly, the best call to cultivate the inner and intellectual man, that I have read anywhere.On a side note: I was shocked at how clearly Thoreau's writing shows the signs of a man with autism or asperger's syndrome. I looked it up and was not surprised to find there is a credible theory on the author."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it is definitely one that has influenced me in many different ways. Thoreau was keenly and honestly observant of everything: from the tiniest leaf to social institutions. He saw through hypocrisy and into the lives of \\"quiet desperation\\" that most people lead because, unlike Thoreau, they do not take the time to \\"live deliberately,\\" to examine and question. They are always at the mercy of others, seeking to accumulate wealth and standing but, in Thoreau's time as in ours, unable to do so because the economic odds are against them. Yet this is an optimistic book, based on the belief that if we act, we can change our lives.The writing is simple, elegant, captivating: almost every sentence in every paragraph deserves to be quoted. And probably has been! Opening the book at random, I find an oft-quoted sentence: \\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\\" Opening the book again, at random, I find: \\"Walden is blue at one end and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.\\"Thoreau's character and outlook is American to the core: he is the product of his place and his time. Highly, Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I was introduced to Walden and Henry David Thoreau in my high school AP Literature course. I was a bit apprehensive about opening this book, but as soon as I began, I was engrossed. Thoreau's stream of consciousnes style of writing holds the reader captive and begs interpretation.

This book is a classic and a must read for any fan of literature."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is an enjoyable account of a man who wanted to live a time of solitude, so he built a cabin and lived by himself, thinking and writing down his thoughts.

I have been meaning to read \\"Walden\\" for years now, and never got around to reading it until I obtained my kindle.

It is thought-provoking and entertaining."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When reading Walden i realized that not only is his writing insightful on the aspects of life in his time. But it transcends generations. I have found only a few other pieces of writing that coincide with my thoughts besides this book. His thoughts on life's essentials and how needless they can be gives such a different view than other pieces of literature. I was especially taken by how he views the importance of education. I agree fully with the fact that experience can teach us so much more than formal schooling. Over all the book was a beautiful representation of a better way to view life than what modern culture teaches."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is an obvious classic of American literature, and for good reason. Throeau has much to teach us about living--really living, not just existing. Life is more than just being part of the &quot;rat race,&quot; trying to &quot;get ahead&quot; or having a higher &quot;standard of living&quot; than our parents did. The fact is, marketers play us for fools, and we let them. Life is about searching, finding, exploring, loving, winning, losing, living, dying. Life is not the sum total of the material possessions we amass, but the sum total of the experiences we have and the memories we make. Thoreau understood that, and anybody who reads this book should understand it too."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"this copy of the book was very different from the rest of my class. the page numbers were all different and even some of the content."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Love it....Love it!

Oddly though, since then it sort of pops up in my mind periodically, like the smell of comfort food or a fond memory, so I've reread the book (in its entirety) every few years. It's like the best kind of friend--you can kind of wander off and do your own life but then return and find the connection is as strong as ever, you still find warmth and something for your soul there. I'm about to buy the Kindle format because it's summer and I need some good summer reading material, and Thoreau stepped in to fill that void.

I can only cite the very well-worn clich&eacute;: Better late than never.Walden is a pond, just outside Concord, Massachusetts, and for two years in the mid-1840's Henry David Thoreau lived a largely solitary existence there, in a simple wooden cabin which he constructed. This book is a collection of his mediations on the natural world, and a person's place in it. Thoreau also ruminates on an individual's place in society and certainly demurs about the hurly-burly existence led by so many, or, in an expression that I had always attributed to T. S. Eliot, but was first coined by him: \\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\"The first third of the book is on \\"economy,\\" and the house that he built near Walden. He describes his labor, and provides a table indicating the total cost, and compares that with the annual rental cost of housing. Similarly, he covers his food, clothing and fuel expenses (the \\"essentials\\"), and the underlying theme remains the subject verse, taken from a Shaker song, \\"Simple Gifts,\\" written about the same time: if you simplify your life, and rid yourself of the bondage of so much self-imposed clutter, you really are much freer, and that includes having the opportunity to take a ramble in the woods, which was a major aspect of his two years at Walden. As Thoreau phrased it: \\"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\\" Or in another passage: \\"I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.\\" Contrast that with the constant exhortations of our consumer society to \\"buy, buy, buy\\" and if we can only get the American consumer spending again, our \\"economy\\" will be OK. The beauty of Thoreau is an independent mind writing against the grain of conventional thought.Much of the latter portion of the book features his observation and outlook on the natural world around him. These observations range from the scientific to the poetic, with an emphasis on the latter, but he does not hesitate to make controlled measurements, like determining the true depth of the pond, which had previously been the subject of speculation. He describes how ice is harvested from the pond, and shipped to Boston for summer use, and is continually intrigued by the color of both the ice and the water in the pond. For those who are overwhelmed with \\"light pollution\\" and do not know what the phase of the moon is, Thoreau provides a suitable admonition: \\"It would be well, perhaps, if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.\\"There is much else as well. He describes the life of poverty of his nearest neighbor, an Irish family who are recent immigrants. He also observes a battle between red and black ants, and plays \\"hide and go seek\\" with a loon on the lake. He leans towards vegetarianism, but praises hunting, and considers it a vital rite of passage for any boy (and yes, it was so long ago, the other half were not even considered).Walden is not an easy read. In part it is due to the turgidity of Thoreau's prose style. There is also the aspect that portions of the book resemble the Desiderata poem that was plastered to so many bedroom walls in the 60's: a string of exhortation on the proper way to conduct one's life. The meaning of some of these aphorisms are quite understandable, for example: \\"While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally\\"? But it would take some true assumptions and extrapolations, and they could be quite divergent, to squeeze the meaning from: \\"The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly translated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures.\\" I'd welcome reader comments as to what that really means.Walden was hardly a \\"commercial success\\" in Thoreau's lifetime, but its impact on numerous historical figures was significant. He was admired by the naturalists John Muir, Joseph Wood Krutch, Loren Eiseley, and David Brower. His companion volume, (On Civil Disobedience) influenced Tolstoy, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, as well as many others.It is a book to be read slowly, with some tolerance for his style, and the occasional still quirky observations. Walden remains a 5-star read, and is an essential book for everyone to read, at least once in their life, even if it is in the latter phases.Finally, proving that once again there are those unlikely connections that add the zest to life: each day I look 70 miles to the west, and enjoy the view of the mountain most commonly called Mt. Taylor, named after Zachary Taylor, the President of the United States who started the Mexican-American War, and is the reason this piece of earth that I inhabit is part of the USA. Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience, and was briefly jailed for his failure to pay his taxes as a protest against that war."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This timeless classic from one of the great thinkers of the 19th century American transcedentalist school appeals to all idealists. This would include idealists from both the left and the right. Envronmentalists are attracted by the themes of living in harmony with nature. For example, Thoreau observes all around him in his two year two month stay in his simple house in the woods. He describes in great detail watching certain insects glide along the pond and the ripples made when they do so. He provides an engrossing description of two ant colonies, one black, the other red, at war with each other and gives a lurid, blow by blow account of the battle. Envrionmentalist also will be drawn toward his declarations against waste and using more than is necassary.Leftists from an earlier generation, &quot;hippies&quot; for want of a better characterization, are drawn towards Thoreau's rejection of the material. At Walden Pond, Thoreau eschewed unnecessary comforts and lived for what may be more truly important; a life in which we get to know the world around us. He was able to sit for hours, but this was not a waste of time because he was thinking and observing. He sought higher values.Idealists from the right are also attracted by Thoreau's observations since he was self reliant and lived off of his own labors without thinking that anyone else owed him a living. He may have rejected the material but, in so doing, he fended for himself and lived off of his hard work and ingenuity. Unfortunately, there are many today who cannot possibly appreciate this great book because they are more concerned with materialism, an easy life and pop culture. I hope that these young people will ultimately experience what Thoreau early in the first chapter calls the greatest miracle: &quot;to look through each other's eyes for an instant.&quot; I hope that these young readers will look through this great thinker's eyes and truly try to understand what he has seen and experienced."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This edition of Walden is a joy to read, with lovely typeface and layout. I am not a Thoreau scholar, but found the annotations accessible and absorbing. The layout allows you to read Walden straight through or wander off into the annotated notes, depending on your mood.A book that serves as a miniature vacation every time you open it."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"incomplete. missing quotes and other passages that were formatted differently in the original work. spend a dollar and get a readable version."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"As a previous reviewer mentioned, passages are missing. This is one of the best books ever written and it is a shame someone messed it up so much."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"For two years and two months, Thoreau decided to live in the Concord Wilderness near Walden Pond, as an experiment. He wanted to see if complete self-reliance was possible, and perhaps get a little closer to Mother Nature. As an experiment in pure solitary living, unaided by the trapping and encumberances of society, Thoreau failed miserably. But as a book of profound insight and beauty, Waldon ranks supreme in the history of American literature, and the bulk of his insights and observations stand even today. I say failed, because Thoreau often spent evenings at the town pub, drinking and talking until late at night, wherefrom he would stumble home drunk without the aid of lamp light. Moreover, aside from a doting mother who would often bring him homemade victuals as a break from mountain berries and unlevened homemade bread, he often stayed over with the Emersons when the pangs of loneliness were particularly biting. Not of word of this will you find mentioned in Waldon, though, for it would go against what Thoreau has to say about charity: namely, that no deserves it. So clearly Thoreau was never as detached from society as he would have us believe, and yet that is neither here nor there. An amazing writer, an observant naturalist, a brilliant social critic, and perhaps the most singular individual America has ever known - Thoreau cannot be beat. And this edition of Waldon is particularly good, in that Hardin has done exactly what all editors should do: In keeping with the Thoreauvian motto, he has made the text \\"simple, simple, simple\\" and accessable, clarifying points when necessary with annotated footnotes. After reading Waldon, you might also want to check Harding's biography of Thoreau, which I highly recommend. Among other things, you will learn about his trouble with women. (Interestingly, like many philospohers, Thoreau died a virgin.)"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Just as Alexander carried a copy of the Iliad in a precious cask, I have cherished a dog-eared and well marked copy of Walden for a quarter of a century. Now at last we have a binding worthy of one of the greatest books of all time. The embossed cover, the lavishly illustrated endpapers and page footers, the vast number of drawings from Thoreau's pen, and the detailed Masorah-like marginalia elucidate the familiar text and enrich the reading experience. The many references in the notes to Thoreau's Journal have lead me far afield into the various editions of the Journal (at least those I can afford). This is a first rate edition which I hope to carry with me the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Henry David Thoreau's _Walden_ is an account of a young man's sojourn in the New England woods, a critique of modern society (in the 1840s), and a call to action to vegetarians, libertarians, and other free thinkers. Thoreau's account is highly idiosyncratic and obscure. To be honest, it is a chore to read it through to the end. But Thoreau is wise on some subjects and, even better, he is funny. He is also very quotable, as this review demonstrates excessively.Thoreau begins _Walden_ with a scathing depiction of the senseless, directionless activity of modern life:\\"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\\"And:\\"Men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.\\"Instead of working harder to produce more, Thoreau decides to want less, and leaves corrupt society behind to live at Walden Pond. There, he takes refuge in naturalism. He plants a crop of beans, he takes long walks, he observes the animals that share his woods, and he engages in some amateurish scientific speculation. Thoreau is not a hermit: he often visits the village of Concord, Massachusetts, and enjoys visiting with infrequent visitors at Walden Pond. But he finds that a little bit of society can go a long way:\\"We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. ... We live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications. ... It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I live.\\"One of my favorite passages in the book describes the author as he leaves behind the brightly lit village and walks home through the woods alone to his cabin:\\"It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire \\"as I sailed.\\" I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night.\\"After a minute description of his life at Walden, extending over the bulk of the book, Thoreau suddenly tires of that part of the narrative and decides to fast forward a bit in what I think is the funniest paragraph in the book:\\"Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.\\"In the last part of the book, \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,\\" Thoreau expresses a radical libertarianism:\\"I heartily accept the motto, -- 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, -- 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\\"An opponent of the war with Mexico and the institution of slavery, Thoreau decides to do something about it, and lands in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax. In life as in politics, Thoreau advocates a life of deliberation followed by action:\\"There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. ... To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.\\""},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden, since the age of fourteen, has always been a special place for me. Ironically, I did not disturb the leaf laden path through Thoreau's wood until seven years after, but at a young age I enjoyed the utopia this book offers. Interestingly enough the surface was read, and with little understanding of history, of which I know have a Masters degree, I did not know the context. With this Annotated version you are thrusted further into Thoreau's world than ever before. I suggest strongly to read the text, then start over with just the annotations. It takes you into the historical/political context of the book's purpose, and from that, into a world leading to civil war, that would traverse those growing pains into a time of reform. Truly a book before its time, yet speaks to the reform movement of the latter 19th c., and perhaps today."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is an incredible collection of writing yes but contrary to the seeming popular view it was not meant to be a good read. i do not imagine thoreau wrote this as an attempt to achieve the status of a clean writer. What he says is there not to entertain but to inspire. Not to provoke thought but to provoke action. Read this book but do it not as an attempt to seek entertainment."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854. Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges. Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from. Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text. The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004). Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.\\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" by Jeffrey S. Cramer was released in August 2004, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the original publication date. Cramer is the curator of collections for The Thoreau Institute and therefore has access to some of the best primary and secondary source material available -- including Walter Harding's notes. In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few \\"extras\\": an introduction to Thoreau's life but only as it applies to his cabin stay and WALDEN writing; a bibliography; notes on the text; and a detailed index. The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- are quite extensive. They are set off from the WALDEN text with page-within-a-page graphic detailing and are easy to read. Cramer did not merely merge Van Doren Stern's and Harding's previous notes with those from David Gorman Rohman's dissertation. His analysis at times echoes that of Harding, but when it does, Cramer often goes one step further with a definition or citation. He has thoughtfully used a \\"Notes on the Text\\" appendix to outline HDT's wording differences in the various drafts of the work. Thus his annotations are not bogged down by minor editorial alterations that the casual reader may not care about. Unlike Harding, Cramer refrains from expressing personal opinions and lets the research speak for itself. An added bonus is a reproduction of Edward Emerson's map of Walden Pond which shows the location of Thoreau's bean-field as Waldo's son remembered it. The only cumbersome quality in this publication is the placement of WALDEN chapter titles at the bottom of the pages instead of the top. This otherwise stellar volume is beautifully presented with a cover photo of the cabin reproduction as it currently stands in Walden Pond State Recreation Area. A classy edition by all accounts.Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal. Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\" (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life? Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses? Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph. He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more. His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\" Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories. At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\" So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\" (\\"Conclusion\\") Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time? Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript? Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life. Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement.

Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text. Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others. I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three. Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that \\"Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in\\" is NOT about fishing at all.Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions. Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions. If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book. If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his. Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by Jeffrey Cramer. It's a worthy addition to the Thoreau legacy."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden, what is it? Is it a book on nature, a book on ecology, a book on human nature, a prescient description of the struggle between modern civilization and the land that nurtured it, a critique of mankind, a string of quotable gems, an account of a mind, or, like Star Wars, a way of slipping a deep and human spirituality into someone else's mind without their recognizing it? It depends on who is doing the reading and when. Read it for any of these purposes, and it will not disappoint. If you've never read it, read it. If you read it for class years ago and hated it, read it again. This may be the most subtle, multi-layered and carefully worked piece of literature you'll ever find. By keeping the down-to-earth tone (no doubt in reaction to the high-flying prose of his friend, R.W. Emerson) Thoreau pulls a Columbo, and fools us into thinking he's writing simply about observing nature, living in a cabin, or sounding a pond. Somehow by the end of Walden, however, you may find it is your self he has sounded. People have accused Thoreau of despising mankind, but read deeper and you will discover he loved people well enough to chide us, show us our faults (admitting he's as bad as the worst of us), and give to all of us this wonderful gift, a book you could base your life on. There is more day to dawn, he reminds us at the end: the sun is but a morning star."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Besides irritating formatting issues (as Mr. Wiggings mentioned in his review), I got over a quarter way through before realizing that the quotes are missing! I'd see many lines that just seemed to end with half a thought and a comma or double-dash, with nothing to punctuate his statement (price, poem, song, etc.). I just grabbed the MOBI version from Project Gutenberg ([...]) and everything seems to be in order. However be aware that THAT version has no table of contents (DOH!).So ... it's free, yes, but you're missing out on key elements of the book if you download this."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I had not read this growing up but wish I had. This is such a wonderful book. There are not many pictures in here - just a hand drawn map in one part of the book. Its excerpts from Thoreau's journal over the two year period when he lived on Walden's pond. He did not live like a recluse (he went in to Concord almost every day) so its not a book about living alone per se. Its more about reflecting on life, considering why one &quot;is&quot; and recognizing the beauty and mystery of nature around us every day, everywhere. Thoreau talks of regular daily things too like what it costs him to farm, or having cider, or building a chimney. The writing style is conversational, open, honest. He doesn't try to get tricky with words, he just tells it like he sees it. It's so beautiful. For anyone (like me) who indeed sees nature as their &quot;religion&quot; or sees the Great Spirit in every leaf, tree and bug, this book will be adored. So many wonderful messages, thoughts, woven throughout this book. Its an incredible work."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book screams simplicity!In this book, Henry David Thoreau takes an extended look beyond human nature and human habit. He brings forth a new and exciting view point on life and teaches how to live in happiness without the confusion of mechanical materials. I had to read this book for a 9th grade Language Arts assignment, and I had never heard of Walden or Thoreau before this project was assigned. When I completed this book, I felt very refreshed. It encouraged me to take a second look at my own life, and simply discard of the things which were causing complications or confusion. This book stretched past the limits and capacity of my mind as a 9th grade student. It forced me to think. Judging by the majority of my peers, I am convinced that anything that would force them to THINK harder, deserves 5 shining stars."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walter Harding was one of the greatest Thoreau scholars. His annotations include explanations of puns I hadn't understood, sources of quotes and references in the text, and information about Thoreau's time. I also learned that one of my favorite places in Concord was referred to by Thoreau as Fairyland Pond.The book also includes a map of the area in Thoreau's time, reproductions of HDT's manuscript pages, drawings and excerpts from his journal, and his map of Walden Pond with water depths he determined.I wouldn't say the book is perfect--there are still a few obscure references without notes, and some notes for points that are obvious--but it's as close as anyone is likely to come.Be sure to also read Harding's The Days of Henry Thoreau, a great biography."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854. Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges. Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from. Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text. The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004). Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.\\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" by Walter Harding was released in 1995, a year before the editor's death. Harding was a founding member of the Thoreau Society and devoted his entire life to the man and his writings. He is still regarded as *the* HDT expert of the 20th century. In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few \\"extras\\": a four-page forward that contains a biographical summary; a bibliography; journal entries and original HDT sketches scattered throughout the book's margins (a favorite Harding technique); and a special appendix regarding the story about \\"a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove.\\" The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- define a number of references both in word and phrase. Harding didn't copy anything from Van Doren Stern's previous work, and he also didn't include as many stylistic comments as his predecessor. He offered more frequent explanations and backed them up with a variety of source materials. He also throws in his own opinion every once in a while. The occasional ink doodlings from the journals serve well to break up the text. But lack of an index is a major failing. This is a handsome volume that improves upon Van Doren Stern's previous WALDEN analysis.Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal. Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\" (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life? Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses? Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph. He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more. His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\" Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories. At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\" So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\" (\\"Conclusion\\") Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time? Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript? Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life. Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement. Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with \\"It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau.\\" In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text. Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others. I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three.

It's a worthy addition to the Thoreau legacy."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book should be required reading for every high school and college student in every school in the country. Our narcissistic, throwaway, gadget-intoxicated society needs to hear Thoreau's message about the satisfaction gained through living simply, and about the difference between want and need. Not to mention his pronouncement that we do not own our possessions but are rather owned and enslaved by them."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"We have waited too long for a new edition of Walden which takes account of contemporary Thoreau scholarship. This new edition from Yale University Press provides what can now be regarded as the definitive text of Walden, correcting errors and omissions from previous editions. But it is very much more than simply a corrected text! We are invited into Thoreau's world and the context of his writing and thought through generous annotations on every page. These annotations include details on Thoreau's experiment in living, his physical circumstances, relevant quotations from his other writings and the writings of his contemporaries, as well as detailed references to things, places, and names, both contemporary and historical, mentioned in the text. In short, this Walden is a tour de force of scholarship that should not be missed by anyone with a passing interest in Thoreau or Walden. It is sure to become a standard reference in the subject. The book is physically beautiful as well. Its rich paper and the spacious layout of text and annotations make handling and studying this Walden a physical pleasure in addition to an intellectual one. Yale University Press clearly intends that this edition should be honored as a centerpiece in any Thoreau collection. Hurrah for Yale University Press and Jeffrey Cramer! Well done!"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Unbelievable! I went to Barnes &amp; Noble the other day to purchase a copy of Walden. They had the Cliff's Notes but not the book. Is that a profound comment on our times, or just the last straw that persuaded me to write this review?I have read Walden from cover to cover many times. I have read excerpts from it many more times. I have never found it boring or tedious, as some reviewers have. In fact, I have found it to be one of the few books worth re-reading on a frequent basis. Why?Our times do not differ significantly from Thoreau's. He saw a society enthralled with &quot;progress,&quot; such as the ability to travel from place to place via railroad at the astonishing speed of 35 miles per hour, without any idea of what to do when they arrived. He travelled by foot, and saw the life that others hurried by.Has it ever seemed to you that the acquisition of ever-more-expensive habits and tastes, and the need to work longer and harder to satisfy them, is ultimately a waste of the precious gift of time and life that each of us is blessed with? Do you wonder how (or if) people who live without televison, video games, and automobiles can be happy or fulfilled? How would you fare if you were stripped of your possessions but still retained the ability to obtain the necessaries of life? Could you treat that as an opportunity to discover more about what it means to live?If any of these are questions that have nibbled at your psyche, read Walden. If you love nature and its intricacies, read Walden. If you've ever thought about through-hiking the Appalachian Trail, read Walden. If you think modern-day life can't be improved on, or you want a quick read that will entertain you for a few hours, read something else. And if you read Walden and don't find it meaningful or profound, perhaps you will find another book that will remain as significant an influence in your life as Walden has been in mine."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is a wonderful book from which I obtained many hours of enjoyable reading. Though its tone is generally serious, it can at times be light. When he does slip in some humor it comes at an unexpected time and caught me off guard giving me a good laugh. I found many of his ideas very thought provoking. His account of how he built his cabin and his remarks about food and shelter were for me fascinating. I found it a very warm and friendly book with much to think about and obtained from it many referrals to complement my reading list. I Thoreau-ly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is really an exposition of Thoreau's way of viewing life. Thoreau says there is more to life than posessions and money, that, as difficult as it is to accumulate posessions and to earn wealth, it is much much more difficult to rid one's self of them! A statement/concept that is worthy of contemplation.Walden will take you away in to your own &quot;walden&quot;, if that is where you would like to be, and, if so, then you, as I, will enjoy the book very much. I rated it as a four star (out of five), only, because I could not choose 4.5 stars. On my personal scale, in order to receive a 5 star rating, a book has to move me with the intensity of a paradigm shift. It has to offer up concepts that, following a thorough consideration, change my present view of life, world. etc.... Thoreau's Walden comes close on this measure, but falls just a little short.His On civil disobedience, is another work that I reccomend with high regard, slightly more so, even. than Walden."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is the most important book that I have ever read. It is instructive, but not to be taken literally. It is not dictating that everyone should go to the woods, but find their own God. For Thoreau that was Nature in the woods, for Thomas Carlyle, Great Leaders. What is it for you?"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Anyone who prefers Emerson above Thoreau surely does so with a view to increasing his own popularity. Thoreau is too outspoken to be liked by everyone--indeed, to identify more with him is a kind of social suicide. But then, Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not here to please anybody, but rather to be authentically what he was.To find a modern man who so thoroughly embodies the wisdom of antiquity is as rare as &quot;the tooth of a dragon, or the hair of a phoenix.&quot; Henry David Thoreau is such a man. More than a mere combination of past, present and future, he brings together the most mundane, prosaic and ordinary considerations of daily life with the loftiest and noble thoughts of mankind. Furthermore, he perceives the spiritual aspirations and practices of east and west as one coherent whole. He was well acquainted with the classics of both hemispheres--The Tao de Ching, The Bhagavad-gita, Vedic writings, The Iliad and more--and here, distilled for us common folk, is that wisdom as seen from the viewpoint of a modern man. Bertrand Russell has given what would seem the crown laurel to Thoreau calling him &quot;a pure romantic&quot;--in contrast to the weak romanticism of Victor Hugo, or the rather soft variety found in Emerson.During his lifetime, 700 or so of the 1,000 copies he had printed of his first book,&quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; wound up in his parents' attic, ostensibly making him a failure as a writer. Walden was also not a big seller during his lifetime. Since then he has become a literary god, and without doubt one of the most influential writers of the past 200 years. It was Thoreau's tract entitled Civil Disobedience, written because of his objection to paying tax to the American government--a so-called democracy involved in slave trade, westward expansion, displacement of indigenous population and imperialistic annexation of Mexico--that gave fuel to human rights movements in the 20th Century. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. based their efforts on this small but amazingly powerful essay, which only goes to show that Confucius--one of Thoreau's favorite sage authors--was right; the thought of an intelligent man sitting in his room can kill a king and destroy his country. And so it was that slavery was abolished in the United States, India attained home rule and racial integration in the U.S. progressed.Since the industrial revolution in the 18th Century, the central goal of western technological society has been economic growth. And to achieve an economic growth that is endless, corporations in the latter half of the 20th century have encouraged consumption that is mindless. But by the dawn of the 21st century, this central project has proven to be obsolete, for nature cannot sustain endless economic growth, and neither can the people in general. Nature has rebelled by refusing to absorb the transgressions against her dignity (pollution), and humanity has expressed insurgence through psychological and physical disease. Dr. Willis Harman has discussed the matter in detail in his book, &quot;Global Mind Change&quot; but, though more than a decade has passed since its publication, the important and timely points that it makes have yet to be assimilated by the public. Thoreau, however, was already tuned in to this problem way back in the 1840's. Astrologers attribute an overlap of a little more than 200 years between astrological ages, and this puts Thoreau in with the new Aquarians.His observations--on economy, simplicity, learning, human nature, participation mystique when close to nature and the close proximity of God--are unpresuming, candid and at times downright hilarious. I say Henry David Thoreau is a philosopher sage amongst the American transcendentalists, and a man who was not unconcerned about his less educated or enlightened fellows. He took tremendous pains to share himself, through his writings, with us, and there are many innovations of his that are already being practiced by posterity. Not the least of these is the growing awareness that ADULT EDUCATION for men and women can be a lifelong pursuit. I agree with Dr. Harman that this is on its way to becoming the new central project of western society, known as it is presently by the name, The Personal Growth Movement.In Walden the mature seeker will find lucid clues as to what the Aquarian Age is all about, its characteristics and even the means of cultivating the new consciousness. But this is not a book for people who like easy reading. Henry would demand of you that you read it with the same diligence and deliberation as it was written. It took him five years of refinement before he was satisfied with the manuscript. Walden will provide you and your descendants with many more years of pleasure and enlightenment than that."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I had to stop reading this kindle edition of the book because large portions of text were missing. Namely the list where Thoreau talks about how much all his building materials cost (not really that important) and (more importantly) any time he quotes someone. This is the free kindle edition.Since I did not want to pay any money for it I downloaded another edition for free from Project Gutenberg (gutenberg.org).

I recently attended a public lecture featuring Mr. Cramer and had the privilege of a one-on-one meeting with him.

He doesn't want that to be true of himself. So he decides to live simply for two years, building a small shelter near Walden pond. He plants his own garden and discovers that if he works hard for four or five months out of the year, there is plenty of time left over in the year for reading, contemplation, and observation.He records his observations of farmers working, bluejays and squirrels eating chestnuts, men ice fishing on the pond, the snow falling, and many other things.I must say that the book is not always easy to read, but rewards close reading. You'll come away from the book with a greater appreciation for what has been given us in the natural world. Not everyone will agree with Thoreau that you are not a complete man unless you learn to cook your own food and plant your own potatoes, but I found his logic and reasoning compelling. A classic work with timeless relevance."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I've always gotten satisfaction from the outdoors and it's complexities. I'm glad that someone shares the same sentiments. This book should be required reading for any person whether in their teens or reaching the end of their life. While Thoreau can be a bit drawn out in this book on some of his spiels, most of what he says is right on the money, even if it was 150 years ago. Too many people have given up on the outdoors and prefer to stay inside and spend their life in front of the television. This is definitely on my must read list."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Was researching, indepth, the subject of why Walden was such an important influence on earlier American writing, and bought a few books to add to my personal research.

I sensed his brilliance yet secretly accused him of purposely unconnecting from the world. I was recently lead to him while looking for some essays on gardening. The first subject he covers in Walden is ecomomy. Economy rates low on my reading list. I was further warned by the difficulty of his text in general. Still, I was close to discovering his writings. In the beginning pages he takes me on a tour of opinions needing to be voiced in my life. My fear of crankiness is dispelled with freshness on every page."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is so beautifully written, and the issues are still relevant today. To me it is a guide for how to live in harmony with nature. I think if you are a naturalist or an aspiring naturalist this book is a must have. This book touches more on spiritual aspects than any religeous scripture I have ever read. Even 150 years ago Thoreau looked at the trends and knew what was coming. Today I don't think that anyone with any sense would argue that in an era of 200 different shampoos that all do the same thing,we cannot sustain this pace and will deplete all of the resources and pollute all our lands,if we continue. Live small and ecologically sound was the message and a great one it was."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Borrowing a corner of friend Ralph Waldo Emerson's farm, Thoreau sets out to conduct an experiment in living more simply for the sake of living more fully spiritually and intellectually. He builds a small cabin and begins to live self-sufficiently with his own hand, farming, hunting and building as he needs. By keeping his wants simple he keeps his horizons broad and finds that he may devote himself to higher callings than he might with the encumbrances of modern life.Walden is the journal of this experiment, providing an account of both the mode of living he has chosen and the far-reaching contemplations he is able to afford himself by that mode of living. It is page after page of beautiful prose and imagery considering his place in nature and society both--or simply appreciating the length and breadth of the day from his doorstep, having given himself the freedom to forego his work if he pleases by keeping his wants simple and true to what the human spirit needs rather than what vanity or social convention say he must need. While his thoughts wander far afield at times his observations are invariably insightful and often profound. (It is startling the number of well-known quotes and observations that find their first expression in Walden.)And this is his theme, not to live as a recluse, but to suggest that we all live more simply so that we may live more fully, that our villages be spread out and we allow ourselves space for thought and freedom to follow a muse, and that we further make our villages and indeed the whole of nature our living universities and schools, making the student learn by living and the community itself perpetual teacher and student.While his own experiment called for living apart for the sake of testing the limits of self-reliance, Thoreau does not advocate a world of hermits. He remains very much engaged in the society around himself, only asking that we consider what it means to provide for ourselves and if we haven't found that most of our effort is devoted to superfluity and nearly none to the mind and spirit. He argues that the essentials of maintaining one's self are much simpler than society has deemed and that what passes for the norm has become a hindrance to living rather than an improvement."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Henry David Thoreau gives up his life and most of his posessions and decides to live in a bare necessities cabin in the woods for two years to examine his life. Lucky for us - he brought a pen and paper with him to write it all down! His main focus in this book is to remind you over and over again that the things that you own and the money that you make are not the things in life that define you. He tries to teach us how to seperate ourselves from the hustle and bustle of every day life, stating that the less that we own and the simpler we make our lives, the happier we will be. &quot;Simplify, Simplify, Simplify!&quot;Everyone I know who has read this book has walked away having learned something. It is a classic. A must have for any book collector - and a must read for EVERYONE!This edition of the book is simply beautiful, too. Well crafted and binded, it adds the perfect complement to such literary perfection."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I didn't have the problem reported by the previous reviewer, in that the margin size is not a problem on my Kindle.

That is my only objection.The price is right. :)"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"To a citydweller who enjoys the modern conveniences, the idea of building a primitive shed in the woods and observing Nature for days on end was entirely unappealing. I felt I would have no sympathy with the Thoreauvian worldview.I was pleasantly surprised. Thoreau has a distinct sense of humor. While a lot of the book is descriptions of Nature, the writing was lovely enough to make up for my disinterest in the subject. In fact, Thoreau's enthusiasm communicated itself to me, and I found myself becoming more interested as I read on.Thoreau has a reputation for being unworldly, but interestingly the longest chapter in the book, \\"Economy,\\" lays out in great detail the cost-effectiveness of his experiment in simple living. Although living in an isolated shed, he is no misanthrope but displays much affection and compassion for his fellow man. He is a keen observer of human nature and his descriptions of his friends and visitors were some of the best parts of the book. He is a man of sensibility, sincerely concerned about the direction he sees society taking.The annotations were useful, as was the map of Concord."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Even though I live in Australia in 2005, I found this 19th century book superb.I cannot reccomend it highly enough: witty, intelligent, honest, articulate and timeless.I was particularly touched by Thoreau's appreciation of the value of solitude and of living a simple life. Such observations are highly relevant in our modern world based upon our frenzied capitalistic obsessions with long working hours, mass materialism and the media-driven madness to be surrounded by friends and family every moment of the day and night.In my view, Thoreau is the wittiest and wisest writer America has produced and will be just as well read and loved in 500 years as he is today."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I found myself, overall, agreeing with one of the reviewers when he stated specifically that &quot;Walden&quot; is not a book to be read purely for enjoyment, it is not a thrilling read or even a very deep one in general but then one must remember in which time we live and the style used by Thoreau is one of the mid 19th Century which was prone to the type of writing he uses. Anyone who has read other novels of the time or rather written in that period will find similar styles eg James Fenimoore Cooper, Charles Dickens etc. In addition this is not a novel but rather a retelling of experiences of one man in his own adventure as he would put it.That is not to say that Thoreau does not illuminate or at times give remarkable insights especially when it came to some of the people he met who had fascinating ways of life eg the woodcutter. The book varies from downright mundane and tedious to being very insightful and beautiful. Its amazing how someone can do this as he writes, verging from one extreme to the other. But then it was written from journal notes as he lived his life in the woods over two years experience and during that time a person changes as he adapts to his new way of life. At first its very exciting and new, any new experience is always full of a kind of life shock whether it be painful or joyful, the thinking mind, the mind absorbed in everyday &quot;safe&quot; tasks which define the &quot;normal&quot; life are absent in this new environment which requires new creative energies to survive, after a while this way of life becomes the accepted one and starts to be drained of the vitality it possessed at the beginning as one is fully acclimatised to it and it becomes the norm, after this stage comes the usual safety associated with the walls created to keep life ordinary rather than really being alive. This is hard to do when living in the woods by yourself where you need constant awareness to survive unless its a little too close to civilisation which provides the safety net which Thoreau always had available to him. But still during the period where he was very much alive and aware, life is lived without need for too much unnecessary thought, and this is the place from where insights and great creativity burst forth.If one wants to know what it is like to be really truly alive in the moment and you are afraid to try it yourself and would rather read about it then try the books &quot;Abstract Wild&quot; by Jack Turner or &quot;Grizzly Years&quot; by Peacock. Am I wrong to criticise Thoreau so much ? Yes and no, eg Yes:see the comments by John Ralston Saul on exactly this aspect of Thoreau's writing, No: look at your own life or mine for example, in each case we do not escape this ordinary life we ourselves create. For the purely lived life expressed in poetry look at the poems by Basho, no clearer or more beautiful expression of life has yet been written. I say written not lived, lived can't be written down in full only a brief glimpse or shadow of it is possible even with Basho.As regards what is said it often betrays Thoreau's astonishingly well read mind, quotes from the Baghvad Gita or other Hindu texts surprise because in Throeau's day very few people would ever have bothered to read the Indian works, the average American thought his own life and European works to be far superior. Thoreau often quotes Latin, often without reference, and the notes at the end of the book are very helpful. Thoreau's experience becomes the one Americans want to live at least without being in too much danger as he would have been in the true wild still available at that time in the lives of say the trappers or mountain men of the Rockies or any native American. As such it is an in between way of living wild.So Thoreau's work is definitely worth reading even for only the historical value or the literature it represents. It stands by itself."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"If anyone can describe what life is really about it is Thoreau. Even in the 1830's he gave relevant advice that can tie into everything in today's world. Every sitting a new and exciting idea to ponder over. Thoreau reminds us all of the confusing yet wonderful world we live in. Most of all Thoreau in Walden makes a tribute to the indivdual and tells us to follow our dreams, because they are just that ours. The best book I've read by far!"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I would have quit reading this book if I weren't so stubborn about finishing books that I started.Here's an example of some of the writing that makes me dislike the book: \\"If you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand.\\"First: that's one sentence! Second: this type of writing is really difficult for me to get through, and I don't enjoy it.There was some information that I found interesting, however, particularly in terms of the cost of things, and the day-to-day information about how Thoreau lived basically \\"off the grid\\" during his time at Walden Pond. I think that I would have really enjoyed a ten-page summary."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When I first heard about this author in one of my classes, I felt that it was the most boring pices of information that I haveever heard. But, when I started to actually lusten to what he was actually saying it really got me thinking. I was the only onbe in my class that actually understood what he was saying in his stories. His writing has got me thinking different ways on everyday situation. I had never thought that I would start to think like this. His writing has got me to see things different than I ever thought that I would. What he did in his life is cool, going to live at a pond all by himself for about 2 years and find the essintials of life, is brilient. In resistance to civil government, I had never read better writing in my life. When he had to spend a night in jail and realized that it was not even a hard punishnment, for not paying his taxes. There are really no words that I can use that can explain my love for his writing, because it has just moved me to no end. I really wish that I could have been alive when he was so I could have gotten to know him better."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"As Omar said of the Koran, I say of Walden. This is the single greatest book I've ever read, hands down. Words really can't describe how amazing it is, though I doubt that it will affect many people the same way it has me. That said, this edition (the Konemann) is one of the best I've seen. The book itself is helpfully supplied with footnotes (which are something of a necessity for a born quoter like Thoreau), unobtrusively marked by a leaf in the margins of the pages, which refer you to the notes in the back: this is an excellent way to supply these notes without interrupting the flow of the text. There are no elaborate essays on the meaning of Walden, however, so the reader is left to judge the book on its own terms. The book itself is svelte and compact; a perfect backpack-sized vade mecum.This book, with shipping, is less than 10 dollars. It was one of the best purchases I've ever made."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"To really get everything that is in the book out, it must be read slowly. It is an interesting look at one man's attempt to view the world in a different way than his contemporaries. It has changed my life in that Walden made me see the error of spending my life working for no other reason than to acquire more possessions. It can also give you a greater appreciation of nature. This should be required reading."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Great ideas in a mixed format, some great observations presented in poeticverse and some rant with confused presentation.

When I was in high school I had the opportunity to be in the New England area and wanted to learn about Thoreau.Unfortunately being English my second language, it was almost impossible for me to fully understand what Thoreau really meant.I finally I had the chance to read it and fully understand it. Believe me all these years have been worth to wait."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is really a great work, by a great thinker and a great man. I would like to focus on three concrete topics Henry Thoreau writes about that are still not solved.He already understood the futility of mass communications before they actually happened. \\"We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\\" This was written in 1854 ! Now, 150 years later, this could not be closer to the truth. Only the names have changed. I don't have the slightest idea who Princess Adelaide is, nor am I interested in her, but I can't ignore that much of the \\"news\\" is now dominated by Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and other starlets, whose names will also be forgotten within 20 years. What a waste of time...On politics, Thoreau disliked profoundly the way our \\"democracy\\" is organized, where we have to elect a \\"representative\\" who then is supposed to \\"think in our place\\". \\"Where is this division of labor to end ? and what object does it finally serve ? No doubt another may also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.\\"A third thought concerns the way the economy should be handled : \\"... a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.\\""},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"My first copy of this book was indubitably from some other publisher. So I'm not commenting on this particular volume but the content of the work itself.I have always loved this book but it wasn't until recent years that I realized what a controversial book this was. Thoreau published this book at his own expense and he sold very few copies. Later on he stored most of his unsold copies in an attic. He once claimed to have the largest collection of book published by Henry David Thoreau than anyone alive - and I'm sure he did.But why didn't people buy this book? Well, for one thing it was critical of \\"the neighborhood\\". For another thing it was critical of \\"the values of his neighbors\\". For another thing it was critical of the values of his countrymen; it was critical of Capitalism; it was critical of modern life; it was critical of the \\"consumer mentality\\"; it was critical of the work ethic; it was critical of buying things; it was critical of \\"getting ahead\\" and \\"accumulating; it was critical of working for a living; it was critical of achieving; it was a critique on the civilization of the day - and it was not positive.So why did it make me feel good to read it then and why does it have the same effect on me today?I don't know but whenever I get lonely to go have a talk with an old friend I go to the book shelf and pick up Walden by Henry David Thoreau.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:\\"A Little Something: Poetry and Prose\\""},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"What has happened to our language?

Thoreau was always learning and teaching us about things like how to live life, the joys of life, and that the best government is the government that governs the least. Thoreau's ideas, especially the idea about politics, have much relavence today, since we have a very terrible president sending poor boys to their deaths just to 1 up old Pappy. I once thought that Poe was my favorite author, then, I read Thoreau and my views were changed. Thoreau was such a wise poet and a modern day hippie, if you will. When the Mexican War, also known as the Northern American Invasion(by the Mexicans whose land was stolen by us in that war) started in 1846, Thoreau, who was already pissed off at the government refused to pay his taxes and then was thrown in jail. He wrote later of his account in a poem. Sadly, Thoreau would die of Tuberculosis around the beginning of the Civil War(which he rejected) in 1862. One witness recalled that Thoreau, dying was at peace and seemed to be happy so, like Jerry Garcia the great, Henry David Thoreau passed into Heavan with a smile on his face. Thoreau has passed, but has left a great legacy with this masterpiece which I think should be read by all, especially Americans."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When Thoreau made his great experiment of withdrawal from the social world he went into the woods in order to confront himself and real life. This action , the action of withdrawal and the ensuing revelation have served as inspiration and example for many others overwhelmed by the burdens and business of life. Thoreau however was not an ordinary person in withdrawal. He was a very deep student of Nature and of the philosophical literature of his Time, of Emerson. And he was in tune with the Transcendental spirit of that time that reaching out and beyond to a spiritual reality which in some way would unite all worlds and bring the universal unity of Mankind. The combination of his deep perception of the local physical world and the vast stretch of his richly metaphoric mind help make one of the great American classics.This work is so aphoristically rich that it is difficult to read it as simple consecutive prose. As with Emerson one must pause and rethink the various aphorisms given us. But one thing, the spirit, the spirit of hope of intellectual adventure of faith in a greatness and goodness in Nature carry us forward.

It had been raining the entire trip, but armed with my coat of many pockets, my backpack, and my umbrella, I entered and \\"sauntered\\" about the gift shop, glad to get out of the cold dampness if only for a moment. I picked up a couple of the customary t-shirts one needs as souvenirs when traveling and then found myself in the book section, drawn to the items which enthrall me wherever I go. One book stood out-not because I needed it, for I had a copy at home that was given to me by a friend for my birthday one year, but because of the photo on the cover. Whoever had designed the cover had actually BEEN to Walden, and the proof was the wet leaf among the terra firma known as the Pond. With an accompanying introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, I couldn't refuse. The cover still touches me, but I have taken to reading books and giving them away afterward, a habit that I am almost sure that Henry would love. I instead remember Walden in other ways, as rain falling on cedars. Walden to me is always Easter, always Earth Day, always truth, and most of all, always a reminder that my life is not mean or poor but rich and ready for picking. The chapters relying on Spring, Economy, Reading, and most of all the swelling Conclusion, like a gentle coda after the soaring symphony, remind me of what still waits, regardless of how old I am, and how old I will get."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"\\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Thoreau spent 26 months hermitage at Walden Pond to face what is essential and shed the rest. Starting with Economy then on to Where I lived and What For and Reading, Sounds, Solitude, Visitors, the Pond, Baker Farm, Higher Laws, Brute Neighbors, House Warming, and on through to Spring. Sounds is one of my favorite chapters. He tells of the sounds he can hear as he sits silently listening. He sets his furniture out of doors and watches the sun beam down. He hears the railroad whistle in the distance and the distant rumbling of wagons over bridges or hoot owls at night with bullfrogs too, a plethora of sound!Superb writing and the benefit of one perceptive man's 26 months of reflection, hermitage, and life at Walden Pond."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When I read Thoreau's book Walden, I was amazed to learn that Thoreau's writing had such a great influence on such men as Mohandas Gandhi and Dr Martin Luther King. They read Thoreau's book on \\"civil disobedience,\\" which advocated passive resistance (Peaceful protest). Another thing that surprised me was the way that Emerson and James Russell Lowell degraded Thoreau in their speeches at Henry's memorial service upon his death. During the memorial these two so-called friends of Thoreau called him a lazy braggart, a societies maverick & a drop out! Perhaps by societies standards he was a rebel but certainly not the worthless ne'er do well that these men painted him. Thoreau sets out to build a cabin on Walden Pond in order to be at one with nature. Thoreau was at heart a naturalist. He resisted paying a tax which he spent one night in the Concord jail for. This was to prove a point. He lived at Walden Pond for 2 years. Upon returning to society, he continued to write his books. He said that, \\"most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Henry David Thoreau was born July 12, 1817 & died May 6, 1862 of T.B. He built his cabin on March 1845 at Walden Pond at a cost of $28,12 & half cents. Thoreau started out life in the Transcendentalist movement but he later departed from this group.

So good, in fact, that I waited years to finish this book, savoring it. No writer that I can think of matches Thoreau for perception, insight, and clarity. While perhaps not as original a thinker as Emerson (and not as good a poet, in my opinion), Thoreau tops his master in the practical, while being funnier (okay--a dry Yankee funny, but funny nevertheless). This book advocates the philosophy of simplicity by respecting nature. It is critical of the hurly-burly waste of the modern industrial world, but it is not cynical. It is beautiful.

It's a classic of American literature, and as thought-provoking as just about any work of philosophy. It's a bit of a dry read at times, but we must remember it's not a work of fiction. Forget about characters, and forget about the rest of Thoreau's life, and focus on what he's trying to say.That being said, this book is a beautiful edition of a classic work.

He writes about rejecting society however when he lived at Walden he went into town every day to socialize and buy things. He wrote about seclusion but was in contact with other people almost every day. His writings are wonderful works but I think its ironic that he doesn't practices what he preaches.Thoreau, in Walden, wrote a lot about human and animals. He compares the instincts of animals to the barbaric qualities of humans. In Chapter 11, \\"Higher Laws,\\" he sees a ground squirrel and feels an urge to kill it and eat it raw. In Chapter 12, \\"Brute Neighbors,\\" he watches a battle of ants and feels his animalistic instincts compel him to watch it to the end. He studies life in the woods and is always around it therefore his statement of total seclusion is proven false.Thoreau is one of my favorite writers and his style intrigues me greatly. However, he carefully alters his writings for himself to sound non-conformist and anti-society. Not that this should be held against him. He is a wonderful writer with a distinct style, but he isn't really a non-conformist. He conformed to the non-conformist style but couldn't give up his social life."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Undoutedly &lt;&lt;walden&gt;&gt;is a great book for every nature lover .In this eligent edition you will surprised in such considerations that pulisher had made,the lovely dark green hard cover and gorgeous essays by Thoreau were fit author's initial intents of his writting.I read &lt;&lt;walden&gt;&gt;for more than three times,this special book could popular for hundred year because of its humanity remedied most of people's madness and negetive thoughts.&lt;&lt;Walden&gt;&gt; surely is not a personal expirence,mostly reflected the goodness among the nature ,human and poetry."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"It appears that computers are running Amazon.com.

I decided to read this because a) I usually read such random \\"fluff\\", that I thought I should try to better myself, and b) I've gone to Walden quite a few times now, and was interested to hear what Mr Thoreau had to say about his experience (though admittedly I'm sure much has changed between his visits and mine). My conclusion? I'll stick with my \\"fluff\\".I get it, it's a \\"classic\\", but that doesn't mean it makes for good reading. As others have said, I went into it expecting some deep thoughts, grand ideas he came up with while spending some quality time with nature, whether I agreed with them or not. What I got were a few quotable lines here and there, mixed into a book that details how he grew beans, how much he spent to build stuff, and what I feel are some rather unfair judgments on other peoples' lives (almost like the 17th century equivalent of \\"I'm a *fill in the blank* and I'm so much better than these other misguided soles who aren't\\").Personally, bored to tears with the book. If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it. If you're looking for deep thoughts about nature, it's probably better to go out there yourself and come up with your own."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I had hopes for this book and here's why, I was never much of a reader. Music was my passion, But a few years after high school I met my now wife who made me feel like I missed out on a lot of great literature. This feeling was made even more aware to me upon the meeting of my brother-in-law who is an english teacher, And a shakespear specialist. So as the music of my generation died off for the most part I started reading avidly, Recently I decided that I was gonna start reading all the literary classics I could and started with this. Now I can very much see the appeal of this book, Thoreau has an unbelievable ability to detail his surrounding so vividly that one can picture himself there on the shores of walden pond. His dialogues on man living with only what he needs are so elegantly put that theres no wonder so many people think that hey I can go into the middle of nowhere and live so minimaly. The down side of this book to me was that he's very aware of how well spoken he is and tends to drone on about the same things multiple times at great lengths through out the book. Now he never repeats the same metaphor when redescribing something even for the fourth time which don't get me wrong is very impressive but makes the book about 100 pages longer than it really needs to be. Thoreau comes of a little to pompus for me in the fact that he likes to mention just how smart and witty he is over and over again, And to the people the get enamored with this breaking away from society and surviving on the land its self. Please pay attention closely before you decide to go all into the wild with yourself, why because one he's not very far from the village that he's breaking away from not to mention he makes multiple comments about getting things from town or from neighbors. So he's not that secluded from man, He's sounds like the kid that say's he's going to run away from home then proceeds to go to a friends house down the block thinking he's traversed the globe to get away. Now despite my critiques of Thoreau he is quite an astounding writer this book really is worth a read, But pay attention to whats really happening and try not to get caught up in all his exagerations of his situation. By the the way his book civil disobedience is way more pointent than walden."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book is fantastic. It's one of my favorite books along with Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey. The Transcendentalists really knew what was going on. In our consumeristic times, it is necessary to learn how to simplify. That is what Thoreau was all about."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Reading Walden is like visiting the Grand Canyon or standing at the shores of the Meditteranean...part awe at witnessing the grandeur of such a thing and part studied concentration to ensure it will remain in your memory.For the purposes of this review, I would offer two examples:In the first, Thoreau is attempting to demonstrate the futility of acquisitation. To make his point, he likens the burden of property ownership with the burden an ant endures while carrying a morsel. Like the ant we are blinded to the unnecessary weight of our possession.Unlike the Buddha, Thoreau shows by example that existence is suffering even when caused by the fulfillment of desire.In the second example, Thoreau gives us vision and asks that the word go out to every John or Johnathan that \\"there is more light to day than dawn. The sun is but a morningstar!\\"How could I -- a mere reviewer -- follow this up? I can't. Thoreau preached self reliance so I would offer the same: read Walden for yourself that you may better appreciate its wonders."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I needed an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a reader's guide to get through this book. It's by no means light reading, Thoreau uses a lot of big words, metaphors, and references a lot of obscure people and places. Though arduous to read, this helped to expand my vocabulary and knowledge as well while reading. Even though it is so difficult to read, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. He had an amazing perspective on life and some of his writing just made me gasp in amazement. It's worth reading, my advice would be to not get discouraged if you don't understand everything he writes and says."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Anyone who has ever been stirred by discontent or haunted by life's unanswered questions or just intrigued by possibility, hear Walden's message. \\"No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof.\\" Thoreau offers no proof, but merely sought himself, and challenges us rethink every assumption, habit, and doctrine. This concept, along with so much about Thoreau, resounds within me. As with no other writer, I can relate with him on a personal level. I, too, have had revelations in amidst simplicity and nature. Time and time again, I emerge from a time in the woods-be it two weeks backpacking in the smoky mountains or an afternoon jog beside four mile creek-only to find myself irrevocably changed. The seemingly impervious logic that formerly laid behind affections preferences, habits, hobbies, choices, even my lifestyle, had vaporized. The sun shines more brightly-and every aspect of life is illuminated differently. It can be an alarming but incredibly valuable experience, a free one as long as nature is preserved, and one that I would not trade for anything. All men would view and their time differently if only they became acquainted with nature, where time does not exist. \\"At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.\\" The choice, in so many ways, is yours."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I have at least six or seven different editions of Thoreau's greatest classic, and this one is my prized possession. Of course, if I took his ideas more seriously I would simplify things and give away the other copies, but they have my notes in them and I find it hard to let go of them. Part of the problem of this edition being so beautiful, on excellent paper, with very useful notes and images, is that I would hate to mark it up with the lines and notes that I have included in some of the other editions. Still, that's a good problem. The notes in this book are useful notes -- not just a haphazard list of some scholars' remarks (not always authoritative) on favorite passages, and not speculation, but clear sources for some of the obscure references in the text.On the book as a whole, it is worth noting that Walden is rich in ideas and is one of the most profound American philosophical classics, and no reading could exhaust its wealth. It is much more than a journal of Thoreau's time alone in the woods (as it were) on the banks of Walden Pond (as it is often thought to be by those who haven't read it - I know because I often ask my students what they know about the book before they read it).A quick introduction to the project of Walden, that will help organize and make sense of some of the variety of Thoreau's remarks here, is to think of his remarks as falling under three rough stages:(1) an account of the problem we face, that we waste away our lives trying to make a living, that we seek to acquire property for the sake of freedom but find ourselves encumbered, that we associate the rise of modern technology with enlightenment but find that our technologies and advances increasingly take us away from ourselves and our self-sufficiency, and make us dependent on what we do not individually understand.(2) an account of an experiment undertaken to discover what is truly essential for a life of fulfillment, and the discovery that a complete and worthwhile life can be achieved through a deliberate simplification of desires.(3) an account of the many remarkable discoveries that can be made about ourselves and about the natural world and the relation between these when we voluntarily simplify our lives.This is a book to read and return to throughout one's life, and there aren't many books that really merit such attention. Given its importance, having a copy in what is probably the best edition available now makes a lot of sense."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Thoreau wrote a scathing and humerous critique of his neighbors. His comments about living in the moment, jumping off the rat race of working ever harder to accumulate more toys, about just plain walking about with open eyes, applies equally in our day. He bi-sected human frailty with a very sharp knife. Some of his writing uses terms and analogy unfamiliar in our daily use. But persevere and you will surely gain a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I first read this book twenty years ago and found it a refreshing insight into the modern world. Every couple of years I refer to it and everytime I read it I am astonished at the insight in such a simple read. This book has become a friend, which good books do. As meaningful today as when it was written and to me a relief from the modern age. Beautiful quotes all the way through which I still use. One of my favourites is that \\"I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion\\"."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"In 1845 Henry David Thoreau built a 10 x 15 foot cabin in the woods on the shore of Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, and lived there for two years, two months, and two days. Out of this experience came the book Walden, first published in 1854. Embarking on this sojourn of solitude was an attempt to escape the distractions, conventions, and frivolous fashions of urban society, to reconnect with the essentials of existence, and to get at the very root of life. By practicing a simpler way of living, engaging in a more direct relationship with nature, and replacing the hubbub of civilization with quiet contemplation, Thoreau hoped to experience life more fully and richly. The result of this experiment is this classic of American literature, an inspirational combination of philosophy, poetry, and natural history.Walden is a manifesto of nonconformity and individualism. Thoreau urges readers to forget how society says you should live and to live by your own compass, by what you feel is right. Disregard public opinion and take command of your own fate. The materialistic culture of modern, civilized society distracts us from finding our true direction in life. Solitude and introspection are the means by which to recover one's bearings. Through a simplified, more natural way of life, Thoreau was able to strip away the unnecessary psychic baggage of society's traditions and expectations, allowing him to examine his life objectively. By Thoreau's account, even in the mid-19th century Americans were slaves to the rat race, working themselves like beasts of burden, ever accumulating debt, all for the sake of luxuries that were supposed to bring pleasure to their lives but only compounded their misery. He begins the book by laying bare all the absurdities of this unhealthy cycle, insightfully picking apart the ills of his contemporary society with a biting, sarcastic wit. It is remarkable how well his critique of \\"modern life\\" has held up over the past 150 years. His opinion of the railroad, for example, can be just as accurately applied to today's internet when he questions the benefit of all this high-speed communication if people have nothing meaningful to say to one another. \\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life,\\" he writes, \\"are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\\" To experience the true joy of life, quit living for your possessions and get your mind and spirit in order. Though the language of Thoreau often sounds antiquated to the 21st century reader, the message of Walden is still as vital as the day it was written.In describing his two years in the woods, Thoreau provides poetically beautiful and scientifically accurate depictions of the scenery, inhabitants, and processes of the natural world. Yet for Thoreau these empirical observations are only a means to an end. As a member of the Transcendentalist movement, Thoreau saw nature as a medium through which the higher philosophical truths of the universe are revealed. It is to nature that we should turn to seek guidance in living our lives, not to the traditions, mores, and manners agreed upon by civilized society. One need not retreat to the wilderness to lead a natural life. In fact, Walden Pond was only a few miles out of town, and Thoreau had visitors almost daily. Isolation was not the point of his experiment, but rather self-reliance, in thought as well as deed. To find direction in life one must seek inwardly. Nature is free to all, and all are free to learn its lessons and live by them. Let Walden be your guide. There is profound wisdom to be gleaned from each paragraph for those willing to seek it."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Not only is this an excellent read, it is a way of life. If you truly read this book more than once you will learn things about life and your place on this planet will be enriched. You will undergo changes, you must understand. Thoreau was a master at creating an alternative to living life in the fast lane. \\"Living Deliberatly\\" simply and with a purpose is so important, in this book you will learn how to do all of it. Your life will be better if you really try to understand. Even the slow parts have messages so be sure to pay attention. You will become awakened."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I buy books in hardcover when I want them to last, when I know we will be life-long friends. \\"Walden\\" is one of those books, and this edition published by Castle Books is truly lovely.Henry David Thoreau is, of course, quite famous for his Walden experiment and his name immediately invokes that of a lonely hermit living in a hut on the outskirts of society. This myth, however, is far from accurate. For one thing, Thoreau never intended to become a recluse, but he did desire to put into action--to literally prove--how living in nature could bring us closer to our higher selves.Philosopher Erick Erickson, in saying that \\"Every person should have a Walden,\\" testifies to the metaphorical nature of Thoreau's experiment. For Thoreau, the two years spent living at Walden Pond represented an inner journey in which he spiritually connected with nature and created a place--a personal Walden--inside of his soul.Thoreau's metaphysical journey began with his recognition of the interrelatedness of all life. It was not enough that he engross himself in nature; he had to see himself as a vital part of it. Thus, in \\"Walden\\" he writes, \\"Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mold myself?\\"Even more importantly, internalizing a place like Walden Pond meant seeing the connectedness of even the \\"negative\\" aspects of nature. For example, when he imagines the seeds he planted in the ground rotting because of too much rain he says, \\"it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass, it would be good for me.\\" In this way, Thoreau is able to recreate any negativity he finds at Walden and turn it into something positive by focusing on the unity of all nature and seeing everything as a symbol of the self.This is easier said then done and Thoreau willingly recognizes the difficulty of finding connections in the natural world, even at a site of pastoral beauty such as Walden Pond. But in spite of the difficulties, he stresses solitude and self-discovery because he believes that only by actively exploring our inner lives can we become aware enough to see the bonds which link all things.In his conclusion to \\"Walden\\" he asks us, \\"What does Africa--what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior white on the chart?\\" How, he implores us, can we ever hope to see the connections between things if we have yet to investigate our own souls?\\"Nay,\\" he commands, \\"be a Columbus to whole new worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought.\\" Thus, Thoreau urges us to embark on a voyage of self-discovery that will help us truly participate in nature by seeing ourselves as \\"part and parcel\\" of it. \\"Explore [yourselves]\\" he urges us, and uncover \\"the perennial source of life\\" through nature.It is not an easy path to follow, but luckily Thoreau does not recommend that we follow his path exactly. We don't need to purchase a secluded cabin and turn our backs on civilization (although that sounds nice at times!); we just need to get off the \\"beaten track\\" and to immerse ourselves in our own special, wild places.Re-reading \\"Walden\\" this last week I was reminded of the need to do so every couple of years. I'm looking forward to having this forest green volume around for a long time."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book, edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, is a dream come true for diehard Thoreauvians (like myself). If you think you know everything about Thoreau's Walden, think again. This book is full of fascinating footnotes that shed light on particular turns of phrase and allusions that one thought one had grasped. The footnotes are particularly illuminating in re turns of phrases that have gone out of style. To learn, for instance, that train wrecks and such were commonly referred to as &quot;melancholy accidents&quot; in the papers of the time, lends an otherwise missing mordant wit to Thoreau's criticism of the railroad when he says that &quot;it will be perceived that a few are riding while the rest are run over-and it will be called, and will be, 'A Melancholy Accident'.&quot;-Absolutely delightful! Why is this book out of print with so many purported lovers of Thoreau out there?!?"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I've read Walden at least a dozen times and it just keeps getting better.Thanks to the truly inspirational thoughts in this book, I have learned to be alone in the woods and high wilderness and feel nothing but joy and awe. Fear doesn't enter into it. It's only people and \\"civilization\\" that bring me angst. Thoreau taught me how to use my mind to see beyond the surface of nature into its glorious inner workings, and few gifts have ever been so precious in my life.There is so much wisdom here it's impossible to digest it all even in a dozen readings. Lines from this book come to me over and over as life rolls along. One of my favorites states that HDT would be happy to live in a pine box, three feet by six feet, as long as he could wake up every morning in the middle of nature. I know exactly what he means, and I have patterned my life along that vein of simplicity and sustainability.For that and so many other thoughts here, I love Thoreau like a real brother. He's always there when I need him. It's okay that Walden was closer to town than most think; the real point here is letting wild nature enter into you until you become part of it and no longer part of the illusory world of homo sap. That can be done even in a city park if one learns how.This book, along with the best of HDT's journals, constitute some of the most useful of all American literature to my mind, and to millions of others over the last century-plus.Thanks to Hank for understanding what really matters, and for waking up an entire nation to how precious our natural heritage is."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Jeffrey Cramer's annotated \\"Walden\\" weaves together the \\"woof\\" of Thoreau's philosophy and observances with the \\"warp\\" of all the influences upon him in his life, current and remembered.

The font is tiny, the margins ridiculously thin. I was so disappointed to open the package and find this version."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Henry David Thoreau's Walden is one of the great classics of American letters. Although its reputation has been somewhat unfortunately tainted in our modern day times by its reputation as the &quot;treehugger's Bible&quot;, this, indeed, misses the point of the book entirely. Although Thoreau obviously loved nature, and was one of the nation's first enviromentalists - indeed, the modern day enviromentalist awareness outlook can be traced directly back to Thoreau - the core of this book is not a simple stating of the virtues of nature. No, indeed: Thoreau, in this book, lays down nothing less than a life philosophy. Both his essay &quot;On Civil Disobediance&quot; and this book, which preach the virtues of individual liberty and the importance of Man over State have been enormously influential on my own personal philosophy and views. Thoreau raises some staggeringly deep existential questions: If a man lives entirely outside of the State, doesn't depend on them at all, but still resides inside the boundaries of said country, need he pledge them any allegiance? Need he pay their taxes if he does not depend on their support for his welfare? Thoreau, here, tells us how to get the most out of life by living simply: using only what we need in life and doing without luxuries - cutting off the fat, so to speak. Indeed, much like the philosophy of Rosseau, Thoreau seemed to basically believe that the true essence and spirit of man resides in the state of nature: he assures us that, if all men lived as simply as he did at Walden, there would be very little theft, crime, violence, envy, or jealousy. He urges us all to live our own lives as we see fit, neither depending on or heeding others, and not merely become another mindless drone in the conformist society. For all of this greatness, the book, I must say, however, is not faultless. The book does tend to ramble at times - Thoreau might, indeed, have benifited from some editing. And, on a more personal note, I am far more interested in Thoreau's philosophical outlook on life than his observations on nature, and found many parts of the book focusing on the latter aspect to be a bit slow and trying. Still, if you belong to that camp, then I can only give this book an even higher reccommendation for you. An essential read for those who would have us return to a simpler state of things, as well as those in favor of preserving the natural beauty that is still left to us."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"At the age of 50, I, like many adults struggled with the meaning of what I had been doing for the past 50 years. Most of it spent in pursuit of my generation thought of as the \\"American\\" dream. Thoreau, in the classic work, answers many of those questions. Less is actually more. No review can do justice to this work; it must be read, and preferably in some wilderness location, away from the bustle of \\"city life\\". ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"When some people think of WALDEN, they think of a man living deep in a primeval forest, far away from civilization, learning how to become one with nature. Rather, WALDEN is about a man living only a few miles from a well-established village (Concord) attempting to learn about himself, especially in relation to the nature around him. He believes men live lives of \\"quiet desperation,\\" always in a hurry, missing the best that life has to offer. To discover life's greatest offerings, which for Thoreau can only be found inside a person, never \\"out there,\\" he builds a hut on the shore of Walden Pond and lives there for two years.\\"I went to the wood because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\\" he writes. It is an \\"experiment\\" in living (as republican democracy is the \\"experiment\\" upon which the country was founded), an empirical one based on observation. He describes in loving detail the woods, the fields, the birds he hears, the pond itself (\\"the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature\\"), even village life (he goes to Concord every few days to pick up on the latest gossip). He describes the seasons as they progress and how they touch upon his inner search for meaning. Zen-like he finds inner purity and the necessity to free himself from the social and political ties that restrict his \\"freedom.\\" He feels \\"the divine being established\\" inside of him every day. Finally it's time to leave (he is a man of the world after all). But he's learned that \\"if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success.\\" One must be true to one's own nature - that is the key message of WALDEN.WALDEN is an American classic that combines the mystical with the practical. For those who have ever felt that \\"life\\" is some force outside of us, controlling us always, tearing apart our true natures (and who hasn't felt that at one point or another?), WALDEN is just the book to remind us that we don't have to be \\"a slave to material desires.\\" Excellent in every way."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I am one of those people who has read Walden over and over again over a period of decades, and have owned several editions. This is by far the best I have seen. It is quite helpful in the explanations it provides for some of the more obscure passages, is beautifully put together, and is simply a pleasure to read.Thoreau was part contrarian crank and part visionary, like a crazy uncle. I am glad to have known him through his books. Taken with a grain of salt, his perspectives are refreshing and often illuminating. He helps his readers see there are indeed different ways to look at the world."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&quot; I grew up in New England near Walden Pond and first read Thoreau's Walden in college. It has had a profound influence upon my life over the thirty years since then. One of the great tragedies of life in our time is that many people spend their lives working like slaves to accumulate wealth which is spent on things they don't need. And in the course of this pursuit of wealth, vast tracts of time are lost at great expense. Why? Some people may never have the epiphany that the pursuit of material wealth and the search for meaning are entirely separate and wealth doesn't guarantee that you live your life well or nobly or meaningfully. Thoreau knew this. He considered the townspeople of Concord to be slaves to their farms and herds and fields and houses. In the woods Thoreau became totally immersed in the process of living each day: he watched red and black ants fight an epic battle, which he described as having great depths of Homeric valor. He observed the color of the pickerel in Walden and the color of the ice in winter. And listened with disdain to the sound of the Fitchburg railroad as it whistled in the distance. He was a purely self-reliant human being having built his own cabin by hand and planting his own fields. This great American naturalist could look at a stand of trees and tell by observation the forces of nature it had experienced. Thoreau is profoundly wise and if you read Walden earnestly, it will change your life. I know that after I had read it, I was never the same person. Give it a chance to do the same for you. You may become transcendental, if you read it sincerely. And understand the importance of marching to the tune of a different drummer."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I think Thoreau was a nut-job.

If you think you can &quot;discover yourself&quot; or &quot;discover the meaning of life&quot; by going out into the woods by yourself well then you have a social problem. I don't believe a pond can tell you anything about people or about anything for that matter. What can happen to you if you go live in solitary for a long period of time is that you can develop a mental problem, and that's about it. Sure, lets get rid of everything in life that makes us happy, simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Ha! This only sounds like a very depraved soul crying out for help. I think the only thing we can learn from this book is that it is not a good idea to go live in the woods by yourself, because it's hard. I say this book is a complete waste of time. It is perhaps the most boring piece of literature I've ever laid eyes. I say save your time and money and don't read this book."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I first read Solitude in high school(over 10 years ago), not as part of the regular curriculum but for US Academic Decathlon. To think about it even now still bores me. Reading Solitude may have been the most boring part of USAD, &amp; that ain't a little bit of boredom. Thoreau, Emerson, those other guys I can barely differentiate, especially the 'fire &amp; brimstone' types were some of the reasons I took British lit instead of American lit in college. I also took British lit rather than American because it is 800+ years vs. 200+. (Thanks Mr. M, my h.s. English lit teacher). But back to Walden.Think of it. You decide to live in solitude for a couple of years, in the 19th century! The very idea is boring. Let's not get into no t.v., et.c. But not even the daily news? Didn't they have newspapers back then? Before some make the mistake of thinking I don't understand, I (yawn) say I can appreciate one's desire to engage himself by the near total exclusion of others. I just don't believe its something you need to read about some guy doing over 150 years ago. On the other hand, if you wanted to avoid those very interesting times, you'd do what Thoreau did if you could so afford. If not you'd read about it, to quiet the debate going on outside one person's journey of self-discovery. Specifically, if I wanted to learn more about those times I'd check up on abolitionist writings, women's suffrage, and other things from the period that were more topical.Nevertheless, I could use a copy though, for those troublesome nights when I can't get to sleep.P.S.

Genius."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"- an excellent insight into nature, humanity - though Thoreau is somewhat contradictory at times.To read all the books of the Collector's Library is on my 'bucket list'."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I get why Walden is beloved by so many of us: it is the antithesis of American capitalist society. It confronts, with remarkable courage and aggression, head on, the very \\"progresses\\" and prosperity that so many Americans consider to be the foundation of this country and even of the American Dream. And it is an ode to nature at the dawn of the beginning of a shameful era of nature's accelerated destruction.But it was hard to swallow; in fact, too hard. I was not able to get past Chapter 3. If Thoreau could have passed himself off as a man of the world with wisdom and credibility this book would be radically more appealing. However I fear Walden to be the writing of a bitter, angry, social pariah-come-misanthrope. So, to employ an analogy of our own times, it is difficult for me to accept one man's statement of the meaninglessness of mainstream society when the man is about as socially attuned as Noam Chomsky or Glenn Beck.I'll stick to Emerson."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"A poignant peek into one man's view of what is and should be the true importance of every man's existence. Thoreau in the 1800s already felt, in my opinion, strangled by too much, unnecessary stimuli. Once out in the woods, on his own, with just the basic necessities, he was able to reconnect with his true self. I can only imagine what he would think of today's world. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Reading through the pages of this book makes you wonder if the author was a hermit and a heretic or a social reformer, or a mystical philosopher. \\"On Walden Pond\\" sounds similar to the classic movie \\"On Golden Pond,\\" starring Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn. There are some similarities; in both stories the lead characters go and live near a secluded lake (pond) to spend their lives, but Thoreau goes a step forward to find himself and his soul when he can't accept the status quo of life. His journey is to find the truth that is beyond the apparent reality: A search for transcendental truth of Bhagavadgita and Upanishads. His search for the nature of soul is found in the tranquility of Walden Pond when he states that, \\"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modem world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! There I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and, floating by Temate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the tropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which Alexander (the Great) only heard the names.\\" Through these passages he compares himself to the great Vedic sages and rishis who meditated deep in the woods for prolonged period of time in total tranquility to realize spiritual awakening. Thoreau was a prophet who had the same identity crisis as his better known contemporaries like; Emerson, Whitman, Channing, Hawthorne, Melville, and Dickinson. But among these men, Thoreau was forerunner as practitioner. He insisted that knowledge without experience or action is a false knowledge.Thoreau's passion to seek inner meaning of life is illustrated by his disappointment in the traditional Christian culture; \\"We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agriculture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten.\\" In another paragraph he observes; \\"For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify God and enjoy him forever.\\" In another section of the book, Thoreau writes, \\"We perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit every where, which still is built on purely illusory foundations.\\" He continues in the later part of the paragraph, \\"I have read in a Hindoo book, that there was a king's son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father's ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,\\" continues the Hindoo philosopher, \\"from the circumstances, in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme. I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things.\\"Thoreau was also keenly interested in the work Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution. In many ways he resembled Darwin in his patient observations and Benjamin Franklin in his inventive practicality. Unlike most transcendentalists, he could do things, tend to garden and make home repairs for Emerson, or actualize the real carpentry Branson Alcott's fanciful vision of a summer house.Thoreau expresses strong belief in social reforms when he refuses to pay taxes in protest against practice of slavery in Southern States. He championed abolitionist John Brown whom he met briefly in Concord, Massachusetts. In one paragraph he laments; \\"I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous,..\\" \\"There are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave driver of your soul.\\"1.Civil Disobedience2.The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson & Henry David Thoreau3.Henry David Thoreau : A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers / Walden; Or, Life in the Woods / The Maine Woods / Cape Cod (Library of America)"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"First of all, the Kindle Annotated edition itself is fine.

It was hard to get through, and it is largely repetative. Thoreau, considered the first enviromentalist, writes about his 2 year experiences in Walden Woods, on the pond.

The well read reader should read this one to say that they have read Walden."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"There was plenty of good, profound philosophy in this book. Thoreau made many wise observations and commentaries throughout the book. Unfortunately, these were all buried under heaps of gibberish. &quot;Blah blah I used X many nails to build my house blah blah the ground here is soft blah blah....&quot; and so on. I couldn't care less about the wildlife, or the ecological systems of Walden pond; if I had wanted that I would have read a science book. I wonder if Thoreau liked the sound of his own voice.

Still, it is one that many people should read. At least read &quot;Economy&quot; and &quot;Conclusion&quot; (which is not really a conclusion, but more of a continuation).Some have criticized Thoreau of being hypocritical. It is easy to see why. He chastises gossip, but then produces gossip on the printed page so that many will read it well after the fact. To be true to himself, it should have stayed within himself. He could have provided examples for our benefit without being quite so particular.Another example is condemning the &quot;corporate&quot; life, but then he proceeds to closely detail his manner of how he could make a living off the land -- not merely eating what he sowed, but that he sowed enough to make money doing it. Although he disliked local farmers giving him advice, he still disperses equivalent advice to his readers -- not taking a look in the mirror.I had expected more and it started out on a good note. This was written when he was 30. Although that would not be considered mid-life now, it probably was then. It certainly was in his case (he died of TB at 45). He starts with many things that one may learn during mid-life, which was encouraging, but then slowly turned it mostly into gripe sessions and simple anti-establishment diatribes. Although I agree with many of his points, too much bitterness was showing through.However, the baby should not be thrown out with the bath. There is much good and it has a generally positive outlook for one's life. He did this as an experiment and because he did not continue it, one must ask if the experiment was a failure. I think therein lies the greatest thought provoked by this book."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I don't know how people can call this book a brilliant &quot;American classic.&quot; I rarely enjoyed reading this book, and it took me quite a while to finish because I could never bring myself to sit down and read it. Once in a while, Thoreau offers some nice insight, but the majority of this book just describes his mundane daily activities, and then he goes off on a tangent seemingly trying to find something &quot;deep&quot; in it. Thoreau shows his writing ability to be very established, as he can go off for pages about the most petty things, but often it seemed he was just trying to show off his Latin or his knowledge of the Vedas. He found the need to write every Latin quote in both Latin AND English. I did read the English version for a reason. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they are reallly bored."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"For those of you have never read Walden, I suggest that you abstain entirely from the book, for the rest of your life, if possible. I have always had my doubts about works by the Transcendentalists, and they were confirmed, upon reading this &quot;American classic.&quot; This was just a plain piece of literary failure, and it was evident, as seen through Thoreau's own words. The man was full of contradictions, and in Walden, he was very successful in refuting what he just said a few pages before. He also seemed rather fascinated by Eastern traditions and spiritual writings, which, by the way, he often misquoted. Not only that, he exhibited, throughout his work, a subtle arrogance, in the sense that his words often suggested his supposed superiority, as though the readers should do nothing else other than heed his wise counsel. This proved to be quite unnecessary, after seeing it over and over again ad nauseum. In short, Walden does not merit the honorary title of an &quot;American classic,&quot; as there are other works by other authors that should deserve more praise than the ones lauded on Walden."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine?

I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was \\"o'erweening arrogance\\". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way. I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted.

So again, I understand why Thoreau is important.Now onto Walden Pond. Do people actually read this and enjoy it?

In this edition, Harding provides marginal notes to explain various references in the text, such as people and places that Thoreau mentions, Biblical allusions, or unfamiliar terminology.

End material includes some theories on possible meanings of the famous \\"hound, bay horse, and turtle-dove\\" passage, Thoreau's map of Walden Pond, and a list of works cited.Harding provides much useful information in the marginal notations, clarifying references to Greek texts that modern readers may not be familiar with, or pointing readers to scholarly interpretations of specific passages. The notations can improve one's understanding of Thoreau's text, but they can be a bit distracting at times. While many are informative, some seem a bit over-the-top, such as definitions for relatively common words like \\"scimitar\\" or \\"Algonquins\\".

That, pretty much, sums up my thoughts about this wonderful book. I keep coming back to it; don't know if it's the gentle admonitions, the fundamental questions that it raises or the rustic imagery that it creates in my mind. The relevancy of the message is found in the fact that a book that had New Englanders of the mid 1800s as it's target audience finds such an universal appeal (don't know what exactly they do, but there is a Thoreau society in Bangalore). At the same time, when one see the videos in YouTube where tourists are lined up to see a makeshift cabin, you can't help wondering whether the interest is for the wrong reason.Philosophical musings aside, Walden merits greatness on literary basis alone. Given that it was written in a period that is spatially and temporally far off, I had to constantly look up online to understand many of the references Thoreau makes in the book. If you can get hold of an annotated version it might be helpful.Walden, perhaps, will set you thinking in a new direction. As Thoreau says, \\"Man come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where their household echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes it own breath again; their shadows, morning and evening, reach farther than their daily steps.

It possesses that inexplicable charm which walks gracefully hand-in-hand with Transcendentalism, and marks the height of that era's thought. But Thoreau is quite different from the likes of Emerson; as another reviewer poignantly commented, while primarily a master of the word Thoreau was equally capable as a thinker, and Walden is, quite simply, the perfect demonstration of that fact. It is brimming with careful observation, a certain care and compassion for life, and Transcendentalist thought which may not be so casually dismissed. Walden is a masterpiece, perhaps because Thoreau removed himself from the modern whimsy which pervaded society in his times, but most certainly because Thoreau himself was the epitome of the joyous, nature-loving spirit which is embodied by the entire movement of Transcendentalism."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"After I crashed and burned in a college intro to philosophy course, I wanted to see if I could find a work by someone who was both a thinker and a writer.Thoreau, in his book Walden, proves himself to be it.Walden is the narrative of the author's two year stay at the aforementioned pond. He has decided to live life simply, and in a collection of loosely connected essays, he describes the people, animals, and the pond that make up his new home. If you haven't spent real time out in nature, you might think this book is ridiculous. But go into the woods, and stay there until boredom and longing for the city stops. Just then you'll realize the awe he felt when examining the ice bubbles and listening to vagabond squirells. Thoreau has rediscovered the patches of Eden that still exist in the world. And if we are open-minded enough to listen to his instructions, we can find our way back to them.Even if his insights into the idyllic perfection in nature fail to sway you to live more lightly in the world, Thoreau will open your eyes to the benefits of philosophy. He understands the man who marches to the beat of a different drummer, and shows through his clear, crisp text the results that thought and contemplation can hold for anyone."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book was a true inspiration to me and was part of the reason I fell in love with Nature.

When I lived in Massachusetts, I loved to read the book AT Walden pond. I've traveled to that little pond via bycycle, motorcycle and car and have seen the pond in every season and every state of weather. I have walked and run around the pond . I have swam across it many times, once at the price of mild hypothermia. I have skiid around and across it. I think the only part of that danged pond I have not seen is the bottom. The book is much like the pond -- you can read it over and over and it will always be fresh and you will never have plumbed its depths fully.The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the detailed nature observations may be tedious for readers not fortunate enough to be able to visit the pond.

They are great pieces of work and deserve some looking into."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden invites us to re-examine and weigh our priorities in life. It maximizes the value of our present experience, emphasizes the richness of nature, and diminishes the value and rationality of our struggle for material success. The book is filled with quotes and ideas that inspire a renewed energy and fresh approach to life. It awakens a sense of appreciation for simple pleasures. It promotes a perspective that reflects a more innocent set of values -- that challenge the world's judgement of a man by the money he earns, the car he drives and the possessions he amasses.In an era where excess spells success, it is calming and thought provoking to read about the Thorough's two years in the woods. It strikes a chord of things that we have known all along but have perhaps forgotten. The sights, sounds, and experiences of nature and the scenery provides us with a sensory scale to weigh our priorities and pursue new directions in our lives.Can we attain personal satisfaction and hapiness by simplifying our lives? This book inspires us to try."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I did not particularly enjoy this book, but it is one of those books that anyone who wants to study American Literature must read. Some parts are fascinating, and some of his arguments are strikingly acute, subtle, and persuasive. However, his experiment in natural living and in a more honest human economy just does not ring true to me. While his minor points are often inspiring, the overall argument simply strikes me as a little too self-righteous and overbearing. His indictment of society aside, I just don't find his alternative views as an improvement. I'm not interested in breaking down said arguments for the sake of this review, but I find its strengths to lie in the quality of the writing, the completeness of the philosophy, and the conviction in which it is written. Its weaknesses are debatable. I can see where one could argue there are none if one were to agree with his points and enjoys the narrative style. Others may say it is rather long-winded and/or cynical. I fall somewhere in the middle, as I actually suspect few readers will. I think most people will love or hate Walden, but, like I said, every serious student must give it a chance."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I wonder if Thoreau wrote the way he did as a way of imparting to his readers how much hard work he put in to living in the woods. If so, he was successful.This book contains many, many little gems of clever witticism and solid advice, but it's quite difficult to sift through all of the pointless and trivial paragraphs in order to separate Thoreau's genius from his madness. It is almost not worth it. I've lived twenty-two years having not read Walden and I did not live them as a hillbilly. Therefore, I probably would have been perfectly able to function in society without reading this monster.Again, though, the gems in this book cannot be denied. They are a mirror, in front of which is standing American society.Some have called Thoreau arrogant. I disagree. Although Americans might not want to see what Walden has to show them, they should not take this disgust out on the messenger. Thoreau did not imagine what he had to say about American society, but rather he observed it. That is not arrogance, it is realism and bravery.I do, however, truly wish I'd not read this book. Someone should sort out the passages of value and publish them in a small volume that most people might actually be able to get through. American society would be the beneficiaries of valuable knowledge and information without the drag of the rest of Thoreau's book."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"While I'm sure this is a great work of liturature that I should read, I was unable to get through it.....Maybe some day in the future, but not now."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"The book is new but there was no publishing information, which led me to think that this book was published illegally in another country.

His disobedience wasn't too civil was it? Unfortunately I think Ted Kacinsky is our Postmodern version of Thoreau taking extreme measures. But I rate this book much higher than his Anti-technology Manifesto. This book gives the disenfranschised, the outcast or someone whose just had enough of society and work a different alternative rather than &quot;Going Postal&quot; and making the 6 o'clock news. If anything, this book gave me compassion for people caught up in the materialism and clutter in their lives."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I have to disagree with the positive reviews above, but I'll admit I don't generally enjoy audio books and I couldn't get through much of this one.The first problem for me is that it is Walden Lite. In the parts I listened to while following along in the text, all Thoreau's references and comments on mythology, history, etc. were eliminated. No doubt that makes it simpler to read and listen to, but it's not Walden. If you're not up to dealing with the whole book, just get a book of Thoreau quotes...don't listen to this and think you've heard Walden.The biggest issue I had was that I simply didn't like the voice of the actor reading. It's hard to say why exactly, but I think I found it too high-pitched and affected. Never had the pleasure of hearing HDT's own voice of course, but I like to imagine it a lot more down to earth than this one."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Henry David Thoreau is more to me than a neighbor. His book is more to me than a classic.\\"Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity,\\" Thoreau states. . .. . .and in such powerful, clear, and memorable language tries throughout the book to awaken us.\\"Simplify, simplify,\\" he restates. . .. . .and encourages us to live--as he tried--honestly and sincerely.The five words quoted summarize \\"Walden\\", but it should not be summarized: it should be read, and reread. . .and understood. . .and practiced.What is Thoreau; what is Walden to me? The four-word title of this review was my original, complete review, submitted--and rejected--over 20 times.Simply:My god; my bible"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is one of the most classic examples of American literature. In his book, Thoreau describes his break from 19th century &quot;civilization&quot;, and his experiment at surviving alone in the woods near Walden Pond.Thoreau survives on a bare minimum of money, food and &quot;necessities&quot;. Along the way, he discovers how fragile our environment really is (even in the 19th century) and becomes one of the nation's first environmentalists.Walden is an absolute classic. It may have been written over 100 years ago, but its content seems more pertinent today than ever before. It is perhaps even more pertinent today than at the time it was originally written. If you are looking for a book to help you understand the fragile balance of both nature and humanity, this one is a must. It certainly puts one's life into perspecive."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Thoreau went into the Concord woods \\"to live deliberately\\" and to try to approach in practice his excellent motto--multum in parvo--much in little. Setting off to transact some business as simply as possible, Thoreau began his famous experiment a happy man. Importantly, he concluded it 26 months later in the same convivial state. After proving to himself it could be done, he saw no point in continuing his experiment in such extreme fashion, becoming once again \\"a sojourner in civilized life.\\"Thoreau was certainly not alone in the woods. Apart from the many visitors he welcomed, he took frequent trips \\"into town,\\" or met woodchoppers and ice cutters during his marathon sojourns through the fields and forests surrounding his wooden castle. While most men, as he famously said, \\"led lives of quiet desperation,\\" Thoreau seemed to soak up the life and energy of every waking hour, giving him an inexhaustible supply of earthly happiness. There was nothing quiet or desperate about Thoreau.Classically-educated Thoreau was patently devoted to the writings of ancient authors, but to him the words and pages written by Nature were far more interesting and pleasing than histories in Latin or 2500 year-old Greek sagacity. In fact, Thoreau read very little during a good portion of his Walden experiment. He preferred sometimes just to sit on his doorstep from morning to noon, steeped in the sights and sounds of the abundant nature surrounding him. Of course he also wrote. But the Walden we read today is not simply a collection of his raw, day-to-day diary reflections. In fact, it wasnft until a few years later that he expanded and painstakingly polished the rough journal entries he made during his stay in the woods. Whatever the case, the writing in Walden is brilliant throughout. Foremost, Thoreau was a writerca profoundly masterful one at that.People read his Walden for a variety of reasons. I read it because it speaks with an immortal voice...and every word, phrase and sentence resounds with transcendent clarity. This simple little book is so full of hope, wisdom and inspiration that one can read it a thousand times and each time discover a new kernel of brilliance or vision.During his lifetime, traditional success would never be his. But you would have had to argue with him over the definition of success. \\"The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind,\\" the author so wisely said. It is precisely because of such profundity that his \\"success\\" is guaranteed for as long as people still read good books.\\"Follow your genius closely enough and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour.\\" --H.D.T."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I read this book when I was 16. I found myself fascinated with Thoreau's simplistic living, and overall, his philosophical awareness. He was sure of his purpose in life and meant to live by the expectations only he held dear. I believe he wanted us, the readers, to realize that a man with so much potential and ability doesn't always have the desire to use it. Life is too short to waste on anything less than what makes us pleased with ourselves. We all know deep down what's right from wrong, how we really feel towards life and everyone who lives in it. A good life is the ability to live with total assurance that what we do is worth our struggle maintaining it.It changed the way I think, whether it be his intention to do so or not. It was the reminder for me that I am human, and in no way insignificant."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"A book I had always meant to get around to reading, but somehow never managed to make a priority. Glad I had the bright idea to order the audio version!This is a wonderful disc to accompany a hike in the country, a walk in the woods, or anywhere one is alone in nature. With his embracing of the simple, unencumbered style of life, and rejection of all material non-essentials, it is easy to see how Thoreau became godfather to the hippie and counter-culture movements of the 1960's.The reader's near monotone delivery does not exactly make Thoreau's inspired musings spring vividly to life, but his controlled placidity is not unsuited to the serene nature of the narrative either. It was extremely handy to have all of the unabridged, over eleven hours on one disc; I found myself frequently rewinding to allow a second or third shot at unravelling the complex, but elegant and profound prose passages.Listening to this audio CD was an excellent way to finally get to know this venerable work; an inspiring classic that most readers are aware of but fewer have actually read."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Imagine a man, living in the present time, who is fed up with life in our ever-changing electronic world. So, he goes to live in a hut he's re-built out by a gentle pond, reasonably away from civilization. He throws away his cell phone, computer, TV, radio, etc. and lives simply and quietly, observing naature with his eyes and a microscope. He's not a hermit, because he visits and is visited by, friends and neighbors. He examines his life in solitude and writes about the sights and sounds of the woods and the pond.For two years living alone this way, he comes to know nature and himself intimately and when he returns to civilization, he is refreshed, spiritually, emotionally and mentally.Now, imagine all this as done 160 years ago when technology consisted of things like the newly invented telegraph (which he disdained), railway system, and others. Thoreau, like many of us today, longed to live simply and in harmony with Nature. The inspiration for hundreds of hippies, eco-freaks, Luddites and anti-technologists, he showed us that we sometimes need to get back to simple and clean living with no one and nothing to intrude on our thoughts.And by the time you've finished this little gem of a book, the weekend will be over, and it will be time to go back to the ugly, long commute to a place where technology and stress seemingly go hand in hand."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This book has some great quotes about life. In one sense it seems like a postive thinking book. It suggests we reawaken ourselves. It tells us to live deliberately. He points out that life is frittered away by detail. He tells us to be philosophers rather than professors of philosophy. He points out that most men lead lives of quite desperation.Those are some of the things that I underlined and like to re read. The backdrop to all these great ideas is his time spent in the woods. He did retire from society for a while. He did make a lot of very detailed observations about nature. It felt like being in the woods. The experiences, in some ways, reminded me of my own time in the woods but in many ways they seemed like very different and new experiences.In the end he says he that he left the woods for as good a reason as for which he went there. I was not conviced of that claim. To assume that he he just went to the woods to record the experience and use the time to to offer his complaints about society is just not enough to explain this book. Somehow both approaches complimented each other.The book is well worth reading. After reading the book brings you back to find a quote your thinking about and to better understand the quote."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"The physicality of this edition feels as though Thoreau himself has put it together by hand - from the unusual scrap-book inspired approach to the cover to the reproductions of drawings and notations Thoreau had made in his own copy, it is a complete experience."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I want to know if anyone who has read this book actually liked it. I've talked to a lot of people who like Thoreau. And, after conversing with them further, I discovered that all of them (except for one) were lying. At least a little. They had read excerpts of Walden or individual quotations and thought them to be insightful and thought-provoking. I agree. When taken one sentence at a time, after, of course, carefully screening for only those which inspire deep thought and meditation, Thoreau is just fine.I read most of Civil Disobedience in HS as well as excerpts from Walden and I spent a few years thinking Thoreau was pretty hot stuff (literarily speaking of course...). So, when I found a pretty faux-leather bound copy of Walden and Other Writings at a used bookstore, I grabbed it, and went home so excited to read it, thinking I was going to be so edified. And then, after I started reading it, I realized I was so bored. Thoreau takes 300+ pages to talk about spending 2ish years in the woods, and with the amount he rambled, I'm thinking 100 to 150 pages would have been better. He told stories that related to nothing. In the middle of a chapter about walking around, he's suddenly start spouting off about this dove/dog/man who were all searching for each other and then... and then... and then... nothing. No resolution. He even itemized how much it cost him to build his little home in the woods. (Or rather, how much it should have cost him, because I swear, everything he took with him was donated by someone else...)Anyway, I could have gotten past the fact that Thoreau's life was a little dull, because really- he's spending 2 years in the woods with very little human contact, and no amenities. Don't get me wrong- I love the woods. I'm not gonna lie- I'd totally go live in the middle of the woods if I had the chance, although I'd make sure I took electricity and a flushing toilet with me... So, I could have forgiven that, and probably enjoyed this book a lot more if Thoreau didn't come off as so darn pompous and self-righteous. I'm kind of glad I never had to meet this man, because his writing makes him sound like one of the most condescending men I've ever come across. And, living in the woods for 2 years without the luxury of a doormat and then moving back to your original home does not make you qualified to tell me that my luxuries are the beginnings of my downfall into evil. He doesn't exactly say this, but it's pretty close and I definitely felt like Thoreau was talking/looking down on the rest of us. I might take Thoreau and his preachings about the benefits of an entirely simple life if he had always lived by Walden. But he didn't. He went home after a few years. But, he's still better than all the rest of us who invite evil into our lives. Bully for you Thoreau.I understand that this opinion very possibly makes me sound like an uncultured, uneducated philistine. I mean really, Thoreau is one of the Transcendentalists, right up there with Hawthorne, Whitman, and Emerson. I get that... But, I don't care. I didn't enjoy Walden. It's entirely possible that I was simply in the wrong mood to read this type of literature/philosophy when I gave it a shot, but I don't think so. Because I own the book and doubt I'll be getting rid of it (it's pretty and looks great on my bookshelf) I'll probably give this a try again in a few years, when I'm older and hopefully wiser and all that great stuff. And, if I'm still blogging, I'll be sure and let all of you know about my new opinion, if it changes at all.But I'm confused by all the 5 star ratings on Goodreads. Many more than I would have expected. The 4 and 5 star reviews strongly outweigh the negative reviews. So I wonder... Is there something that I'm missing? Or has the general population bought into the idea that they have to give the book a higher star rating to prove that they did, in fact, get it, as so many of us lesser people seem to not. Perhaps this paragraph doesn't make as much sense as it should... Although I was quite put off by Thoreau himself and his writing, I can see where the basic ideas of economy and simplicity could really resonate with someone. Perhaps, because I was raised to understand that living within my means and avoiding debt and extravagant lifestyles made this book superfluous to me, so I didn't feel it connect with me, but regardless. Whatever the reason I or you come up with, Walden was not for me.So, I'll ask you again. Am I in the majority, or the minority on this one? How did YOU feel about Walden and Thoreau's writing in general?"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"On my short list of all time favorite books, this one is up there at the top. It doesn't attain the #1 spot, but it's up there, definitely top five.I think it is very interesting to read the reviews and notice that the vast majority of the bad reviews are coming from the young, mainly teenagers who were made to read this in school. The vast majority of the good reviews are coming from the older and the more wizened.I think the youth of today are just so totally enamored with technology and what's cool and popular. I know I was when I was 17. But then you grow older and hopefully more wise, you live life a little and you no longer care about what's cool or what's popular, you are no longer so enamored with technology and you begin to see how technology is actually killing us. You have some perspective to temper the youthful idealism.I just loved everything about this book, but I never read it until my 30's. If I had read it in my teens, I probably would have thought it pretty stupid.I think Thoreau was a genius, both with words and how he lived his life. He did not live on Walden Pond his entire life, by the way. Walden pond was an experiment, not so much a way of life. His time there was meant to show people how superfluous most of our lives are, that it can be simplified, to our soul's benefit, not to mention the benefit of our fellow human beings and the world at large.He was not a stupid man, he was educated at Harvard. He knew that his way was not the way everyone could or would live. He was not advocating a new social order. He was merely trying to prove a point, that people's lives are way too complicated.It has been said that Thoreau was the anti-Benjamin Franklin. Realize that even in his day, Thoreau was ridiculed. It is no surprise that he would be ridiculed today, mainly by those who just simply could not live without their iPods.I read Walden as an ideal and it made me sad. I would love to live my life in the way he did on Walden Pond, but I'm just not so sure how possible it is to live that way in today's world or even how desirable. There has to be a happy medium. You don't have to run out and live as a hermit in order to be able to appreciate Thoreau. There is beauty in the middle way, one can learn to make small changes in their lives, to try and live more simply, as many today are trying to do, to lighten our footprint on this earth, for the betterment of all.I do believe that people's lives are too complicated, that they can't see the forest for the trees,that their lives are only about making more money so they can buy more things. They have lost their way in the world, they have forgotten, if they even even knew, what life is about.But running out to live by yourself is not the solution either. I am reminded of the story of Christopher McCandless, whose story was made into the movie Into the Wild. He learned too late that true happiness is not real unless shared. That without love, life is meaningless. And THAT is the reason that living on Walden Pond by yourself is not the answer. We are here on this earth for each other, to love. Without love, life is meaningless.To live on Walden Pond by yourself for a period of time, to find yourself, or to prove a point, is all well and good, but as a permanent way of life, it's not utopia.And Thoreau knew this, after his time in the woods, he went back to civilization, but he never lost his soul and he knew how the soul was refreshed... with love, with learning, and with nature."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Walden is a plea for self reliance and political understanding by a writer eager to get his reader to see that political and personal freedom in a democracy is gained through self knowledge and a recognition of what the individual owes to himself and the political state he finds himself in. Threau warns against the powers of media, money and government to run over the individual. He counsels self-knowledge and civil disobedience. He also writes with clarity and humour and the book is one that re-pays an alert reader with much to think about.

It made me start questing my motives for what activities I was spending my time doing, what kind of clothes I was wearing, and what things I was saying. I think like many teens a lot of my actions had to do with wanting to impress my classmates or to put up an image that I thought would make me popular. Once I read this book I couldn't go through through life without asking \\"why am I doing this?\\" over all of my important decisions. It's liberating to choose what'll make you happy, not what you think will make others like or respect you."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Just a few pages in, Thoreau puts in a few quotes from other authors, all of which are missing!

At best, you have to work at it. The writing although informative, educational, and thought provoking is often complex, unapproachable, and drowned in archaic syntax. While not as easy reading as adult teen fiction, I'm about 1/3 of the way through and so far have been able to follow about 80% of it without needing to go back over anything or bust out my dictionary.The Kindle format itself is great and well adapted. No strange formats, no font oddities.As for the text, it should be pointed out that there is more to Thoreau than \\"simplify, simplify\\". His observations on the motivations and trappings of society are accurate and telling, proven even more by the fact that one hundred and fifty years have passed since its creation and little has changed.An outstanding text for anyone wishing to get more out of life and to distill out the things that are most excellent."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"As other reviewers have noted this version is incomplete and sentences stop in the middle.

I tried using the free version of Walden, but without a linked table of contents, referring to specific chapters and sections of the book was nearly impossible.

Today, his thoughts, opinions, and experiences inform and educate us, enlightening us to a world of possibilities. Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden, and now all of us have a chance to spend time there in this richly illustrated edition.Jeffrey Cramer, Thoreau scholar, has meticulously put together this labor of love for the book, as is shown on each and every page. Writing a short, insightful introduction to this book, and carefully research notes in the margins of the book, add layers of understanding to an already powerful book.I hadn't ever visited Walden prior to this book. As a Walden novice, it served as an excellent introduction to an amazing man and an amazing work. I'm sure that both novices and scholars will benefit from this wonderful literary escape from the world. Yet the escape teaches us more about the world than we might ever know. Thanks to Cramer, and thanks to Henry for crafting this word feast."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I've read a lot of books in my time, but never one this bad. There is literally no plot at all. Any good writer of fiction knows that you need rising action, and then a climax. I kept waiting for the plot to show up, but there was none. If Thoreau had taken my advice he would have gone bear hunting, and chased some Indians with a gun, then maybe find a good woman to settle down with. That would have made for a good read. Or maybe if Thoreau had slimmed this little number down to 35 pages on how to build a house it would have been more useful. Some of these sentences just make no sense. Check out this: &quot;It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people.&quot; Yeah, whatever you say Thoreau. I gave it three stars though because, to his credit, this book is kind of long and it takes a lot of patience to write a book this boring. I give him mad props for that. He just needs a good lesson in suspense."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I was an American literature major in college and had to read lots of classic books. However, I never had to read Walden. So yesterday I decided to start reading it.Well that was a big mistake. I thought it was going to be strictly an autobiography of Thoreau's two years of living on Walden Pond. Right away, it was obvious I had bitten off more than I could chew. The first chapter is called &quot;Economy&quot;. The second chapter, which begins on page 79, appears to be where the autobiography actually starts. I reached page 9 of the book and couldn't take it anymore.I couldn't tell you what I read in those 9 pages. I would read a paragraph and not know what the heck I just read. His language is so confusing, his word choices so peculiar that I literally did not understand what he was saying. I did comprehend it enough to know that he is just babbling about the state of the world and how much he hates this and that. Is this an autobiography or a philosophical and political treatise? I don't know for sure, because I wasn't prepared to wade through all his ranting just to get to the story of living on Walden Pond.American classic? How was that possible?"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Why would any one want to read this book on their own accord? I found it to be the worst book in history. It's nothing more than a bunch of jumbled up statements that say one thing and deny it the next. He just repeated everything and since he couldn't make it in society, he moved to the woods. Is this supposed to show us how we are to live our lives, because if it is, shoot me now. He seemed to hate everyone and live with the animals and the pond. No one really cares what he ate or what he did for fun (if he can call it that), or how he failed in everything. If he wanted to find out who he was, he should've become a buddhist monk or something. I've seen someone else who left society and moved to the woods, and he is locked away for a long time for sending people bombs in the mail."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Do not read this book.

After an embarrassing incident at Starbucks left me red-faced (a cool college student asked about my opinion on transcendentalism), I decided to finally examine the contents in this book, and let me tell you, ignorance really is bliss! Excruciatingly long (I seldom read anything over 20 pages unless there are a lot of pictures) and tremendously boring, I struggled to get past the first few paragraphs. The most notably tedious chapter is entitled \\"The Pond\\":\\"The temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where I sat from five o'clock in the afternoon till noon the next day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to 65x or 70x some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was 42x, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn. The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same day was 45x, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it.\\"'Nuff said.

He was a friend of Emerson's and a Transcendentalist. He saw the beauty of life and how we mortals squander it with too much getting and spending. He was a man who not only stopped to smell the sacred scents of nature, he went on to become imbued with the great truths that permeated the wood and the pond that he loved so dearly. In an idyllic sense, he was a man for all seasons, a man who took on authority and questioned its right to dictate over the life of the individual.This was indeed his great theme, for he said: &quot;I am too high born to be the property of any government.&quot; And he also said, &quot;That government which governs best governs least.&quot; But I doubt the conservatives can claim him as one of their own. For he was among other things a staunch abolitionist, and he was also against America's involvement in the war with Mexico, (the Viet Nam of its day). So what has changed? Not much. Life is still a battle between the individual's rights and needs against societie's injustices and a life of conformity.But even if you never read Walden please think about this quote: &quot;Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man can not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears the beat of a different drummer. Let each man step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.&quot; Now that's something I can sink my teeth into!"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"if I could give this 10 stars I would. can't even say enough about it, so I will leave it at that.

After perusing the first few pages I was certain the accolade was a hoax yet continued out of sheer folly.Being an outdoor enthusiast, I was astonished how Thoreau carefully developed a method of sustaining oneself without the need for civilization. He covers everything from living frugally to divesting oneself of the need of Adam Smith's division of labour. Great for the outdoor survivalist!The simplicity of such a life is matched only by the peace and inner reflection which arises by stripping away the unnecessary concerns which bombard us daily. The fact that his advice is still as applicable today as it was then is a testament to the author's insight.I particularly enjoyed his robust description of nature and her changing seasons. One gets a sense that Thoreau's hermetic life is only superficial and that a deeper intimate relationship exists with nature. He becomes iconoclastic in his musings with nature questioning every aspect of the social norm. Man made laws vs natural laws are repeatedly contrasted hinting at the content of \\"civil disobedience\\".The single greatest lesson learned is the need to follow one's own thoughts and \\"conscience\\"."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"Writings of his prose and observations of a simplified life in the woods near Walden pond New England.

He espouses the benefits of nature as well as the healing properties of simple toil and the benefits of rugged independence. Thoreau's mantra of \\"Simplify, Simplify, Simplify\\" has become pertinent again and again over the years since he wrote this little book. The book is an excellent nature book as well. Thoreau spent hours observing nature, and wrote about it with a simple and beautiful prose. Thoreau spent two years at the pond Walden. This book covers his observations during that time."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I loved to read Walden and it made me think alot about frugality and what I really need.

A must have for the frugal person."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"I congratulate and credit my high school Literature teacher for first englightening me to Thoreau and Walden, and I have enjoyed both regularly ever since. I was disappointed to see the negative reviews, but I was not at all surprised. Thoreau is for the rare individual, as he was a rare individual himself. Few will be able to appreciate his keenness of thought, his breadth of perspective, his striving for some measures of worthy improvement while remaining content. Thoreau has been unserviceably miscategorized by subsequent generations. For example, he is really neither a transcendentalist nor the progenitor of the modern &quot;civil disobedience&quot; tactic (read his essay by the same name, and note that Thoreau himself was jailed and accepted that consequence). Thoreau was first a naturalist and observer and second a philosopher and writer. This should aid you in gauging whether Walden will be an interesting read to you. Thoreau is challenging for idealists, because he strove to experience and practice his ideals and was at liberty to do this (he had no dependents). Finally, Thoreau is an adept writer, and his natural flow of literary devices are satisfying for even the subtlest reader. Walden is one of the crowning works of America's finest literary, intellectual, and philosophical offerings."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"An excellent book that should be read by all. Thoreau outdoes himself in proporly expressing his thoughts and ideas. He uses symbolism and moving language. It is truly a timeless, universal piece and one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"It looks like I rated it 4 stars. I can't seem to change that. I really meant to rate it a 3.Fortunately, I read The Annotated Walden, annotated by Phillip Van Doren Stern. Thank goodness I chose it. Without Mr. Van Doren Stern's introduction, side bars, pictures and comments, I think I would have been thoroughly lost.I have to agree with a few of the reviewers who stated how pompous Thoreau sounds; he does. He tries to act superior,only to have the side bar notations state something different; something that a friend mentioned. For example, he says he \\"could easily do without the post-office,\\" yet a contemporary, Sanborne, is quoted off to the side of the annotated version as having said about this quote: \\"Few residents of Concord frequented the Post Office more punctually or read the newspapers more eagerly than Thoreau.\\"He contradicts himself constantly. He mocks people who don't read, and then says he barely read a few pages of one book in the two years he was at Walden pond. He could be vindictive; lashing out at Flint's Pond (and Mr. Flint) because Flint would not let him build a cabin on his pond. He comes off as a snob, saying most men learn to read only as a necessity; for work, to add up their profits. But *true* readers are hard to come by. \\"I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this Concord soil has produced..\\"Yet, he also has some really great words of wisdom. He questions the wisdom in working so hard during the best part of your life (youth) only to spend the fruits of your labor \\"during the least valuable part of it.\\" Enjoy life while you are young. Why work so hard when the endgame is death? He comments on things that are still true to this day; fashion and our obsession with appearance. Work to provide for yourself, not to overburden yourself and keep yourself in debt.Someone reviewing this book on Amazon wrote that it was a failed experiment; that he meant to live in the woods as a hermit of sorts and failed miserably to do so. That was never the extent of his experiment. He never says he's going to lead a solitary life. He states he visited the village every day or two. \\"As I walked in the woods to see birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see men and boys.\\"I find myself having mixed feelings regarding this book. He is so contradictory, but then, so am I. He can be judgemental and then he can be spot-on. It was a difficult book to get through, Again, had I not had the annotated version, I would have been truly lost. He frustrated me at times. I was not reading literature. I was reading someone's diary that often went off-tangent (like this review). Is it Top 100 book worthy? My opinion: no. It was good at times, painful at others. I took 2 months to trudge through it, all the while reading 5 other books just to keep me going. I am glad I read it. I won't do it again though. Sorry, Mr. Thoroeau"},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"...not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\\"Paragraph one sets the scene: Thoreau says that when he wrote \\"the bulk\\" of the book, he \\"lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor...on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusettes...\\" for a period of \\"two years and two months.\\" In this first chapter, entitled Economy, he talks a lot about how much stuff cost to build and grow, and describes his living conditions. Early on, he shares his philosophy on what it is (p 12) \\"[t]o be a philosopher.\\" It is \\"...to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.\\"Although I'm glad that I can now check the \\"I read Walden,\\" box, doing so involved more drudgery than delight. For one thing, Thoreau seems to ramble a lot. For another, he's a paradoxical guy. He disdainfully emphasizes a lack of intelligence in others, as when he refers to some of his visitors as (p 142) \\"half-witted men,\\" and one specifically as \\"an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper;\\" seemingly rudely directs those stopping by his place for a cup of water to the pond, \\"I told them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to lend them a dipper;\\" claims of certain unfortunates he offered assistance that they (p 67) \\"preferred to remain poor;\\" and admits that charity isn't his thing, (p 67) \\"As for Doing-good...I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution;\\" but later philosophizes, (p 205) \\"Goodness is the only investment that never fails.\\" He repeatedly uses the racist term (p 27, etc.) \\"savages\\" to refer to Native Americans, yet states that he aided a runaway slave (p 144) \\"I helped to forward toward the north star.\\" He seems sort of straight-laced, but also funny, as when he mocks the men that built the Pyramids (p 53) \\"there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs.\\" And even his logic can be illogical, as in his support of the statement (p 48) \\"the swiftest traveler is he that goes afoot.\\" The example is that traveling 30 miles is better done on foot due to the hassle and cost (\\"almost a day's wages\\") of taking the train. By my calculation, at three miles an hour, a 30-mile journey would take 10 hours, more for a man like Thoreau who was afflicted with tuberculosis.Although Thoreau's story contains noteworthy quotes throughout, the last chapter is filled with pearls, like this inspiring (and quite famous) one, (p 303) \\"...if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours,\\" which proves to be an enjoyable end to an uneasy read. It was only afterwards, during my book club's discussion session, that I first heard Thoreau's self-proclaimed life of solitude was not as solitary as one might think. This led me to pick up (but only skim) The Thoreau You Don't Know by Robert Sullivan, a good choice for those that feel compelled to learn more about the supposed recluse. Worst of the book was annotator Bill McKibben's occasional opinion-laced footnote, including the one on page 252, in which he feels compelled to share that Louisa May Alcott's father was a \\"fruitcake.\\" My advice, skip this version in favor of any other. Those that enjoyed Walden may also like: The Thoreau You Don't Know by Robert Sullivan, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard, and Gilead by Marilynne Robinson."},{"Title":"Walden : or, Life in the woods","review":"This is a book that you could open on any page and find something interesting to read.

(Crown Business. 2004)By George FulmoreThe subtitle of this book reads, \\"strategies for retiring rich in a totally changed world.\\" Maybe I've been at this personal finance stuff for too long, but for me that subtitle means that I'm about to learn something new. In reading \\"We're Not in Kansas Anymore\\" I did not find that to be true.To me, what this book is saying is that the old world of retirement pensions is gone and cannot be depended upon. Many of us have known that for decades. In my case, the defined benefit program where I worked was converted to a defined contribution (401K) program by the mid-80's. This is not big news. And this would seem to be one of the many books now coming out that warn Baby Boomers that they need to take this savings stuff serious or else. Again, I'm not sure that this is new stuff. (And I'm not sure that all those state, federal and county government workers need to be sweating out any of this. Their pensions will hopefully be there for them.)The bulk of the book talks about standard personal financial stuff that has been printed for decades elsewhere and that you can find in endless current books: start early, think long-term, max out deferred options, don't think it's too late, don't be too conservative or too risky, live within your means, review your overall plan at least once a year, yada yada yada. This takes us to page 244 of this 277-page book.Sure, if one follows all this, he or she or they build up a nest egg that will prove its worth in retirement. And that will be wonderful. But if we don't do all this, then we will be in the soup, unless we somehow catch up in time. What the author does not spend much time with are the real world reasons why these things do not work out. That's not his concern. And, of course, he never really defines how much is enough. Nobody knows all the variables of the future, so nobody really knows the answer to that one.The final 33 pages are why I bought the book, but they do not contain enough insight or information for me to urge others to do so. He talks of a \\"longevity risk,\\" which is all that stuff about running out of money because one lives too long, but he also says, \\"there's no way to know in advance exactly what mix of stocks and bonds will make your portfolio last the longest or how you can set a withdrawal rate just high enough to give you the most income without your nest egg expiring before you do.\\" Thanks a lot, buddy. That's a big help!There are about 14 pages on annuity strategies, which I was hoping would be the bulk of the book, as I think converting illiquid assets into income over time is the name of the game in retirement. And he is generally talking about that in this brief section. (No mention of charitable trusts annuities, which I generally prefer.) The final pages urge the retiree reader to make periodic reality checks on how things are going, mixed with advice about how not to get too caught up in all this finances stuff in the first place: \\"don't let the planning get in the way of living a happy and fulfilled life.\\" You get only one retirement. Enjoy it while you can.\\"I you are looking for a good book on personal finances leading to a sufficient retirement nest egg, I guess this is as good as any; although, I'd think you could save yourself some money by going to a used bookstore to pick up one of the many books on this subject that have been around for years. If you are looking for a book that deals primarily in retirement financial strategies in today's world, I'd keep looking. This book is not it, in my opinion, and my guess is that there will many, many more to follow in the next"},{"Title":"We're Not In Kansas Anymore : Strategies for Retiring Rich in a Totally Changed World","review":"Updegrave succeeds in capturing the essence of the Baby Boomer's retirement dilemma--they are responsible for their own economic viability as ERISA legislation has largely shifted the burden of support from employers to employees. The challenge now is how to capitalize on the various tax-deferred and individual retirement plan allocations that will establish a safe and effervescent income stream. \\"We're Not In Kansas Anymore\\" does a good job of laying the framework for readers hoping to understand the big picture of the retirement of their futures. Additional work on actual strategies and implementation would have been helpful, especially for individuals who have fallen behind in establishing their nest eggs. (See perhaps \\"Rich Dad's Prophecy\\", \\"The Intelligent Asset Allocator\\", or even \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\" for further reading.) With that said, Updegrave's writing makes it quite clear there is no financial panacea. I found his focus on leading a life of value and substance refreshing, all too often material wealth is glorified over the simple, free experiences of life--Scarecrow's brain, Tin Man's heart, and Lion's courage I dare say are all priceless."},{"Title":"Sorceress: The Mike Hoffman Sketchbook (Volume 1)","review":"The illustrations in the book are really nice. I have both Volume one and two of Sorceress and they are both very good.The reproduction values are really good to reproduce what looks to me like pencil illustrator though they may be lite ink wash ether way reproducing this type of illustration and keeping the detail without making it blotchy to get all the details it difficult and the publisher did an excellent job."},{"Title":"Sorceress: The Mike Hoffman Sketchbook (Volume 1)","review":"I have just a couple of quick notes to add to the criticisms below. Under no circumstances buy the work of Hoffman unless you are fully equipped with the work of Frank Frazetta. The price differential between this collection of mostly black and white pencil studies and the stunning pen and ink, watercolor, and oil work of Frazetta is insignificant compared to the vastness of the talent differential!Hoffman captures Frazetta's anatomy (including the occasional mistakes!) without capturing the spirit of the work - but it's more than that. Frazetta himself was influenced by other artists, including Al Capp. Some of Frazetta's equipment and vehicles have a silver-age corniness to them. Hoffman's weapons, terrain, even monsters! - are cheesy fill-ins - just enough to act as props for his bare-naked ladies.After seeing Frazetta, I found it hard to accept even 'imitators' like Jeff Jones, Boris Vallejo, Barry Winsor-Smith et al. However those artists may have started with Frazetta - but they found their own way forward. Once you've exhausted their work, and classic illustrators like Allen St John, Virgil Finlay, and Joseph Clement Coll, try Hoffman - for contrast!"},{"Title":"Sorceress: The Mike Hoffman Sketchbook (Volume 1)","review":"Hoffman's work is just a pale imitation of Frazetta's talent. Being myself an artist I cannot understand why people that is already established in the art field keep trying to copy somebody else's work. It is probably fine when you star your career but after a while the logical path is to follow your own style. As an artist doesn't he fell ashamed? I certainly would. I recommend you to get a Frazetta's books first."},{"Title":"Sorceress: The Mike Hoffman Sketchbook (Volume 1)","review":"Hoffman's figure drawings are full of beautiful curves and soft muscles in a fantasy setting. This sketch book of drawings is especially good for the artist who wants to learn to draw women. This is not a how to book, but is a good book to study the female form. This book is a good supplement to Dynamic Figure Drawing. The drawings in Dynamic Figure Drawing are mainly of men and the women take on a masculine quality because of the emphasis on muscles. Hoffman does the same with his drawings, but with a different result, he uses just the right lines to emphasis the characteristics of a healthy formed female."},{"Title":"Sorceress: The Mike Hoffman Sketchbook (Volume 1)","review":"I bought this book realizing that Mr. Hoffman was imitating Frank Frazetta. Such imitation is not a bad thing in and of itself; some fine illustrators began their careers by putting their personal spin on Frazetta. Jeff Jones to name one. Mr. Hoffman has no personal spin; he's just a copyist. Again, not necassarily a bad thing if the imitator has sufficient talent to bring it off. Hoffman doesn't possess such talent. To call these drawings derivative ennobles them because they are blatant, pale simulacra of Frazetta. I compared Hoffman's drawings to those in \\"Illustrations Arcanum\\" a book of Frazetta's drawings and here's how Hoffman stands up: Mr. Frazetta's drawings of buxom women, brawny men, battle scenes and monstrous creatures are sure handed, confident, dynamic and well rendered; Hoffman's drawings of similar subjects are anemic, hesitant, dull and mediocre. Where Frazetta's line work is vigorous and varied, Hoffman's is limp and monotonous; where Frazetta employs a large range of values and punches the darks effectively in his modeling to give a high contrast effect, Hoffman's value range is limited and lacks any darks and possesses negligible contrast; Frazetta's figures look as if they've been caught in movement, Hoffman's figures are stiff as mannequins; finally, Frazetta's depictions of women exude sensuality, Hoffman's women are, at best, timid and completely devoid of any erotic appeal. Hoffman may be well schooled in Frazetta's subject, but he sadly misses the master's skill and spirit. An illustrator at the beginning of his career might be forgiven for this, but Hoffman has been working in the this field for a long time. He's not a second rate Frazetta, he's tenth rate joke. His biographical sketch boasts that he has many commissions for his work, proving H. L. Mencken's dictum that no one ever went broke underestimating the intellegence (or taste) of the American public. Purchasing this book makes me wonder if I'm not as smart as I thought. Don't repeat my mistake by buying this book.

Evanovich's first novel is one of the best 1st novels i've read. Her main character which has spawned nine sequels (the newest being\\"Ten Big Ones\\") is Stephanie Plum. Stephanie is a now unemployed discount lingerie buyer.She needs a job and quick so she blackmails her cousin Vinnie and gets a job at his bail-bond business as a bounty hunter. Her first target is Joe Morrelli,a cop who allegedly killed an unarmed man. But for Stephanie tracking down Morelli is personal due to the fact that Morrelli stole Stephanies virginity when she was sixteen. Along the way of tracking him down a sub-plot begins involving a boxer namedBenito Ramirez who begins threatening Stephanie. This synopsis that I just wrote sounds like any other detective novel but this one is different. It's funny,but not too funny. Evanovich writes the character to make her sound sexy however...Not to sexy. This is where Evanovich succeeds. James Patterson writes a series involving the \\"Womens Murder Club\\". When he's talking about his main character he makes her sound like a lingerie model. Evanovich writes Stephanie like your every day typical women.Any mystery fan needs to read this book.An absolute must.A."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Wow - I've never read a mystery where I have so much in common with the main character. Stephanie Plum is one hell of a character, who is your ordinary everyday 30 something woman become bounty hunter. Evanovich makes the book fast paced and easy to get into. I was recommended into this series and now I'm thrilled that I took the recommendation. I spent two days reading the first three books of the series! This was my favorite of the first three as Stephanie's chemistry with Joe Morelli is fantastic! I've never heard of a bounty hunter \\"catching\\" her prey so many times only to let him go. Definite pick up - check it out!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading this book it is easy to see why it was the catalyst for nine more books in the series so far. One for the Money introduces Stephanie Plum, the fiery and immediately likeable protagonist of this series. Evanovich started her writing with bad luck. Her first story, about the pornographic adventures of a fairy who lived in a second rate fairy forest in Pennsylvania, was rejected and set the standard of not being accepted for many years. She notes that when she got a whole box full of rejections she burnt them and changed her career. From the naughty fairy, fans will note her continued use of quirky characters throughout the Stephanie Plum series.Since receiving her first payment of $2000 for her first book she has become immensely popular worldwide. She originally wrote in the romance genre under the penname of Steffie Hall, publishing Manhunt, Rocky Road to Romance and Naughty Neighbor. This background in romance pervades her work in One for the Money.As is appropriate and necessary in the first in the series, this book is largely taken up with introducing and fill in out the personalities of the characters who are going to become staples over the rest of the series. Besides getting to know Stephanie herself, including her taste in clothes and junk food, we meet her mother and father, her irrepressible Grandma Mazur, her slimy cousin Vinnie and her two competing love interests - Joe Morelli and Ranger.The sexual tension between Plum and these two love interests is parallelled by the competitive tension between the two men. They are also portrayed as very different types of heroes. These dashing heroes echo the romance genre's use of passionate and enigmatic male figures. Although Evanovich has broken the mould of the detective or crime fiction by making her protagonist an ordinary woman, the romance genre antecedents are clear as Plum still need a man to save her.Plum herself is portrayed as a strong, modern woman. She is far from a weak character. Although she gets off to a slow start, she eventually masters the use of a gun and high speed car chases. Must a woman be able to take on typically male traits to be a successful detective? The genre is hybridised to create a romantic, comedic, thrilling detective novel. Perhaps this new mixed genre will have to mature before significant changes to established and accepted patterns will be permitted.Although Evanovich does deal with some social issues, for example she often comments on the low socio-economic stasis of the suburb of Trenton, One for the Money is largely light hearted and fun. \\"Fun\\" books are often underestimated by literature critics. This is just that sort of book, not much more, but certainly nothing less."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Introducing Stephanie Plum. After losing her job in the lingerie industry, Stephanie approaches cousin Vinnie to take on a small filing job within his Bail Bonding company . One thing leads to another and before you know it she is out on the rough streets of New Jersey struggling to catch the villanous Joseph Morelli. Joseph is up for murder, and having skipped his court hearing the bounty for his capture is high. With no phone, car, and a gradually decreasing list of possessions in a cruddy apartment - Stephanie needs the money, and will do whatever it takes to bring Morelli in.One for the Money is a hilariously written introduction to the new life of Stephanie Plum, Bounty Hunter. While Stephanie is new to the world of weapons and crime, she not only learns to dodge bullets - but questions from her overprotective family about her new career. Juicy in descriptive details - it's hard not to like Stephanie. A character so naive and real that the smallest detail of her absurd life is not to be missed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first book in the Stephanie Plum series is an all-around fantastic read, and it left me craving much more of Stephanie Plum. It is darn near impossible to read this book and not have a great time. The pages just kept turning as the characters were very real, and enjoyable! I found the book a light and quick read. It was witty, hilarious, angering, and just plain old fun to read. The characters are well defined and believable. This was my first Plum book but not my last."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading some of the worst reviews, I am strictly appalled at the seriousness that these reviewers must have had when reading this. So, to clear up any confusion, let me spell this out, THIS BOOK IS PURELY FOR FUN AND IS FICTIONAL. I am a 17-year old male who started to read the series after my mother could not stop laughing once the book was in her hands. I soon joined her in the laughing fits. Evanovich has got a good idea, and she runs with it.&quot;One...&quot; is the beginning of a series that involves Stephanie Plum, a lingerie buyer who was laid off from her job, struggling to make payments for her New Jersey Apartment. She becomes desperate and goes to Vinnie, a relative of hers who runs a small Bail Bond business. After blackmailing Vinnie to tell his wife about an alleged sexual relationship with a duck, she is hired as a bounty hunter to go after Joseph Morelli, who Failed To Appear to court. Morelli brings back memories of a game in the back of a pastry shop called \\"train.\\" (Ladies and gentlemen, let your mind wander.)Through the book, memorable characters are made, most will stay for the next 10 books. Between Lula, a prostitute with Queen Latifah looks and attitude, Connie, Vinnie's filing clerk who would remind you of the mother from \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\\" exploding cars, a grandmother who would remind you of Sophia from \\"The Golden Girls,\\" and Ranger, the more experienced Bounty hunter with a body like the Rock, Antonio Banderas looks, and more butt-kicking than the two actors combined, this is certainly a book to buy."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"ONE FOR THE MONEY by Janet EvanovichONE FOR THE MONEY is the first in the popular series by Janet Evanovich, featuring Stephanie Plum, \\"bounty hunter\\". In this first installment, we meet Stephanie who is currently out of a job and is desperately fighting poverty. She's sold most of her appliances and furniture to bring in a few dollars here and there, but she knows that sooner or later she needs to get a job, fast. When her car is repossessed, that is the last straw.Her mother informs her that cousin Vinnie has an opening in his office, so when Stephanie pays him a visit, she also finds out that she could bring in some big time cash if she worked for him in a different capacity. Her old \\"friend\\" Joe Morelli is on the run and wanted for murder. The challenge was calling out to her and because of some childhood memories she had of Morelli, bringing him in was even more enticing. Stephanie knew that he was her answer to a new life and $10,000. But first she had to learn the art of being a bounty hunter.I found this book funny and very light-hearted, despite some heavy themes that were running through the book. An aggressive boxer who craved violence helped give the book its atmosphere of suspense and fear. But on the other hand, her attempts at making it as a bounty hunter helped lend a humorous feel to the book. I am giving this book a thumbs up, as it's very entertaining and did not pretend to be more than what it was: a very humorous look at world of crime."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great twists and great humor in this book. After reading two other Plum books, it was fun to see how it all began for Stephanie. I sort of see Steph as a female version of Charlie Brown. She's always screwing up (which is half the fun of these novels), but refuses to give up in her endeavours. Excellent pace to the story with lots of weird things happening to poor Stephanie, from being handcuffed to a shower rod to being stalked by a psycho serial rapist boxer. I also loved the weird relationship she establishes with Joe Morelli, helping him while at the same time trying to collect on his bounty. Just read it and see. There were also some pretty entertaining scenes with Steph's wacko family. Her gold medal-class worrier of a mother, her father who just goes through life shaking his head in disbelief at his family, and my favorite, Grandma Mazur, who simply refuses to act her age. Take it from a native of the Trenton area, you'll dig this book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is still my absolute favorite of all the books in the Plum series. It got me hooked, I can't remember another book before this that had me laughing out loud. I remember my friends enthusiastically discussing it, and I rolled my eyes. &quot;Yeah right,&quot; I though, &quot;books can be funny, sure, but make you actually laugh so that people in the library turn around to give you dirty looks? Please.&quot; But I tried it anyway... and stayed up until 3 am to finish it. I even named my gerbil (not hamster, they bite in real life) Rex. Stephanie is the sort of smart, sassy heroine that every woman can enjoy reading about -- she may want a man in her life, but she doesn't need one, and it's Stephanie that solves the mystery, not some knight in shining armor! This is a wonderfu l start to a great series, and I even used it to get more of my friends hooked. In summary... read this book! You'll laugh too."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have just started reading Janet Evanovich's series - Stephanie Plum. Loved this book. It is a great read, funny, couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich is without a doubt a master of her craft. This is another fun, hot sizzling read that is packed with just the right amount of action, suspense and a bit of romantic intrigue. And by the way, the book is so much better than the movie!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I just may be the last person on the planet to read this book. I have had this series recommended to me by so many different readers. I bought a used and abused copy of it a long time ago and pulled it out. I heard it was a laugh out loud read and I was ready for a good laugh. This book delivered in the laugh department. Stephanie Plum is hilarious. She gets herself into some of the funniest situations. I like her spunk!Like any crime story, there is violence and some explicit scenes. Stephanie is a bounty hunter after all and criminals on the lamb don't exactly want to be taken in.The ending was nicely wrapped up but not too tightly as we know the series does go on. I hope to be able to read some more of the series and look forward to seeing the movie at some point.If you are looking for a fun crime novel, this might be the book for you! Thank you to all those bloggers and friends who recommended this series to me."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book kept coming up as a recommendation for me, both from goodreads and Amazon. It is a lot more girlie than my typical style, but I decided to give it a shot. To my delight, it was witty and suspenseful, making for a very enjoyable read.The books focuses on hopelessly unemployed heroine, Stephanie Plum, who talks her cousin into letting her try her hand at being bounty hunter so she can make ends meet. The plot unfolds with her comical attempts at learning to bring in fugitives as she gets more and more embroiled in a deadly mystery.I liked that Stephanie was not your typical, polished detective. This added to the humor and made her struggles endearing. I also liked the fact that while there were overtones of chemistry between Stephanie and another character, we were not force fed a romance."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you haven't read any of the Stephanie Plum Series by Janet Evanovich, then you'd better start now. \\"One for the Money\\" is a fast paced, enjoyable novel. The main character, Stephanie Plum, is so believable for her age and especially for the area of New Jersey in which she grew up and still lives. Plum is a thirty something woman who lost her job as a lingerie buyer, pawned most of her possessions, and just had her car reposed. You can feel her frustrations over her situation and her family. After doing some short term temp work, Plum ends up working for her seamy cousin Vinnie of Vinnie's Bail Bonds. How hard can it be to bring in a fugitive, bail skipping felon, she thinks to herself. And that is where the \\"fun\\" begins. Written with a humorous style, which often makes you laugh out loud. Evanovich paints a believable picture of this young woman's life and draws the reader into the her personal world and frustrations. I read where one person complained about what Plum wore: spandex shorts. They added: \\"I see it was wrote in 1994, still...that was past the 80's...no excuses\\". However, \\"spandex shorts\\" is so realistic of then and still is today; just watch the nauseous popular show on current TV: \\"Jersey Shores\\"! They also complained about her language, as boinking -- this again is attention to detail for the local color of that area of Jersey. This is a fun book which creates a very believable character who encounters some, arguably, unrealistic situations in such a short period of time. Never-the-less, what a enjoyable read, and I am going to read Plum's second book \\"Two for the Dough\\" in the near future."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had been wondering about the Stephanie Plum series and finally got the recommendation needed to give it a try. She is an unlikely bounty hunter, but the desperation for money drove her into the dangereous profession. The latter part of the book brought the suspense and unexpected - just enough to get me to buy the next book. I was hoping for a little intimacy at the end - we will see what the next books bring."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"It was my neighbor who got me hooked on this author. I thanked her..I have all the books. I never laugh so much in each any everyone of her books....love morelli,ranger and grandma mazur, she has some great lines. I can not wait for the movie to come out next year. The trailers are great. I wonder if anyone likes the cast or not? I was not sure but the more and more I saw the trailer...it fits. Some people wanted Sandra Bullock to play Stephanie. I know a guy that actuaLLy has read these books. I was shocked but to each his own. I think that Stephanie should end up with Morelli, not that Ranger is not hot and a bad boy. You have to love Lula, she has some great lines....Her and Stephanie make a great team. I just finished 17 and waiting Explosive 18 which I have pre-ordered. All the views who wrote good things are spot on. Those who did not like it well I quess you don't have a sense of humor."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich was recommended to me by my aunt. Also the librarian couldn't say enough good things about the books. And a complete stranger saw me reading this at the beach and told me she loves this series and they are hilarious.I enjoyed this book and have read #1 - 3 in less than a week. It is a light read but the mysteries are well thought out and the characters are each unique and hilarious.Stephanie Plum is still learning from her mistakes - takes her 3 or 4 times! But honestly, I would be bumbling around myself if I decided to become a bounty hunter tomorrow with no training. She underestimates the FTAs she has to apprehend and gets herself into harrowing situations. Usually Morelli or Ranger come to her aid in time. I like these 2 characters too.I want to comment on some reviews where there was criticism about violence against women, it was the criminals behaving this way, and the author is not praising this behavior it's part of the criminal personality - there is a sick criminal who terrorizes some women. There are some hookers who get beat on. But one of the hookers, Lula, ends up straightening out her life and you read about her in subsequent books. There was also criticism for how Stephanie handled a phone call where she could hear a woman being terrorized. She recorded the call to get the voice of the guy and then she called the police and gave them the tape. Another criticism - how she pulled Lula through her window - well, Lula was beaten up and tied to her fire escape which was outside Stephanie's bedroom window which is a second floor apartment. I didn't expect her to go outside and climb up to get to Lula. Also, she had gotten to know Lula personally and seeing her beat up and unconscious she reacted by dragging her inside before calling the police. Much the same way most people would react when seeing a friend in that same situation."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum, a thirty year old woman who's down on her luck. When her mother suggests that she turn to her cousin Vinnie for a job, she gets a lot more than she bargained for! Thrown into a more dangerous side of New Jersey, Stephanie attempts to catch a murderer for 10,000 dollars. Until she realizes that he isn't the worst of her problems. The next thing Stephanie knows, she and this criminal are working together to prove his innocence....'One for the Money' was definitely a great book! Stephanie is a funny and very realistic character, as though she could come alive and knock right on your door! The book was well written aside from the minor grammar mistake here and there. The plot was somewhat overused - mostly just proving the innocence of a supposed criminal - but the ending really brings it up to a great conclusion! I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich is on her fifteenth book in this series, with the first five being the best \\"ride\\" of the group. Book number one introduces us to ditsy but insightful bonds woman Stephanie Plum, whom does everything she can to catch her bond jumper, all of it unconventional!Plum is an ex-lingerie buyer, who finds herself on the brink of financial collapse and in desperation, turns to her barely-ethical cousin to give her a job. Once the job begins, she has found her calling. We are in for a comedic, romantic turn, thinly disguised as a mystery. There is just enough, \\"who-dunit,\\" for excitement, coupled with the protagonist's near escape(s) from blunders of her own making.A fast read that is all in fun, with witty dialog and interesting characterization throughout for spice.

Can't wait to read the next one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The book was great. At times it took a little time to get into the book. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Very addicting. Mystery, suspense and a sense of humor. Had a good ending. The beginning may have been a touch slow but didn't take long to get moving."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm probably the last person alive who hasn't read the Stephanie Plum novels yet. However, this won't deter me from gushing about it and adding my voice to the millions who are absolutely gaga about this series. If I could rate this book a hundred stars instead of merely five, I'd do it with a smile. It had absolutely everything I love to read about in books to make it what I consider the ultimate read. I enjoyed the movie, but of course, I enjoyed the book far more.So with no further ado, here are my top ten reasons why you should get this book and move it to the number one spot on your to-read list. Here goes:10. It had a shocking twist at the ending which is nearly impossible to predict.9. The story ends on a high note that leaves you smiling and desperately wanting to read the other eighteen books in this fabulous series.8. It is loaded with nerve-wracking, nail-biting action and suspense, and even has a scene with a car exploding.7. Stephanie Plum is a lifelike character with flaws and a fantastic personality. You know when bad things happen to good people? Yep, happens to her in spadefuls, but she takes it in her stride and you can't help but root for her all the way. She's so incredibly likeable and real, and she refuses to stay down. Showing courage in the face of danger and having an awesome sense of humor, are only two of her best qualities.6. Then there's Joe Morelli - the supposed \\"bad guy\\"...and oh boy, he is tantalizingly delicious! To top it all he's got a wicked smart mouth on him that causes you to want to slap him upside the head as soon as the butterflies in your tummy has settled down and you finally manage to get your breathing under control again.5. Stephanie's family is a laugh a minute - especially her grandmother. She alone is worth getting this book for all the laughs you'll get from her character. Trust me, she's a treat! There's a scene with grandma, a roast chicken and a stray bullet at the dinner table...I couldn't stop laughing!4. Although Stephanie and Joe weren't written as the two main characters who inevitably fall in love somewhere in the first few chapters of the book (as most books go), they have a sizzling love-hate attraction to each other - which, for me, made their run-ins so much more interesting and enjoyable. In lieu of the absence of romance, the chemistry between them was continually crackling with electricity. All the scenes in which they interacted, I constantly wished for them to fall into each other's arms - which is so unlike me as I really don't care much for romance in books. They're such an unlikely pair although their personalities complement each other to make them work well together. I love that the author didn't match them up as a couple, and instead shaped these two characters in such a way that the reader begs for them to end up together.3. There's no love triangle - hooray! In fact, there wasn't even a smidgen of romance I had to suffer through. The author cleverly lured me into wanting them to be a couple by making me feel the sexual tension between these two exceptional characters, but not in an explicit way.2. Have I mentioned Joe Morelli is to die for? He sure as heck is the ultimate bad boy us girls all fantasize about. Seriously, other than Eric Northman from the Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris, I've never lusted after a character as much as I did this one.1. My number one reason I'm begging you to read this book (in the unlikely event I'm not the only person who hasn't discovered this magnificent series yet) is because there's a multitude of reasons, which I can't mention here without giving any spoilers, you'll love this book. If you want a book with a story that gets your adrenaline pumping, get butterflies doing crazy loops in your tummy, and at the same time make you laugh until you have tears streaming down your face, then this is the perfect read for you. This book has everything. OK, maybe not everything per se, because romance fans might feel slightly disappointed, but I'm not a romance fan so I thoroughly enjoyed this book. In all honesty, I was relieved to finally come across a book which can stand all on its own without the dreaded love-triangle and angst-ridden instant-love rubbish that seems to be the foundation of so many books today. Janet Evanovich clearly knows how to engage the reader with her relaxed but fun and sassy writing style, and has proven you don't need your two main characters to fall irrevocably in love to have a phenomenal story. I'm definitely going to read all the books in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the second time reading this book. I missed some things the first time.

Well written and funny."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Well I was looking for a good series to read and someone suggested this one. I have seen the movie so it made it a good read because it was easier for me to picture the characters which is why this isn't a 5 star in mind opition if it hadn't been for the movie I would have had a hard time grasping them."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was about nine when her first book came out so I can see how the younger generation writes the books off as for older people, but they're not. I mean yeah, certain things they say can be dated, but that's cool in its own way. I mean I picture Stephanie with one of those huge cell phones and an outfit from Flashdance. Okay I exaggerate just a bit, I think the books came out early 90's so maybe not the outfit, but the phone yes.So Stephanie Plum used to be a lingerie buyer, but is now unemployed. Her fridge is empty, her car gets repossessed and she needs to live. Desperate she asks her cousin Vinnie for a job as a bounty hunter. As it turns out her first assignment is to hunt down her ex Joe Morelli, a former cop who is in deep trouble for killing a man. Of course the situation is more complicated than we think. So not only is she looking for her punk ex, she is solving a mystery as well.You know, when I first got into the book I thought it was pure fluff, but one scene early on really scared me, and puts you in the same mindset of Stephanie. She really doesn't know what she's getting herself into in the beginning and she kind of flounders along. Her family is hilarious, and her Grandma Mazur is just crazy funny.I mean it's kind of like Dog the Bounty Hunter meets the Jersey Shore. Pfft. Okay, okay, it at least takes place on the Jersey Shore and the accent is fun to imagine.Overall it was a fun book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you're reading/or listening to this series, it is great to hear/read the 1st book to capture the main caricatures starting points.

I decided to listen to this whole series on audiobook. I think I took away one star because the audiobook experience ruined it a little for me. The reader, CJ Critt was good, but spoke so properly that she seemed older and nerdier than the New Jersey character of Stephanie. I enjoyed the story, but found the repeated mention of \\"the burg\\" annoying, and found that some descriptions were just too detailed and didn't help the storyline. Again, that may be because I was listening and not reading, and found myself distracted during many parts where I might not have if I were actually reading it.That being said, I will continue to listen to the series on audiobook, while I read other series in the more traditional way (well not too traditional, I read all my books on my iPhone). I would switch to reading but at this point, the reader's voice is already in my head as Stephanie, so it would be much harder for me to enjoy like I would if I imagined the voice in my head.I enjoyed the story, thought it was cute and funny, and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens between her and Morelli."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is amazing ive read every book in the series and i still cant wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"With the movie just weeks away - I decided to purchase & read this book. So very glad that I did! It started out a bit slow, but all in good character development I would say. I had so many laugh out loud moments that my family was starting to question whether I was delirious or what? Not trying to be a spoiler -but I'm already anxious to see who plays Grandma Mazur -she's a hoot! The off/on sexual tension/hate between Stephanie & Joe is enough to keep the pages turning quickly. Just wish that I'd read these years ago when friends were chattering about them then. Well, I'm off to buy & read the next book on my kindle and suspect it won't end there for me with Stephanie Plum -I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you haven't read the Stephanie Plum Series by Janet Evanovich then you'd better start now. In my book there isn't a better, funnier, series out there. Start with \\"One for the Money\\" and dig in. I guarantee you'll enjoy the experience. Now I can't wait to see the movie, starring Katherine Heigl, which comes out on January 27th. Janet Evanovich is one of the \\"Best of the Best!\\""},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is quite a character! Janet Evanovich has done a great job showing us Stephanie's crazy world in a believable way. It's easy to cheer for her as she struggles to catch bad guys and dodge sexy men.This book got me hooked on the series and I powered through the next eleven (I stopped at twelve) - just see what Stepahnie was going to do next."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I know this is a popular series, this is one of the reasons I wanted to read it. I wanted to know what the fuss was about and try and understand why there are now 18 of these books.Stephanie Plum is desperate for a job, just desperate for money in general. To make ends meet, she starts working for her cousin's bail bonding place as a bounty hunter. In this novel she tries to bring in a guy who is wanted for murder, Joseph Morelli, who is also a cop and an old romantic interest from her past. Hilarity ensues when she realises she has to physically apprehend these criminals and doing it with her mere female hands will not do the trick. She enlists the help of a guy named Ranger, buys a gun and some spiffy spray which knocks out its target cold and also steals Morelli's car in an effort to lure him out and get him. As if catching Morelli isn't hard enough, she's also got to be careful of a psycho female bashing boxer named Ramirez.I really enjoyed One For The Money. I thought it would end up being more of a chick lit but it was a real thriller in the end and I really wanted to keep reading to make sure Stephanie kicked some serious arse. I liked how Evanovich made Stephanie Plum into this woman who was trying so hard to make it on her own and she wasn't a damsel in distress, even when she's being terrorised by this Ramirez character, she's not all \\"why me?\\" or doesn't go cowering in the shower. Yes, she locks the doors and windows like a responsible young lady and she takes all of the help she can get, but she doesn't give up. Even when her eyebrows are burnt off by a car explosion. That would be enough for me to call it a day.I also reviewed this book on my youtube channel [...]"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started this book over the weekend and finished it in 3 days. It was quick moving and kept my attention throughout the book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is this thirty something woman who lost her job as a lingerie buyer and after doing some short term temp work ends up working for her seamy cousin Vinnie of Vinnie's Bail Bonds. How hard can it be to bring in a fugitive, bail skipping felon who happens to be Joe Morelli, a cop and a person who has a past with Stephanie? Joe has been charged with murder but as always there's more to the story and this starts to get complicated. We're also introduced to Stephanie's parents, a no nonsense retired part time cab driver and the mom who is a happy homemaker who would like to extend the umbilical cord all the way to Stephanie's apartment. Mom's also a great cook who specializes in comfort food like pot roast which prevents Stephanie from starving. Then there is Grandma Mazur who is something else! Grandma envisions herself about forty years younger than she actually is and even tries out spandex shorts and uses Stephanie's gun on the roast chicken. We meet Ranger who is also a bail bondsmen with a past who teaches Stephanie the trade. While Stephanie is in hot pursuit of Morelli and tries to find out more about his case including two more suspected deaths, she meets Lula, an African American woman prostitute with an attitude who provides some insight into other bad guys. There are a lot of car problems involving the reposession of Stephanie's Miata, buying a clunker that needs cases of oil, stealing Morelli's Cherokee, a vehicle getting blown up, getting beaten up, diving into dumpsters and it goes on and on. Stephanie is a New Jersey gal who has grown up in a blue collar neighborhood where everybody knows everybody. She's also a woman who doesn't let obstacles stand in her way and will do almost anything to survive and still maintain her integrity and sense of justice. After all $10,000 is a lot of money and she'll do what it takes to get her man. Janet Evanovich's description of the Trenton \\"burg\\" is just spot on--you can just picture the landscape of duplex houses and neighborhoods that have seen better days and the local spots like Pinos Pizza. The characters are mostly funny except for the bad guys. Stephanie's character also has a soft feminine and even sexy side. She also has a place in her heart for a small pet, namely her hamster, Rex. If Rex isn't included in the movie due to be in theaters soon, I'll be really disappointed!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Excellent start to a series - lead character is strong, Evanovich knows the climate of the city she is writing about, the secondary characters all are real and have some depth, and the plot is pretty good too. In fact, the ending is not an easy one to figure out along the way. I'll definitely read more of this series now that I've started with One for the Money."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'd heard great things about this series for years, but as usual that was more of a deterrent for me than a selling point. I hate reading books other rave about because I'm worried they won't live up to the hype. However, after years of refusing to touch One For the Money I finally gave in and am ecstatic about the results.I don't want to ruin it for any prospective readers, but the thing that sealed the deal for me was the first big confrontation scene of the book between Stephanie and a hulking prize fighter type. Until then I'd been kind of puttering along half thinking about lying when people asked me if I'd finished One for the Money. Stephanie was a decent character, but there was no mettle, no fire just a putz jobless woman. Then this guy ties into it with her, and it was like a completely different woman arrived on the scene. Even though she had no training and was scared witless she didn't freeze up or wait for some guy to come charging in from the wings to rescue her (a failure to many other leading ladies to count are guilty of). She used everything she had, went down swinging, saved her panic for later, and got gun training as soon as she had the opportunity.That was it for me, by the end of that chapter I knew I'd inhale this book and not rest until the rest of the series was within easy reach.Another big selling point for me was the humor. It was hiding in all of the most unexpected yet perfect places. Such as when she was so desperate she tried hamster food, or the gradual hawking/ trading of all of Stephanie's possessions to pay for for various and sundry things such as a TV and VCR for a Nova.The relationship dynamics were both hilarious and believable, but my favorite relationship by far was the one between Stephanie and Rex, her hamster. The stumbling step in many books I've read is the pet/ owner dynamic. Most authors can barely pull off a good dog/ person relationship, but Janet Evanovich managed to deliver in spades with a hamster and a wanna be bounty hunter. So well in fact that I started to fear for Rex's health just in case the relationship was being so flawlessly constructed to elicited an emotional response when some psycho killed him off. I kept expecting Stephanie to come home to find a blood soaked cage and Rex's bloody body nailed to the back of the door. Thankfully despite guns being fired in his vicinity he survived book one unscathed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The romance is wonderful, and the book is hilariously funny, but the plotting of the mystery is good but not excellent. I liked the book more because it is laugh out loud funny and will cheer you up if you need it.The plot involves an out-of-work and desperate young woman in Trenton, New Jersey, who goes to her cousin, a bail bondsmen, for work. She's heard he needs someone to do some filing. She ends up trying her hand at being a bounty hunter, because she is desperate. She needs to get her hands on the $10,000 she can earn by apprehending a fugitive vice cop who has been accused of murder and jumped bail. She really isn't very good at being a bounty hunter (she's afraid to fire a gun), and that's where the comedy comes in, but she has courage and determination. Needless to say, the fugitive cop is attractive and single, and there's a good chance he's not a murderer. But unless the truth can be discovered, he could end up going to prison.Anyone who likes mysteries with humor and/or romance will love this book. I intend to read more of her work."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love the Stephanie plum series :-) n she's from NJ word I'm Stephanie from si,NY ....... n all I wanna say is........

One of my girlfriends recommended that I read this, saying that she liked it so much she was up to number eight in the series. For a Jersey Girl like me, it is entertaining because the entire series takes place in NJ, making it familiar. Evanovich also doesn't add any NJ stereotypes which can be appreciated by true NJ residents! As a character, you immediately side with Stephanie and hope that she succeeds as a bounty hunter. The other characters add more suspense leaving you guessing until the very end. I read this in two days and would have finished it sooner but I had to work and go to sleep. If you are looking for something to fun and easy to read-this is your book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Book one reels you in and you're hooked from there on!

She needs to bring in income and considers between using her sports bras and working for her cousin Vinnie. Since she has no furniture for entertaining clients, she asks Vinnie to hire her on as bond hunter though her cousin would insist she used blackmail to coax Vinnie into giving her a $10,000 murder suspect pick up, disgraced vice cop Joe Morelli. Now all Stephanie needs is a gun and a car.Stephanie and Joe have a long time relationship that some would say is insane as she has driven her car over him and gave him her virginity as a teen. Stephanie knows this is the latest chapter when she catches and loses her mark. She interrogates boxer Benito Ramirez before borrowing Joe's car; he would say stole it. To insure Joe cannot repossess his vehicle before she collects her bounty, Stephanie installs a car alarm for she is coming to hogtie her money source.This reprint of the first entertaining Plum guided tour of the mean streets of Trenton retains the freshness due to the tough humorous heroine. Fast-paced. the jocular Stephanie Joe chess match is fun to follow. With the movie due out shortly, fans will enjoy One For The Money as the raunchy first person asides of the kick butt protagonist hold up nicely.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm a guy, and I loved this book. It gives more than a laugh per chapter and keeping up with all the characters is just as much fun as finding out how Stephanie Plum solves the mystery.I'm not much of a movie goer, but I think I'll set aside time to see this one when it is released early next year (2012).Read my review on the entire series at []"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was missing a couple of the \\"Janet\\" books from the Stephanie Plum set, and found them here. It arrived in condition expected and promptly. Now ready to pass along to a friend!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"By far my favorite series ever! I found the entire set at a Library sale and thought \\"what the heck?\\" and purchased them. Many parts of the book actually made me laugh out loud. The characters are great and really add to Stephanie Plums character. I'm a little disappointed that Joe Morelli isn't real, he would be the perfect guy."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have rarely found a book that has made me laugh like this one did, its like listening to your best friend talk about her day. Stephanie Plum and I could be best friends that is something that I knew right from the start. This novel has such great characters, Grandma Mazur, Lula, Joe Morelli, Mrs. Plum (Stephanie's Mom). I feel like I have known them forever and I really love that about any book. Its a good beach read or a good read on a snowy day. Its generally just a great read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this, out of curiosity, when I was told how funny Evanovich was. I am hooked, now, and will continue the series.Stephanie Plumb, a down-on-her-luck gal, decides to take the fast road to money, but becoming a bounty hunter. She is totally clueless, and in her quest for the big money, in the person of Joe Morelli, an old school chum, and supposed bad cop, she lands in all sorts of hot water, but makes headway, as well. Morelli, pops in & out of her life, and they have a love/hate thing going. Not to give anything away, good triumphs over evil and Stephanie saves the day. Language is a little rough, but expected for this type of book. It was funny, and scary at the same time. I intend to continue the series, as I've been told they just get better & better."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Do you like to be so entertained that you laugh out loud while reading a book? Do you like to get turned on by the sex scenes? Do you like to feel tense during the scarey parts? Do you like characters so well-drawn you feel like you can reach out and touch them? Do you like to read a book that makes you not want it to end? Then you will LOVE this book! AND you will love the audio version even more! Keep them coming Janet Evanovitch!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was hilarious. I just started reading the Stephanie Plum series a few days ago and I'm already done the 1st three books. The only reason I haven't read the other two yet is because someone else has them out at the library right now. I even have the 6th on e on reserve and it's not out yet. I'm the 13th in a line of 17 so that tells you how popular Janet Evanovich is. I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels will satisfy most any readers thirst for mystery/suspense with the added joy of being a hilariously fun read. Grandma Mazur is a real trip!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"All the books by Janet Evanovich are fantastic. They are &quot;laugh out loud funny&quot;. I haven't read any books like this since Donald Westlake,,,,he has now met his match!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read all of the Stephanie Plum series and can not wait until the next one comes out. These books are a definate joy for anyone who has ever had a bad day go worse. When reading these books I try to be alone, not only to be undisturbed but also because I laugh so loud I disturb others. At a book signing I learned Janet is as funny in person as in her books, she comes by the humor naturally. Stephanie always finds herself in situtations due to her lack of a better career and her stuborn personality that will not allow her to listen to others advice. Stephanie is a very real character that is very easy to identify with even if you don't live life as close to the edge as she does. The stories have it all from danger, humor, sexuality, and moves so well that you carry it around hoping to find a few minutes to read just a little bit more. This whole book keeps you coming back for more with great characters that are humorous and outrageous, but could easily be someone you already know. One of my favorite characters is the grandmother that gets into just about as much trouble as Stephanie. Read this first one and I guarantee you will be back for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"There is no flab on Stephanie Plum, the heroine of Evanovich's funny, fast-paced, exciting mystery-thriller. And there is no flab in the book. Truly a rapid page turner. And laugh-out-loud funny with true to life, and yet outrageous, characters like Stephanie's mom and grandmother. I can't wait to read the other books in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great book, laughed out loud in several places. Must say, however, that 2nd in series was the absolute funniest book I have ever read. I was howling with laughter in my bed every night. The best new female protagonist I have seen in a while.

I had heard such good reviews about these novels, that I chanced it and got all 5. Ms. Evanovich is similiar to J.D. Robb. Buy the whole series and you WON'T be sorry. I'm on book # 3 and am enjoying it as much as 1 and 2."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A light and comical murder mystery along the lines of Lucy becomes a bounty hunter. This book is by no means a serious mystery....it's just a comical story of a women who lost her job and must find some employment. It's a story about a women down on her luck in predicaments that make you wonder what could possibly go wrong now. Even she sees humor in things that happen to her. A light, funny book if you enjoy Lavern &amp; Shirly, and Lucy type adventures."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've read this one and the next two in the series! I have actually laughed out loud and can't wait to finish the fourth. In this first of the series, you get to know the characters in addition to a good story. They get better and better. . . You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this first book as a fluke because I saw an advertisment for the fourth book in the series. So I decided to go the cheap way and read the first one which was in paperback. I have always enjoyed the Kinsey Millhone stories, so I thought I might also like this one. And boy did I. I not only liked it, but I enjoyed the reading even more than Kinsey Millhone.Stephanie Plum has spunk and a smart mouth. The mystery part of the story is fairly good also, but the heroine is just a lot of fun to follow around.I have since read all of the others including four and loved everyone of them. It's not often that I get to read a good mystery and laugh all at the same time."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was given this book by a friend who knows I like strong female characters. I wasn't disappointed in the character of Stephanie Plum. She's thrown into bounty hunting by accident, but makes the most of her situation. As the book progresses we get to see Stephanie progress from an incompetant to a, well, still incompetant, but entertaining bounty hunter. Glimpses from her past gives insight into this character. I was able to identify with and like Stephanie Plum, which is necessary for me to really enjoy a book. I loved the tension between Stephanie and Joe Morelli as well. Once I started this book I couldn't put it down. When it was finished I raced out to find the next installments in the series. I would highly recommend this book, especially for fans of the Kat Colorado and V.I. Warshawski series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I saw Evanovich's newest book, Four to Score, in the bookstore and thought it sounded good so I looked for the first in the series so I could check out this author the cheaper way -- paperback! I expected the book to be a lot like Grafton's work and in some ways, it was. The violence did surprise me a bit but I still really liked the book and have bought Two and Three. I don't remember ever reading a good mystery that also made me laugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I absolutly loved this book. I was particularly interested in the relationship between Stephanie Plumb and Joe Morelli. It seemed to mirror many of the romantic entanglements I myself have experienced as have many of my friends. Although the violence in the book is graphic, especially when Stephanie meets up with Ramirez. I could not stop reading because of the plot development and the overall excellent writing. My favorite character was Grandma Mazur. What a hoot! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a little humor thrown in."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book has it all -- murder, thrills, romance, and last but not least, laughs! I love a good mystery, but it's been ages since I also laughed out loud while reading one. In fact, my laughter was so contagious that my husband also laughed out loud (Stephanie's grandmother is exactly as outspoken as my mother...I can see my mom saying the same kinds of things.). Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!! Brava, Ms. Evanovich!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money moves at an almost perfect pace. The daily activities of Stephanie Plum in her hilarious adventures as a novice bounty hunter are written with a terrific wit and eloquent writing style. There is one thing that puzzles me, though. How does one shoot 5 rounds into a 1-inch group with the gun inside a shoulder bag? Especially with only a couple hundred rounds of practice? It's statistically impossible, but is only a minor headscratcher. Evanovich also wrote a supporting character out of the story with a wound, which was the point that the story abruptly switched gears with Stephanie doing a remarkable jump from novice bounty hunter to intermediate bounty hunter with only a few days of experience. Another headscratcher, but still not too major. All in all, a good story, and a terrific writing style that puts many bestselling authors to shame. Just wish she had a few more pages to avoid the small blips in the storyline."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read the second book, &quot;Two for the Dough,&quot; first and had to rush out to find the first book in the series. After many stops, I finally laid my hands on &quot;One for the Money.&quot; I wasn't disappointed. Although the second book made me laugh harder than I've laughed in a long time from reading a book, the &quot;One for the Money&quot; came pretty close. This book had a truly frightening evil character in it. I'm not often nervous while reading, but this brutal character had me shivering and checking that my doors and windows were locked. After that, it sounds like you couldn't possibly find anything to laugh at, but believe me, at times you can hardly stop. Let's see, there's the pawning of her worldly goods, her car problems, Joe Morelli's car problems, her history with Joe Morelli, her current status with Joe Morelli, her bounty hunter training under Ranger, how her family treats her and each other, and so on and so on. If you like funny mysteries, this is one to sink your teeth into!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money was being given away by a local bookstore as a promotion, so I picked up a copy and put it on my shelf, thinking that if they were giving it away, it couldn't be very good. A year or so later I read it while on holidays, and now I am hooked. Ordered Two for the Dough and Three to Get Deadly from Amazon, and am looking forward to the next one coming out in paperback. Stephanie Plum is a hero of the 90s, with her pet hamster, ornery grandmother, and non-existent sex life. Keep on writing, Ms. Evanovich, we want more!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Okay, so it's not the type of book full of symbolism and in-depth meaning. However, Evanovich's book is definitely worth the read. In short, it's about this woman (Stephanie Plum) who's desperate for cash, so she decides that it's within her abilities to become a bail-breaker-finder (which is sort of like a head hunter). Needless to say, when you take a girl with no experience going after criminals, things become pretty funny! Evanovich also introduces other characters, such as Stephanie's grandmother who acts like she's in her twenties, which adds humor to the book.Many of my co-workers raved about Evanovich's books and spoke constantly about how hilarious they were. I was not disappointed at all. In fact, once I began reading, I couldn't stop. The story line is solid and intriguing and fast paced.. A definite must on your vacation (or wherever)! Oh, this story does have some sexual undertones and cussing-just thought I'd warn you in case you don't like that kind of stuff or if your kid wants to read it!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book on the reccomendation of my aunt. She was right on the mark!I was so enthralled by the tale of Stephanie, the world's most inept Bounty Hunter, that I had to run out and get the next book, and the next, and the next. I read all of the first 8 in a week!These books are all written with humor, great descriptions of all the sexy, funny, equally inept, talented, and dysfunctional people that surround the main character."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is outta work and needs to get into some form employment before she has no furniture left to pawn off for gas and the occasional bit of grocery shopping. In an act of desperation she decides to get her duck loving uncle to give her a job as a bounty hunter, chasing down criminals in the New Jersey Ghetto.My wife was always laughing when she was reading these books so one day I took a look myself, thinking it was another 'women's' book I was reluctant to show an interest at first but then I got hooked, I went on to read he next nine books and they just seemed to get better. Just when you think nothing else can happen to this poor woman something does. If she isn't being stalked by some crazy heavyweight boxer she is burning down funeral parlors with her old Grandmother in tow.These books are great; interesting story lines will keep you guessing while hilarious scenarios will keep you laughing all the way through.A well deserved 5 Stars."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I did this backwards - started with &quot;Hard Eight&quot; and loved it, so worked my way backwards to the first. Evanovich is great at giving the reader quirky characters. True, she does remind me of Grafton, but that doesn't take away from the fact that she can deliver a book that's entertaining and fun to read. Now onto the latest!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Being laid off in Trenton, NJ, means having to hock your stuff to pay the rent and buy gas, as well as endure family dinners (or starve) over at M&amp;D's house. Desperate times call for desperate measures, so ex-discount lingerie buyer Stephanie Plum goes to work for cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman, as a skip tracer, i.e. a bounty hunter who retrieves those who've skipped bail.In ONE FOR THE MONEY, author Janet Evanovich kick starts Stephanie's new career. Plum immediately jumps into the proverbial deep end by convincing a skeptical Vinnie to give her a chance at finding Joe Morelli, a local cop accused of murder. The finder's fee is 10 grand, and that'll buy a lot of chow nuggets for Rex, Stephanie's pet hamster.Plum's considerable appeal lies in her complete ineptitude for her new career. (It doesn't help that she and Morelli have a &quot;past&quot;. At six, she'd allowed Joe to play train under her skirt in Old Man Morelli's garage. At sixteen, Stephanie was relieved by Joe of her virginity behind the pastry counter at the bakery where she worked. At nineteen, she intentionally clipped Morelli with the right front fender of her Dad's Buick.) Within the first few days on the job, Plum finds Joe four times, but fails to make the bust, a tough assignment if your quarry leaves you buck naked, dripping wet, and handcuffed to your own shower curtain rod. Or your car keys have been tossed into the putrid muck at the bottom of a dipsy-dumpster.Another source of amusement for the reader is Stephanie's family: Mom, Dad, and Grandma Mazur. The inspiration for Grandma might well have been Dorothy's mother Sophia on the TV series GOLDEN GIRLS.ONE FOR THE MONEY was originally published in 1994. This paperback edition was published in 2003. In the intervening nine years, seven additional Stephanie Plum adventures have been added to the series. In the back of this edition, there's a brief synopsis of all eight novels to date, which also defines for each book the &quot;Historic Moment&quot;, &quot;New Characters Introduced&quot;, and &quot;Automotive Factoid&quot;. It's apparent that Evanovich continues with the personalities introduced in ONE FOR THE MONEY, as well as bring in new ones. And Stephanie continues to have car problems.I'm giving this first book in the series five stars because it's truly amusing and the Plum character is (for me, at this late date) fresh. Books written by formula to create a series sometimes become tiresome. TWO FOR THE DOUGH is on my shelf to be read. Once I hit two 3-stars in a row, I'm done. We'll see."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money is a mistrey book and it is about a girl named stephnie plum and she lost her job her car and she is out of money.She goes to her cousin for a job as a bountie hunter and starts here work.There are a few twists and turns in this book and that is what is so good about the book.I enjoyed it and i know you will to."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I don't know why I waited so long to get into the Stephanie Plum series. I think maybe it was because I had read in the reviews that she was a bounty hunter, and didn't think that would interest me. What a mistake that was! This book is a great read! I really didn't want to put it down. Stephanie is so real and funny that she is a joy to meet. The book is action-packed and certainly keeps the reader's interest right up unitl the stunning conclusion. Stephanie finds herself doing apprehension work in order to make some money to keep food in her fridge and to pay her rent. She isn't prepared for the dangers that she faces while she's out to capture her old nemesis, Joe Morelli. Stephanie finds out that she has to learn to use a gun and to carry nerve spray in order to defend herself from the bad guys that her new job puts her in contact with. This book is full of surprises, right up to the very end when Stephanie finally gets her man (in more ways than one). I can't wait to read the others in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"These books have been a lot of fun. I drive a lot in my motor home. So, I also buy the Audio Book, preferably unabridged if available. Unabridged is rarely available.The publisher changes readers three times over the series. The reader of the first 3 books sounds more like what I imaged that Stephanie might sound like, but didn't have the range of voice to Vinnie, Morelli or Ranger very well. The next two readers are much better doing all the voices"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"OK. I'm a guy. I was waiting for the next Star Wars, Tek War or Tom Clancy book to come out and needed something to read. I borrowed OFTM from my wife who had borrowed it from my office manager. Of the 3 of us, I was the first one who has read all 9, so I guess you'd say I was hooked.But guys, listen! Stephanie Plume is cool! She isn't Laura Croft. She's a girl from the burgh who needs a job and goes to work for a scum bag cousin vinnie. No, not that cousin Vinnie. This Vinnie prefers rubber duckys to a woman like Marisa Tomei I think. Well Vinnie owns this Bail bond business and needs Stephanie to bring in those who skip out. Fortunately she's got this Cuban... His name is Ranger... x-?Seal?, X-CIA??? Man mountain hunk to help her now and then. Then there is Morelli. He is a cop. Stephanie just can't decide what to do with Joe Morelli. Oh my, I haven't gotten to her family. Granny is my favorite.Each story does conclude a specific story line, but Evanovich keeps the story movie linearly alone a straight time line into the future. So what you get is an evolving character and evolving relationships with great continuity. And best of all you feel like you're your friends the Plumes with each novel.Oh ya, she also has trouble with cars!These books have been a lot of fun. I drive a lot in my motor home. So, I also buy the Audio Book, preferably unabridged if available.The publisher changes readers three times over the series.

Good, relaxing, funny reading for the hour before bedtime."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"With all of Stephanie Plum's misadventures, you begin to think that she just isn't going to make it. Janet Evanovich proves us wrong! She has developed this character with such depth that you feel she could be the bumbling idiot next door who always makes it! Seriously, Stephanie Plum is one of the most lovable female \\"heroines\\" I've ever had the pleasure to encounter. Evanovich deserves praise for her ability to up the ante with characterizations that make you scream!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I just finished reading this great book. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. I read often and cannot even tell you the last time I enjoyed a book as much as this one. The sheer determination of the books main character, Stephanie Plum and the troubles she finds herself in are truly histerical. If you can use a good laugh, this one is for you."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first book by Janet that I had read. My mother saw that the series was on a best seller list and thought I might enjoy it; she gave it to me as a birthday present.The first couple of chapters did not get my attention, infact at first I found the book to be boring and put it down several times which is very much unlike me; I usually read an entire book of this size at one sitting: I put it aside and read something else. Two days later I pulled it out (I was bored and curious: books don't stay unread long on my shelves) and made myself read past the first two chapters. I could not put it down! The characters charmed the socks off of me (I love Gradma Mazur and Stephanie's father reminds me of my own) and the story was fun. I didn't stop laughing. All the bumbling errors and chance meetings (and sexual tension) with Joe made for a fun romp through New Jersey. It is a very good read once I got past the first two chapters, and I would reccomend it to anyone. Janet now has a new dedicated reader."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"So be sure to buy them all. I love these wacky characters and find myself laughing out loud at the things Stephanie gets herself into. Best time you can have reading!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am so hooked on the Plum series. Ms. Evanovich creates wacky characters you just love. She writes with humor and wit. I can't get enough of this author!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is one of the most down-to-earth, funny, and gutsy heroines to come around in a long time. When she gets laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in desperation. She is expecting to get a filing job, but instead she becomes a &quot;bounty hunter&quot;, bringing in crooks who have failed to appear for a hearing date. It sounds like easy money, until she actually tries to jockey some of these brutes into her car to take them to the police. They resist in every way possible and Stephanie does some fast, on-the-job training. Her first case is a former lover of hers who has committed a murder, with some debate as to whether it was self-defense. She pursues him while being pursued by a violent, sadistic boxer who threatens great bodily harm to her. This story is told in a breezy, tongue-in-cheek manner which is very appealing and causes it to be a page-turner."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend of mine gave me &quot;One for the money&quot;, and after reading a mere 25 pages, was hooked. Even though you have to read from books one through seven, it's still an awesome read. Stephanie Plum is a great character, and so is Joe Morelli. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to have a good read..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is another one of those books I wanted to badly to love and cheer about. Unfortunately, I was so put off by the flippant way the author portrayed a six year old being molested that I found myself unable to enjoy the rest of the book. The character lost my interest, and I found her actions predictable and juvenile. I am one who can willingly suspend belief for the sake of a good plot, but the idea that anyone could just become a bounty hunter overnight without any training (or brains) just didn't work for me. There were some humorous parts but they were not enough to earn more than two stars from me."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"the detailed descriptions of how Benito brutalized and raped women with broken beer bottles etc- after all, who needs these images in their head? Isn't the nighly news enough? Also, the crude language and setting just gives me an ugly feeling. That said, I liked Stephanie and her sense of humor, but I'm not sure I would read more of the series. The fact that these are bestsellers just proves to me that society is getting more and more depraved."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"It's been a long time since there came along a book that I couldn't finish. Try as I might, a little over half way through the book, I put it down. I can't imagine why this would have been made into a movie."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first in what has become a series of very funny, entertaining mystery stories. Stephanie Plum is the main character in the book and she is extraordinarily funny as she bumbles her way into a career as a bounty hunter after leaving a job in lingerie sales.Stephanie's on the job training as a bounty hunter is a series of hysterical episodes. She has only become a bounty hunter to escape total poverty. Her car is repossessed and she has sold most of her furniture. Paying her rent has become top priorityTo get the bounty hunter job, she blackmails her cousin who is a bails bond agent, into giving her the job of bringing in Joe Morelli, a cop up on charges of killing an unarmed man. Stephanie's cousin is easy to blackmail since he is a really slimy sort who engages in various strange sexual pursuits in his office. She merely suggests to him that his wife might now be pleased with his behavior. So, she gets the job to get Morelli.Stephanie knows Morelli from the neighborhood and even has a bit of history with him from when she was 6 years old. Morelli is one of those men who are very attractive and very dangerous. She hasn't seen Morelli for a long time and the last time she did see him she ran over him with her car. She is able to find Morelli. Actually, she finds him quite often, but she can't bring him in he always gets away. There are some incredibly funny scenes around Stephanie trying to bring in Morelli. Stephanie enlists the help of a fellow bounty hunter, Ranger, to give her some training. Ranger is another one of those attractive dangerous men and also very mysterious since no one knows where he lives and how he manages to drive around in Porches, BMW's and other high-end cars. Ranger is a continuing character in the Stephanie Plum series.Read all the books in the series, in order. Each one stands alone but you won't want to just read one. I've looked forward to each one and haven't been disappointed yet."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I want to add my voice to the minority here who were also shocked by the violence against women in this book, for which I was very unprepared. I started reading it after a couple of people told me how funny the series is. This book goes into my personal hall of fame as one of the few I have chosen not to finish.Any redeeming features of this book, including its so-called &quot;humor&quot;, are entirely mitigated by the full-scale &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; that is so degrading for both the male and female characters. This sexism is present more blatantly in the plot action (encounters with a sexual sadist) and more subtly in the way it infuses the whole narrative. For example, it seems we are supposed to get laughs out of a woman being involuntarily handcuffed naked to a shower rail and being ogled at, and by what happens when young women are too inexperienced to negotiate what they want from their first sexual encounters, and by men and women settling their differences through violence (driving into someone and breaking their leg).It kinda adds to my disappointment that the author is a woman. Oh well..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Down on her luck and out of cash, ex-lingere buyer Stephanie Plum is at her wits end. Her car has been repossed, she has had to sell her furniture and all she's had for breakfast is a beer. She's desperate for a job. Any job.When she hears that her cousin Vinnie is looking for a bounty hunter for his business she blackmails him into giving her the job. The only catch is her first big case is Joe Morelli, the man who took her virginity at the age of 16 and left her.Stephanie can put that incident out of her head and spend her time tracking down Joe and bringing him in. But can she set aside the past, especially when Joe is breathtakingly handsome? Joe and Stephanie play cat and mouse while Stephanie is getting into trouble after trouble proving herself to be the worst bounty hunter alive. But she's determined to get her man and her money.The first in the series of Stephanie Plum novels, ONE FOR THE MONEY delivers like no other. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read 2/3 of it before putting it down for good. I truly gave it a chance.However, as other readers pointed out, this book is way too sexist for my taste. Perhaps the author thought she might be adding titillation by adding sexual content, but what came out is poorly executed sadism. The characters are cardboard, and the main character, Stephanie Plum, is just another -oh-I'm-so-clumsy-let-me-bat-eyelashes-and-get-what-I-want-because-I-want-to-be-a-tough-girl of those chick lit heroines.I'm a Sue Grafton fan also, but what I found here was a poor imitation, a dumbed-down version with even shorter words and slapstick humor."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I found this to be boring, insulting, and obnoxious. I was looking for something light when I purchased this, but this was too dumbed down for my taste."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first series of books that actually made me laugh out loud. Stephanie, Grandma, Joe, Ranger and many characters to come will make you love or hate them because Evanovich has done such a great job making these relatable people, like you and me (ok maybe not Ranger but most of the others)."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Okay, so I've been listening to the bloggers on the web, and of course, my darling dad- who absolutely LOVES Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series- and broke down and starting reading them. I have only read one other besides this one, and that was an in-between-the-numbers, called Plum Spooky. Let me say this: I've been a hermit all my life! LoL! This book was AWESOMENESS!! I was instantly hooked, instantly swept away to Jersey, and instantly fell in love with Stephanie, Ranger, Morelli, Rex and Grandma Mazur!!One For The Money was absolutely awesome. It was suspenseful, it was laughable, it was page turning. I loved Stephanie Plum. She's a down on her luck gal in the Burg of Jersey and took on a job with cousin Vinnie as a Recovery Agent....better known as a Bounty Hunter. Yep, a bounty hunter. Her first assignment? To bring in Joseph Morelli....the boy who showed her his father's garage when she was 6.....and boy is she not ready for that! So, what really happened when Vice Cop Morelli went to check on an informant? Did he REALLY shoot a guy down in cold blood? Or was it as he said, self defense?I LOVED every minute of following Stephanie around Jersey, listening to the accents and seeing the sights, as she hunted for clues to help bring in Morelli and get that $10 grand she was after. It really was quite an enlightening experience.I DEFINITELY recommend this with a 5 book rating, but, reader beware: make sure you have LOTS of free time as you won't want to put this book down. Oh and wear Depends.....you'll laugh til you pee (not really but....well, shhhh...don't tell anyone about that okay?)! Evanovich is at the TOP of my FAVORITE authors list. Her combination of suspense and laughs is PERFECT. I can't wait to jump into Two For The Dough!*This review is based on a copy purchased by me for my personal library collection*"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"good book love her books trying to read all in this series got really quick this is a excellent series"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Duplicate item.....I have this entire series and have so enjoyed it very much.

Well Stephanie Plum as just done all this and more after being canned as a discount lingerie buyer.Hard up for cash and about to be evicted, Stephanie takes a job as a bounty hunter, and gets landed with Joe Morelli, the gorgeous, seductive, possibly murderous cop who once boinked her beside some eclairs!I love the love/hate relationship between Plum and Morelli!The book is written from Stephanie's point of view and it's one you can believe and maybe even see yourself in.On her mission to find and capture Morelli and in turn collect her $10,000, Stephanie runs into some questionable and downright evil characters! I personally LOVE her Grandma Mazur! I imagine Betty White mixed with the grandmother from the Wedding Crashers!All in the name of making a buck...what's a girl gonna do?All in all, One for the Money is a great book and a great start to what I hope will be a great series!For witty banter, delicious characters, and situations you can only laugh out loud about, this book is it!If I HAD to find anything to complain about...I wasn't fussed how it ended so quickly. This is probably because it's part of the series and Janet Evanovich is leaving me wanting more. So, if this is why, it totally worked because I now can't wait to read the second book in the series, Two for the Dough!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I recommend this writer ... highly. That is if you like a good sense of humor PLUS imagination in a mystery novel. She is an exceptional writer. Probably not a man's book but a GREAT chick book! Oh ... I also saw the movie, but the book was even better."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Fun fluff for when you need a diversion and some down time. Cute character, much like Sue Graefton's Kinsey Milhone, but not so similar that it would annoy someone who has read Graefton's alphabet series.

Good Job"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"No wonder they made it into a movie! I picked up book 4 by chance and loved it so much that I am working my way quickly through this hillarious series.It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud, but Janet Evanovich had me cackling the whole way through. This is a fast paced story of a regular girl in extraordinary situations. The characters are clearly depicted and interesting, including a few really scary ones. There's a bit of sexual tension throughout as Stephanie Plum chases cop Joe Morelli, and ex-fling. The book is packed with details of the burg and life in it, which are fascinating, but don't weigh the story down. Stephanie Plum is likeable, because she may be down-and-out and a hopeless bounty hunter, but she's creative and tenacious and has a talent for accidentally finding criminals, putting herself in danger and getting things blown up. Now it's her job to bring in Morelli, who is accused of murdering an unarmed man and is on the run.I reccommend this very funny, fun and action packed book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Loved the book.

Janet E., I LOVE Ya!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I normally do not read much, but decided to try out reading for fun again. A friend told me I might enjoy the Janet Evanovich, Stephanie Plum series books. I love comedy-romance-mystery stories. This one hit it on the nose. It also helps that my mother and god-mother are from the Trenton, NJ area. I can relate to the way the people act and talk in Jersey.I'm addicted now. In just 1 1/2 weeks I have read No. 1, No.2, and have started No. 3 of this series.I highly recommend this series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I can't get enough Stephanie Plum. I started reading the later noverls in the series and wished I could start from #1. Well thanks to Kindle e-books I have done just that. Great fun to read how Stephanie started out and all the funny missteps along the way. I won't stop now til I own all the books. If you love some fun with your action-adventure you will love these books by Janet Evanovich"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The books got stellar reviews so I figured there must be something to all the hype. I got through One for the Money and admit I was drawn in at times, the book definitely does not drag and it does have its chuckle to yourself moments. I just didn't think it was that funny or that good to warrant such praise. The goofy humor that is in this book, like when Stephanie lets her senile grandma play with her gun at the dining room table and grandma shoots a hole in the chicken did not seem to jive with the brutal violence depicted in scenes. I even willed myself into the second book because I was sure at any moment the \\"magic\\" was going to sweep me off my feet and suck me in. It just never happened for me."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"To read a book about danger and laugh out loud in parts is absolutely the best!! The mystery is great, but to add the humor was such a great addition... it made the book a delight to read! I didn't want to put it down. Already ordered the next book and can't wait to get started."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I just like the way the action in her books are. It's an easy read and holds your interest. I can usually read the whole book in three days when I have the time."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"For the most part, I enjoyed the story and the plot. The characters were well developed and interacted realistically. The major problem I had with it is the (to me) graphic violence against woman. I tend to be sensitive to that, and Stephanie Plum found herself in a bad situation twice. There are two other problems I had with it. First, Stephanie seems to be reaching beyond her grasp - she's very lucky not to have gotten killed. She's not good at apprehending criminals. Second, there was a lot of repetition of her getting dressed. Nearly every chapter had at least one scene consisting of several phrases describing what she was putting on. For me, it was a little tedious. Even though I won't read another, I still think it's a good read overall."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is down to a last resort when she has no car, no cash, and no job. She takes a job as a bounty hunter (by way of blackmail) from her cousin Vinnie. Her first FTA: Joe Morelli, the man who took her virginity at 17 (she who later hits Joe with her father's car and breaks his leg). Joe is wanted for shooting an unarmed man while off-duty as a cop, Steph just wants the satisfation of taking him to jail and collecting 10% of his bail bond. But she's naiive and new at the job (and terrified of guns) and while tracking down her man she becomes the target of a serial rapist who likes to torture women. I happened across this series when the author was talking about a different series. And I found myself loving her cast of characters. There's so much humor that when things get terrifing, youre not quite as afraid for the character as you should be. Add to the fact Stephanie as a \\"colorful\\" family and friends it just makes you laugh out loud and long! This is a must read series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money is all about Stephanie Plum's entrance into the world of bounty hunting. The jersey girl has been unemployed for six months and has ran out of things to hawk to pay for hamster food & beer. She finds herself hitting up her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsmen, for work... and lands the file for former vice-cop Joe Morelli, wanted for murder. Morelli also managed to get Stephanie's \\"cannoli\\" back in high school, so this jumper chase is more than just business, it's personal.After some quick training from the king of bounty hunting in Trenton, Ranger, Stephanie is out and about trying to catch Morelli and investigate his case. Unfortunately, Morelli keeps slipping between Stephanies fingers... a reoccurring incident that got tiring and hard to believe. The whole first half of the book was tedious, which can be expected from the first in a series. Fortunately the second half got better, and made the whole book worth reading - including the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Loved it! This was a fast and easy read, I'm on the third book now and plan on reading all of them!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich creates some of the funniest scenes in mysteries or in any other genre. The crime solver in the Evanovich novels is Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter from hell. Her job is to recover criminals who have been released on bond but who have failed to show up for court appearances. Stephanie is assisted in her efforts to become a successful bond enforcement agent by two men who make women drool and by Grandma Mazur who strikes terror in the hearts of funeral directors. Stephanie's adventures with men, cars and funeral homes make this series incomparably funny.As is the case with most well-written series, relationships change and characters develop as new books come out, so I advise reading the Evanovich books in sequence starting with One for the Money. If you don't have a sense of humor, stay away from Evanovich."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I happened upon a review of the Stephanie Plum series quite by accident, and it caught my interest. So I called up this first book, &quot;One for the Money,&quot; and by the time I had read all the enthusiastic reviews, I had to have it! Well all I can say is thank you. I laughed so much on the commuter train, ALOUD, that people were staring at me...and trust me, I'm not the type to make a scene. The book got me through a dreary, stressful week at work, and I cannot wait to get the next in the series. This is a fun, fast, silly but somehow ridiculously believeable romp, perfect for summer or any time. The mixture of really funny double entendres and hilarious situations with mystery, violence and eroticism is just too much to ignore. OK, so I'm writing a review two years late, but if you are new to Stephanie Plum like I am, read the book! You'll love it!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"All of the Stephanie Plum books are great and this one introduces the characters in a wonderful and funny way. All the ladies that I work with love this series and we refer to it to describe our own lives. The situations that Stephanie finds herself in are so funny and are sometimes so close to the situations that you can find yourself in. Once you start reading this book, you won't want to stop until you finish!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. It was a great read. Very real, up-to-date, serious yet funny. It was very hard to put down. I enjoyed being inside Stephanie Plum's head, and I really liked her family, espically Grandma Mazur. Half way thru this first book, I bought the next two Evanovich books; I had to make sure I'd be able to continue reading his &quot;new&quot; slooth."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I think the basic plot of the book has been well documented, so I'll just offer my own opinion...I started this book a bit skeptical - I hadn't heard of the author before, and I was going by reviews from other Amazon readers. The first few chapters really hooked me, though, and I couldn't put the book down.The writing is clear, sharp and witty. Stephanie Plum's life in New Jersey is truthful and funny. I was rooting for her until the end, and the plot twists kept things going at a fast pace.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I am looking forward to reading the next one in the series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is on the job, and Trenton's never going to be the same.Plum, an unemployed department-store lingerie buyer, has turned to &quot;skip tracing,&quot; a.k.a. bounty hunting, more to keep the wolf from the door than from any burning desire to make Trenton a safer place. Plum is a Jersey girl through and through; she knows how to make her hair &quot;big&quot; when she wants to, she's unabashed about driving around town in a car with &quot;pussy&quot; graffitied on its sides, and she knows how to remove a distributor cap (the only way to be sure your car will still be in long-term parking at Newark Airport when you return from your trip). What she doesn't know is mostly everything about apprehending criminals.But Plum is a fast learner, and downright lucky. By the end of this first novel, she's gotten her man, in more ways than one. She's also rekindled her relationship with Joe Morelli, who took the Plum's plum, so to speak, as a teenager. Morelli, totally by coincidence, is her first FTA (bailbondsman lingo for &quot;Failure to Appear&quot;--in court, that is ). Locking Morelli in a refrigerated truck with 3 dead bodies goes a long way to settling the score. And the $10,000 reward doesn't hurt either.Among the lively cast of characters is Ranger, a fellow bounty hunter who gives Stephanie some pointers and steps in to help when needed. He's an enigmatic guy, but likeable, and I for one hope we haven't seen the last of him. Psycho/boxer Benito Ramirez fulfills the requisite creeposity factor. And then there's Stephanie's family--Grandma Mazur, an septuagenarian with the heart of a teenager; Mr. Plum, a retired postal employee who drives cabs mostly for refuge from his wife and mother-in-law; and Mrs. Plum, pot-roast-cooking mom who never gives up on trying to coax Stephanie to get a &quot;normal&quot; job and get married, like her other daughter (conspicuously absent from this debut novel). These folks are so eccentric that you'd swear that the author had been eavesdropping on your own family.Plum is a down-to-earth, self-deprecating, and witty heroine, and this first adventure tale will leave you both laughing and triple-checking the locks on your door. And maybe even wishing you lived in Trenton, where there's no shortage of good guys to tend to the crooks."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Several friends had recommended this series; I was slow to warm to the idea.

I hope she writes a thousand more!Leah L Higbe's comments on &quot;One for the Money&quot; is a good review; she sums up everything I wanted to say."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When my mom and sister sent me the first three books of thisseries and told me to read them, I thought &quot;right, anothermust-read book recommendation.&quot; When I ran out of fiction and was looking through my bookcases for anything entertaining, I decided I might as well give Evanovich's book a try.Well, I laughed out loud - snickered out loud - so many times that my husband started looking at me funny. Sometimes I had tears running down my face from laughing. I was unable to figure out whodunnit. I blasted through this first book, barely able to put it down. I read the next two within the next week. Then I had to make bookstore runs to get the fourth book. It was a sad day when I finished the fourth book and had to wait for Evanovich to publish her fifth. Now I'm waiting for Hot Six to be published and even have a calendar reminder for its sale date. Have even been to (the website) to read the installments of chapter one of Hot Six. I EVEN ran a search to find the romance books she wrote before she launched her mystery writing tangent.Usually, when I blow through an author's series, after a few books I get annoyed with the character's habits, or of how the author establishes the character's history. Didn't happen with Evanovich's books.These are books worth buying in hard back and keeping for future reads. END"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is such a funny and realistic person! She has bad hair days, slouchy clothes, guy problems and money problems! Everything I'd expect to find in a good TV show! I've read all five books and love 'em all! Especially the bits with Stephanie and Morelli!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"\\"One for the Money\\" by Janet Evanovich introduces Stephanie Plum, a wonderfully quirky, down on her luck Jersey girl who readers are guaranteed to love. I have the Amazon recommendations to thank for introducing me to Stephanie Plum, and I am eternally grateful! Evanovich skilfully blends the humour, mystery, suspense, and a dash of romance into one of the wittiest, funniest, and most compelling books I've read in a long time.Stephanie Plum has lost her job as a discount lingerie buyer and if she doesn't make some money soon, she's going to be in serious trouble. She's already had her car repossessed, has had to sell almost all her furniture and appliances, and she just drank her last bottle of beer for breakfast. So what's the answer? Meet Cousin Vinnie, bail bondsman. Though the filing job Stephanie was thinking of has already been filled, the job of apprehending FTAs (failure to appears) for $$$ a pop is far more appealing anyway. After blackmailing cousin Vinnie into giving her the job, Stephanie gets down to some serious bounty hunter business.The thing is, the FTA she's after is Joe Morelli, a Vice cop charged with Murder One for shooting an unarmed man. But Stephanie and Morelli go way back, coming from the same neighbourhood in Trenton. In high school, Morelli was irresistible to all the girls, including Stephanie. He took Stephanie's virginity while she was closing up at Tasty Pastry when he charmed the pants off of her behind the &eacute;clair case, and then he never called her again.So, Stephanie is determined to get her man, the only problem is she doesn't have a clue what she's doing. A couple of quick lessons from fellow bounty hunter Ranger just aren't enough to turn Stephanie into a pro, but she is nothing if not persistent. It is a hoot watching Stephanie bumble through her work, and Evanovich's perfect timing and dry wit make for many laugh out loud scenes.Unfortunately, Stephanie has a bad habit of leaping first and looking later, and it seems that she has leapt right into a very dangerous situation. In addition to the terrifying threats coming from an unknown source, Stephanie ends up with a sociopathic boxer with a penchant for mutilating women after her. So if Stephanie doesn't watch out, her career as a bounty hunter, and her life, may be cut painfully short!The mystery and the suspense are expertly rendered and they fit seamlessly with the lighter scenes in the book. Evanovich has created a wonderful and colourful cast of characters, one of the best being Stephanie's Grandma Mazur. But it's Stephanie who keeps us reading and it's Stephanie who readers are rooting for. Evanovich has created a perfectly down to earth, realistic, and likable character in Stephanie, and female readers will really be able to relate to her.\\"One for the Money\\" is an all-around fantastic read, and it left me craving much more of Stephanie Plum. It is darn near impossible to read this book and not have a great time, so buy \\"One for the Money\\" today. A word of advice though, have the next few books in the series (\\"Two for the Dough\\" at least) readily available when you finish reading \\"One for the Money\\", because believe me, you are not going to want to wait to read more about the irresistible Stephanie Plum!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first of Janet Evanovich that I have read, and I enjoyed the book very much.Stephanie Plum is down and out on her luck. She has no more money to pay her rent, and her poor old car is broken down. So who does she turn to when the going gets tough? Meet cousin Vinnie, bail bondsman. Stephanie figures it's nice work if you can get it-shagging bail jumpers for $10,000 a pop. So she joins up.Her first assignment: apprehend Joe Morelli, who's a former vice cop on the run from a charge of murder one. There's another bad guy, Ramirez, a cranky ex-prize fighter dogging her and a nasty habit she has of leaping first and looking later. If Stephanie doesn't look out, the first dead body in her future could be her own."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was entertaining, fast-paced and funny. However, I think that the author could have made the violence much less graphic and not affected the plot at all. If not for the descriptions of violence, I would have given this book five stars. I think I will try reading the next book in the series, but if it disturbs me as much as this one did, it will be my last. I do not have to be shocked to be entertained."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum mystery series. Here we find out how Stephanie becomes a bounty hunter (desperation and no money). Advised to catch the villian and not investigate, Stephanie breaks that rule because the man she has to bring in was one of her childhood friends.This book is enjoyable, doesn't take itself too seriously and is a good introduction to the world Stephanie lives in. The most outright funny character in the book is her Grandmother. While I found it amusing, this is not laugh out loud material. Still, it's good enough to make me want to read book 2 in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I live in New Jersey and I can tell you that the characters in this book are very, very possibly real people! These Stephanie Plum books are FUNNY! My friends resisted this book when I told them about it, but when they read it for themselves, they LOVED it---especially the people who grew up in the Trenton, NJ area.My seventeen-year-old daughter put aside her summer activities to go right through this book. She admitted that it was much more enjoyable that the books on her required reading list.I have given this book as a gift and everyone loves it! I have lent my own copies of her books, one to five, to people and they got hooked and started buying the rest themselves. All of them were surprised how enjoyable it was! The idea of a bounty hunter isn't that appealing, but Stephanie Plum is one appealing character.I am about to read her latest book and I can't wait."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been aware of this series for several years and finally decided to give it a try. My first impression was that it reminded me of the Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Mystery Series written by Sue Grafton which started out about ten years before ONE FOR THE MONEY was published. Both series feature a female protagonist who is sometimes out of her league in the rough world of crime and murder. I do have to say that the Sue Grafton series is perhaps a little more realistic than this book by Janet Evanovich. Having said that, I will also have to say that as a person who enjoys mystery series that feature many of the same characters in each book, I know that the author probably has developed her main characters more with each of the books that follow this one and this was a cute story.ONE FOR THE MONEY is the first book about Stephanie Plum, a young woman who lives in New Jersey and who has just lost her job as a lingerie buyer and needs another job quickly so that she won't have to move back home with her parents. Her cousin Vinnie is a bail bondsman and Stephanie blackmails him into letting her work for him and try her hand at being a bounty hunter. Unfortunately, her first case involves the apprehension of Joe Morelli, a vice cop who is accused of murder. Stephanie's known Morelli her whole life and is still angry with him for what happened when they were teenagers. In fact, she can't wait to get even. This is a light hearted and fun caper."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Down-on-her-luck and recently unemployed Trenton girl, Stephanie Plum, blackmails her skeevy cousin Vinnie into giving her a job as a bond enforcement officer (aka bounty hunter) at his bonding agency. Her first case is to find and bring in sexy vice cop Joe Morelli, who she happened to accidentally and purely by chance run down with a Buick as a revenge-seeking teenager. Her case is complicated by Morelli's excellent fugitive skills and her not-so-good fugitive apprehension skills. Stephanie's adventure runs from Stark Street, the baddest of the bad part of Trenton, to her parents' cozy home in &quot;the burg&quot;, where her mother spends a lot of time making the sign of the cross and wishing Steph could be more like her perfect sister, Valerie, who never blows up cars or has bad hair days. This book is full of hilarious one-liners, sexual tension, Hiaasen-esque kooky characters, and one heck of a heroine. Stephanie Plum does for bounty hunting what Bridget Jones did for being a functional single woman; she may be hopelessly inept, but she always has a good story."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When my friend said that I had to order these books -- ALL of them -- immediately -- and read them in order, I wasn't convinced. So, I ordered &quot;One . . .&quot; and &quot;Two . . .&quot; and, boy, am I sorry now! (Hurry, Amazon, with my next installment!)These books are a real romp! Funny and snappy dialog; great characters; lots of food; and some fashion (well, not HIGH fashion). And, some nice crackling sexual tension. In short, everything you'd want in a summer book.So, order them ALL, so you won't be waiting to go racing through all of Stephanie Plum's adventures!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For the Money is the beginning of a wonderful series by Janet Evanovich. The story takes place in Trenton, New Jersey. Stephanie Plum, an out of work lingerie buyer, goes to work for a bail bondsman, as a skip tracer. Her first bail jumper is a cop, accused of murder, and a man she has an interesting past with. Stephanie is a down to earth, down on her luck, kind of gal and you'll be rooting for her from the start. The rest of the cast of characters are just wonderful, quirky and fun, people you want to know better. The writing is crisp, irreverent and witty. You'll be laughing out loud...that's a promise. Trenton is gritty and drawn and developed so well, you'll start to know your way around town. This is the first of a terrific series. And, as you watch Stephanie work at getting her man, you'll be hooked, for sure. Read the whole series and enjoy them all!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money is about a woman named Stephanie Plum who got laid off of her well paying job. She is suddenly plunged into poverty within the New Jersey suburbs. When she finds work in her brother Vinnie's business, as a bounty hunter, she ahs no idea of what she's getting into. Especially when she realizes the Joe Morelli is her first case! As a small town, Stephanie and Joe's history go way back. Finally she figures out how to use her personality, wit, and charm to convince her small cases to go with her; all except Joe Morelli. I thought this book was very cleverly written! Janet Evanovich is a creative, funny author, and I personally could not put the book down. Stephanie Plum is very real, and she lives in a very realistic suburb of New Jerse. I would recommend htis book for anyone ages 15 and older. Only becuase there is some questionable content, would I put an age limit on it. I deinitely can't wait to read the rest!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is about Stephanie Plum. She is unemployed after working in a lingerie store. She really needs te money so she visits her cousin Vinnie, who is a bail bondsman. So she has to hand in the people who jumped bail.You read how an unexperienced woman deals with criminals and get's better and better in the job. A good read but nothing special here for me. 3 stars"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I too don't understand the high praise for this book. While Stephanie and her home life were somewhat interesting, as was her introduction into the world of bounty hunting, there wasn't enough suspense, nor a tight enough plot to keep me intrigued. Plum brings up all of these plot threads (Hunting Morelli, waiting for revenge on the boxer) but the ending is lousy, without a real twist, or plausible explanation. This was a real disappointment given what I'd heard about the series. Don't think I'll be reading the next four."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I gave this book two stars because it was semi-entertaining, in a bad movie sort of way. It is not the hilarious book other posts have claimed. Maybe you have to be from Jersey to get it. It is generally predictable and unexciting. It is the equivalent of watching a movie made for the USA channel - same tired tv movie plot. My title refers to the Scooby Doo style ending. I'm sure anyone could find a better book than this. This was my first and last from Evanovich!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"How could anyone rate this book with 5 stars? It was poorly written, filled with cliches and the characters were not at all likeable or redeeming. Put this on the back shelf and only read if you are desperate."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Don't read this book! I started reading it totally unaware of how foul this author is. What is it about woman authors? Do they feel they have to be particularly foul to prove something? The sad thing is, it could have been an enjoyable and cute story without all the \\"f\\" words, and innuendo. Starting the book with a high school student having sex on the floor of a pastry shop with the local \\"bad boy\\" should have warned me off; also the amount of times she uses God's name as a swear word. But when she used the \\"f\\" word in front of God's name, that was reprehensible. I think even an atheist would have trouble with that one. She tried to turn it into something cute...but nope...that was simply too offensive, and it's burned into my brain now because I couldn't turn my eyes away fast enough not to see it. I'm really surprised at the amount of positive reviews this book gets. Does nobody care anymore what filth goes into their brains through their eyes? Have they read so few great books that they think this is a good one? They thought this was \\"hilariously funny?\\"Wow. I'm sad.Sorry Janet Evanovich...that was the first and the LAST book of yours I'll ever read!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had never heard of this book or its author until seeing the same on Amazon. The reviews were good. Everyone seemed to like it, so I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, the book must rank amongst the worst I've ever read, particularly as regards the standard of writing.The plot had some interest but was pretty transparent; the sort of thing that may just make an OK TV mini-series.The main character seems a bit shallow given all the problems she's supposed to have had and the others are not much better. One character, supposedly the bounty hunter to end all bounty hunters has to retire hurt part way through because of a minor wound. The other main character, Morelli, is hardly credible at all. Supposedly a run of the mill cop, he appears to have had similar training to James Bond.All that mixed with poor grammar (I know it's not everything but the writing itself shouldn't make your teeth go on edge, as it does with this book) results in a very disapponting read.Finally, perhaps someone should tell the writer of the back cover notes that &quot;shagging&quot; obviously has an entirely different meaning in the States as it does in England (!)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Yes - I eventually do get around to rating \\"One for the Money.\\"In early February 2009, I saw six copies of Janet Evanovich's most recent Stephanie Plum book, Fearless Fourteen, on the \\"New Book\\" shelf at my local library (that should've tipped me off right there). Normally I like to start a series from the beginning, and see how the characters develop over time; but the first book in the series was checked out. So I figured if I wasn't going to start at the very beginning, I might as well start at the end, with Fearless Fourteen. I was bored, needed a laugh, and had heard good things about the Stephanie Plum series.Normally I would be able to finish a book like that in a few hours. After a week of false starts, I just gave up and returned it without ever getting past the 5th chapter or so. It was very poorly written, and there was nothing smart or funny about the characters.Because I had heard really good things about this series -- -- well written and clever dialogue, realistic characters, and \\"laugh out loud\\" funny -- -- I just couldn't believe that I didn't \\"get it.\\" So I popped onto Amazon.com to see what others had to say about Fearless Fourteen. It currently has a 3 star rating, and the consensus is that the Stephanie Plum series was wonderful in the beginning, started to deteriorate in quality around book 7 or 8, and the last couple of books have even loyal fans questioning whether they will bother to continue with the series.Based on that information, I decided to start with the first book, \\"One for the Money\\" and at least enjoy the series for a few books. I tried to go in with an open mind, wanting to enjoy the story, but it took real effort to stick with it. I've finished the book now, and it wasn't really worth the effort.I guess I still don't get it. Nothing in this book made me LOL. Grandma is supposed to be (some of) the comic relief, with her half senile / have straight from the heart comments. The humor is so strained it just falls flat, because NONE of the characters are realistic in any way. Ms. Plum seems to be not just inexperienced, but actually retarded.I will defer to other 2 star and below ratings already posted here for the details of the plot and more detailed explanations of why the characters are so cliched and 2- dimensional. The bottom line is, don't waste your time with this series: it doesn't start off well and never gets any better."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am stunned that no other readers commented on the childhood sex abuse Stephanie suffered at the hands of Joe Morelli. I was reading along, really enjoying the beginning of the book, when all of a sudden, Stephanie describes what Joe did to her AT AGE SIX as \\"fingering.\\" Um, excuse me?!?!? I assumed when they played \\"train,\\" it was sort of like playing doctor - harmless peeking, you know? But when she described it otherwise, I was horrified. I read it a few times just to be sure my eyes weren't deceiving me. And then Stephanie goes on to have sex with Joe 10 years later? And is still drawn to him years after that? I'm not sure Evanovich is right in the head. I just did not see that one coming...Needless to say, I won't be reading any more of her books. Maybe \\"fingering\\" is different in Jersey than it is in Detroit. In Detroit, fingering a 6 year old is a felony and will probably cost the victim years of abuse counseling. I just can't see the justification for that kind of violence in a supposedly \\"funny\\" book.I'll stick to Sue Grafton when I want to read about a female heroine."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I wanted to like this book. If I liked it, then I'd have all those sequels to look forward to. But I couldn't get past the first chapter. Glib, smart-alecky, first-draft-feeling, it just felt too loose and unedited, un-thought-out. No style. More like a boilerplate for people wanting to make a quick buck writing easy paperback mysteries. I skipped around in the book after that, but nothing caught my attention. I even finally read the last few pages, but all I realized was that I would never be able to endure this character for a whole book, much less a whole series. Stephanie Lemon, I'd say."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is the epitome of patronizing \\"you go girl!\\" 90s tripe. Stephanie is useless at her job and has to be saved from her own lapses in basic common sense by her cartoonishly alpha male cop pseudo-boyfriend (who is introduced on page 2 of the paperback copy as someone from her childhood who basically molests her at the age of 6 but that's supposed to be okay because he was only a few years older and it just gets creepier and more uncomfortable from there). When she isn't being rescued by that guy, she has a helpful \\"ethnic friend\\" (Ranger) who seems to serve no other narrative function than to fix her mistakes and make sure she doesn't die in her attempts to be a bounty hunter. Many of these rescues involve Stephanie being placed in a situation where one non-white person or another is attempting to rape her, kill her, or rape and kill her. It's never flat out stated that every bad guy in this book is either African-American or Hispanic, but if you pay any attention whatsoever, the pattern becomes clear. Stephanie making bad decisions that put her in mortal danger without taking any precautions to make herself more able to handle the danger doesn't make her tough; it makes her suicidal, ditsy, or both. And yet, this is supposed to be an example of a \\"strong, independent female lead.\\" She's anything but. She can't do anything substantial without a man helping her out, and her objections to their help (when she hasn't directly asked for it) are hollow and pointless posturing. She's a cardboard cutout.One thing I can say is that Evanovich is a solid writer who does a respectable job pacing out a fairly thin plot. But between the irritatingly incapable character, the fact that I was meant to relate to someone whose stubbornness in the face of unnecessary danger is supposed to be a virtue, and the flat out racist over/undertones, I think this first Stephanie Plum novel will be my last."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich gets you involved immediately in her books. They are interesting and comical and your are hooked right from the start. It's really difficult to put the book down once you have begun reading."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet introduces Stephanie Plum in a hilarious way - plenty of \\"backstory\\" in a funny way. Can't wait to read the others!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading One for the Money, I couldn't even give you the name of the culprit, but I know exactly what Stephanie Plum wears when she's out catching the bad guys.Stephanie Plum is a Jersey girl down on her luck and broke as hell. She takes on a job bounty hunting and the guy she must find is this dude who broke her heart in high school. The plot didn't impress me. The setting and most of the characters certainly didn't, I thought it was too cliche, over-the-top (although maybe at the time it was fresh?). Yet I kept reading. And reading, and reading. Then it was over, and I wanted more. Here is why: Stephanie Plum is probably one of the best characters to come out of \\"chick lit.\\" People want to know what happens to her, they want to see her get her car fixed, learn how to shoot a gun, catch the bad guys, get laid. Everything else is incidental. People are still following Ms. Plum, who is currently in her 13th book, all that carry cutesy titles (One for the Money, Two for the Dough, you get the point).I suspect the books that follow are sharper, better because they probably improve as Evanovich's craft and imagination get more and more buff. So I'll probably read more, but I'm not waving my lighter at the Stephanie Plum concert just yet."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a great fun read for the beach. I loved all the characters in this book. This book was fun, witty and had lots of action in it. It is a great intro to the Plum series. It makes you want to get the next one in the series right away. If your looking for a fun very fast read look this one up, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"An online friend recommended this series to me. I was hooked by this book. Stephanie is a great heroine, but Grandma Mazur steals the book! What a hoot, if I could but only take her home with me.

Oh yes, the a mystery plots are very engaging as well.Any true mystery/humor lover will enjoy ."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am not usually interested in mysteries, HOWEVER, this one adds a little romance & a lot of comedy to the mix! I read it in one day, and am now quickly going trough the series. I even have my husband reading & enjoying this one! From Stephanie Plum, to Joe Morellie, and her Grandma. Every single character in this book is described well enough so you feel like you know them....safter that you didn't though, unless you want risk the lifestyle of a Bounty Hunter.

Stephanie Plum is a wise cracking \\"I can do this Bounty Hunter\\" crap kind of girl. My sister-in-law kept telling me you should read the Stephanie Plum series from Janet Evanovich. I am such a Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown book enthuasist that I kept resisting until I bought my new Kindle(2). I thought why not try her first one and see what all the talk is about. Well let me say, I read \\"One for the Money\\" in one day and have started on \\"Two for the Dough\\". The story line is good but the humor is worth the price of the read.

Prepare to laugh out loud."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a popular series, so I thought I would give it a try. This was a clever, albeit fluffy, story. Maybe the story is not so believable, but I read to escape the everyday doldrums of life. Stephanie Plum is a witty, sassy babe. It was fun to read about her escapade as she embarks on her bounty hunting career out of desperation to pay her bills. This book came out in the 90's, but I found the premise quite relatable to our current economic situation. Thanks to Stephanie, I now realize if I end up on the skids, I need not relegate myself to another stressful, underpaid cubicle prison sentence - I may just follow in her footsteps. Goofy yet strangely inspiring, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick but satisfying, mildly amusing story. Evanovich's writing style is easy and light hearted, despite some of the heavier subject matter explored. Through much of the story, she is stalked by a menacing, unstable predator -at one point he ties a half-beaten-to death prostitute to her balcony - but somehow the way the book is written, this is not scary, just interesting. Sound odd? See for yourself!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great Series! I highly recommend the series and have to many, many people. I also recommend going in order. Go to Evanovich's site so you can see the order, as there are in between books to read along with the numbered. You will laugh out loud and have tears streaming down your face I promise you! I would be reading in the lunch room at work and people thought I was crackin' up!Takes place in Jersey, Stephanie Plum is the main character. She lost her job and went to her cousin Vinnie for work(he owns bail bonds agency), he begrudgingly gave her some work and we are off from there!At first I thought \`What an idiot!' This lady is a moron! Face it I'm used to heroines that are on the ball, amazing, totally kick but and with the picture, well not that with Stephanie Plum. She makes a mess of quite a bit. So I told myself, it's the character, just accept it and keep going, so I did. And I'm glad I did! Just love her like you would your bumbling sister and you will be hooked.There is love, and suspense \`Stephanie style' and great laughs. I love the reoccurring characters, makes you feel like family.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a refreshing book to read after multiple dramatic ones. When it was recommended to me, I was told it was funny - but I just couldn't imagine how that would be true. Funny? I am surprised, and delighted to say that it was indeed funny - incredibly so. Stephanie Plum is a character unlike any other heroine - full of chicken guts and glory. Stephanie Plum is 1 part Nancy Drew, 1 part Dog the Bounty Hunter, and 1 part irresistible klutz.Janet Evanovich writes a tale interwoven with hysterical (although dysfunctional) characters, mingled in an interesting storyline full of suspense, mystery, humor, and murder. \\"One for the Money\\" was an easy read, and I read in about 24 hours.

Stephanie Plum is a great three dimensional character with a hilarious life I wish I had... The first book is a little hard to get into but once you get to the climax you won't be able to set the book down. I rated the book a four because it is not the best in the series but it definately sets you up for the more entertaining books to come. If you loved the Bobbie Faye books by Toni McGee Causey then you should definately read One for the Money!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm coming late to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series, which is now fifteen novels strong. But increasingly I've been reading positive references to the books, bloggers anxious for the next installment, so I downloaded a sample. I was sold on reading the whole thing by the writing style. Passages like this one suggested the series would offer better than average writing:\\"Food is important in the burg. The moon revolves around the earth, the earth revolves around the sun, and the burg revolves around pot roast. For as long as I can remember, my parents' lives have been controlled by five-pound pieces of rolled rump, done to perfection at six o'clock.\\"In this first installment, published in 1994, Stephanie Plum is out of work, having been laid off from her job as a buyer for a mafia-connected lingerie emporium. She falls into a job working as a bounty hunter for her bail bondsman cousin Vinnie. Her first assignment: bringing in Joseph Morelli, who's wanted for murder and has skipped on a $100,000 bond. Stephanie knows Morelli from the old neighborhood: she played \\"train\\" with him when she was six and he eight, and ten years later they played a variation of the same game on the floor of a bakery after hours. He kissed and told and she's held a grudge ever since, so hauling him back to jail has its appeal.While learning on the job and trying to locate Morelli, Stephanie runs into some other bad guys, a seriously scary championship boxer and his trainer, a low-life who's skipped bail on a stolen car charge. She also bonds with Ranger, a co-worker who looks like what a bounty hunter should look like and who proves to be a good friend to have when there's trouble.Now that I've been initiated into the series everyone else seems to have been reading, I have to say, I'm sold on it. The book never seemed formulaic to me. The writing is punctuated by clever turns of phrase. I didn't have problems with the story's credibility. And I like the cast of characters. I've already downloaded the second book to my Kindle.-- Debra Hamel"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum has been out of work long enough to force her to sell off furniture, appliances and jewelry just to survive. After telling her parents that she has been out of work for six months they suggest she visit her cousin Vinny the bail bondsman for a clerical job. Reluctantly she does so and finds out from his secretary the position has been filled. She also lets her know how much she could earn as a bounty hunter. The biggest payoff is to be made if she can capture someone who has periodically come into her life to torment her, Officer Joseph Morelli. Bringing him in would net her $10,000. When Vinny refuses to give her the job she threatens to reveal certain secrets to his wife. Vinny gives in. This is where Stephanie's life takes a dangerous turn. Inexperienced as a bounty hunter and determined to get Morelli may just get her killed. I put off reading this book every time something \\"more interesting\\" came along. This author was recommended to me by three different teachers who know I predominantly read Young Adult books. I was very pleased with the book and will definitely read more. She does an excellent job of keeping you on the edge of your seat as you get caught up in the action. I give this book a 5 out of 5 rating."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is great for escaping the real world. Stephanie Plum turns to bounty hunting as a last resort, and she is terrible at it! The plot will have you laughing the whole way through as Stephanie continually botches her attempts to bring in criminals. Her family is hilarious and make great secondary characters. If you are looking for some light reading with lots of humor, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"God I love this series. Stephanie Plum bumbles her way through life, love and criminal apprehension. A must read, a mix of mystery chaos and fun. I'm still hooked on this series and I suspect I will be hooked for a long time to come. Not recommended for those without a sense of humor."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My husband just introduced me to this series. Being a Peace Officer myself, I could relate to some of Plum's struggles and emotions as a female bounty hunter. This is a great read, fast paced, funny,entertaining and leaves the reader wanting more. I'll read them all!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book had me laughing out loud on the bus to work. All I can say is that it was H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S. Not only was it funny but there was not a dull moment. I finished it in 4 days. I simply could not put the book down. The Shocking twists and turns and the chemistry between the two main characters kept me on my toes. I can not wait to get book two."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum's New Jersey venacular is accurate as well as her intimate knowledge of the byways and culture of Trenton NJ. At first, this is irritating. Almost like listening how your sister-in-law from Paramus would decide to take on an extreamely dangerous career, &quot;just to make the rent&quot;. However, as the book progresses, the Evanovich's character slowly transforms before our eyes.By the end of the book we are pleased to see that Stephanie has become a fairly effective (and damn lucky) recovery agent, without losing the charm that never fails to remind a fellow native of New Jersey of what it's like to live in the Garden State."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I liked this book alot, Stephanie Plum, is a young girl some of us could totally relate too. I loved the author's description of Jersey. I am very anxious to read the other books that follow this one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed all the Stephanie Plum books and rated them 5 stars. I was looking forward to sharing them with my husband while on vacation, but the audio version was very disappointing. Ms. Petty's voice was so annoying I barely made it through chapter 1 of book 1. Four hours in a car with that voice is worse than listening to the kids fight! Forget this audio version-try to find the orginal unabridged version!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money is a fun book. It's actually funny without being heavy-handed (listening, Carl Hiassen?), it's got great character development (heads up, Agatha Christie?), and it's hard to put down.That said, don't expect a complex plot, or, in fact, any mystery at all. The &quot;mystery&quot; is simply a backdrop for poor Stephanie Plum's new job as a bounty hunter, and could concievably be dropped, since the only time the case really matters is in the last ten pages.The humor is dry and charcter-driven. Stephanie is an excellent rhymes-with-witchl, but without the malice associated with such a term...more like what used to be called a &quot;broad.&quot; The humor occasionally becomes a bit too earthy, and gratuitous references are needlessly made for a cheap laugh. Most of the time, though, it's geniune straight humor.It's light reading; don't expect the clever plot twists of a Christie novel or a brilliant fair play deduction. I'd even consider it more of an &quot;action&quot; novel then a &quot;mystery&quot; novel, but they also have Tom Clancy under mystery at my local book store, so what do I know?"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I thought that this book was great! Very funny-I was laughing out loud while reading it.I have read all five of Janet Evanovich's novels and loved them all. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"WARNING: Once you read this one, you'll have to read the whole series!Janet Evanovich has done an excellent job of creating a fast-paced mystery with her tale of how Stephanie Plum stumbles into the bounty hunter business. She's a street-smart Jersey girl you'll never forget! And her search for a fugitive on the lam forces her to cross paths with a sociopath boxer, some of the eeriest scenes you'll get. Even so, lots of parts of this book are pretty funny.Once you read this one, you'll have to read the other four in this series. Evanovich is more believable than P.D. James or Colin Dexter, and her stories are much faster paced. More clever, too. If you like the smart-talking Archie Goodwin of the Nero Wolfe series, you'll love Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Evanovich is a wonderful writer, giving a great sense of place and well drawn characters. But Stephanie Plum? Oy! I wanted to throw the book across the room. She drags an injured woman through her apartment window? Even a high school student would know better. She hears, on the phone, a man whose identity she knows torturing a woman. Does she call the police? No. She plugs in her answering device. Dozens of other utterly absurd actions show her to be a total [mindless person]. She is so stupid that she becomes a primary cause of another person being shot!I must say this is the absolute worst book of its kind I have ever read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is my first Sephanie Plum novel--I actually tried reading the first book first for a change. I enjoyed the book a lot, and would recommend it to James Patterson fans as well, for a good read.The main character, Stephanie Plum, is wonderful--very real and funny. The situations she gets herself into are not realistic, but that's all part of the fun. Lots of interesting twists and Stephanie gets hersef in and out of trouble.I'd recommend this book, and will be reading others in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Unemployed and down on her luck, Stephanie Plum takes a job with her cousin Vinnie's bail bond service as a bounty hunter. Soon she is on the heels of Joe Morelli, a cop wanted for murder with whom Stephanie also has a complicated personal history. This is a light, breezy story whose main charm is its amusing lead character, who narrates the story and her many screw-ups on the way to ultimate victory in a very humorous voice. The end disappoints by denying us a major confrontation that seemed inevitable and by falling back on the old device of the villain who is undone because he takes the time to explain his schemes. Still, it remains a fast, enjoyable read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Wow, this is such an amazing mystery/humor book! There's everything some sex appeal, some hot main guy charachters, and a main girl that EVERYONE can relate too!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is one of those books that make you chuckle out loud and then look around quickly to see if anyone noticed. The asides and comments were so cutting and so on point. Loved Stephanie, Grandma Mazur(!), the cocky ex(?) heartthrob and even the evil bad guy was chilling and entertaining.If you are looking for a Patricia Cornwell or Elizabeth George, forget it. This is a light, breezy, easy read that is perfect for the beach or the pool. If you've ever been occupationally challenged (PC for \\"unemployed\\") and been reduced to selling off your belongings, this is the one for you. I was given the entire set EXCEPT number one and was told that it was essential to understand the rest of the series. Here's hoping for some great followups."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is a GREAT comedy/mystery. It is so funny and is definitly a page turner with a laugh a page. recommended to anyone who wants to read a great book and be completley entertained! I wish i could give this books 10 stars!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm tired of authors trying to creat masterpieces. It doesn't work. Fancy language, and symbollism doesn't amount to anything without a decent story. Janet Evanovich realizes this. She has written a hilarious, brilliant dark comedy that never tries to be a classic, but will end up being one anyway."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Sooo good!!

Stephanie Plum is currently out of a job; she got laid of at E.E. Martin as the discount lingerie buyer. In order to get back her car and most of her furniture, and to pay the bills on her less-than-great appartment, she blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job--as a bounty hunter.What can she say, she REALLY needs the cash.How Plum thinks she's going to pull this off, and how she actually does are almost so funny, it's too much. She's got guts though. Her first assignment, for $10,000, is to find Joseph Morelli, the first guy that she ever had sex with in high school and later tried to run over with her car. Now, he's a cop, and one being wanted for murder to boot. Can a girl whose own grandmother is a better shot than she is actually succeed at catching this guy? Or will her $10,000 go down the drain?-Embyr Bradson (10/19/03)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"As the first in the series of nine (thus far), I found myself whizzing through the pages of this light-humored story. The ever-evolving tale takes place in Trenton, New Jersey, where Stephanie Plum tells the reader the story of her haphazard life, first hand. Stephanie Plum is the stereo-typical \\"Jersey girl\\" who recently has lost her job as a lingerie sales girl and finds herself working for her cousin Vinnie as a bounty hunter (of all things). Stephanie focuses most of her attention on apprehending Morelli, a cop gone bad, whom she lost her virginity to in her younger years and also somehow managed to run over shortly thereafter. Will she catch him or will he capture her??#1 Plum quote: \\"I ate frosted flakes for breakfast this morning. I figured if it was good enough for Tony the Tiger, its good enough for me.\\""},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money introduces us to Stephanie Plum and her outrageous family and friends. Stephanie is an out of work lingerie buyer. To pay her bills she becomes a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinny. He has given her one week to bring in Joseph Morelli-her pay, $10,000. Stephanie tries to learn the tricks of her new trade and catch Morelli in her one week time so she can earn her money and get her life back on track. Along the way the reader is in for one heck of a good, laugh-filled ride.This book is hilarious. I found myself literally laughing out loud. Stephanie falls on her face quite a few times (not literally) and has to pick herself back up. It is so funny to read about the situations she gets herself into. Her family is a real hoot too, especially Grandma Mazur. She definitely added some laughter to the story.One for the money is a good, light read. It is a little crude at times with some in your face situations and language. With that aside though this book is very entertaining and easy to read. Not a book for kids though."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"You won't be able to put it down (except to get the tissues to wipe away the tears of laughter!) and once you've finished, you'll race to find the next one. A fab series!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is the first of Stephanie Plum series. Who is Stephanie? She is a normal girl who becomes a bounty hunter(and not a good one, actually). Her first job is to get a guy of her past, with help from a professional black bounty hunter. The fun part of this series is that Stephanie has no qualification for being a bounty hunter! After I finished this book, I suddenly continue on the next ones!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first Janet Evanovich book that I read was High Five. I thought that Stephanie was such a believable character that I decided I had to read the series, in order. One For the Money is a wonderful little mystery that set the stage for those that follow. Along the same lines as the early Grafton books, Evanovich has created a female character who values her independence, stuggles to make ends meet, wants to be good at bounty hunting but usually falls a little short, and still has to rely on her mom, dad, and grandmother more often than she cares to admit. A fast read, uplifting, and just plain fun."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The lead character is a real kick in the pants. I can definitely recommend this easy-to-read and fun book about a semi-bumbling, attractive, novice detective to any and all. Great summer, lounging-around-the-pool, read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was the fastest moving decetive story that I have ever read. Stephanie is a down and out lacy pajama buyer who gets layed off from her job and doesn't want to tell her parents. She has to sell most of her furniture and her car gets repossed. Then her mom mentions that cousin &quot;Vinnie&quot; is looking for someone to do filing. Stephanie goes for the job, but finds it filled. So she blackmails Vinnie with family secrets to hire her on as a bail bond agent. From here the laughs just keep going. Stephanie is assigned to track down Joe Morelli a cop who is accused of murdering somone in cold blood. Joe is also a sexy as hell guy who stole Stephanie's virginity. She is out for revenge (and let me tell you that when she catches him he is madder than all get out). Add an abusive boxer who is after Stephanie, a car bomb that blows up Joe's new car, and some drugs and you have the makings for an interesting book. I can't wait to sit down and read the next book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"For once I'm glad I didn't read any reviews before I started the Stephanie Plum series. I'm a hard core detective, police procedural reader and have absolutely no interest in romance novels. I was surprised to read that Janet Evanovich was a romance writer at one time. But romance plays a minor role in these very fast paced and fun books. Stephanie Plum is such a likeable character and Evanovich wastes no time in getting right to the action in her stories. All the minor characters, most of which repeat in later books, are interesting and could be oddball people you know from your own neighborhood. I just love Stephanie Plum and plan to read the whole series currently in print before starting any other mystery books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great little book, when a book makes you laugh out loud and everyone asks, what, are you reading? it's good. Fast paced with unforgetable caracters, especially her Grandmother. I can't believe I never read Janet's books before. I just ordered another."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Out of curiousity and their bestseller status, I thought I would give Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series a try. Detective novels have never been my favorite genre, but the concept of an unemployed lingerie buyer turned bounty hunter seemed to hard to resist. As a transplanted New Jerseyan, it was also a treat to revisit some of the true characters that populate my former home state (stereotypes perhaps, but they get to be them for the reason). And Evanovich has created quite a cast of characters -- from our spunky heroine Stephanie to Joe Morelli (an troubled cop in a playful love-hate relationship w/ Stephanie) to Ranger (a mysterious fellow bounty hounter who often rides to Stephanie's rescue) and Stephanie's unintentionally hilarious family headed by scrappy Grandma Mazur. Needless to say Evanovich had me hooked and I quickly purchased &quot;Two For The Dough.&quot;"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I finally gave in to the hype, and started reading this series to see what all the fuss was about. I'm sure glad I did because One for the Money was one of the most enjoyable, laugh-out-loud, and fun books I've ever encountered. Stephanie Plum, the lead character and narrator of the story is a 30-year-old woman who knows a lot about hairspray and fingernail polish but little about the dangerous world of criminals. So how does she land a job as a bounty hunter? After getting laid off as a lingerie buyer, Stephanie finds her rent is overdue, her car is repossessed, and her refrigerator is empty. Perhaps cousin Vinnie has some clerical work for her at his bounty hunter business, her mother suggests. But when Stephanie finds out how much money she can make tracking down deadbeat thugs, she bribes her cousin into giving her a job skip tracing and embarks on her new career.Stephanie chooses to take on the hottest case in Trenton N.J. Find Joe Morelli, a cop accused of murder one. The problem is, Joe is no stranger to Stephanie. They've known each other since childhood and had some steamy moments together as teens. Joe knows how to push Stephanie's buttons, and as much as she hates to admit it, she finds him irresistible.The plot pounds along as you follow Stephanie through her ill-fated efforts to capture her man. There are plenty of screwball characters that cross Stephanie's path, and the story is full of offbeat comedy, hilarious one-liners, and sexual energy. As a Jersey born and bred woman myself, I can attest to the fact that Evanovich captures the Jersey essence and attitude brilliantly. If you like snappy dialogue, quick-wit, and non-stop action you won't be disappointed. Don't miss this one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Book reads quickly, humorous, not brain surgery but enjoyable nontheless!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"FROM THE CASE: \\"Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store). Stephanie needs cash - fast - but times are tough, and soon she's forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family...Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie's bail bonding company. She's got no experience. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice copy Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants, to the time Steph hit him with her father's Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water-wanted for murder...Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prize fighter Benito Ramirez isn't. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she'll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight - and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man...\\"This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum series. When Stephanie Plum loses her job, she makes every attempt to survive. She has hocked most of her appliances and furniture, and you think, what else can go wrong when her car is repossessed. What's a girl to do then? Well she does what any self respecting person, male or female, would do, turns to her cousin Vinnie for a job at his bail bond company.I found this to be an enjoyable book with a good plot and though you quickly develop some suspects, Ms. Evanovich doesn't give you enough information to definitely connect them to what's going on.This book was narrated by C. J. Critt, who has narrated other books written by Ms. Evanovich as well as authors such as Patricia Cornwell and R. L. Stein. Ms. Critt does a pretty good job with the narration; however, I thought that her attempts at doing male voices could have been better. It seemed to me that they all sounded pretty much the same. The only male characters that definitely sounded different to me were Morelli and Ramirez. I'm not saying that Ms. Critt did a bad job. On the contrary, she did a good job and brought many of the characters to life. She did an excellent job with the character Stephanie. Ms. Critt makes Stephanie Plum seem so real that when she reads one of her parts, you just know that she is saying it the way Stephanie would.There are many things about this book that I liked. Ms. Evanovich doesn't waste words on detailed descriptions of people and places. She gets straight to the point, and only gets detailed when necessary. However, though this is a good novel, it's not great, and at best is average. If you like the detective genre or mystery genre will like this book.I rated this book average (three stars). The reason for this rating is simple. Being one who commutes in a high traffic area and gets tired of radio stations with lame DJs and radio stations with to many commercials, I like to listen to audio books. When rating an audio book I base it on how much I was kept riveted to it. This book, though good and decently paced, didn't have me hoping to get stuck in traffic or not wanting to get out of my car at the office or upon arriving home.This book does have foul language and some minimal sexual content. Though not used on every page, when the foul language is used, it is used in spurts. If you are offended by this type of content, then this isn't a book for you.This book was nominated for the following awards in the category of First Novel; Agatha Award, Edgar Allan Poe Award and a Shamus Award.Below is a complete list of the awards Ms. Evanovich as been nominated for or won.AWARDS:NOMINATED:1995 Agatha Award One for the Money1995 Edgar Allan Poe Award One for the Money1995 Shamus Award One for the Money2000 Anthony Award High FiveWON:Ms. Evanovich has not one any awards for her writing.This is the second book by Ms. Evanovich that I am familiar with. The other book was, To the Nines which is another in the Stephanie Plum series. I think Ms. Evanovich is a good author and I am planning on listening to or reading other titles written by her. If you like the mystery genre or detective genre, then I recommend that you put One for the Money on your list of must reads.If you like authors such as Nancy Bartholomew, Sarah Strohmeyer or Anthony Bruno then you will like Evanovich.Give One for the Money a try, and happy reading."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've heard people rave about the Stephanie Plum series for several years.

Maybe they weren't deep, and they didn't have the answers to the mysteries of the universe, but they were so much fun.

I have read all ten Stephanie Plum novels and have enjoyed almost every one (the christmas one is not so great, only read it for the fact that it moves the character relationships along for To The Nines). I can't wait for the next. These were so good, I gave them not only to my mother but to my grandmother to read as well and they both loved them. All three of us being from New York and familiar with &quot;Jersey Girls&quot; makes these books that much funnier. Read these books. All of them. Well... maybe not the Christmas one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading Patricia Cornwell, James Patterson, Katherine Coulter's FBI series &amp; so on for years, I wasn't sure if Stephanie Plum could hold my interest when a friend insisted I read this book. However, I read it in 2 sittings, not wanting to put it down! Yes, it's a much lighter read than the other author's, but it's got a lot of humor &amp; fun.

But Stephanie Plum is a cute, spunky monster who's scared, fearless, independent, vulnerable, sexy, smart, ditzy, sophisticated, goofy, and a whole pizza box full of contradictions. But she's a lot of fun.Stephanie's a New Jersey girl who's out of work and short on possibilities. So she asks her cousin Vinny, a bail bondsman, for work. Right off the bat, Steph decides to bring in Joe Morelli, a man nobody else has been able to haul in. Of course, all she can see is the money it'll get her - $10,000.It's not quite as easy as she thinks. Stephanie's Nova just barely moves, requiring a quart of oil every 15 minutes. She doesn't have a clue about using a gun, tracking FTAs (Failed to Appear), or how to apprehend one if she finds one. Plus a boxer is determined to inflict a little torture on Stephanie...just for fun.Evanovich's first Stephanie Plum novel does a great job of introducing readers to Stephanie, her wacky family, friends, and life in New Jersey. Quirky, funny, and always entertaining, Evanovich has successfully kept the thrill in thrillers, the mystery in mysteries, and the fun in following a character we can really root for."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a laid off lingerie buyer for a store that just went out of business because of its shady connections.

The series starts off with Stephanie out of a job and desperate for money, so desperate she becomes a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie.All the characters are richly drawn and quirky--in a good way, Morelli, Vinnie, Rex, Mom & Dad, and Ranger. Stephanie's exploits and narrative keep me constantly entertained and amused. Her Grandmother seems drawn from the Maxine from the Hallmark cards! Still her grandmother is positively tame compared to other cohorts. The story line is also suspenseful and well written.All in all, a very enjoyable read. I have read 3 in this series so far and enjoyed the first one the most simply because Stephanie didn't have it together at all and was even more hilarious.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum's most vivid memory of anything sexual comes from her days as a child when young Joe Morelli looked up her skirt in his garage while they played train and tunnel. Then, after high school, they had a VERY brief fling on the floor of a bakery, Morelli leaving without saying a word. Stephanie wasn't happy about THAT. In fact, she was so upset that, when she spotted him later, she ran up on a curb with her car and pummeled Morelli, breaking one of his legs.Years later, we have Stephanie in a destitute position after losing the only job she could get as a lingerie buyer. She's hawking her furniture and kitchen utensils to help herself stay self-sufficient, away from her parents and the eccentric grandma Mazur. She's trying to find a new job, too (without much success).But then she's reacquainted with her cousin Vinnie, a bondsman. Stephanie is about to become a bounty hunter. Uh boy. And her first case: Joseph Morelli! Holy cr@%! Morelli, now a cop on the lamb, is accused of killing an unarmed suspect and has jumped bail. And if Stephanie Plum finds him, it's payday in the amount of $10,000! But Stephanie doesn't know anything about being a bounty hunter.Enter \\"Ranger\\", a bada$$ bounty hunter with years of experience. He finds Stephanie attractive and helps her out, teaching her about gun usage (which she is terrified of), and other ways of subduing suspects. Could she really shoot Morelli? She did run him over with her car that one time. Would shooting him be that different?Soon Stephanie re-encounters Joe Morelli and the sparks begin to fly. The passion they feel for one another is still palpable, but so is Steph's need to eat. Which will win out? You'll just have to read this fast-paced novel and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A lot of people recommended the Stephanie Plum series to me. I heard and read so many praises that I decided to give the first book a whirl. One for the Money starts out with the heroine's desperate need for cash. She has lost her job as a buyer at a third rate lingerie shop in Newark and is penniless and in dire need of a job. So she asks her cousin to help her out. She goes to sort out files and instead ends up with the job as bounty hunter for people who miss their court dates. Her first assignment is Joe Morelli -- her one-time lover turned murderer. She is unsure about turning in a childhood acquaintance to the authorities, but the $10,000 commission is too difficult to resist. Besides, she hasn't forgiven him for having sex with her and then forgetting all about her. So Stephanie sets out to find Morelli at all costs, even if it means going to the biggest ghettos in New Jersey, where she encounters many unpleasant things. Will she be able to turn Morelli over to the police? There are various twists throughout the novel.The good thing about this novel is the heroine's sharp wit. She is quite funny at times and the situations she faces have a mixture of suspense and dark humor. The story is fast-paced, the dialogue is crisp, and some of the characters are great, though ridiculously stereotyped and one-dimensional at times. The character I liked the most was Ranger. His street-smart manners and blunt quips made me laugh. The story is quite original, albeit frustrating when Stephanie has Joe right in front of her and does nothing to capture him or call the police. She gets into one stupid situation after another, and I just wanted to toss the book to the nearest wall when that happened. All in all, it was an okay read to me. I am not as enthusiastic about it as most of the reviewers here though. Maybe it's because I have the flu. I'll give Janet Evanovich's popular series another chance to impress me by reading the second installment."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'd heard great things about Janet Evanovich but never got around to reading any of her work. A couple of days ago I stumbled upon 6 of her Stephanie Plum novels and decided to take the plunge. I'm extremely glad I did.Stephanie Plum is a no-nonsense New Jersey girl with attitude. I'd go so far as to say she's the best heroine I've read in years. Out of work, out of money and pretty soon to be out on the street, Stephanie decides to go to work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie. With no experience in any form of law enforcement, Stephanie plunges in head-first without checking the water level. It's really delightful to see her come to terms with her new career and start to pick up the ins and outs of the business.From the minute I started the book I couldn't put it down. The writing is light and humorous, the plot is just sinister enough to be enjoyable without being melodramatic and the secondary characters are charming. Having just read the one book, I can already tell that Ms. Evanovich has a knack for shaping a story into something truly wonderful. I'm already itching to start the next in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's \\"One For The Money\\" is an exceptional mystery cum romance, with extraordinary humor, (guaranteed to brighten the darkest mood), and originality. Once I began to read this book, the first in a series, I could not put it down.Stephanie Plum, our heroine, is down on her luck, unemployed, divorced, sans money and car & culturally-challenged, being born and raised in Trenton, New Jersey. Hey, I'm originally from NJ, so I am allowed to say that! She does have the option to move back in with her parents, but the very thought of going home again causes her eyes to twitch uncontrollably. Steph's cousin Vinnie, an easily blackmailable sex maniac, owns a bail bonding company. Stephanie \\"persuades\\" him to hire her as a bounty hunter, novice that she is. Her first job - Joseph Morelli, who is FTA, Failed To Appear...he's skipped bail!Now, Joseph Morelli, a sexy hunk and ex-cop, on the run from a murder charge, and our Stephanie have a history that goes way back to childhood. When she was six years old and the precocious Morelli was just a few years older, he taught her to play \\"choo-choo\\" in the Morelli garage. When she was 16 she lost her virginity to Morelli on the floor of the Tasty Pastry Bakery, after working hours, and then didn't see him again for 3 years. When she finally did see him, 36 months later, hanging on the corner of Giovichinni's Meat Market, she ran him over with her father's Buick. He lived to tell the tale.Ms. Evanovich also introduces us to a cast of wonderfully outrageous characters who continue to populate her subsequent books: Ranger, a 2nd generation Cuban American, ex-Special Forces, creative genius of a bounty hunter...and also very hunky, especially when wearing his all black outfit with leather accessories; Ramirez, a psychopathic prize fighter who is too scary to be much fun; Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's maternal grandmother, and a pistol-packin,' roller blading clotheshorse she is! Fortunately, she is probably the majority contributor to Stephanie's gene pool; Lula, a 250 pound-plus hooker, who aspires to be a bounty hunter & is working on her resume; etc.And of course there's the mystery...because this is a mystery. But I won't spoil that for you. Just run to your local library, bookstore...or Amazon.com, of course, & get this chock-full of great reading gem of a book. Also, beware!! Janet Evanovich has 8 more Stephanie Plum books on the market to date, and you won't want to miss any of them - they're as addictive as a great belly-laugh!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book and had so much fun, I bought all 7 of her other books. Every one was a pure delight. I found that I had to store them in a closet and ration them out so that I wouldn't get addicted and forget to tend to the rest of my life. The main character in this book is kooky, fun, real, and just a complete trip to follow on her adventures. I loved all eight books in this series. Great reading for traveling or if you just want to get away while you are at home."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Love the witty personality of Janet Evanovich! I enjoyed the books so much I passed it on to my husband and he couldn't put it down either. I'm thrilled to have this author on my list!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"First book I have read by Evanovich. It was very good. Stephanie Plum is fired from her job and has no money. She hooks up with her cousin Vennie to be a bounty hunter. About like me trying to fly a plane. Very good fun to see her in action. She wants to find Joe Morelli, who she has know since high school. Joe is accussed of murder and has skipped his court hearing. Joe is an ex cop and may or may not be guilty. Along the way she comes in contact with Biento Raminez, a great boxer, who treats women like dirt and I would like to do him in myself. Stephanie does her job through many mishaps, and comicial situations. I like the characters of her family. I really liked Grandma Mazur. I think you will find the ending a surprise but good. The book will hold you attention. I keep thinking of &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot; even though there were in a different town. Will try to read the rest in order."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Oh my goodness, _One for the Money_ is one of the most hysterical books I've ever read. Stephanie Plum is one kicking chick and a total joy to read about. _One for the Money_ is so fast paced and addicting that I read it in one sitting. Janet Evanovich really puts all she has into her first mystery novel and it shows. The story line is unique, her main character, Stephanie Plum, is so well developed you can practically see her, and the suspense is masterful. One book is definitely not enough and I would suggest buying at least two more books in the series before starting this one because you will want to read these books as fast as you can. I just can't say enough good things about _One for the Money_ and the whole Stephanie Plum series. It's got everything you could ever want in a book/series. One amazing main character, spicy secondary characters, and a plot/ writing style so addicting you can't put the book down. Stop reading reviews about this book and pick up _One for the Money_! Right now!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My wife recommended this when I asked for something &quot;different&quot; after too much concentrated effort on the meaning of life and similar such fluff, which had reduced me to near certifiable lunacy._One for the Money_ had a some clever lines and some readability. I did want to know the resolution, even while it was becoming more and more obvious and boring.But, this isn't my genre. Elmore Leonard's _Out of Sight_ is my favorite here, and Evanovich's book doesn't come close, imo.Still, on that long flight when you really need to be sleeping but somehow can't manage it, there could be worse choices."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I received this book as a gift and am glad I did. I thoroughly enjoyed reading about Stephanie Plum as she takes on a new career as a bounty hunter. She is determined to bring in one special criminal and meets some interesting characters along the way. Janet Evanovich kept me interested and has won over a new fan. I gave my copy to my Aunt and bought another copy for my grandmother, both of whom are now looking forward to the rest of the series. I will be buying more Plum books!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I work at a Museum that tends to be very quite unless of course this one particular desk docent is working. I always heard bursts of laughter during her shift. I finally broke down and asked, &quot; what are you reading?&quot; She lent me the first in the Stephanie Plum series. Needless to say I ordered all the rest in one fell swoop because I didn\`t want to be wasting any time hunting each one down. The books are extremely funny. You can smell the low life the bounty hunter has to come in contact with. The real life that happens all throughout these books touches on daughter /mother guilt,generational gaps and the fact there are good people who just get mixed up in bad circumstances. There is enough murder mystery, who dunnit and a little bit of steamy sex to please everyone."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started reading this fast-paced novel on the train going home from work and missed my stop because I was so engrossed. It was a long walk home. In this book we are introduced to one of life's losers: Trenton resident Stephanie Plum, queen of angst. Desperate for a job, she becomes a bounty hunter. Not just any bounty hunter. The worst in the business. Stephanie Plum is one of modern crime fiction's truely great characters. Janet Evanovich's deadpan humour is drop dead brilliant. There's six books in this series, but do start from the beginning. There are many wonderful characters to be introduced, with their own stories to tell, including sometime stud and cop Joe Morelli, efficient bounty hunter Ranger and Stephanie's grandmother, to name a few."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's ONE FOR THE MONEY seemed rather formulaic in its approach to mystery novels. None of the characters seemed to really grab me and keep me intersted for very long, the story was rather unimaginative, and the plot not so much contrived as...well, unintersting to me.Janet Evanovich seems like a fine writer and her books are good brain candy, well worth taking into the tub with you or falling asleep to before you go to bed. But in all honesty, I'm quite surprised this book was recommended to me. There didn't seem to be much that differentiated the story or the characters. Nothing seemed &quot;fresh&quot; in the same way that, say Nevada Barr did with &quot;A Superior Death&quot; or Laurell K. Hamilton has in the fantasy-mystery cross-overs with her Anita Blake novels.It could just be that bail bonds are not my thing. But I suspect that it's a dependence on a formula that just doesn't work for Evanovich. I'll read more of her novels if they pass my way, but in all honesty, I'm not going out of my way to buy copies of the books in this series. And the ones I have so far, well, they'll go to the used book store along with the brain candy romance novels."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is on the job, and Trenton's never going to be the same.Plum, an unemployed department-store lingerie buyer, has turned to &quot;skip tracing,&quot; a.k.a. bounty hunting, more to keep the wolf from the door than from any burning desire to make Trenton a safer place. Plum is a Jersey girl through and through; she knows how to make her hair &quot;big&quot; when she wants to, she's unabashed about driving around town in a car with &quot;pussy&quot; graffitied on its sides, and she knows how to remove a distributor cap (the only way to be sure your car will still be in long-term parking at Newark Airport when you return from your trip). What she doesn't know is mostly everything about apprehending criminals.But Plum is a fast learner, and downright lucky. By the end of this first novel, she's gotten her man, in more ways than one. She's also rekindled her relationship with Joe Morelli, who took the Plum's plum, so to speak, as a teenager. Morelli, totally by coincidence, is her first FTA (bailbondsman lingo for &quot;Failure to Appear&quot;--in court, that is ). Locking Morelli in a refrigerated truck with 3 dead bodies goes a long way to settling the score. And the $10,000 reward doesn't hurt either.Among the lively cast of characters is Ranger, a fellow bounty hunter who gives Stephanie some pointers and steps in to help when needed. He's an enigmatic guy, but likeable, and I for one hope we haven't seen the last of him. Psycho/boxer Benito Ramirez fulfills the requisite creeposity factor. And then there's Stephanie's family--Grandma Mazur, an septuagenarian with the heart of a teenager; Mr. Plum, a retired postal employee who drives cabs mostly for refuge from his wife and mother-in-law; and Mrs. Plum, pot-roast-cooking mom who never gives up on trying to coax Stephanie to get a &quot;normal&quot; job and get married, like her other daughter (conspicuously absent from this debut novel). These folks are so eccentric that you'd swear that the author had been eavesdropping on your own family.Plum is a down-to-earth, self-deprecating, and witty heroine, and this first adventure tale will leave you both laughing and triple-checking the locks on your door. And maybe even wishing you lived in Trenton, where there's no shortage of good guys to tend to the crooks."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a fantastic book, although it should come with a health warning since you will experience pains in your sides from laughing so hard and your cheeks will develop permanent cramp from the constant smiling. This is a well written and very witty novel. I am so glad that it is part of a on-going series. I just love Stephanie Plum--she is so very funny and sassy. I guarantee that if you are looking for a good mystery that's easy to read with lots of humorous moments, this is a must read. I have just finished &quot;Two for the Dough&quot; and it is equally as sharp and witty. I highly recommend this book/series and hope that Janet Evanovich keeps them coming!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My sister kept bugging me about reading these Stephanie Plum books. I kept putting it off because I don't like these continuing private eyes, or their clones, which the mystery genre loves so much. Spenser I gave up on years ago, along with its writer, Robert B. Parker, for example! However, my sister kept talking about the humor, especially with the grandmother at the funeral parlor, and a whole assortment of other eccentrics in middle class New Jersey. Then she said the romance was pretty good too and different readers were on different sides of whether Stephanie should pick Joe or Ranger. &quot;And how difficult is each mystery to solve,&quot; I asked. &quot;Oh, that,&quot; she said, trying to remember what the mysteries were in the books. That pretty much sums up the series. I also like the pet rodent, Rex, although I prefer having a dog. Read them in order, starting here, or you'll have trouble making sense of things since it follows a chronoligical time frame in #s 1-6."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When I first read this novel I enjoyed it slightly. But by the end it left a bad taste in my mouth. It's not a terrible novel, and actually has some well-executed humor, an interesting story, and some likable characters. But I just couldn't stomach all the violence.I'm not against violence in fiction. I enjoy a good action film. I love monster movies where people get eaten by the handful and entire cities are destroyed. I liked \\"Pulp Fiction\\" with its strange mix of seedy lowlives, slapstick, and bloodshed. But even in these films the violence, though often graphic, is presented with a certain style that makes it palataple.Not so in this story. When people are hurt, they're hurt bad. And often. And in gut-churning detail. What happens to Lula the prostitute disgusted me. Not as a violation of women or as an unbelievable act, but because the writer felt the need to heap such abuse on her character only to make us understand how bad the bad guy is. Well, I'd figured that out by then. He could've just beaten her and raped her. (God, I can't believe I just typed that sentence.) The point is, the tortures Lula has to endure makes it hard to turn around and laugh in another scene anywhere in the book.I guess I just don't like books with graphic, excessive bloodshed and torture. And I have a hard time calling them \\"fun\\". So, hey, if that eliminates me from the Stephanie Plum fanclub, I guess I'm out."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The characterisation is perfect. Janet Evanovich (JE) doesnt turn her heroine into an expert bond agent in 20 pages or less. Stephanie Plum doesn't run around with guns blazing a la Dirty Harry from the word go. She's new in the bounty hunter job and it shows. She makes mistakes. Dumb ones too. Even better, she's willing to admit it. And that makes the story even more alluring. Seldom do we read of a protagonist who is not already an expert in his or her field. Of course JE has the luxury of a series to groom Ms. Plum and 'ONE FOR THE MONEY' is the best debut I've read for a long time and the best place to start the series (obviously, since its the first book...duhh). This way the reader can witness Stephanie's evolution from ditzy deadbeat to experienced agent as the series progresses.The fugitive she has to apprehend used to be the kid who took away her virginity when she was 16. Now Joe Morelli's a cop on the run, wanted for shooting an unarmed man. Her search for him quickly turns into an investigation into whether or not he shot a man and why.The book alternates between funny and scary. The funny part is when she has to go to dinner at her parents' in the \\"burg\\". Her grandma is just hilarious (she's even funnier in subsequent books). Watch out for the scene involving Grandma Mazur, a loaded gun and a roast chicken. If you dont laugh after reading that, you have no soul.The scary part is when she is stalked by a crazed boxer named Benito Ramirez. Benito likes to hurt women and he wants to hurt Stephanie the most. The gruesome scenes are when Benito tortures (and rapes?) a woman and forces Stephanie to listen and when he beats up Lula the prostitute because he saw her talking to Stephanie.This balance of light hearted and tense scenes make for a cracking read. Veteran bond agent Ranger, Vinnie the bail bondsman, his secretary Connie, Stephanie's parents and her grandma Mazur make up a great supporting cast and contribute even more to a wonderful series debut.Click on the \\"Add to shopping basket\\" button now."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Not one for following convention, I have just read the first of the Stephanie Plum series after reading the fifth, second and third (..in that order). Being greatly impressed with High Five, a trifle bit less impressed with Three To Get Deadly, and non-plussed with Two For The Dough, I was concerned that Janet Evanovich's series simply improved with each new Stephanie Plum novel ... and One For The Money might be a comparative dud. Glad to say, I was wrong.One For The Money is the first Stephanie Plum adventure, and we learn how Stephanie makes the unusual career change from a buyer at a down-market ladies underwear retailer to a bounty hunter. We also get to meet the lovable yet crazy people in her life, including her wacky family. Janet Evanovich keeps the one-liners flowing as we are treated to a very good little mystery where her ex-boyfriend cop is wrongly accused of pre-meditated murder. The sexual tension, always pervasive (yet not crude) in Evanovich's novels, is palpable ... to a very humourous effect.Bottom line: a great intro into charming world of Stephanie Plum. Guys, don't judge these Stephanie Plum books by their flashy, 'girlie' appearances. (The UK versions of these books makes it a downright embarassment for a guy to be seen reading them.)

Having never read one of her novels, a friend suggested I start with One for the Money- the first book in the Stephanie Plum series. This book was published in 1994 and a movie was made from it in 2011. The main character, Stephanie, is a down on her luck 30 year old divorcee from New Jersey. As a last resort after her car gets repossessed; she takes a job as a bounty hunter for her cousin's bail bondsman company. Hilarity and horror ensue as she tries to learn her new job and find and turn in a man (who she once slept with in high school) that is wanted for murder.

Stephanie Plum is ridiculously stupid, constantly putting herself in harm's way and being rescued by Ranger (ex-military bounty hunter who mentors her) and Joe Morelli, the guy she's trying to capture. Morelli's a vice cop charged with murder. He's also an old crush of hers and a ladies' man. Try as I might to hate him, he was the most interesting character.

There are some truly terrible books out there. This is not one of them.The author uses the perfect voice for her character. The plot is pretty good. The setting allows for some very funny scenes. There were parts of the book that made me uncomfotable, though I don't think Evanovich went into too much graphic detail.Overall, I think it was well written and funny. If you're looking for something thought provoking and deeply sentimental, this isn't it.

When reading most \\"mystery\\" novels it's the destination (e.g. \\"who did it?\\") that's the most important part. This is not true in the case of \\"One for the Money.\\" The book has a generic plot that allows you to easily figure out that things are not as they seem and it really doesn't take a smart individual to figure out how the book is going to end. However, that is not the point of this book. It's meant to be a fun (sometimes laugh out loud funny) escape into a world with outrageous larger-than-life characters, car chases, etc. The book reads like a combination of Jersey Shore and Dawg the Bounty Hunter. The book is fun-as-hell to read, but don't look for deeper meaning. Just enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I tried reading this book because i was always hearing how great it was. I could not wait to stop. This book is written for a fifth grader and is horrible. The plot would never happen and the violence is unrealistic and does not go with the rest of the story."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"First let me say that I've gone about this series all wrong. My sister was listening to these on audiobook from the library and told me one day that I just HAD to listen to one. So she let me borrow it and it was HILARIOUS! And completely in the middle of the series. I've since listened to books 15-17 (possibly even 14--I can't remember) on audiobook. I've reviewed Sizzlin' Sixteen and Smokin' Seventeen. But after watching One for the Money with Katherine Heigl, I knew I needed to start this series from book one. And so, that's what I did.I loved getting the backstory of these characters rather than just being thrown into the middle of the story. Morelli is much deeper knowing his history with Stephanie than just a Trenton cop. From the later books, I get the opinion of him just being a standup/normal kind of guy. But getting his history and him being wanted for murder and everything in this book, I get that there's more to him than that. He's even got a hint of the bad boy in him, which makes him all the more appealing. I also think he was cast perfectly in the movie version and Jason O'Mara is the perfect fit for him.I really thought they did a good job turning this one into a movie. The first half of the book was pretty right on with the book. And what differences were in the movie were acceptable in my opinion--knowing that no movie will follow the book exactly. Lula's casting was pretty perfect too (Sherri Shepherd), though I love the voice that Lorelai King (the reader in the later audiobooks) does for her even better.As always with the Stephanie Plum books, there's a phrase or two that catches my attention. While I didn't quite laugh out loud during this book as I have in some of her others, I still did find an appropriate quote or two.Morelli: \\"You can hold the flashlight next time we play train.\\"And Stephanie: \\"...there was nothing like packing a pair of cuffs to put some spring into a woman's step.\\"And so One for the Money gets 3.5 Stars. Check it out. If you've already read it, what did you think? Let me know."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Evanovich weaves a sordid tale with a hilarious heroine, Stephanie Plum, who has the tenacity of a bulldog and is incredibly and unapologetically self-aware. Stephanie is completely lovable, and realistic. Evanovich has a gift for description whether it's a person, place, thing, event or emotion, which makes the reader really experience Stephanie's world. Through these descriptions the reader is led to understand in an intimate way how Stephanie's oddball family, the communities of Trenton and her interactions with Joe Morelli shaped her. Stephanie's world supported by a cast of colorful characters - Lula(who gains importance as the series moves a head), wacky Grandma Mazur, and mysterious Ranger -takes on a living breathing life of its own.I would call this book dirty, but in really good way. There is nothing clean cut or pristine about it. This book is completely blue collar and I really liked it. Usually I'm more into the gentleman thief or savvy investigator type of stuff, but this book was great for the very fact it threw a normal person into odd circumstances and she behaved the way most normal people - with an extra helping of tenacity - would. I found it very refreshing, smart and sassy and I plan to move right along to the second book.

It's the start of a great series - how many other series keep you anxiously awaiting the next book after you've already read a dozen of them?"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book because of my book club. It was so hilarious! I laughed through the whole book and I was hooked. I am now reading book ten just two weeks after reading book one. They are fast and easy reads and many characters remind me of someone I know in my own life!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book started off pretty slow for me but got better after half way through. It definately wasn't the best book I've read but good enough to make me want to read the second one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read all nine of the Stephanie Plum novels plus the Christmas story. I have never had so much fun reading a mystery series than I have with these books. I truely look forward to #10. Her characters are wonderfully created and full of life and zest. If only my grandmother would have run around with Colt .45 in her purse. These are a must read for anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a good explosion on a regular basis."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is broke. She is desperate. Once she learns that she can make $10,000 as a bounty hunter, she decides to learn the tricks of the trade. Her first task is to bring in Joe Morelli, someone from her past. Now he's a cop accused of murder and presently, on the lamb. Stephanie learns the trade the hard way as we follow her foibles and mishaps, yet there is something endearing about her obstinate attitude. In search of Joe, she gets mixed up with a sadistic boxer, his manager, two call girls, and a butcher. Evanovich, the author, writes superbly with a tight plot and witty prose. A fun read that doesn't disappoint you!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I liked Plum, she is the antihero heroine, funny, different, a Jersey girl just trying to pay the bills. This was read in an afternoon and is a good book for an airplane or the beach but frankly I like Jamie Burke's books better. I will read the next one but probably not more. I am not quite getting the enthusiasm about these books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"i am an avid reader of james patterson's books but i decided to venture off and read a new author when this book landed in my hands. this book was a really quick read....the pages just kept turning. i couldnt put it down. the storyline just kept you guessing and wanting to read more. if you like this book then you should really read a book by james patterson!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"THIS WAS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTINGLY FUNNY MYSTERY NOVELS I HAVE READ IN A VERY LONG TIME.

THIS BOOK WAS SO GREAT I HAVE BOUGHT AND READ ALL OF THE SERIES AND I AM CURRENTLY WAITING FOR BOOK 10. I RECOMMEND THESE NOVELS TO FRIEND WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A FUN, EASY READ. HOPE YOU ALL ENJOY AS MUCH AS I HAVE!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A can't put down book! I've never laughed out loud while reading a book like this before! Stephanie Plum never gives up! I'm on to Two for the Dough next! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich writes one good book. It is funny and fast paced and an excellant read. be prepared, though- read one, you'll want to read them all!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Mysteries are so popular today, and there seem to be so many different styles. One author writes police drama, and another PI cases. And then there are the many \\"themed\\" mysteries including cooking themes, antique themes, Native American themes, etc. And then there is Janet Evanovich with her Stephanie Plum series, which falls into the \\"hysterical\\" theme!In One for the Money, we are introduced to Stephanie Plum. Stephanie lives in Trenton, NJ, was just laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, and is desperate for work. Through a series of threats and blackmail, she gets her sleazy cousin Vinnie (who owns his own bail bond company) to hire her as a recovery agent. Of course she is clueless about being a bounty agent, and is given an especially tough job right off the bat-bringing in Joe Morelli, a vice-cop accused of murder.The plot is a scream and it will have you laughing out loud (make sure not to eat or drink while you're reading). But the characters are what make this book, and they're characters that you could only find in Trenton! Grandma Mazur will have you in stitches. Also, while some mysteries showcase cops or PI's who are always on top of their game, Stephanie bumbles through her cases, which is probably more realistic in the long run. You will also enjoy the descriptions of Trenton-the row houses, the nosy neighbors, the stores, the big-haired girls in spandex, and especially, the food.So, if you want to read one of the funniest mysteries around, start with Evanovich's One for the Money."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm an author of serious non-fiction, but I enjoy reading light-hearted novels. This is as good as it gets. Stephanie Plum is absolutely hilarious. I started reading this series in the middle (number four) because a friend loaned it to me. After reading numbers four, five, and six, I went back to read the first one. They are all monumentally funny. It's sometimes embarrassing when I crack up and others around me can hear!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Growing up in New Jersey myself, I was thrilled to read about newly turned Bounty Hunter, Stephanie Plum, Hungarian-Italian from Trenton who previously worked for a lingerie company.Hysterical and witty and so much fun you will wonder as I did, where I've been all these years NOT reading this series!A friend of mine recommended this 11 book series (as of 2004) but I was a little skeptical, being that sometimes as you probably know, some 'comedies' tend to be 'unfunny.' Too much unbelievable action sequences and dialog that it makes you harumph and wonder what the author was thinking. I too thought this was one of this unfortunate group, but no way! This was one of the gems in the long, long line of comedy/action/mysteries. With a little romance thrown in for good measure, I enjoyed myself so much I went out and bought the entire series!This is the first in the famous 'Plum Series'. Aptly titled 'One for the Money,' we meet Jersey talking Stephanie Plum. Frizzy hair and big bones from her mother's Hungarian side (although her mother and grandmother have dainty gypsy bones is beyond her) she inherited the plow driving peasant build.Stephanie is a woman on a mission. Recently laid off from a job with a warehouse lingerie company, she is hurting for money. The solution? Her cousin Vinnie has a bail bonding business that does very well in Trenton and is looking for a filing clerk. Just the job she could use, but when she arrives, she is too late. The job's been filled. No worry, the assisant to Vinnie, Connie urges her to try Apprehension Agent...in other words? Bounty Hunter extrondianire.Vinne is NOT happy and soon tries to discourage her. Stephanie is not having any of it, this could get her an easy $10,000 bucks! All she has to do? Find and bring in Joe Morelli...former vice cop on the run for murder. There's a catch though...Joe and Steph have a past...a very steamy and volatile past.More problems arise when she confronted by a cranky ex-prze fighter who doesn';t like her snooping around in his 'nieghborhood' and the other Bounty Hunter called 'Ranger' who thinks Stepahnie is WAY out of her league.Not to mention her mother who thinks all she needs is to check out Macy's and become a makeover girl and everything will be okay, right after she goes home to eat...because God knows she just doesn't eat enough. Her grandmother seems to think bounty hunting is 'neat' and wants to know everything! Her father is just waiting for everything to get quiet so he can read his paper in peace.Funny funny funny...the mishaps this woman gets herself into and the things she encounters is just too much. Joe is [attractive] and very determined NOT to get caught. But yet, toying with Ms Plum has always been fun...he he heA great read not to be missed!

BALONEY.DON'T BELEIVE IT."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read all twelve of Janet's books in the Stephanie Plum series and I am absolutely hooked and am waiting for her latest book to be available in January of 2007. I never used to be an avid reader until I started these books. If you want some light reading that keeps you laughing at the antics of some of the characters these books are for you! I love the way Janet makes these characters seem so real."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book at the behest of a co-worker. She hyped it up as a humorous, quick and easy read.About 50 pages into the book, I got offended by the main character who was a \\"white woman invading a black man's gym.\\" I marked the page and continued to read hoping this would be the last time I read such a remark. Drudging on, the main character approached a man she was to append for skipping bail. The character says \\"Let's face it, how many bearded fat white men lived in this neighborhood?\\" I would have stop reading the book then. Unfortunately, I promised my co-worker to finish the book. So, I kept reading and highlighting. Other references included characters talking \\"ghetto\\" and traveling in areas where she was not welcome by her skin color. In the end, I marked over 10 despairing references toward Blacks and Latinos.This book is horrible. And, someone of us wonders why discrimination still exists. \\"Leisure\\" reading like this still perpetuates hate for a good laugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"AlL i CaN sAy iS tHaT tHiS iS tHe BeSt BoOk I hAvE eVeR rEad!!!

I am not amused by either junior high humour or violence against women. I found this to be a dreadul book with a sophomoric plot and a degrading, violent, abusive view of women. I did not finish it and will never read another book by this author. I stongly suggest no one else do so, either."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love these books!!! I have never found a series of books that i liked so much!!! Cant put them down!!!! Wonderful Wonderful Stories!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"It's probably unfair to the author to review a book without having finished it--but I can't get through this novel. I've read over seventy pages of the book, which gives the author more than a fair shake. The writing in this book is trite and hackneyed, the characters (including the heroine) boring and uninteresting, and the plot is just plain silly.The main character is a newly-minted bounty hunter named Stephanie Plum who finds her prey (twice!) within the first fifty or so pages of the book, but still allows him to slip through her fingers. Sorry, but my willing suspension of disbelief was a bit taxed by this book. Why couldn't the cops (or a more seasoned bounty hunter, for that matter) find the quarry? The fugitive was just hiding out in his own apartment when our heroine comes knocking on his door--not exactly a stretch. And why does the fugitive open up his door to her in the first place? Isn't he supposed to be running from the law?The scenes with Stephanie Plum eating dinner with her family are tedious. I suppose a grandmother discharging a firearm into a roast chicken might be sort of funny in a Ben Stiller movie, but not in a novel--not this one, anyway.I am not a literary snob. As Anthony Burgess once wrote, one should not disparage the well-made popular. As far as I can tell, the Stephanie Plum novels may be popular, but well-made they are not."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's, One For The Money takes place in New Jersey where Stephanie Plum lives. This woman basically had no money and no food to live off of. She had loving parents whom lived close by her apartment. She recently had been laid off from a lingerie store. Sadly she went home that night to her parent' s house for dinner. Where everything changed in her world when her mother made a suggestion. The suggestion had been that she should talk to her cousin, Vinnie who was in charge of a bail bond's man agency. Taking the suggestion made by her mother she went to Vinnie's office where she instead of filing papers was on her way to be an apprehensive agent. She got a case from Connie, Vinnie's secretary. The case dealt with a murder that a police officer committed. The police officer, being Joe Morelli was by coincidence the man who was the first to make her unclean. She signed a bond agreement that stated that if she turned Joe Morelli in she would receive $10,000.The money could tremendously help her out with paying her rent off. So off she went in looking for Joe Morelli who supposally had killed Ziggy Kulesza on purpose when arriving at Carmen Sanchez's apartment. Joe went to Carmen's apartment because she had called him of a police matter. According to Morelli it was in self-defense that he shot Ziggy Kulesza. At the scene they said there was another suspect who fled when the police had arrived. Not only did that suspect disappear but also did Carmen. Stephanie got more information on the case and met with Ranger Manoso. When discussing the case with him she figured out that Ziggy worked for Benito Ramirez, the champion of boxing. She went after Ramirez in hoping that she could get information for the case. When she went to meet him at the gym she had unpleasant attack on her and was saved by Morelli. A number of times after that she ran into Morelli and they had nice conversations but just could not arrest him. After meeting Morelli, many times they become friends. He made an agreement to her that she could have her money if she did not turn him in and prove him innocent. He also could protect Stephanie in case Ramirez tried to attack her again. Later through out the story she got many threatening phone calls and even an unpleasant view in front of her apartment. It was of a dead body that was brutally beaten by Ramirez. He was a sick man who liked to molest women. Stephanie again tried to confront him but this time ran into Jimmy Alpha who was in charge of Ramirez. He apologized for all the assault she had received due to Ramirez. Eventually she figured out who the missing suspect was and what had happened to Carmen. Stephanie figured all this out when she followed Louise to a marina bank post. There she called Morelli and they went on that dock and found Louise and Carmen's body dead. They found no evidence of the gun that Carmen and Louise were killed with. Ramirez and Jimmy did this all. She locked all of them into the refrigeerator including Morelli and turned it in to the police. Her check was for $10,000 was on her. She went home that day and ran into Alpha at her house that tried to kill her and finally explained to her the missing story. Jimmy Alpha was in charge of Ramirez who was in charge of Ziggy. Who with Louise the missing suspect killed Carmen. All of these people were involved with importing cocaine into town. Jimmy warned her that Ramirez was on his way to assault her again. At that point she felt confused about turning in Morelli because she kind of missed him and realized that he was innocent. Jimmy shot Stephanie in the leg but Stephanie pulled out her gun and shot him. Later she heard a knock on the door, it was Morelli. He was released of all charges and walked in with a box of pizza."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I work at a bookstore and Janet Evanovich was coming to do a signing. Our managers encouraged us to get familiar with the books. I have to admit, I am more of a literature reader than what I consider to be \\"fluff, beach reads\\". However, my one exception is Carl Hiaasen; perhaps because I am a native Floridian. I had been told Janet Evanovich was the female version of Carl, so I began One for the Money with high hopes of a truly humorous read. I honestly do not recall laughing once during this book. There was simply nothing funny about it. It wasn't even clever. It was poorly written as well. I view writing as a true art form and Ms. Evanovich's writing gave the sense she simply wanted to get through the book. Maybe I am being picky but writing that a character did \\"the breakfast thing\\" or did the \\"blow dry and hairspray thing\\" is boring and a short cut. I suppose I should be happy that at least she was trying to give some sort of description. I read \\"The Hour I First Believed\\" by Wally Lamb (quite a large book) in two days. It took me over a week to will myself to finish this one. I disliked Evanovich for the same reason I disliked the only James Patterson book I will ever read: writing is more than putting words on a page to tell the reader what happened. Writing is art, using words to paint pictures and create true experiences. Books are supposed to make you think. The only thought I had after finishing this book is I will not be reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Estremely sad for all the vulgar gutter language and poor taste of speech that added nothing to the plot nor story. The story could have been interesting otherwise but this depleted its message. I am saddened over ordering it and will not be reading any of her other books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am an avid reader of this genre, and was excited to begin a new series and bond with a new heroine. Unfortunatly the level of writing was poor, and I do not intend to read any more of this author's books. This book was written at a high-school reader's level, but with adult content. In my opinion a bad combination."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"It's like, fabulous. Stephanie Plum is entirely believable. I can relate to a woman who creates chaos where ever she goes. *Mental eye roll.* This is a fresh character in a fresh situation with some true zanieness thrown in. I enjoyed nearly every word (and the especially fine men -- *oh boy*)."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Well all I hear about is how these books are so great. Well I wasn't that impressed with it. The beginning was Pretty good and the ending was alright but the middle of the book, just plain ol boring. I heard the books start to get better after the first so hopefully they aren't as bad as the first."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After having this book recommended to me by, well, everyone, I decided to give it a chance. I must admit, I wasn't very interested with the description of the book (I'm not for the cute heroine-types) but I found the book to be very interesting. Despite what many of the reviews on here say, there actually is a plot, and something seems to be happening in every chapter that makes it such a page-turner.The disrespect towards women that some reviewers describe is definitely there (and upsetting) but isn't that what books are supposed to do? Give us a look into what can truly exist? Though Plum isn't the smartest lady, she does pretty well for the situation she is in and it's clear that she wants to learn as much as she can.I started book two right after I finished one, and am looking forward to reading more. The best thing about this book is that there is a series to continue to enjoy! :)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Ok, I'm hooked! I absolutely loved this book and can't wait to read them all!!! Stephanie Plum and all of the characters are hilarious!!!! Loved it!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Charged with a fast pace and tense atmosphere at the right moments, never weighed down by too cutesy antics but still rich with humor and warmth, this is a book I'd recommend to many. It did have flaws, though. Stephanie was right, maybe, in her end turnaround with Morelli and his 'problem', but it disappointed me a bit too. I know the villain had more at stake in the story than was let on, but I was still surprised to see his actual role, so that was a nice surprise as well.Violence is graphically described but not shown, so the squeamish should be fine reading through this one, while mystery hounds can rejoice, romance fans eagerly reading on. It's another book with a lot going on - Stephanie coming to terms with her loss of work, then finding another job that takes learning, fighting off the bizarre Ramirez, coming to terms with her relationship over Morelli, and the slightly abnormal family interference.Stephanie is definitely an unlikely heroine - as Morelli is a bit of an unlikely hero - and Ranger is an unlikely helpful assistant - but it all comes together in the end to work out in a pleasing, inventive manner. I highly recommend this novel to readers of nearly any genre, for it's guaranteed to bring both chuckles and warmth."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When I first meet the Stephanie Plum Serise, I was so intreged by what she went through into becoming a bounty hunter.

I wonder if she is real?"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was so funny I laughed out loud in several places. I bought a copy for a friend who doesn't like to read at all and she's up to number eight in the series now. The ditzy stephanie is a joy to read, but I think my favorite character is her grandmother. The whole dinner table scene had me laughing so hard I almost cried."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am completely addicted to Stephanie Plum! I read this book because it came highly recommended by a friend and I was not disappointed. I can't get enough of this series! I look forward to many more Stephanie Plum books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you are looking for a deep mystery thriller, this series isn't for you. If you are looking for a series to read that is laugh out loud enjoyable, then I highly recommend Stephanie Plum and her friends to you. Stephanie is down on her luck (and money) and talks (coerces) her cousin, Vinnie who owns a bail bonding company into giving her a job as a Bounty Hunter. This is the first book of the series and lays the ground work for each subsequent book. Evanovich's writing is smart and sassy and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend recommended these to me and I am passing on the wonderful books to the overseas readers."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was impossible to find in hardcover in local book stores, but Amazon came to the rescue!

The characters of this book were its strength - some were creepy, others intense, some were down-right scary, and some you really had to root for! The mystery of the book wasn't clear for me for a good part of the book but by the final third I put the pieces in order and was starting to think through the mystery along with Stephanie. The physical danger she was in, and the horrible abusive boxer really made me uncomfortable (good writing Janet Evanovich!) There was a twist that caught me at the end (I love that!). I will certainly seek out more Stephanie Plum books!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK, THE AUTHOR IS VERY GOOD AT MAKING YOU FEEL THE CHARACTERS ARE REALLY COMING TO LIFE IN THE BOOK. I WILL CONTINUE TO READ ALL OF THIS SERIES AND WOULD PROBABLY READ MORE FROM JANET."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you want to start the Stephanie Plum series, One for the Money is an essential read. In this novel, you get all the background information needed to understand the rest of books that follow. Janet Evanovich is very good about making sure the reader knows the major reasons behind some of Stephanie Plum's references, but here you get to see the transformation from unemployed Stephanie to bounty hunter Stephanie. It is very humorous."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Sometimes I like to take a break from hardcore detective stories and tearful literary masterpieces and sit back with a fluffy story that makes me laugh. This series fills the order nicely. I actually laughed out loud on more than one occasion and even a loud audible gasp that drew the question \\"What on earth are you reading?\\" Lots of fun here, but don't come into it with any expectations."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first in the Plum mystery series. To be honest, I don't read a lot of mystery books as I typically find they all seem the same. This one suprised me.The first, and I guess most important part of this book, is how is the mystery. It is good, not great but good. It isn't one that you can work the clues in your head and figure out, Evanovich doesn't give you enough information to be able to know who the real bad guy is. But, it is interesting and once you know \\"who done it\\" all the pieaces fit together.This story is more a narrative about Plums' life and adventures wrappend in a mystery, rather then a mystery itself. And what a story it is. The thing that brings me back to this book is the fact that it is funny, which you just can't beat. There are parts that have me laughing out loud, which doesn't happen often.The main character is a tough as nails marsh mellow, more or less. She is scared, out of her league, and out-gunned the whole book, but never gives up. As a character she is really endearing. Also she is really fleshed out and you can feel she is a complete character, if not completely believable. While many, if not most, of the side characters aren't give the same loving care, this is the first book of many in the series so they will eventually get much more background.If you like a fast, fun read or a light-hearted mystery, this book is for you."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Outstanding!If I were forced to describe Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, beginning with \\"One for the Money\\", in only one word, outstanding would be it. Evanovich has created a wonderful balance of crime/mystery and comedy with a heaping helping of romance mixed in as well.Stephanie Plum is determined, if nothing else, and no one or no dumpster will stand in her way of collecting the cash prize for turning in a wanted bail jumper. Question is, how does an out-of-work woman with no experience in catching criminals perform such a feat?Prepare yourself for a wild and hilarious adventure. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This whole series is great, I become so engrossed while reading that people will talk to me and I dont even hear them.

Plot quick and simple with coming events one after another and fast resolution. This book will not offer you a whodunit, nor a true crime with grizzly discoveries nor impressive twist and turns. Every other word Stephanie is cracking a joke. If you want to laugh out loud for a while go ahead and get it, if you want to think, better look for other authors."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was told I couldn't find this book used. I did and I loved it. Lots of fun to read. Now I see why it's hard to find used."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet's story of how Stephanie Plum becomes a bounty hunter after losing her job as a lingerie buyer is laced with her characters' colorfulness, a close knit neighborhood and the idiosyncrasies of her opinionated family. Humorous asides of these characters kept me chuckling while I followed the plot like a donkey after a carrot!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I don't get it. You have a continuing series, you need a continuing narrator to go along with the series. Lori Petty IS Stephanie Plum. I even see her in my head when I read the books!All the characters come alive in their own way. Especially Grandma Mazur and Stephanie. Even Morelli sounds cute in Petty's voice. And I'm not a huge fan of her movies, although I don't hate them.BOTTOM LINE:Listen to the first three (I believe) audio books read by Lori Petty. After that, just read the books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is down on her luck, lost her job, lost her car, sold most of her furniture and small kitchen appliances so she can eat and maybe out on the street unless she can come up with some quick cash. At dinner one night at her parents, she finally tells them that she lost her job. Her mother the eternal fixer of problems, tells her her cousin Vinnie is looking for a filing clerk. It turns out that cousin Vinnie is a bailbondsman and the job has already been filled, but Vinnie's secretary, Connie, tells her she can make a quick $10,000. All she has to do is bring in a FTA (failed to appear), who just happens to be someone from her old neighborhood, Joe Morelli.Joe also happens to be a cop who is accused of murdering a suspect, who was thought to be unarmed. He is trying to clear his name and avoid the cops and Stephanie as well, who keeps stepping on his toes as she conducts her own investigation.Stephanie is new to the bountyhunter game and is learning as she goes, she does get help from another bountyhunter, Ranger, who is top in the field. He helps her get set up with the right equipment and gives her tips.As she investigates, there is more to the story than first thought and she and Morelli have to team up if they want to stay alive.All in all this was a great book that I could not put down. I can't wait to start reading the second in the series to see what Stephanie gets herself into next."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum goes to work for her cousin, Vinnie, as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment, worth $10,000 is to bring in Joe Morelli who is a cop accused of murder. She and Joe have a past (fleeting though it may be) but she is determined to bring him in. She runs into him quite a bit but he doesn't &quot;let&quot; her catch him. The characterization is great and there are a few laughs. I have read the whole series and they only get better and better and laugh out loud funny. This is one of my favorite series. Stephanie and Joe's relationship alone will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the money is an excellent book. I really enjoyed reading it because I liked the idea of a sometime ditzy female bounty hunter. Stephanie Plum is the main character in this story, andshe also narrates it. The story was more immediate because of Stephanie's first person narration. Early in the story we learn that Stephanie was laid off from her lingerie buying job, her car was repossessed, and she has had to sell most of her furniture to make the rent. She finds a job, only because she blackmailed her bail bondsman cousin Vinnie to let her work as an 'Apprehensive fugitive agent,' a modern day bounty hunter. Her first assignment is to find Joe Morrelli, a guy from her past that she ran down with a car, in revenge (when Stephanie was 16 Morrelli charmed her out of her virginity, and he never called her afterwards). After Stephanie finds out that asking Morrelli to come with her does not work, she seeks the aid of Ranger, a big, tough bounty hunter. He teaches her a lot of things and gets her a gun (which she is scared to use). Stephanie is a tough girl; she takes a beating, but does not givbe up. When she takes the job, she was only thinking about geting the $10,000 for bringing Morrelli in. However, by the end of the book Stephnie wants to bring Morrelli in because of events that happen throughout hte story. Stephanie is determined to get her man, no matter what may happen to her. Evanovich has made an excellent character in Stephanie Plum. I think that most women would like to be Stephanie because of her attitude an her courage. How many women do you think would even consider taking such a dangerous job."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I bought this book almost totally oblivious of what it was really about. I started reading it one afternoon and read almost non-stop till one in the morning...by one in the morning I was pretty well into the plot and was so scared that i was basically up the rest of the night. Stephanie Plum got my attention right away. She was funny and not to over the top to be unbelievable. I thought the whole &quot;bounty hunter&quot; thing was pretty awesome, almost like a female James Bond. I loved this book so much and thought it was so funny that as soon as I was done I bought the rest of the series...I'll never be tired of Stephanie and her wide range of friends...now that I know better than to read them at one in the morning."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I laughed out loud so many times reading this book, it is one of my favorites! Although it plays into a lot of the NJ stereotypes, it's not done with malice and for those of us who live here, we know that a lot of it is actually true. (We ALL know people who resemble some of the characters in the book!)But you don't have to be from NJ to love this series. I've read all the books so far, and I haven't gotten tired of the characters, as I have with some other mystery series. The dialog is sharp and witty, and all of the characters are distinctive. Stephanie Plum is an enjoyable character, and Morelli and Ranger are simply to die for. The mystery is good, too. This author was recommended to me by an in-law of a relative of mine, and I give thanks for the day that happened!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is 30 years old, unemployed, and just had her sportscar reposessed. She's applied for every job there is in her field, buying cheap lingerie, and finally ends up working for her cousin Vinny (I couldn't help laughing at the reference to the movie by the same name) as a \\"recovery agent\\".The book tells the story of Stephanie's crazy exploits when she's tagged to bring in Joe Morelli, a person she vividly remembers from high school, who's also skipped bail on a murder charge. She figures it'll be easy work if she just finds him, asks him to come to the police station, and collect her fee. It turns out not to be so easy.I loved the descriptions of her family, especially her mother and grandmother, which often had me in stitches, laughing so hard I was crying in some places.I haven't laughed so hard while reading a book since I was reading Beverly Cleary books in the 3rd grade! And I can't wait to read the other books in the series, because I know I'll be laughing all the way!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I thought that this book was hysterical. Fast read and could not wait to get my hands on the next Stephanie Plum book. I hopeful that we see where Stephanie and Joe go with their relationship. I like the mystery and light touch of romance."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you want a quick read, fun that will make you laugh it is this unpredictable accidental Bounty Hunter, I bought the first 4 to go on vacation, now coming back to get the rest."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first 2 books in this series will not disappoint! Great light reading. Sexy, funny, suspenseful!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have long been a fan of Sue Grafton's series but after reading \\"S\\" I knew I needed to move on. A co-worker recommented Janet Evanovich and I LOVE HER! I started reading the first pages of \\"One\\" on Monday and less then a full week later I am already beginning \\"Three\\"...I absolutely love her writing. I have laughed out loud several times and find her writing fun, witty and real. I recommend this book to anyone, especially anyone who enjoys Kinsey Millhone's character in the Grafton books. I have totally switched my focus to the number series! LOVE IT! :-)~Vanessa Aprilliano :-)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked up this book because I had read good things about it here on Amazon. I had just finished one amazing book, and one pretty good book by different authors and I was hoping Stephanie would keep the winning streak up. At first I found this book rather slow moving and a little boring; even though there's action it didn't seem to be going anywhere. But stick it out, at about the middle things really pick up and its a rollercoaster ride till the end. I was delighted by the characters (my favorite being Morelli), liked Stephanie's style and new resolve, and found her capture to be absolutely hilarious. I am now excitedly awaiting the second book. If you're looking for a funny, exciting read; go with Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Start with this premise -- a woman working a man's beat, who thinks about sex about as often as a guy, and who is petite and feminine to the eye. Stephanie Plum, the New Jersey bounty hunter who we meet in this book, is many a man's dream. And, she watches television sports, eats cold pizza, and drinks beer at almost any hour.Between pugilistic encounters with a tough has-been felonious latino boxer, and trying to catch up with a Don Juan (Italian style) detective who is her best friend and enemy in her newly encountered second career, Plum gives us barrels of laughs with her insightful thoughts -- which we guys do not always know about as women do not tell us things -- even after eating cold pizza and drinking long necks in the a.m. hours with girls like her (or if there really were).My wife found her tirades and conquests too physical and confrontational. To me, it was just about right. If you are to read the next 10 books, you have to read this in order to learn the characters e.g. what they are made of and what makes them tick.If the book is too violent, skim the noncharacter parts and commence book two. Proceed forward. Most of the rest are less violent, and some have a lot less thinking about the hoochie coochie. She just does the hoochie coochie. You know, the kind of thing people like my wife like to read.Next time you are in the airport, and need a book to read, try this and you will be hooked. Before you know it, you too will need to read the next 10."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After finishing 10 BIG ONES, I needed another Janet fix. Dug up my copy of One.....and sat down to enjoy all over.Just as funny the second time. Loved seeing the crew again. Ranger was great and Joe Morelli was SO good. The scene with Steph handcuffed to the bathtub and Ranger rescues her...... Ya gotta love it.This series is a hoot. All funny characters to be followed all the way thru. Just one good time! It's a feel good book without being sappy. Waiting for her newest....."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book had me hooked from the first page. I had read the first couple of pages online at this website, and I was very impressed. The story was funny and catchy.When I finally received the book in the mail, I couldn't wait to get started on it again. It was so hard to put the book down. I could have read it in just one sitting if nothing else was going on.I have already ordered the rest of the books in the series, and I can't wait to continue the adventure with Stephanie.Stephanie Plum is spunky but smart. She has a great sense of humor, and you can't help but envy her attitude and perseverance throughout her struggles in the book. She draws you into her life, making you want her to succeed. Stephanie is one of those girls that you could hang out with at a diner, and someone that you would want to be friends with. That's what makes this book work.Stephanie is not the only character in this book. She is also joined by her quirky family, some good friends, and a crazy boxer. Even though not all of the characters are large in the story line, they contribute so much to the book with their annoying habits and hilarious backgrounds. It makes meeting new people such a joy to read about.Well, I loved this book, and I hope that people would try and read it once because I believe that this story has something for everybody hidden in the pages. If nothing else, it will definitely make you laugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"You will fall in love with Stephanie Plum! She's a hard headed, smart mouthed, witty babe packing more attitude than you could imagine! This book is absolutely hilarious! It's fast pace keeps you turning pages! A very entertaining read!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a great book. I laughed and then I would be scared something bad was going to happen. Definitely kept me on edge!! I love it!! Can't wait to see the movie."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I liked the One for The Money so much I'm going to read the entire Stephanie Plum collection. I'm already on the forth book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I absolutely loved this book, and it hooked me on the series. Thank goodness two friends of mine had started reading the books and loaned some to me! I can't believe I missed out on Stephanie Plum until now. My only concern is that with 18 books in the series, at some point I'm going to be disappointed! It's got to be hard to hit it out of the park 18 times, but I'm up to book 4 (my favorite so far) and Janet Evanovich has nailed it every time. Her writing is witty, the characters are great, the sexual tension between Stephanie and her ex Joseph Morelli is well written and jumps off the page. Evanovich is now one of my favorite authors, and she's created an extremely lovable main character in Stephanie. I hate that the movie got poor reviews, it was a chance to bring this story to a wider audience including men who wouldn't read a first person narrative of a female character. If you heard the movie was bad or saw it and didn't like it, do not make the mistake of letting it turn you against the books before you try them."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Hilarious book! You will love Janet Evanovich's characters! It is definitely a laugh out loud read! Read before viewing the movie."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A great book and wonderful quick read.

The movie was very good too everyone should watch it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Book was an entertaining and easy read. Her characters are interesting and I felt like I had a real fee for them quickly enough to keep my interest. I normally like things with a little more adrenalin but this book was good and kept moving at a reasonable pace."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I first read Sizzling Seventeen and loved it. I decided to go to the beginning and read One For The Money. Being a\\"Jersey Girl\\", I connected with the author's New Jersey connection, but aside from that, the book was a gateway to Stephanie Plum. Now, I want to read all of them."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I ordered this book via Kindle so it was immediately available. The book was excellent - a really fun read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A very entertaining idea. The book is filled with interesting characters that you want to know more fully. I will probably be ordering more Stepanie Plum books in the future."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this one so much I went right out and bought the next in the series. The lead character -- bounty hunter Stephanie Plum -- is one of the most original and fascinating protagonists I've read so far. She's funny and tough at the same time, and Lori Petty &quot;plays&quot; her to perfection. I can't imagine a better reader for this book. I just wish it had been unabridged!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book last week and was thrilled to find a new author I like. I'm a big Sue Grafton fan and I found Janet Evanovich's style to be quite similar. I read some of the other reviews on this book and can't understand all the comments about portraying women in a negative light. I found Stephanie Plum to be a strong female character. The reality is, this is a murder mystery type series and in murder there is violence. I think it's a great book and recommend it to all mystery fans"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It was so funny, I found myself laughing outloud. I would recommend it to anyone and all of the books in this series. Some of you people just need to lighten up and enjoy this for what it is--a fun read!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"OMG. I love these books. I picked my first one up at the airport waiting for a flight...unfortunately it was 12. But as soon as I finished it I ran out and got the first ones and now I can't put them down. Stephani cracks me up how she continues to find these people that no one else seems to be able to do....and still gets the guy. Great books. Jeez just read them for fun and stop taking everything so seriously. Don't think the author really meant for it to be taken in a racial manor...lighten up!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Having seen the popularity of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum mystery series, I decided to try the first book, One For The Money. It was readable and cute in places, but not interesting or fun enough to entice me to read any more in this series.Stephanie Plum, Evanovich's protagonist, is thoroughly likeable and accessible. She is firmly middle class, sometimes straddling blue and white collar segments. Although Plum is planted in Trenton, NJ, I (firmly planted in Houston) could easily relate to her sensibilities. There are enough regional references to keep the characters and setting from being anonymous or generic and to make the story appealing to a wide range of readers.Still, I found the plot terribly forced, with way too much beginner's luck for Plum (in her first assignment tracking down people who jump bail). There are enough calamities that pop up to keep the story moving, but Stephanie always seem to get out of these scrapes by the occurrence of some minor miracle.It's a quick, easy read and worked well for me while on the exercise bike. Would probably be good for bus/train/carpool commuters as well.WARNING: the edition I read contains several pages at the back of the book which give previews of the next books in the series. If you DO choose to follow this series, be forewarned that these pages give some details you might regard as plot spoilers!!Don't look for me to be reviewing any more in this series: I'm off to enjoy some Harlen Coben and Michael Connelly mysteries now!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a great read, couldn't put the book down!

It is interesting, funny, and entertaining. I cannot put it down!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I saw the movie when I was about 1/2 way thru this book. As usual book is better than the movie. Once I got started I couldn't wait to read the next in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read these years ago but they are wonderful. I can't always tell which story was which by just looking at the cover a I read them all back to back. They were always addictive and laugh out loud funny. I didn't read this particular book, I read the one with the original cover but can't seem to find that one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved ONE FOR THE MONEY!! The characters are interesting, and the writing style is snarky and very funny. I like the fact that the book is engrossing, but not such heavy reading that you get bogged down and bored. Also, I read it in two evenings, and now I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series! TWO FOR THE DOUGH, here I come!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the money is a funny read! You will fall in love with the characters Evanovich introduces in this book. Stephanie Plum is hilarious and can't help but want to read more! I read this book during the summer and found myself reading through all 12 books in the series! Evanovich gets you hooked from book 1. If you have any doubts about reading this book, Don't you will enjoy them. The Stephanie Plum novels are meant to be an easy and fun read, and are no literary masterpiece. Take them for what you will and enjoy this truly hilarious and worthwhile series!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"In 'One For the Money', Janet Evanovich first introduced Stephanie Plum, the perennially down-on-her-luck, but on the edge of making positive changes in her life, semi-tough New Jersey gal. Here she first gets hooked up with her own cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman. Vinnie tries, but he can't keep Steph in the office and she is soon out on the tough Jersey streets apprehending some pretty dumb cons on the lamb from their legal appointments.Her main target, however, is Joe Morelli, an allegedly, as they say, bad cop (and school days 'lover' from Steph's childhood). The reader also meets the mysterious Ranger, a dark, handsome, and much more accomplished 'apprehension agent'. You also meets the Plum family, in particular neurotic mom.Quick, fun and easy read for lovers of the detective story genre. Evanovich is still churning out the Plum novels - she's up to twelve, so if you like this one, you've found a friend in Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I haven't laughed so much while reading a book for a long time! This book is full of great characters that are fun to read about. I first got the recommendation to read the Stephanie Plum series a few years back from a clerk at the book store after she caught me picking out romantic suspense, but I tend to read more from the \\"romance genre\\" so I waited awhile before trying. I've only read two in the series so far, and so far the developing relationship between Plum and Joe Morelli sure is pulling me in. This is a great book for readers who enjoy laughing, a mystery, and a bit of romance."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Really GREAT book! Action Packed! twists and turns.. I highly recommend. Very whitty style of writing. I am exctied to get on with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"With a .38 Smith and Wesson and Sure Gaurd defense spray, Stephanie Plum hunts down FTAs in a career no one anticipated---Now she's a bounty hunter, and she's on the hunt for Joe Morelli for 10% of his $100,000 bond. However, while pursuing Morelli, she makes some new and unwanted enemies, and the case takes a very unexpected turn.Janet Evanovich is pure genius! Never have I seen an author create such a hilarious character. Stepanie Plus makes us laugh so hard in this exhilirating novel, that it has the potential to bring tears to your eyes. I suggest reading this indulgent book after a nice bowl of chocolate ice cream :) This series is seriously addictive!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have seen this series around for years, and not being a big mystery reader, I have avoided it. But when I finally checked \\"One For the Money\\" out of the library, I got hooked by page one! These books are just so funny! They are also filled with adventure, and a form of romance which I can actually stomach. Stephanie is really fun. She is goofy and funny, but some of the predicaments she gets into (having to pawn everything she owns and buy a really nasty car) are pretty realistic, so the reader can relate. Her family is hilarious. Her boyfriends are sexy and exciting. Janet Evanovich is a former romance writer, but it doesn't show in this book. Coming late to this series, I got the treat of gobbling up eleven of these books in a couple months. My advice: read all of the Stephanie Plum books, but stay far, far away from the romance books by Janet Evanovich which are being re-issued due to her success as a mystery writer. They are rank."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"OK, so this book is hardly literary heavy-lifting, but it's a great light read. The characters are entertaining and the plot takes interesting twists. It's a great book to pick up at the beach or for a morning commute. And I certainly plan to read more of the Stephanie Plum adventures! Oh, and I grew up near Trenton NJ and worked there for a while, so I love that the author uses real streets and places from around the county!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is literary fluff at its finest. Nothing deep and heart-wrenching here. Instead, it's a refreshing, fun swim in shallow water. Peppered with plenty of humor and with the knowledge our heroine, Stephanie, never seems in any REAL danger, we enjoy her balls of brass, her family and \\"colleagues\\", and hope for an equal quantity of lighthearted entertainment in the rest of this series. Three books later, I haven't been disappointed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have always loved to read but typically don't spend much time doing it as I get so addicted that I neglect all of my other duties. Recently I had the opprotunity for some free time to read this book. From the moment I opened it I could not put it down. I finished it later that day. Since then I have read all eleven, and each one in less than 24 hours. I am not bragging but just warning you that once you begin this series you will be addicted and unable to stop.Each character draws you into their psyche and makes you want to see them more and more.I am currently waiting very impatiently for the next book in this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I just recently picked this book up because SO many people read/have read them and talk about how good they are. I really enjoyed reading about Stephanie Plum's (mis)adventures as she starts her career as a bounty hunter. The relationship between Stephanie and Morelli contributed an offbeat romantic storyline and the Benito-Stephanie plot was very suspenseful and full of surprises.A few things were a little cliche, but not to the point that I wanted to stop reading the book. If you like mystery/crime novels and want to get into a series, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie does get herself in some great messes, but can figure out how to getherself out!

As is turns out, not much. Mild wisecracks, &#34;quirky&#34; relatives and &#34;you-gotta-be-kidding&#34; situations are thrown against the wall to see what sticks As it turns out, the only thing that happened was two crimes: I was robbed and my time was killed."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the MoneyEntertaining and funny. Kept me wanting to read more. Pretty good light book for the beach."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Although it makes sense that Stephanie wouldn't be an awesome bounty hunter immediately, I didn't enjoy reading about an incompetent heroine any more than I liked her being interested in the jerk who slept with her then left her. Obviously, I wasn't too fond of our leading man either. Without having a character to really relate to, what got me into the book was the humor. Stephanie is a little clumsy and very snarky, both traits which lead to some funny moments. And her grandmother is one of the quirkiest characters I've read about in a long time!The plot was surprisingly complex for something I would describe as the book equivalent of a soap opera. There's a compelling mystery to solve and you're given enough information that you can work on solving it. There are also a couple of side plots as Stephanie completes odd jobs to make money while pursuing Morelli. Along the way, a decent number of the supporting characters get very well developed personalities. The reason I would categorize this book as mental junk food, despite the quality of the plot, is the writing. Not only is the writing itself nothing special, the information included in the book is often more graphic than necessary. It frequently feels like the author is going out of her way to entertain the reader with unnecessary sex and violence.However, I'll admit it - I like junk food and I liked this book, enough that I've also read the second one. I did read it hoping for a little bit more though, and all I discovered is that the series seems a bit formulaic. Between the similarity in the plots of the first two books, the unlikable main characters, and the rather crass writing, I won't be reading another. There are just too many other books for me to spend time re-reading the same only-acceptably-good book over and over again."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Note if you watch the movie 1st do not expect the book to be a lot like it and vs versus.

There was more to this story than I was expecting. It did have some funny moments but it had more depth than I was expecting. The main character Stephanie Plum was great. A real do it yourself go getter. And her grandma was hilarious. I will read the next one."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I do not think I can push to read this any longer, I mean jeez book 17 is out, its a sign that I needed to read this now. I am glad I did, it is a nice break from supernaturals and YA fictions. I was wrong about Stephanie Plum, I was under the impression that she's been a bounty hunter since the beginning and that she has all the martial arts training and kick ass female bravado, so I was so surprise that she is a newbie. The characters in this book, man they are either weird, funny or scary, especially Ramirez, there are no words to describe how horrifying his character is. I think I've been reading too much YA because I got a little shock in the choice of words and environment that Stephanie lives in.Mama Plum and Grandma Mazur is just too funny. While Mama Plum's meddling is intolerable but it gives me great entertainment to read it. I am so impressed with Stephanie. She is funny and witty. I am looking forward for more troubles she gets herself into."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The characters in this book are what make it so charming. The first couple of pages describing how Stephanie met Joe when they were kids sets the tone for the whole story. If it makes you laugh, you'll love the book, if it offends you, read no further."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first Stephanie Plum novel blew me away with the humor. Now I've read them all. Try Janet Kole's Suggestion of Death for a similarly amusing mystery.Suggestion of Death"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My first ( Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum) book I purchased was \\"Four to Score\\".I knew nothing about the author or the story. I read the first 2 or 3 pages and could not stop laughing... I was instantly hooked.After I finished \\"Four to Score\\", I got on Amazon and ordered the first three \\"Stephanie Plum\\" books.Before I finished those, I was ordering several more.These Stephanie Plum books are like potato chips. You can't eat just one.Unless you have no sense of humor, or are dead.... These books will make you laugh.Well written fast paced stories... filled with wacky scenarios... wonderfully strange people (and animals) .... and pinhead or psycho murderers.theses books are a treasure!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A fun, fast-paced detective/thriller. The main character, Stephanie, is very real, giving us a great reminder of the suburbs in the 80's. Evanovich uses humor throughout the book to lighten the many depressing and frightening situation Stephanie gets into. If there is a complaint about the book it is that sometimes the situations are so awful that the humor seems out of place. Still, if you are looking for a great escapist book, this would be a superb choice."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you ignore the inconsistancy errors, I hate poor editing, it is a good book. Some htumor was right on mark. But the publisher has the books priced too high. Otherwise, I would be on boolk two now."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I'm going to start with what I liked about this book first:Morelli and Ranger are delish, Stephanie is quirky and fun, Ramirez is just plain scary, and Grandma is hilarious! The plot grabs your attention, and the one-liners are the best!I'm going to start with what I liked about this book first:Morelli and Ranger are delish, Stephanie is quirky and fun, Ramirez is just plain scary, and Grandma is hilarious! The plot grabs your attention, and the one-liners are the best!Now for what I didn't care for:There's a saying in the writing community: Show, don't tell. It means the author should \\"show\\" the reader what is going on, lead them through the journey. The author shouldn't \\"tell\\" it to where there's a disconnect and the reader doesn't get involved, or experience it.I can honestly say, this is the first time I found myself wishing an author would toss that rule right out the window. Just TELL me nothing is going to happen instead of showing me. Chapter after chapter, I read the most detailed descriptions and play-by-play action of...nothing. Nothing to move the plot forward, nothing that has any bearing on the scene, nothing but the protag spinning her wheels (she was bored out of her mind, and so was I). It got tiresome, and made it very difficult to forge forward. But I kept after it because everyone was clamoring about what a great book it was.In the end, I DID enjoy the overall story. My only piece of advice: Cut out all the \\"nothing happened\\" descriptions. You'd be left with a book the size, but it would be an excellent read!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum series. Now, I normally shy away from crime books, but my aunt has been trying to get me to read this series for years, and so I finally picked it up after seeing the trailer for the movie. All I have to say is WOW.Stephanie Plum is amazing! She's smart mouthed, funny, and clumsy. She's extremely easy to relate to! She is newly divorced, and recently laid-off. She's in desperate need of cash, and so she seeks out a job at her cousin's bail bond company. As luck has it, one of the bondsmen recently came down ill, and so she weasels her way into the position.Reading about her trying to learn the ropes is hilarious. She's afraid of her gun, and completely out of her league with this job. The secondary characters provide great laughs as well. You have Ranger, who is another bondsman for Vinnie, Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's grandmother who provides great comic relief, and you have Joe Morelli.Any time that Stephanie and Joe are on the page together is great. He's a former... fling for Stephanie, and the sexual tension that leaks from these two is great. Joe also kind of wronged Stephanie in the past, so, she tried to run him over with her father's Buick. So, needless to say, there's also just general tension between the two. It's awesome.And then there is the main antagonist, a boxer named Rodriguez. He plagues Stephanie this whole book, and to be honest, some of the dialogue between the two got a bit uncomfortable for me. There is some mention of rape, and that's a subject that I'm really uncomfortable with. But Janet Evanovich did a great job with the subject, and she never really let it get too uncomfortable.The plot I thought was a bit predictable at times, but at the end, I completely got thrown for a loop. Ms. Evanovich did a great job with this ending!In the end One for the Money is a fun, fast-paced, breezy read that's great for anyone. I can't wait for the next book to see what's going to happen to Stephanie!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I must say this was one of my favorite books.

I totally disagree with their casting choices, btw, but what can you do? This book, however, is great. It has a lot of action, suspense, and humor. It is really fast-paced as other reviewers have pointed out. Such a page turner! The thing I like most about this book and the others in the series is that they are pure escapism. I don't feel stressed while reading them at all. One for the Money is the perfect book to read in bed with a good cup of tea at your side :) I'd recommend it to anyone --- and have!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read all the Stephanie Plum books in this series and others she is in that are not series related. They are some of the best books I have read if you want fun, light, page turners. They get me so engrossed that I read them in a day or two and would stay up half the night because I didn't want to put them down. As crazy as Stephanie is, every self respecting Jersey girl can completely relate to her and in their heart want to be her! I can't wait until the movie comes out!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a really fun book. It reminds me of a Bridget Jones type character doing bounty hunting for the first time and getting in more and more trouble on the way. It is very entertaining and a fast moving novel. I cannot wait to see this in the movies. Stephanie Plum makes you laugh throughout the book. This was my first book I read of the series and look forward to reading more. I read this on my kindle and had gotten it at a time when it was offered for a bargain. From the beginning of the main character's job in bounty hunting your interest will be captivated in order to find out what is going to happen to her. Is she every going to get the $10,000 by turning Morelli or will he continue to escape every attempt made for his capture.

I enjoyed Evanovich's main character, Stephanie Plum, and I look forward to reading more in the series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum's engaging narrative voice inOne for the Money (Stephanie Plum, No. 1) (Stephanie Plum Novels)had me from the first page. I loved her fierce independence, her hard luck story, and how she tries to retain that independence and improve her bank account by doing something she has always considered repugnant: signing on to join her cousin Vinnie's bail bond business.Her biggest score would be bringing in Joe Morelli, a cop charged with murder, and someone Stephanie has known all her life. She has several intense memories from back in the day. And even as she wants to bring him in, mainly for the money, she has ambivalent feelings about it all. I like this excerpt, in Stephanie's voice:\\"I'm not sure what it is about Morelli, but he never fails to strip my defenses. Even when I'm on guard, being watchful, Morelli can piss me off, turn me on, make me question my judgment, and, in general, provoke inconvenient emotions....\\"While struggling with her mixed feelings and seeking her elusive target, Stephanie manages to score some lighter \\"recoveries\\" and put some money in her bank account, after which she buys a car that sputters loudly when she approaches, making it impossible to sneak up on her prey. Then she turns creative and manages to \\"borrow\\" Morelli's Jeep, making driving around a lot easier.Bringing in Morelli turns out to be more of a challenge than she had imagined, however, since along the way she meets other scumbags who are also gunning for him. Now she is in the sights of a boxer named Ramirez, as well as an unknown ensemble of others who are protecting their own secrets and crimes.I have read some of the later books from this series, and have enjoyed the Plum character in each. However, it was wonderful to go back to the beginning and fill in some of the blanks. This book and this series have given me a feeling for the Trenton, New Jersey neighborhood and its family-oriented aspects, as well as the crime element threading its way through. Now I can't wait to see what will happen to Stephanie next. Five stars."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I LOVED this book. This was a pick by a member of my book club and I gotta say-I flew through it!

She is short on cash and long on bills, her Miata repossessed, and the furniture in her apartment is as scarce as the food in her refrigerator. Yet she is a woman not without resources, who black mails her perverted, bail bondsman cousin, Vinnie, into giving her a temporary try as an apprehension agent. Her assignment: bring in Joe Morelli, a cop on the run who stands accused of shooting an unarmed man.\\"There are some men who enter a woman's life and screw it up forever,\\" writes Janet Evanovich in the opening sentence of \\"One For The Money,\\" the first in her series of Stephanie Plum novels. As a teenager Joe Morelli cavalierly claimed Stephanie's virginity behind the &eacute;clair case of a Trenton bakery and then scribbled the details of their encounter on a restroom wall in Mario's Sub Shop. The next time she sited him was in the cross hairs of a Buick Hood ornament.With an old score to settle and a $10,000 pay check for added inspiration Stephanie sets off on the trail of Joe Morelli. She begins to investigate and finds him almost by accident. But Stephanie, who is after all, new to this line of work, cannot bring him in. He insists that Ziggy Kulesza was armed when he shot him even though no gun was found on the body and there is at least one witness who was in the room who can back up his story... the problem: the witness has disappeared and no one know who he is or where he went.In an effort to bring in her man and her ten thousand dollar pay check Stephanie begins to investigate the shooting herself, and soon finds herself being stalked by none other than Benito Ramirez, Ziggy's boss and a heavy-weight champion boxer, who uses women as his personal punching bags. To pay the bills Stephanie also takes a couple of other cases, but requires the advice and assistance of Ranger, a fellow apprehension agent, who takes her under his wing and shows her the ropes. Eventually Stephanie and Joe realize that they need each other's help, and Joe agrees to let Stephanie earn her $10,000 if she helps him unravel the mystery of Ziggy's missing gun and the missing eye witness.Janet Evanovich has succeeded in creating a novel of suspense, intrigue, humor and passion. That is not an easy thing to do in the crime fiction genre. I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. Her characters are fully drawn and quite believable, even when their actions are outlandish. Her fast pacing and action filled plot kept me turning the pages and wanting more."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's first book of her Stephanie Plum series delivers a fast paced story packing quite a punch, literally!Stephanie Plum is out of work, broke and almost hungry.

I have read all during the last month starting with this one and am now nearing the end of Seven Up hoping that Eight will be soon to follow. I have come to the conclusion that indeed Debbie Mazar should be Stephanie (that feeling not originally mine, I guess, because I see that she has narrated one of the AudioCassette versions.) It's hard to see anyone but Steven Seagal as Ranger (though he is a little older than I would like him to be for this role). Grandma Mazur has to be Estelle Getty, of course. Loretta Devine is Lula and Sally sounds like Howard Stern in drag...So many fun characters brought so fully alive through Evanovich's colorful dialog! I love how she has such wonderful elderly characters in her stories and develops Stephanie to the extent that you feel that she is a very real person and has been a part of your life. I think it should be a TV movie if not a series! Hurry with the next one Janet!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I read this book as a recommendation by a friend and I loved it.

All recommended."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I love this book, it was exciting and fun. My co-workers recommeded this book and at first I was skeptical. In the end I was very happy. I read all of her books in three months. I feel that once you pick them up you can't put them down."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I feel like a sell-out giving this book five stars. I started reading this book expecting a tough, street-smart bounty hunter, but got a stumbling, bumbling out-of-work lingerie buyer instead, and I still loved her. I thought I would be reading a taught and suspenseful thriller, but got a running narrative from a stumbling, bumbling out-of-work lingerie buyer instead, and I still loved it.It was only after reading 'One for the Money' did I realize that Evanovich's genius was in the crafting of one of the most entertaining and real characters ever created, and not in the tight plotting of a mystery or thriller. The story is incidental, it is the laugh-out-loud narrative of Stephanie Plum that makes this book great. She has a matter-of-fact sense about her that often makes her comments regarding the bizarre circumstances of her life quite hilarious.When you read this book, and you should, you will laugh aloud, a lot. If you do not, then something is wrong with you.Read this book now."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book cracked me up. The set-up is unlikely -- Stephanie Plum, out-of-work lingerie buyer, becomes a bounty hunter -- but it's tons of fun. The plot was well-done and interesting, but you should really read this book for the characters. They're all vividly drawn and unforgettable, running the gamut from slightly zany and unpredictable to completly and utterly insane.I just about died laughing. This book is a real treat."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This writer makes me laugh. I laugh out loud in public places and giggle and smile through most of her pages. The characters are unique. I especially like the grandmother. I have never been to the Trenton area yet the writer lets me see it all.All the main characters have flare. The supporting characters bring even more spice.Sometimes I think, &quot;I could have been stupid enough to have let myself into this or that situation&quot;. Stephanie Plum gets in impossible situations with unbelievable regularity.I have read all 7 of her books now and cannot wait for another."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am new to the books on cd so I didn't realize that abridged meant they took what they considered the unessential parts out. That means all the humor, all the real meat of Ms Evanovich's style are gone and you get just another action story to fall asleep to at night. I loved the book and wanted to share the story with my daughter who doesn't have time to read but likes to listen to the stories on her way to work. I am embarressed to give this to her after I have raved about the author's writing because it is just dull. Why would anyone put out something so disappointing. I noticed they have all been abridged and while I was ready to start buying all of them, now I will not be buying any more. Enjoy the books but do not expect much from the audio cds."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I never wanted to read any of these books because honestly they just didn't seem like something I would like. Boy was I wrong!Stephanie was so hilarious at times. I liked how she was written as a normal girl. She didn't have super powers or anything like that. Heck, she was dirt poor. Her phone got cut off, her car got repossessed, and her only option for food was mold or hamster hamburger. And did she cry to her family and beg for handouts? Nope, she went out and got a job.I liked that she had to work to get everything and things just didn't fall in her lap. She had a tough time learning the ropes of her new job. It was extremely funny seeing her trying to convince the bad guys to let her drive them to the police station. Though I feel bad as it did seem like she got the short end of the stick most of the time. Actually she got it almost all the time.I liked Morelli, I found myself either grinning or blushing at his comments that he made. The bad guys did a great job at being bad. I was actually a little more alert walking around my own house! I did figure out who the main guy was but I didn't get the reasons why. I still liked this book though.I wish we could have gotten one last update on a certain person in the book. I have no idea where the second book takes place, so I don't know if they will include the same people. I will continue reading though! I wonder what year this book was published in. I'm almost positive that spandex shorts and Reebok's are no longer popular."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I generally read thriller, horror & fantasy books but every now & then I want to have a laugh or read something light which is why I chose this. When I first started reading this I wasn't impressed I thought the writing was amateurish & immature. I basically thought Evanovich was trying too hard. Then once I got to about page 50 either Evanovich got into her groove or I clicked with her style of writing (or a combination of both) but I started to enjoy the book & from then on it just kept getting better & better. It's not laugh out loud funny but I found myself chuckling a fair bit. There's enough action for even blokes to enjoy. It reminds me slightly of a girls version of \\"Get Smart\\" as Stephanie has many areas of incompetence in this job but she still succeeds. If you are wondering there are no X-rated erotic sex scenes, it's all very tame in that area. Recommended even for guys if you are after a disposable light action comedy book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I picked this book up because so many of my book friends recommended it and I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I'm pleased to say that I found the book quite funny and charming; a fast, easy read that pulled me in quickly and kept me grinning throughout.This is the beginning of the Stephanie Plum series that so far has 12 books. The setup here is Stephanie is out of work and definitely out of money, so she sees her cousin Vinny for a filing job. When that falls through, his secretary suggests bounty hunting, and Stephanie, seeing dollar signs, takes on a case. We follow Stephanie as she learns the ropes and discovers her own strengths and inadvertantly ends up helping the suspect she's after for reward. Through it all, Evanovich gifts us with several hilarious scenes and an entirely believable plot that twists and turns nicely. Having now been converted, I am looking forward to experiencing more adventures of this creative bounty hunter! Recommended, especially as light summer reading fare."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I can't remember who told me about Janet Evanovich's series featuring Stephanie Plum. I wish I could remember so I could thank her! Even though I put off reading this series for months, I continued to collect the books whenever I found one at a library sale or yard sale. I knew someday I would have time to start these books. That time came this past April and I picked up ONE FOR THE MONEY and began a fun, laugh-filled journey.ONE FOR THE MONEY introduces us to Stephanie Plum, who has been laid off as a lingerie buyer for a large department store. Her Miata is about to be repossessed and she's sold most of her furniture, hocked most of her small appliances and anything else worth any money so she can pay her rent. Things are looking glum until she goes to see her Uncle Vinnie who owns a bail bonds company. She blackmails Vinnie into hiring her as a bounty hunter (yes, his penchant for farm animals is something he doesn't want known). So begins Stephanie's career as a bounty hunter, even though she doesn't know what the job entails. I mean, how hard can it be to find someone and bring them back to jail? It's not as easy as one might think, and Stephanie's antics are sure to cause laughter!Stephanie is assigned the Joe Morelli case; he's wanted for murder and didn't appear for his court date. Seems Stephanie has a history with Joe, which began when she was six. He's the neighborhood bad boy turned cop, but a bust goes wrong and he kills a man. Joe says the man was armed but no gun turned up at the crime scene. He's trying to clear his name and if he's in jail, he can't do that, so he refuses to turn himself in until he proves his innocence. Joe is looking for the two witnesses and Stephanie is looking for Joe. They dance around stumbling into each other along the way. It's amusing and very entertaining reading!Character development is excellent. Stephanie and Joe Morelli are detailed in depth and they seem like old friends to the reader. Support characters are vast and not as well developed as the main characters, but you can tell these will be delved into more fully in future books. Villains are plenty, including Benito Ramirez, a psycho boxer who enjoys inflicting pain on others and becomes obsessed with Stephanie.The best support character has to be Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's maternal grandmother. She's feisty, says what's on her mind, and doesn't worry about what people think. One of my favorite passages is when Stephanie is invited to dinner at her parents' house (Grandma Mazur lives with them) and they invite a guy from the neighborhood in an attempt to fix Stephanie up. Grandma Mazur learns that Stephanie has just purchased a gun to use while apprehending felons, and she wants to see it. As they are sitting at the dinner table, Grandma is looking at the gun and Stephanie asks if the bullets were removed. \\"Of course\\" replies Grandma Mazur as the gun goes off and shoots the roasted chicken in the [...]. It's the funniest thing I've read in a long time and I burst out laughing. I happened to be in an airport waiting for my plane while I was reading and chuckling. A woman came up and said, \\"I loved those books too!\\" Hmmm... why did I wait so long to read these???ONE FOR THE MONEY, along with the other books in this series, is a must read for anyone who wants to laugh. The mystery is not mind tingling, in fact some of the whodunit is almost non-existent. But the characters and witty plot development are definitely worth the full price of the book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was my first Janet Evanovich book. I enjoyed it. It was fun to read and definitely humorous, but it wasn't a great read like I was expecting. Maybe I was over-expecting since Janet Evanovich is so popular. It was a nice change of pace from the usual romance or suspense books that other authors write, however. I recommend it and I plan to read more of the series and I hope I'll like the others even more."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was cute, funny and engaging. Easy to read and made me laugh out loud at times. The idea of an underwear buyer turning bounty hunter is in itself intriguing. Evanovich makes it work well and bring plenty of laughs with her main character Stephanie Plum and her whacky grandmother adds sidebars full of laughs. She is descriptive of street life in New Jersey and the neighborhoods that she writes about come to life. I will pick up book two and continue to read the series until it runs out of steam (which most series seem to do, but I hope this one lasts a bit). I hope Evanovich can keep it fresh because I enjoyed the quick, easy and fun read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Thank goodness! I can't believe I didn't find Stephanie Plum & Co. sooner! Her life is deliciously complicated yet believable and the story flows as if the reader was the protagonist! Stephanie is ME--or at least who I'd be if I hadn't met my husband when I was out of work, out of school and desperate for a job! This book got me hooked with its laugh-out-loud antics and crazy subplots; I'm currently reading \\"Eleven on Top.\\" I highly recommend you buy the whole series and sit down and enjoy! (See you at Stiva's next viewing!!!)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was in the library and I asked the librarian if she had any books that would be just a fun relaxing read. I read a lot of heavy literature and history so I wanted something that wouldn't emotionally or intellectually drain me. I can't tell you how much this book fit the bill!!! (My friends and family agree). This book is so funny and entertaining. There's something so quintessentially American about it.Stephanie Plum is a great modern heroine, her love interest vice-cop Morelli is very sexy, and the other characters Janet Evanovich creates are similarly wacky and endearing. Sometimes she goes a little overboard with ethnic stereotyping, but her heart's in the right place and I don't know how she turned the story of an inept female bounty-hunter from Jersey into a book that you can't put down, but she did.I'm quite positive the vast majority of readers will be delighted!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Introducing Stephanie Plum: divorced at 30, laid off ... lingerie buyer (\\"not exactly Victoria's Secret\\"), drives a...Chevy Nova she traded for her TV, VCR and small kitchen appliances after her Miata Roadster was repossessed. In a brutal New Jersey August, she's struggling to keep food and shelter for herself and her pet hamster, Rex. Desperate, she turns to her least favorite relative, Cousin Vinnie, and blackmails him into giving her a bail-bond recovery job paying [dollar amount]. The job: bring in Joseph Morelli, a cop accused of [a crime]. Coincidentally, the same guy who took her virginity at 16. Oh, revenge is sweet.With no experience and no gun, Stephanie is determined to bring in Morelli, not realizing how dangerous it could be. Benito Ramirez, a sleazy heavyweight title contender, is now following and threatening her. He's also been charged with [physical crimes] three times. Stephanie gets some advice (and some rescuing) from Ranger, the \\"Dirty Harry\\" of bond enforcement who also works for Vinnie. Stephanie is most definitely a tough cookie. Let's hope she doesn't get herself killed in the process of getting Morelli.This is the 1st book of the Stephanie Plum series. Although it's a mystery series, it's very funny. I must've chuckled at something on almost every page. The characters are so vivid, from Stephanie's nagging mother, her practically senile and wacky grandmother, and somewhat charming Joeseph Morelli. There may still be some chemistry there. Who knows?This is Janet Evanovich's first mystery novel. She began her career writing romance and is now working on the 9th book of the series. She's definitely got something here. Her writing is so witty and real. Great detail to describing each action and scene. Really great characters you want to see again."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My friend convinced me to read One for the Money. It was a fun read. Not the best mystery I've read, but well worth the read. The lead character is a little under developed, but it works for the novel. I'm looking forward to reading Two for the Show."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Out of work, car on the verge of repossession and Stephanie Plum is sharing a roast and the possibility of working with her slimy cousin, Vinnie. What Stephanie hadn't expected was to go from filing to finding fugitives. No luck, but a plan to be able to eat, drive and live, she's optimistic about her chances.Inexperienced, gun toting and starry eyed, Stephanie is searching Trenton, New Jersey, for Joseph Morelli, a guy she's known her entire life, played trains with and with whom she explored puberty. As Stephanie scours the streets, she meets Prize fighter Benito Ramirez, every woman's nightmare.Dodging psychos, explosions and trying to add up the facts leaves Stephanie, beaten, bloody and puzzled. Can she add up the pieces before it's too late?ONE FOR THE MONEY was laugh-out-loud funny. I enjoyed the lively characters, the connection and even more the thrill of the chase. I am actually looking forward to reading more and soon."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I liked this book quite a lot... Starts off very strongly, but the end is extremely tacked-on and confused. In a lot of ways, this isn't really a \\"mystery\\" in that it is just a wandering character study with a murder at the center of the story. I didn't feel like I had a hope of figuring out the crime, as I didn't get the feeling that the author knew or cared how it was going to end as she wrote it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich's evocative and precocious character, Stephanie Plum, leaves readers breathless and begging for more!A must read for any woman who's ever dreamed of adventure!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I originally picked up One for the Money because I've heard numerous people say that the book was hilarious. I also picked it up because one of my favorite books, The Spellman Files, was compared to the Stephanie Plum series. I think the Spellman series is hilarious and it never fails to make me laugh, so I had high hopes for One for the Money. Unfortunately, this book fell a little short.The reason I didn't love One for the Money is because I was never really captivated by the storylines or the characters. It was good, but it wasn't really one of those stories that had me turning the pages. The mystery just wasn't intriguing enough and the main characters alone weren't enough for me to completely gripped by this novel. However, I did really enjoy a few of the secondary characters like Ranger and the Vinnie's secretary (whose name escapes me at the moment).One for the Money was funny, but it wasn't hilarious. Stephanie did have her moments and I liked the quips that she traded with Joe Morelli, but I just expected this to be laugh out loud funny and it wasn't. It did get a few chuckles out of me (whether it was for the actual jokes or for the outlandish situations I do not know) and I did like it as a whole, but I didn't think it was great. At best, it was okay to good. I will pick up the second installment because I own it, but this series isn't a \\"must-read\\" for me."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really like this book I could not put it down and I started on the next right after I got done with this one I just cant wait till I get to the 3nd one..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is a perfect escape novel, a great read for cuddling up by the fire for an afternoon. That being said if you are looking for serious literature this isn't it. It was fairly graphic and if it were made into a movie it would be more in the genre of a thriller cop movie than say a Miss Marple kind of movie. Anyways, this was a fun read and entertaining."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Darn it! I found another series that I can't put down. I am not sure what I was expecting before reading this book but I can tell you that it has suspense, action, humor, and a little bit of romance. I am not going to repeat the background story as other reviewers have already covered that but it was a great read for me. I couldn't put my nook down with this book and thought I knew who the culprit was all along. I especially like Plum for being a somewhat heroine in this book albeit clumsy and inexperienced. I felt like I was right there by Plum as she set out to catch her man. I will quickly move onto the next book in the series.P.S. Remember, this is not a literary classic here but something to read purely for entertainment purposes."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Amazing read! One of the best books I have read in a long time. Stephanie is a sassy bounty hunter that captivates readers. I defenitly reccomend this book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book is a hoot, and one of the few in the series that I'd recommend. All the books involve bounty hunter Stephanie inefficiently hunting bad guys, helped along with wacky friends and handsome guys. Cousin Vinnie owns the office that Stephanie works from, and how she gets Vinnie to hire her is another laugh in this story. Stephanie eventually gets her bounty and usually blows up a few cars in the process in every book in the series. Stephanie's wacky relatives make appearances in all the books, which are all set in New Jersey. In One for the Money, there is an unforgettable scene towards the end with Stephanie, Morelli and a walk-in freezer which is laugh-out-loud hilarious. If you like women's mysteries with a lot of laughs, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is a great book! I decided to read it after many other people had told me how funny and good Ms. Evanovich's books are. (I work in a bookstore, so I talk to many book readers). This first book, One for the Money, was a very insightful and entertaining book. I loved the Stephanie Plum character and I kept hoping that she would fall in love with either Joe Morelli or Ranger. Oh, well, maybe in future books. I can't wait to read Two for the Dough!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book grabs your attention from the very first page and keeps you riveted until the end.

I look forward to reading all future &quot;Stephanie Plum&quot; books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been searching for a new female detective series and I've definitely found it! The descriptions of the Stephanie Plum series intrigued me. Then luckily (?) I caught the flu and actually had time to read the first two books. I finished both in two days. I loved the rapport between Stephanie and the other residents of Trenton, New Jersey. Having lived in New Jersey for a year, the descriptions rang perfectly true, of the people, the town, the ATTITUDES! I loved it! Now I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the introduction of Stephanie Plum and her associates. It is without a doubt one of the best 'mystery' books I have ever read. It is funny and exciting and lacks the endless angst that is seemingly necessary for PD James, Patrica Cornwall, etc. Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is an out-of-work business woman who would rather remain independent than have to depend upon her family for financial help. Besides money, her family drives her crazy, esp. her grandmother. She decides to work for a cousin who is a bail bondsman.

She also manages to get herself into more trouble than she can handle."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I could not put this book down, and I have added janet ivanovich to my must read authors, i find grandma mazur a delight, stephaine plum is my king of detective.

I cannot wait for the next book, high five, to come out."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed &quot;One for the Money&quot; very much. Being a &quot;Kinsey Malone&quot; fan, I had a hard time accepting a new heroine. The beginning of the book presented some pretty zany stuff, like grandma shooting the chicken, but once I got past that, I found myself engrossed in the story and at times laughing out loud. I immediately orded the next two in the series. NJL"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I bought this book months ago and hesitated to read it, until last weekend. Exhausted and trying to sleep, I picked it up before bed, thinking I'd read two chapters. I was up all night finishing it! Wonderful characters!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is short of cash, so she goes to work, for her cousin, as a bounty hunter. The story was hard to get into, but as I read further, I began to like Stephanie (and especially Stephanie's grandmother) and became interested in what would happen next."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money is a great read! So great in fact, that I only put it down for a smoke or to work! Stephanie Plum is 30, average looking and knows nothing about being a bounty hunter. Boy, does she learn fast! Trying to hook Joe Morelli in this first book, she learns the tricks of the trade rather quickly. I think the best part of this book is her trips to the parents house for dinner. Grandma Mazur is by far my favorite character, especially when she snags Stephanie's gun at the dinner table and shoots the chicken in the &quot;gumpy&quot; by accident. She also seems to adore Stephanie's spandex bike shorts and buys herself a pair. Can you imagine a 73 yr old wearing spandex??? Scary!!!! And very ballsy! I'm not one to read mystery books but this one sure takes the cake! I have all 4 of them and I'm working on no.2 right now!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Trenton, New Jersey. Not a place you'd really want to live. An out of work, ex-department store lingerie buyer, decides to earn some quick money and takes up a job for her cousine Vinnie as a bounty hunter. Her first assignment: bring in ex-cop Joe Moreli, who is accussed of murder and has just jumped bail. To complicate things, Moreli and Stephanie just happen to have a bit of history between them and the chase is on.Oh pleeze! Only in Trenton, can any Tom, Dick or Harry (or in this case Stephanie) become a bounty hunter. Like this is a job anyone can do, right? Just off the bat? And to top it all of, she is absolutelly hopeless at it. The girl has no imagination whatsoever, not to mention common sense. Ahm, and she survived to adulthood in New Jersey???? Not only does she make stupid mistakes, she never learns from them either, at which point the whole book just becomes very annoying. Yes, there is some humour in it, but since the heroin is so bloody stupid, it was an effort to finish the book. This is the first one of a long series, and I for one will not continue reading them. Judging from the reviews here, the heroin still remains clueless by book ten, so I'll save myself the time and effort."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Having read Hot Six, I decided to read all the books in the numbered series in order. I started with One for the Money.The books are supposed to be amusing, but I found this one very disturbing.

This which turns out to be a black prostitute, Lulu, left hanging naked and mutilated on Stephanie's fire escape.In future novels in the series Lulu becomes the comic relief.Lulu"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Let me start with this: I am not against sexist novels(I'm female), as long as it's witty and written cleverly, I will read almost anything. This book is not really sexist, it is rather written too cheesy. The jokes are elementary school level, simple and not really funny. Not three stooges simple, which is funny, no, these are cheesy cheap romance novel level.The setting is dark and miserable, characters are uninteresting and again, cheesy. The more I read, the more angry I got, for reading such a waste of time. The author goes into the thousand details like 'she walked to the bathroom, opened the door, brushed her teeth, walked to the kitchen' etc. etc.. So half of the book is bs details to fill the amount of words required to make it a book. It is horribly boring. Throw in a few side arrests which has nothing to do with the story, so that she can squeeze in some more words, and the reader is frustrated out of her mind.About the main story; it is unbelievable and stupid. Her phone connection is cut by the murderer, so she cannot call the police, then after 10 minutes struggle she succeeds to run to the kitchen and call the police. And dozens of more details like this where you want to grab your hair. I never read one, but I am sure even the cheesy romance novels are better written then this. I keep even the comics I buy, this is the first book ever I throw to the trash can. I am 47 and I have never threw a book in my life before.It is too cheesy for a mystery, too miserable for a romance novel, don't waste your money on this."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it. Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering.

Apparently she was a big success. I bought the first book and read it and passed it on to my friends. None of us liked it at all. Compared to what is out there this is weak. She does do an excellent job of describing New Jersey it is an awful place. I didn't like the main character or any of the others. The grandmother had potential but was highly unlikely as written. The reason for the success of Who wants to be a Millionaire-which I absolutely don't like and the success of this book may be the missing link to all of it. Sue Grafton or J.A.

This book is for someone like me who enjoys hilarious plots, hot sexy men, and heroines that are zany, tough, and lovable all at the same time. I just finished reading the entire series and now I am wondering what I will do at night without Stephanie! I'm already having Plum withdrawals. Each book in the series is equally good, and the books don't have to be read in the correct order for you to get the most out of the series. From Grandma Mazur and her morbid obsession with corpses, to Stephanie's sidekick Lula decked out in flambouyant spandex, it's hard to decide which character is the most endearing. I do NOT think this book series is for everyone... for example, definitely not recommended for those people who might be considering marching in an anti-NRA protest, or who might be of the southern Baptist denomination, or for those who tend to lace their shoes a little too tight. Also not a good book for a book club that enjoys deep moral discussions. But for simple down-to-earth folks like myself who enjoy a good read, a good time, and a good laugh....

(maybe not such a great idea in a public place...people might think your nuts but what the heck...go for it) For any of you that have read Harlen Coben's Myron Bolitar Series or Sue Grafton's A-Z series you might find Stephanie to be a good cross between Myron and Kinsey.(Whom both I love) I highly recommend this book and the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great product with very fast delivery.

This was disappointing."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Janet Evanovich'sOne for the Money (Stephanie Plum, No. 1)is the first in the Stephanie Plum series, and after reading/listening to the in-between-the-numbers Plum novels I can see why people would find the in-between books disconcerting. Those novels deviate from the mystery formula and from the narrative Evanovich already has established.In One for the Money, Stephanie Plum is down on her luck; she's lost her job, can't find work, and has begun selling off her furniture to pay her bills. Eventually she falls into the bail bond business with her cousin Vinny and is tasked with apprehending Joe Morelli, who is a cop on the lamb for allegedly committing murder and is attempting to clear his name. In her travels, she apprehends some small time criminals to get by with the help of professional bounty hunter Ranger.Readers will laugh out loud at Stephanie's escapades and her attempts to become a tough bounty hunter when she doesn't even know how to hold a gun, let alone shoot it. Stumbling upon Morelli at every turn, she fails to apprehend him as he outsmarts her, throws her car keys in a dumpster, and kisses her until she's senseless. The tension between these characters is apparent from their first meeting, and there are definitely unresolved feelings between them. The tension between Ranger and Plum seems to be further in the background and more carnal.The dynamics between Morelli and Plum leap off the page, and Plum comes into her own as a bounty hunter after she gets some tips on shooting and other tactics from Ranger and several other cops in Trenton, New Jersey. This is an enjoyable read on and off the page. Readers who love a good mystery or are interested in a fast-paced plot, should pick up this witty series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book captured my attention the very second I began reading the back cover. With promises of tough bounty work for ten thousand dollars a pop, how could I resist picking up this book and reading it?Starting out Stephanie Plum, a once unemployed discount lingerie buyer, is desperate for a job and finds one after begging her cousin Vinnie at his repo agency. But what she does not know is that her first case might be too much for her to handle. His name is Joe Morelli. He is the same person Stephanie grew up with but now is on the run and trying to prove he was framed for murder. To make things even more interesting, Stephanie gets tangled with a few more characters along the way. You will never know who committed murder until the truth finally comes out.One thing I disliked about this book was the slow development of Stephanie's character. But this can easily be excused because it is the first book of the series and her character needs to develop. On the other hand, I liked many things about this book. One thing I liked was how Stephanie was so poor that she drank her last beer one morning for breakfast. Another entertaining moment in this book was when Stephanie stole Joe Morelli's car and then drove it around because she did not have a car.Lastly, I would like to recommend this book to people who like to read mystery and adventure books. This is because this book is about Stephanie Plum's adventure to solve a mystery."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Hilarious sums it up. I wasn't sure what I was looking for the first time I read a Stephanie Plum book. I think the book cover looked like it might have some humor. Yea, don't judge a book by its cover. Sometimes that works. Anyway, I was tired on so, so serious murder mysteries, I need a touch of humor. I got it here, plenty of it along with some scary heart pounding moments.You must try this first one, I'm a firm believer in reading the series in order. If you like to laugh & wonder what in the real world is going to happen next, read this.Plum Boxed Set 1 (1, 2, 3): Contains One for the Money, Two for the Dough and Three to Get Deadly(Stephanie Plum Novels)High Five (Stephanie Plum, No. 5)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've had this book for a few years and always heard good things about the series so I was really excited to finally give it a go. Stephanie Plum is an interesting character who always manages to get in trouble, no matter what she sticks her nose into. After loosing her job as a lingerie buyer she starts to run out of things to pawn from her small Trenton apartment to pay for rent and basic needs. The thick desperation causes her to change her view of what suitable careers for people like her are and she decides to ask her cousin Vinnie for a job in his bounty hunting agency.Under the dreams of a ten thousand dollar paycheck she takes on the big job of the moment, hunting down a cop who has shot someone and taken off. To make things more complicated he turns out to be her childhood crush and someone that stole her heart more than once, now she has nothing to loose not to mention nothing to eat and a new task. The trouble is that her car has been repossessed and she's starting to knock down some wrong doors, attracting attention of a psychopathic boxer who starts to harass her in macabre yet somehow funny ways. Stephanie's way of dealing with the problems is hilarious, her fresh and little innocent attitude combined with some solid luck and awesome breaks make for a fun read. Her funny family things she's nuts for carrying a gun and handcuffs while she's such a girly girl and not a man hunter but she manages to snag a few men on her list and makes enough cash to support her new job. When clues starts to connect people to the case an element of mystery makes the book even more interesting, it makes it more than a simple light crime thriller.The book was cute and funny in places, chilling and surprising in others and almost impossible to put down. I wasn't sure what to expect in the beginning and I must admit I smiled a few times reading it but it didn't fully grasp the charm of it until I was half way through. The book was on my mind when I was away from it and I was happy when I had some time this weekend to relax and read away. There are some surprises and really hilarious moment's ala Bridget Jones, now I can't wait to read the rest of the series, I'm curious to see how Stephanie succeeds and if she finally gets some furniture for her spartan apartment.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was recommended to me at a bookstore that specializes in mysteries, and I have a hard time understanding why. The characters are largely stereotypes, and the result reads more like a Hollywood treatment of a mystery than a novel. The background for the plot centers on bail bonds, but provides little detail beyond what one could glean from watching a good movie like &quot;Midnight Run.&quot; I notice that many of the (extemely positive!) reviews here are written by people who begin by saying &quot;I don't like mysteries, but. . . &quot; Well, I can see where that might be the case, and respect their opinions (with the one exception that I can't understand the positive comments on the &quot;romance&quot; in the book because it is so preoccupied with sexual violence). But as someone who loves this genre, this book struck me as an unsuccessful attempt at marrying Robert B. Parker and Sue Grafton."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A fun, easy read. I'm ready to continue with the rest of the series - already purchased number Two."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I bought this book for the beach, looking for something light, and I could not put it down. Stephanie Plum was easy to relate to, and the book was very funny at times. My only complaint, being from New Jersey (near Trenton), were the Jersey stereotypes. First, the only \\"radioactive\\" areas in Jersey are near Elizabeth and Newark. Second, we DO NOT wear turquoise or midnight blue eyeliner with cherry red lipstick, spandex shorts, and gold hoop earrings...maybe in the 80's, but not in '94. Third, the dialect was a little off. We don't start out any sentence with \\"probably.\\" Once I got past the false \\"jerseyisms\\" I was able to get more into the characters. I guess I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't from Jersey."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started reading this series at the very beginning, and since I got a kick out of the pacing and dialog and thought the mystery was compelling, I shall be back to read more. BUT, unlike Spenser or Kinsey Milhone, detectives who went private because life in law enforcement wasn't for them, the way Stephanie Plum got into bounty hunting just didn't ring true. I've worked for a big-time national retailer and know how sleazy some (okay, many but not all) buyers can be. But there is nothing in that line of work to prepare a woman for bounty hunting. Especially a woman who has never fired a gun or seen a dead body before. I believe in my heart that if Stephanie Plum were indeed a real woman, at one crucial point in the story she would have taken Morelli's advice and become a shampoo girl at a local salon.Still, there is much in this book that was fun, and I look forward to future installments."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"New Jersey lingerie buyer Stephanie Plum is out of a job and has to go work as a bounty hunter, working for her cousin Vinnie, and rekindles a love-hate relationship with cop Joe Morelli, whose leg she once broke.

Once into this book, bills and bank accounts just don't seem to matter more than turning the pages of this must read book....Thank you Janet Evanovich and just keep on writing!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book came highly recommended to me. I thought it was good,but I had a probelm with some of the things Stephanie did. I couldn't believe her naivete when trying to apprehend the FTA'S(FAILURE TO APPEAR). The story was funny and extremely entertaining, if not very believable. I found myself laughing out loud during many parts. This book reminded me of when I watched the movie PULP FICTION, because it tapped into a very dark disturbing world and yet it had moments that were very funny. I will try the next story in the series and see if I like that one better."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After hearing so much about Stephanie Plum and how one MUST read about her, I gave it a try expecting a smart, sassy, funny investigator with a sharp, edgy mystery to solve. I didn't get it with this novel. Stephanie Plum made so many stupid choices in the course of this book that hindered the pace of the story and the solving of the mystery that I was ready to scream and throw the book across the room. Give me a protagonist with brains!! I realize that this is Stephanie's first assignment, but bounty hunters do not go out on the streets and expect to sweet talk their prey into going downtown to the police station with them.The mystery was secondary to the cast of weird characters and stolen cars, exploding cars, roaring and rusting cars, and near rapes and beatings in this novel.Stephanie Plum left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't think I'll come back for more. If you're looking for a laugh out loud funny mystery with characters who are memorable, check out Sarah Strohmeyer's \\"Bubbles Yablonsky\\" series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really enjoy all of the Plum stories but this is my favorite because it was the start of the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money takes place in the suburbian parts of New Jersey .

I resisted long enough what I thought would be a piece of fluff. This woman can create more comedic havoc with charming central character, Stephanie Plum, than a bunch of senior citizens hustling &amp; nudging each other to get into a cafeteria's early bird special.In &quot;One For The Money&quot;, New Jersey native, Stephanie, desperately needs money. So desperate, she worms her way to be a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie. Having no clue as to what she is doing, we readers laugh our way through her antics of bringing back Joe. Add some suspense, classically vivid characters and we get a delicious, deceitful, diabolical plot.Do not wait as I did on &quot;Money&quot;--buy into Evanovich now.Thank you for your interest &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What do you get when a smart, wise-cracking tough girl from New Jersey becomes a bounty hunter? A recipe for success! Sit back and enjoy the wild ride that is the over the top world of Stephanie Plum.Out of a job and money, Stephanie masterfully tricks her cousin Vinnie into letting her fill the open as a bail bondsman. She has zero experience about the business or the requirements but how bad can it be when she has a little help from experienced bounty hunter and friend Ranger. He teaches her a few tricks on how to catch a criminal.Joe Morelli is a former cop on the run and Stephanie's first project. But the two have a history. Morelli took Stephanie's virginity when she was a mere 16 year old teenager. It doesn't help that the two still have sparks flying between them, but Stephanie must put her life and her will to survive before anything. It becomes an interesting pursuit as we watch Stephanie encounter dangerous threats and even more dangerous men. All I have to say is that Benito Ramirez is a beast!This was an adventurous first book in the series and I'm glad I finally picked it up. I will definitely continue on to the next installments of Janet Evanovich's successful series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Putting aside the Scooby Doo-ish ending and the general surrealism of the plot--an out-of-work buyer for a department store becomes a bounty-hunter--the first novel in the Stephanie Plum Series, ONE FOR THE MONEY, is not only hilarious, but somehow manages to keep the reader in a such a sound state of suspended disbelief that he or she is likely to find him or herself thinking, \`hey, maybe that's what I oughta do; the life sounds exciting and the pay's not bad...'. And Janet Evanovich is so skilled at layering her very colorful and likeable characters, of which \`the burg,' Stephanie Plum's neighborhood in New Jersey, is just one. Forgetting the outlandish premise of Stephanie Plum's adventures--that an everyday average woman can just up and become a bounty hunter and make her livelihood capturing everything from DUI offenders to murderers and meanwhile rub elbows with rapists and hookers with ease-ONE FOR THE MONEY will take you on a thrill ride packed with a great suspense/mystery for a main course and the appealing appetizer of a comedic look into an intriguing slice of the New Jersey cultural pie. And there is a little tension thrown in for dessert-the steamy amorphous kind that hints at a (or a few) potential romantic relationship(s) further along in the series.In ONE FOR THE MONEY, Stephanie Plum finds that \\"[b]eing a bounty hunter [is] a little more complicated than [she'd] originally assumed []\\" when she finds herself mixed up in a dangerous conspiracy, the likes of which she never could have imagined. Six months into joblessness, having her car impounded, forced to sell her appliances and tempted to share hamster nuggets with her pet, Rex, Stephanie doesn't find it too hard to be convinced to become a \`skip tracer,' someone paid to retrieve individuals who have failed to appear in court after a bond has been posted on their behalf...people who don't want to be found. $10,000 bucks, her percentage of the bond for her first retrieval doesn't sound bad to Stephanie at all until she finds out two things: (1) she could get shot or have to shoot someone else in the process; and (2) her first assignment is to take Joseph Morelli into custody.Stephanie Plum has had some interaction with the devilishly handsome and sexy Morelli before on more than one occasion-intimate interaction. As one person put it, \`...half the women in New Jersey have sold him their cannoli....'! However, as the reader laughs and cringes his or her way through the story as Stephanie walks through her humiliations, family dinners, seriously close calls, dubious accomplishments and rare triumphs, it becomes clearer that being a tyro in the criminal retrieval industry is the least of the many problems in Stephanie's world. And it is a rich world that Evanovich has created, a lush breeding ground for humor, lust, danger, mystery, loss, but most importantly, growth-growth of a story, of characters and of a fine fantasy world brimming with many more tales to tell. This is only the first book, I know there are more stories to read (9 or 10 more at least, I think), but I didn't want this one to end.Excellent and Edifying Experience Well Worth a Reader's Time."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Are you new to Evanovich? With the Stephanie Plum series Evanovich brings us fast-moving entertainment, though ulimately, an unsophisticated agent of the thriller genre.Reminiscent of Hamilton's Anita Blake vampire series in sassy, slick style and sexy, superficial characterisation, the Plum series is an entertaining diversion rather than cerebral education.The plot is thin and fast like an early Patterson novel, and the bad guy is evident from half way in. This doesn't spoil the ride though and it's impossible not to hang on with Stephanie and her diverse stereotyped sidekicks for a rollercoaster of fun!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the only series for which a new six star catagory ought to be made which I normally describe as 'pants wetting funny'. I found this, the first of the series, from amazon browze, and thought I'd be getting another tough gal private eye, coroner, detective, etc. It's helpful if you just consider sugarplums to be a christmas special. In this first book you are introduced to ex lingerie buyer Stephanie Plum and the first of her cars, and many lovable secondary characters. As soon as I saw she was an unemployed lingerie buyer I almost quit, but the hysterical dinner with her family won me over. Stephanie stumbles into a job as a bounty hunger because the filing job with her cousin is taken and slogs through the adventures with a combination of guts, luck, and a scary lack of reality about how underskilled she is for the job which comes naturally to the girl who once tried to fly off the garage roof. I expected to her to toughen up as the series continued, but with a sneak peek I'll admit that by book eight she is still scared of guns if much more used to exploding cars and finding people waiting in her living room who picked her lock. The book and series would be totally unrealistic if Stephanie wasn't sel admittedly 'lucky' rather then skilled. Her relatives on the police force and her home grown knowlege of the 'Mafia retirement community' in New Jersey with its net of families and friends makes her survival more plausible. Delightfully nearly all the wonderful secondary characters grace the sequels (including her hamster), something I really enjoy. It's a good crossover of romance, comedy and mystery for those of us that like our books varied. The sicker your sense of humor, the funnier this book is. Titled numerically I don't have to include a sequel chronology here, except that 'visions of sugar plums' (a christmas special) comes between eight and the soon to be published 'nine'."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is not my first Stephani Plum novel. I picked up 'High Five' from the end table one day while waiting on a guest. My wife had left it there. Before I knew it, I was thirty pages into the book and had had several good laughs.I was looking for something light hearted to read to wittle away some spare time the other day, and I decided to give 'One For the Money' a shot. I loved it every bit as much as 'High Five'.Janet Evanovich has created an incredibly funny cast of characters. Stephanie, a down on her luck former lingerie purchasing agent, leads them all. At five foot seven, she is not the prototypical bounty hunter, but facing desperation and a depleted bank account, she blackmails her cousin vinnie, who has a fetish for kinky sex his wife doesn't know about, into giving her a chance to bring in a few bond jumpers.Stephanie's grandmother, Grandma Mazur, is probably the next most charming character. In a way she looks up to Stephanie. Impressed with Stephanie's black biker shorts, Grandma Mazur runs out and buys herself a bright blue pair, which she wears with her knee high stockings and cotton blouse.This is a funny and great story that follows Stephanie as she determinedly bumbles her way through several apprehensions while in pursuit of a cop accused of shooting an unarmed man. She hopes to collect the $10,000 bounty and get her financial life in order. Evanovich has skillfully written this book interjecting wit in just the right places and making wonderful characters out of everyone, and in some cases, Stephanie's cars. There is even a bit of a twist to the end.I'd recommend this novel for more mature readers that like humor and crime fiction. Elmore Leonard fans should enjoy this novel. Its an easy read and would be a wonderful way to pass a plane ride."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have now purchased the eighth novel by Evanovich - all in hardback - and I'm not exactly rolling in money! The Stephanie Plum mystery series has it all: excellent plots, realistic dialogues, nice little unexpected twists and turns, sexy secondary characters (the guys), and a \\"what-the-hell\\" heroine with a smart mouth who can tell everybody where to go except her mom and her \\"just a tad eccentric\\" gun-toting grandmother. If you like a good mystery with laughter, lust, and a few loonies tossed into the mix - you'll love this series!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What do you get when you combine a former lingerie buyer, a sleazy business owner and a former cop accused of murder? An utterly hilarious novel that is laugh out loud funny and very difficult to put down. Stephanie Plum has just had her car repossessed and no job prospects for six months. In desperation, she blackmails her cousin Vinnie into giving her a job as a bounty hunter.What follows is a comic romp through Stephanie's life as she tries to bring in a former fling for a promised $10,000. In the process, the reader is introduced to the seedier side of Trenton, New Jersey and the dangers involved in a not so glamorous profession. We are also given a glimpse into the pit falls of living entirely too close to Mom, not paying the phone bill on time and having only a hamster named Rex for company.If humor is more your speed and you're tired of the more serious and darker mystery novels that are out there today, do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to Stephanie Plum. She may still have a lot to learn in her new profession, but anyone who chooses to read One For The Money will surely enjoy the ride. Janet Evanovich has created one hell of a winner with this first novel in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started reading this series out of order. As a reader you can do that, but I think it would be best to start with the first so you know the history of the series, especially the history between Stephanie Plum and Joseph Morelli.Plum is a laid-off lingerie wholesaler who desperately needs money. She accepts a job from her cousin Vinnie as a skip-tracer. Problem is she hasn't got a clue! That's the best part of the book, watching her stumble and pick herself back up to get an FTA. Her first assignment is to aprehend Joe Morelli, a former vice cop that's been charged with murder. With Ranger's help and Stephanie's stubborness she might have a chance in catching him. Great supporting cast including Grandma Mazur. Very funny book that I read in one evening and plan to keep to read again. Don't miss out! This author's a winner!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is coping with a failed marriage, obnoxious family and lack of a job. Her pet hampster is about the only thing good in her life.So, she decides to become a bounty hunter, and not because she has the necessary skills. She's scared of guns and hasn't the first clue how to begin. This comical ineptness is one of the best aspects of the book. What Stephanie does have, though, is relentless drive (or should that be stubbornness?). Under the instruction of the black-clad and mysterious Ranger, Stephanie begins to stumble through learning the trade. You can't help but cheer her on, even as you laugh at her mistakes.With a charming-yet-maddening bail jumper (the object of Stephanie's search) and a creepy stalker, this novel really has a bit of everything. Comedy, suspense, mystery, fear and lots of very colorful writing.This is a book to read in one sitting; it's so enjoyable and hard to put down."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Down on her luck Stephanie Plum has no where to turn except to her Uncle Vinnie who runs a bounty hunter business. She has lost her job, has pawned off most of her belongings, is in collections for all her credit cards, and is about to be evicted to top it all off. She hears from her family the Vinnie is looking for a file person, so she goes to him to see about the job. Well, her bad luck only continues when she finds that the position has been filled. However, there is a temporary opening for a bounty hunter if she can handle the job. Stephanie has no choice really, so tells him to let her prove she can do it. For every skipped bail person she brings in she get a percent of the bond worth. She has her sights set on Joe Morelli, a police officer that has been accused of shooting an unarmed man and killing him and now is missing. Her payout would solve a lot of her problems right now...$10,000 can go a long way after all. What could go wrong? Well to start with, she knows nothing about bounty hunting and nothing about guns or how to protect herself or how to handle the skippers she is trying to catch. When Joe proves a bit harder to catch than she thought she takes on smaller time skippers to make some money to keep her afloat for now while she keeps on looking for Joe Morelli. Stephanie seeks out the help of a fellow bounty hunter that works for Vinnie, but he is less than thrilled to help her. He does give her advice and when push comes to shove help too. Stephanie finds there is much more to the Joe Morelli case than just catching him and it doesn't help that she and him have a personal past either. She soon finds herself in a very rough spot...a hot shot boxer is trying to have his way with her and isn't known for his soft touch, Morelli still eludes her and when she does see him she never seems to have the upper hand, and she finds her life in danger more than not. Is it possible that Morelli is telling the truth and he was set up? Can she manage to keep herself safe and alive to even find the truths? Who is it that seems to want her dead...the boxer she turns down who is not happy she did and threatens her or the cop turned killer Morelli who is less than excited that she wants to bring him back in, or could there be someone else she doesn't even know about?I have heard SO much about this book and the series that I was more than excited to read it. I was not disappointed either. This book was great, it had a wonderful female main character that is very easy to relate to and had a great plot to go along with her. The characters were memorable and easy to like...or not like depending on the character. The book got moving right away and kept right on plugging along. Sometimes books that start off great turn slow and then speed up again at the end; not the case in this book. The action kept right on going from beginning to end. Every time I thought I knew what would happen and who was trying to kill Stephanie something else would happen forcing me to re-evaluate the whole theory I had. It was a pretty easy read which I also liked. I look forward to continuing on with this series to see where Stephanie goes from here! Stephanie Plum quickly took up residence on my top favorite characters in a book or a series list. She was portrayed as a down to earth woman who comes from a loving family, but is also very headstrong, determined, and not willing to let some bad luck in life stop her or slow her down.5/5 Stars!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"From my blog:Sci-fi and fantasy novels are all well and good, but I do read other books. One example is the hilariously funny Stephanie Plum novels by Janet Evanovich. Now, Evanovich is a prolific writer and so has a lot of series, some better known than others, but the Stephanie Plum novels are a must read for anyone looking for a good laugh. I have listened to a number of them on CD, and I highly recommend listening to the later ones since the narrator definitely adds to them. The earlier ones have a different narrator and I might be biased (since I listened to the later ones first) but I don't like the earlier narrator nearly as much. Also, these books really don't need to be read/listened to in order! There are a few over-arching plots in Stephanie's life, but each book easily stands on its own.Title: Stephanie Plum novels (first one is One for the Money)Author: Janet EvanovichSetting: New Jersey, not quite our world from what I can tell of the spin offs, but very nearlyPremise: Stephanie needed a job so she became a bounty hunter for people who skip bail after getting bonded out. She has a tendency to wind up in ridiculous and hilarious situations and handles them with jokes and dumb luck.Strengths:Really really really really funny! You will be laughing out loud.Brave and fairly intelligent but mostly lucky and witty female characterAn endearing boyfriend and complicated friendship with a really hot guyHilarious minor characters, including a cross-dressing stonerLight and easy mysteriesWeaknesses:Warning, there is some swearing *gasp*It can be a bit grisly sometimes despite the humorous setting. There are murders.Not always very realistic :-)I've never been to New Jersey, but I'm suspicious about how accurately it is portrayed :-)I have a tendency to crave donuts after reading these books...Summary: Really excellent books to pick up in the airport or whenever you need a good laugh and an easy read, as long as you don't mind a bit of a darker side to the humor once in a while. They are also great to listen to while driving, since they don't take much brain power to follow.More reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"First in the Series and it is absolutely the funniest book I have read.

We are introduced to Stephanie (her Italian temper, her Hungarian metabolism, her awful eating habits, and her hamster Rex), as well as the motley crew of characters in Trenton, New Jersey.When we first meet Stephanie, she has just been laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer and is selling off her furniture to make her rent payment. In a last desperate attempt for a job, she blackmails her cousin Vincent Plum, a bail bondsman, into giving her a job (I'll leave what she blackmails him for as a surprise). She turns out to be quite inept as a bounty hunter but amazingly lucky and tenacious. We meet Ranger, the hot Cuban bounty hunter Vinnie assigns as her mentor, and Morelli, the equally hot Trenton cop wanted for murder. There is also Lula, Grandma Mazur, Connie and the Plum parents.This is an excellent foundation on which to build the series, and it is at some points laugh out loud funny. I definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had to read this one again, as I find Stephanie irresistibly funny, sassy and witty. In this plot, she is searching for an old lover, local vice cop Morelli, who is wanted for murder and has jumped bail. Abject poverty will drive you down different routes just to pay the rent and buy a meal, and she ends up working for her sleazy cousin in New Jersey.

There are something like 20 in the Stephanie Plum series, with gradually cheesier titles, not usually a good sign. Still, this is the first, so the author hasn't had a chance to slip into potboiler mode. They've just brought out a movie so try to get a cover with the movie tie-in rather than the original Death by Pink.Stephanie becomes a bounty hunter to pay the bills. Unsurprisingly she isn't terribly good at it, but manages to win through more by good luck than judgement. Quietly self-deprecating humourI think I prefer Sara Paretsky's novels (featuring V I Warshawski as the hardnosed private eye).Jack Whittaker is a database administrator specialising in SQL Server technologies and author of the DBAtasks Blog - [...]"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"When I'm reading it, I can hardly put it down. I can't wait to read the rest of the Stephanie Plum novels."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was such a fun read! I love film adaptations and I try and read the books before the movie comes out to analyze the similarities and differences in storytelling. So, I can't wait to see this movie on opening weekend!I have to admit that I have my issues with white, female authors creating white heroines or heroes and then putting them in the midst of counter cultures -particularly black cultures --even more particularly, low income black culture. Having grown up in low income, black culture and constantly worrying about any residual ghetto funk, it bothers the hell out of me when others not in it or of it use it to their advantage. Stephanie Plum even comments on her mentor turning off and on his own \\"ghetto talk\\" and I just had to take a moment and sigh, but I did turn the page and keep going.That aside, Plum is awesome! But even more interesting is the anti-hero Morelli. If you were nabbed in high school or college by the womanizing, panty-snatcher, this book is such sweet revenge. And though there are times when Morelli's powers of seduction call to her like the smell of a good steak, overall she holds her on keeps the fire to him. Although I see that there are a shelf's worth of sequels, so I'm sure that changes at some point. I will definitely grab another one to see where they end up."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have already read it. I liked the original cover better because the movie didn't do it justice. This book was a give away and it was in good condition."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A great treadmill book....now I want to read the entire series. Easy, interesting, and funny. Love the mother and daughter relationship"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved reading my first ever Janet Evanovich novel. It was fun, unexpected and I read it in one sitting.It's not anything too deep, which is what I was looking for. Her book(s) came recommended by a friend. Looking forward to more about Stepnanie and her adventures."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was. Fun read. Light and did not require lots of thought. I really enjoyed the read and I plan on reading more of this series. I would recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Great book and was received on schedule. Janet Evanovich is a great author, and I recommend her books to everyone!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"We are excited about collecting all of this series. Thank you . Book in Great conditon. Looking forward to reading it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I will admit, I saw the movie coming out before I realized it was a book. But when I saw it was a book, I had to read it before I could see the movie. Books are always way better than the movies. This one isn't any different. I had laughed so much reading the book that my husband was looking at me weird."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really like this book and will probably purchase others in this series. Stephanie Plum writes a good book. You'll love it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been looking for a new mystery author for a while. A friend of mine recommended Evanovich and I bought this book. I was caught up immediately but was so horrified by her initial encounter with Ramirez that I almost quit! (Shows how well Evanovich draws her plot events.) But I was already hooked with Stephanie, Ranger, Grandma Mazur and Morelli and just could not do it. This is a truly well-constructed plot with wonderfully developed characters. Yes, I sound like the English major that I was. But what kept me going was Evanovich's ability to draw you further and further into the story. And to make you really feel a part of it as it progresses - makes you feel Stephanie's emotions as she struggles to conquer her new profession, her crazy family, relationship with Morelli and financial situation. Only problem is that I now can't get a hold of book 2. But will continue to do so until I get my hands on it. Will continue to read her until I run out of books."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I discovered this author by reading a couple of her other books first then I decided to try One For The Money. I read most of it in one day which for me is very fast. The book is a lot of fun and I couldn't put it down and it was also funny at times too. I am already half way done with Two For The Dough which I read once again mostly in one day. These books are just too much fun! Loved One For The Money!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The book overall was a good read...This was my 1st book that I've read from her, and I am very eager to read the 2nd book in the Stephanie Plum series...In the beginning/middle (in between) you run across slow parts, but if you keep reading and get near the end, you will not want to put the book down until your done. Plus it had an interesting ending, you suspect one person, but it turns out to be someone else which makes sense."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have read just about all the books in the Plum series, but somehow I missed the first book. I do remember that I really enjoyed \\"Two for the Dough\\" so I started dropping hints that I wanted this book for my birthday present and low and behold I got my birthday wish. I wasn't disappointed in this book even though it had a real frightening character in the story. Still there were many scenes where I found myself laughing, i.e, the car problems and the family and many other scenes. It humorous and serious and all in all just a wonderful story."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I had heard how good these books were from other people but just never took the time to check them out myself. I am so glad I did!! Great writing! I found myself getting involved on page 1 and couldn't put it down. Stephanie Plum is quite the character. Down on her luck and without a job, she goes to her cousin Vinnie in hopes of getting a job filing. Instead, she ends up a bounty hunter on the hunt for Morelli, a man from her past. I found myself laughing out loud at her family, especially her mother and grandmother. Stephanie jumps right in on the search for Morelli and gets more than she bargained for when she encounters a prize fighter who ends up stalking her. I have heard they were going to make these books into movies. I can't wait to see them! Sandra Bullock would be perfect for the role of Stephanie, much like her character in Miss Congeniality!! This book is a must read! Can't wait to read the rest of the series!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a fantastic book! This is the funniest mystery/detective book I have ever read. Janet Evanovich is inspired in her book about an inept, but totally endearing, bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum and her crazy family, weird clients and outrageous friends.You cannot put this book down and I know you will laugh out loud. You get the feeling of Trenton through Stephanie's eyes, the taste of her mother's meals, the pithy asides of her father, the eccentricity of her grandma and you will be totally absorbed from beginning to end.I'm a Sue Grafton fan, and this is every bit as good and a whole lot funnier. I am not going to tell you the plot, because that would spoil some of the fun for you. Just buy it!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"if you do not enjoy these books(or fancy the pants of morelli)then you most definetly have a hormone missing.Forget all that nonsense about Bridget Jones and her Diaries..Stephanie Plum is the one and only star of the nineties novel. Long live Janet &amp; Stephanie"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"The first book in the series may be a little enjoyable as you get further into it, but overall it was predictable and disappointing.Janet Evanovich paints a dreadful picture of New Jersey, where old women are assuming worry-worts, young women are exploited tough-it-out crudes, and men -UGH! men!- they are grunting sexual predators who eat hunks of beef when hungry. A complete turn off to me, and I'd put it down right there if it wasn't this month's book club read.After this bleak picture, the zaniness starts for our heroine, Stephanie Plum! How crazy is life for Stephanie, becoming a bounty hunter just to pay the rent (guess there was no other jobs in New Jersey at the time), and the big money bounty that can get her out of debt happens to be . . . her hottest flame from the past and known locally as being completely irresitable to women. What are the chances of that?!In seriousness, the plot is loose and predictable. Evanovich plays on stereotypes that make the characters flat and predictable. Though Evanovich writes in plot twists, an avid reader would have expected a twist to occur. Then it comes, so there really aren't surprises and revelations. The book is like a Lifetime movie - stereo-typical, predictable, and a little cheesy.Rating: An easy, no-thought involved pool/beach read. You'll walk away liking it, but feel that it wasn't that entertaining. 2 Stars."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the series, and cannot wait for each new book. But, I recommend to my friends that they skip the first book and start with Two or Three. They'll meet the characters just fine without the first one.In my opinion, the first book is too 'raw.' The sex and violence are too graphic. To me, it seemed that the author wasn't certain what sort of book she wanted to write. By the second or third in the series, she hit her stride and got more comfortable with her own characters and genre. But the first in the series just isn't comfortable in its own skin.Enjoy the series, though! It's a hoot! I live in NJ and work in Trenton, and love the \\"local\\" references."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am a lover of the Sue Grafton series and find that these books are similar but with more sass and sarcasm. My book club actually picked this title for our Oct 2012 selection. We will be heading to a cabin for the weekend and plan to watch the movie after we discuss the book.Note - this isn't a cozy mystery. There is one bad guy you'll wish dies a slow death.The minute I finished this book I wanted to rush out a get #2. That deserves five stars.This is a fun read for people who like clever, witty female characters. If you find yourself cheering for the underdog, then Stephanie Plum will hear you loud and clear."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Why I Read This Book: This book was recommended to me by a friend.What I liked: I liked how this book kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end. I also liked how the characters seemed real to me.What I didn't Liked: I did not like Benito - he was not a nice person and seemed to only want to hurt women.Overall Impression: I am glad I read this book. I am not a fast reader but I read this book in a day and a half which is fast for me. I could not put it down. One minute I was scared for Stephanie, then sad for her, and then cheering her on. Poor Stephanie has lost her job and is out of money but rather than run to her parents or giving up she chooses to take a job with her cousin. It was fun but scary at times to watch Stephanie learn how to become a bounty hunter. She made some mistakes got knocked around a little but in the end did a good job. I loved Stephanie's grandma she seems like a hoot, we don't see much of Stephanie's family but they seem like a close family what little we did see. I liked how Joe and Stephanie play off each other and he kept her on her toes and would not \\"let\\" her bring him in to collect her money. I wonder if we will see more of them together in the future? I would like to see the movie now but am afraid I would be disappointed as I enjoyed the book that much. I will be continuing on with the series in the future. 5 Stars."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One for the Money (Movie Tie-in) (Stephanie Plum Novels)I love Stephanie Plum!

Pretty quick read. it wasnt overly thought provoking but its good for a light read. will more than likely read the next one too."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was a book that I would recommend. It had suspense and humor. There were parts that I laughed out loud and some I was at the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"ONE FOR THE MONEY is the first in the Stephanie Plum series. I was sick when I read this and could hardly keep my eyes open, but still I could hardly put it down! It reads like the adventures of a bumbling Kinsey Millhone, but Stephanie Plum is funnier. I could just picture the oddball characters. The book was tense, scary, hilarious, fast-paced, sexy! I just loved it and can't wait to pick up number 2! Where have I been?! Doesn't matter -- I'm glad I get to experience the pure pleasure of reading the series now! You won't want to miss this series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"She would read a book of my choosing, which ended up being \\"Wizards First Rule\\" by Terry Goodkind, and I would read one of her choosing, which ended up being \\"One For the Money\\" by Janet Evonivich.After thoroughly avoiding the book like the plague for over half a year I finally got around to reading it. Being a big fan of fantasy and sci-fi I wasn't really sure how much I'd like it, but for some reason I did.The story moves at a smooth and generally fast pace never wasting time making the reader bored. It's a murder mystery/ book of self discovery about Stephanie Plum a woman who is out of money and taking on the life of a bounty hunter to get a living.So to all those of you who loved Terry Goodkind, or to those of you who like this genera of books(whatever it is, mystery I guess?) then this book is for you! I give it 4 stars because I liked it. So you should read it to. I love you Amanda! bye-bye."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"One For The Money has to be the funniest book I have ever read. In fact it is so hysterical that I laughed out loud and I am looking forward to reading the rest of this series.Jersey Girl, Stephanie Plum is out of work and her car has just been repossessed. She has been looking for work but hasn't had any luck until she blackmails her Cousin Vinny into giving her a job as a bounty hunter. Her first job is to catch Joe Morelli, who she shares a past with and is wanted for murder. Needless to say that Stephanie hasn't a clue on how to handle this new profession as well as how to resist the sexual tension between her and Morelli.This book has several characters that I love but I especially love Grandma Mazur who steals almost every scene that she is in. I'm anxiously awaiting to read the rest of the series and I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a real good laugh."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I think I've read about 5 Stephanie Plum novels in the last two months! I love 'em. Stephanie gets layed-off and can't face 8 hours-hours-a-day at the button factory no matter how empty her refrigerator gets, so in desperation, she blackmails her totally gross cousin Vinnie, a bail-bondsman, into letting her work as a bounty hunter. When people don't show up for their court date, all she has to do is somehow persuade them to come down to the courthouse to reschedule, and she gets a percentage of the bond. Sounds easy, right? Stephanie reels from one crazy mishap to another, tapping into her extensive connections in the Jersy Burg where she grew up, and occasionally getting some assistance from her mysterious and very hot co-worker, Ranger, or the sexiest cop on wheels who long ago got her to play a game of choo-choo when she was nine and looked up her dress. But against all odds, through outrageous escapades, and despite numerous wild plans gone awry, Stephanie always manages somehow to land on her feet and get her man. And the writing is so funny, every book has me laughing out loud at some point. Evanovich's characters are colorful and full of life, and her depiction of Burg culture is priceless!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I came upon this book while reading message boards for Kelly Rippa's book club the &quot;Bachelor&quot;. Someone mentioned it and I'm so glad that I picked it up. I'm not a big detective story reader but I love the style of writing, all the humor and the little kick of romance. I can't wait to start the next book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Wonderful book! I was given it by my cousin and was leery of reading a book that wasnt usually my taste. I found the book to be fantastic and very funny, entertaining! I have now gone on to read two other books by this Author and the books just keep getting better and better."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this book. It sets the tone for the rest of the series. It's so funny, and full of mystery, mayhem, and sexual tension. Stephanie Plum is CRAZY, you'll love her. The secondary characters are great. Tough Ranger, sexy Joe, helpful Eddie psycho Ramirez, medling Mom, and excentric Grandma Mazur all help the exciting adventures of Stephanie Plum come together. An absolute must! This book is great any time of the year."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I started One for the Money last night and couldn't put it down until I was done. Just hilarious. I haven't laughed so much in ages and I mean laughing until I cried. If you need to have your spirits lifted, I would definitely recommend this book. Great characters, interesting setting, and a very human and halarious heroine just trying to get from day to day in a not too pleasant world."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum is a down on her luck Jersey girl. Her parents want her to marry and settle down, or at the very least get a decent job at the button factory or a nice filing job. How does this idea sit with Ms. Plum? She goes to work for an Uncle as a bounty hunter.With no previous experience in this field the possibilities for danger are unlimited. She is shot at, handcuffed, threatened with rape and this is just the beginning. Janet Evanovich has created a wonderful, interesting and very funny character and then proceeds to surround Stephanie Plum with a crazy array of Jersey-ites that are sure to keep you riveted in the frightening and also funny adventures of this female bounty hunter!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am a total romance person. I don't like to read anything else, but I decided to get Janet's books(really I got them for my husband because he likes mysteries). I am currently on Four to Score and I'm here to tell you---GET THEM. They are really funny. My husband keeps giving me wierd looks because I'm just setting there laughing. Janet's books are on my shelves to stay. I don't think she is going to be able to write fast enough to keep up with her fan club of devoted followers."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"After reading all the heavy (content) books lately I thought I would try something light and funny. I was told by the local used book seller that I would laugh out loud at some of the \\"zingers\\" that the author throws at you unexpectedly. I enjoyed the book and found it cute, until while snuggled in my bed \\"for a long winter's night\\" I reached page 68, when the senile grandmother grabbed Stephanie's gun and shot the chicken off of the platter at dinner. I laughed so hard I almost peed in my bed! That broke the ice and I have been laughing ever since. It's like rednecks meet Newark-necks! I have ordered the next two from the library. Did you know that they are making a movie out of this with Katherine Heigl as Stephanie and Sherri Shepherd, the comedienne from The View, as Lulu? It will will be in theaters July 8, 2011. I can't believe that I went all this time and never entered the world of Stephanie Plum. I'm gathering the rest of the series so I won't miss a single one!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Family life is a major focus in this novel, but then, so is the mystery. I've come to the Stephanie Plum series written by Janet Evanovich late, but now I'm super charged up and ready for more. This was a well written book and downright laugh-till-you-cry in some places. What a talent this author has for capturing the down home aspects of Stephanie's life. When Grandma fired the \\"unloaded\\" gun at the dinner table I laughed until I had tears in my eyes.But just in case you think all this frivolity might keep the story from being a true mystery, don't worry about that. I thought the process of Stephanie learning how to be a \\"bounty hunter\\" or \\"recovery agent\\" by trying to bring in the biggest bond skip was extremely well written. The character made all kinds of really novice and stupid mistakes and she paid for every single one of them. No getting away from the consequences by batting her eyelashes at somebody who makes all the trouble go away. No, singed off eyebrows and skinned knees were actually the least of this woman's troubles. Was Joe Morelli a dirty cop? Stephanie wouldn't put it past him because of the grudge she's still holding from high school days so she commandeers his car and tries to capture him and earn the $10,000 fee. Her problem is that she meets Joe every time she turns around and yet is no closer to turning him in. Her investigation into the charges against him makes her start wondering if the official version of what happened might be slightly or even completely wrong. She will just have to solve the mystery and find out.Also, I would like to make a comment about the quality of this book regarding Kindle formatting. I read comments all the time about how bad Kindle formatting is in some books. Well, I read this on my Kindle and the formatting was absolutely spot on. No problems whatsoever so that's one thing you won't have to worry about if you are a Kindle reader."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"First time reading one of the Stephanie Plum books. Funny and easy to read. Looking forward to reading more."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"As a fan of Stephanie Plum this book definitely sets the stage for her adventures. Although Janet Evanovich writes in a way that you can read the books \\"out of order\\" but still know what's going on and the characters' relationships, One for the Money helps to put everything in order. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been seeing Evanovich books for years and not even once was I compelled to give them another look or find out if they were worth my time. I kind of regret it now.This 1st book in the series about a female bounty hunter set in New Jersey ethnic neighborhood was quite a pleasure to read. The book was written about 15 years ago and definitely felt dated in many ways, especially in regards to \\"fashion\\" - spandex shorts, big hair, hoop earrings and all that. But the humor remained fresh, Plum/Morelli dynamic duo was a lot of fun to follow, and the mystery involving Hispanic and Italian gangsters, prostitutes, a crazy boxer and drugs was an original one.I am not rushing into reading the 2nd book in the series, mostly because I don't want to overdose on them and also there is no rush for me to get caught up on this series, there is like a million books in it. But I will definitely check the next book out whenever I am in a mood for a fast-paced funny mystery."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Stephanie Plum has hit some hard times. She's lost her job as a buyer of cheap lingerie, fallen behind on her bills and has had her beloved car repossessed. She's got moldy cheese and a stale loaf of bread in the fridge and she has hawked most of her furniture and major appliances to pay the rent and procure a P.O.S Nova. Stephanie doubts things could get much worse. She's about to be proven wrong.In a stroke of dumb luck, or perhaps, an evil twist of fate, Stephanie lands a job at her uncle Vinnie's bonding company as a bounty hunter. It's Stephanie's duty to bring in FTA's in exchange for 10% of the bond. When Stephanie is informed about an FTA worth 10 grand, Stephanie is all over it, until she discovers the FTA is none other than Joe Morelli, Stephanie's childhood nemesis, who taught her how to play train at the age of six and deflowered her behind an &eacute;clair case 10 years later. She may have clipped him in the leg with her dad's Buick three years later, but thoughts of Morelli still rankle. What follows is an amusing, entertaining and at times, pretty sexy man hunt.Stephanie isn't brilliant, but she certainly isn't dumb, more hilarious because of her dumb luck than snide humor, she's a pretty endearing heroine. I enjoyed the time spent with One for the Money and find myself wanting to dive in to book two as soon as possible. Great way to spend a Sunday."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I've been hearing lots about these books, but hadn't had a chance to try one yet. I would see my boss read and just start laughing! So, I picked up the first book...Wish I hadn't waited so long.The writing style is engaging and the pace is fast. I read it in one day! Because, I had a very hard time putting the book down. When the book ended, I went to the store and got the second book and order 4-7 on amazon. I plan on grabbing the rest too.It's easy to see why this series is so popular. The fun characters and storyline make for quick, light, and FUNNY reading. I'm looking forward to reading the rest and cann't wait to get them.BUY IT! READ IT! AND LAUGH!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"So i finally decided to read a Stephanie Plum book. I read a few of Janets re-published romance books and enjoyed those. Steph is pretty funny with alot of spunk but liked that she was a little scared at the same time. There were a few disturbing things in the book that i'm not use to reading like violence scenes, but that's ok. I got alot of catching up to do to get threw this whole series but should be fun."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was my first evanovich book and it was soooo much fun!!!

Fast, enjoyable, a great read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"\\"One for the Money\\" is the first Stephanie Plum novel by Janet Evanovich. I had read many reviews for the Plum series but many sounded like it was geared mainly toward women readers, but I enjoyed it much more than I expected. Stephanie Plum, a thirty year old woman who has lost her job and sold off most of her personal belongings, goes to work as a bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie who is a bail bondsmen. By blackmail, she gets a case that would pay her $10,000 for bringing in Joe Morelli, a cop who is charged with murder. Morelli was also one of Stephanie's former lovers who took her virginity. This novel is funny and I really enjoyed reading it and will continue to read this series that is up to number Thirteen at the moment."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved it. The characters are wonderful, especially Stephanie and Grandma. I recommend it to everyone who loves mystery, and humor."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I am a writer of non-fiction and fiction myself and when I read One For The Money,I found it well written and with great characters. I had expected to find a super heroine type female bounty hunter, but instead found one that experienced almost exactly what a female of her build would encounter in the real world of bounty hunting. I would say, Janet really did her home work on this one. It held my interest enough I read it all in one day."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was on business for a month in London when I saw a review of the latest book.

Women will want to be her."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My Grandmother suggested this book - after someone suggested it to her. It is the best little secret I have ever read. I couldn't stop laughing at her and her Grandmother. I believe if I was a bounty hunter I would be just as bad - and just as lucky! I challenge you to put it down without finishing it first!

Not that she'd have time, or the money, and we'd have to get a doggy bag for Rex the hamster.This series was recommended to me within a web forum in the same paragraph discussing Elizabeth Peters and Laurell K. Hamilton (the web forum subject we were in&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;go right there, next!) Truly, after all the tortured souls in contemporary series mysteries, Stephanie is a relief. She gets clues wrong, she gets people's hearts right, she gets to Mom&amp;Dad's on time for dinner, secretaries &amp; hookers with info befriend her, she's supported by lifelong friends from childhood (who just happen to be male), and she's smart enough to know when to be afraid. After reading too many series where the female &quot;I&quot; is offended whenever any man comments on her as a woman (like,he outweighs her or outskills her)...Stephanie's a relief! Glad to be a girl, wants to be a girl with bounty hunter skills. On to the 2nd book."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was the beginning of my Steph and Joe addiction. Be warned!

While to some degree Evanovich seems like another Grafton copycat, she has enough originality and style to have her own voice. I'd rank Stephanie Plum on par with Karen Kijewski's Kat Colorado and slightly above Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski, but Kinsey Millhone is still the female P.I. queen."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a fun experience to read a book where the characters are rounded and realistic. Our Heroine, Stephanie Plum has bad hair days, slouchy clothes (not always designer lines) and a quirky job she happens to fall into. The pages turn quickly and the last page leaves you wanting more. Thankfully, Ms. Evanovich has a couple more after &quot;One for the Money&quot;, but she must write faster to satisfy me!Stephanie Plum gets downsized at a lingerie factory. Her family &quot;encourages&quot; her to seek employment from her cousin Vinnie, a bail bondsman who needs a file clerk. Stephanie ends up on his payroll, but as a bounty hunter not a file clerk. Her adventures send her all around the &quot;burg&quot; in Trenton, New Jersey. The results are exploding, tense, empathetic and all around fun.

I greatly enjoyed reading and listening. If you are like me and find it difficult to make time for getting into a good book I recommend spending that time reading One for the Money. Get the audible to go with it so you can keep up in the car or while doing household chores."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Goodreads desciption:Welcome to Trenton, New Jersey, home to wiseguys, average Joes, and Stephanie Plum, who sports a big attitude and even bigger money problems (since losing her job as a lingerie buyer for a department store). Stephanie needs cash--fast--but times are tough, and soon she's forced to turn to the last resort of the truly desperate: family.Stephanie lands a gig at her sleazy cousin Vinnie's bail bonding company. She's got no experience. But that doesn't matter. Neither does the fact that the bail jumper in question is local vice cop Joe Morelli. From the time he first looked up her dress to the time he first got into her pants to the time Steph hit him with her father's Buick, M-o-r-e-l-l-i has spelled t-r-o-u-b-l-e. And now the hot guy is in hot water--wanted for murder.Abject poverty is a great motivator for learning new skills, but being trained in the school of hard knocks by people like psycho prizefighter Benito Ramirez isn't. Still, if Stephanie can nab Morelli in a week, she'll make a cool ten grand. All she has to do is become an expert bounty hunter overnight--and keep herself from getting killed before she gets her man.Why did I pick this one?Well....to be honest. I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I wanted to see the movie because it looked cute and a bit funny. I have this OCD problem to where I NEED to read a book before I watch the movie it was made after. So I cheated and took a mini vacation to read this one for fun.I heard that this series was good from my mom (ya I know I know...). But she's cool beans I swear. ;-)Then I heard that it was being made into a movie. Then the movie preview came out and it looked kinda funny. Like a cute romantic-mystery-comedy thing. So I picked up the book....and read it all in one day.So what did I think?It wasn't what I expected. Like I mentioned above, I thought it would be cutesy. It was...some of the time. But it was pretty hardcore as far as the crime stuff goes. I won't go into too much detail on here but you'll have to read it to see.There were some funny lines that Stephanie lets loose. I liked her personality. She was a very independent likeable character. I liked her a lot.Joe was definately swoon worthy in my book. Any guy that has that much swag in his step is a generally hot guy in my book. The more swag, the hotter he is.The whole story had really good twists and turns that kept the plot thickening. I thought it really was a good story and I'll be reading the rest of them.I think one of the best parts about reading this book is because it was set in the early 90s so the clothing style is hilarious. Spandex shorts, hoop earings, reebok hightops, and cherry red glow in the dark lipstick. Oh man...I can only imagine. I was literally laughing out loud on that tidbit.The scenes in this were really fun to read. I loved pretty much everything about it. The gritty heat, the people...everything.I loved the interaction between Joe and Stephanie. Their banter is so funny is had me grinning and giggling.I really really enjoyed this book and I'm sure that the rest will be just as good. They're a pretty quick and easy read which is good for a mini vacation.Let me make this point...the crime and sinisterness is this book is VERY crazy and a bit hardcore. This isn't cute and fuzzy crime...it's pretty dirty.Favorite Quotes:Just the career move I'd been hoping for-filing for Vinnie. Of all my relatives, Vinnie was my least favorite. Vinnie was a worm, a sexual lunatic, a dog turd. \\"What does he pay?\\" I asked.This is no big deal, I told myself. Nothing to worry about...only a criminally insane, two-hundred-and-fifty pound man standing in the hall, calling me names.Morelli grinned. \\"You're a marshmellow. Soft and sweet and when you get heated up you go all gooey and delicious.\\""},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"If you are looking for a fun read that is not to deep and makes you laugh this book fits the bill. The characters do not take themselves too seriously. While some of the scenes are a bit far fetched they mesh with the overall tone of the book. I class this as a good beach read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Enjoyed this book from the moment I started reading it. Evanovich has a great sense of humor! I think everyone can identify with the main character."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really tired to get into this book but I couldnt get past chapter 4 or 5. I enjoy a good mystery or action book but there was way to much slow paced details for my taste. I couldnt finish it."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"You have to like Stephanie Plum. Funny and entertaining.Definitely will read more of her books in the future. Easy to read"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book has everything! Suspense, comedy, drama and action! I'm not a big reader but this book kept my attention for the entire ride. On to the next!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Loved this book, loved the character !!! Takes a look into an uncommon line of work. Well written. I will definitely read the whole series. If you like the Alphabet series (A is for...etc) you'll like this entertaining series. Thank you, Janet..."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This book was a fun easy read. I liked the story line and thought it was well paced. Stephanie Plum was a very likable heroine."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This was my first Stephanie Plum novel and I intend to read the rest. Really fun/easy to read. I found myself laughing a lot at the dialogue. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This is the first book in the Stephanie Plum mystery series. It sets the stage for the following books, and it happens to be one excellent story.Stephanie Plum is a broke, out-of-work lingerie buyer, with mounting bills and a repo man after her car. She has a nagging mother, complacent father, and a wacky, off-the-wall grandmother. And that is just in the first chapter. She goes to work as a skip tracer for her Uncle Vinnie. Her first assignment, which would bring her $10,000, is to bring in a cop named Joe Morelli, who happens to be the guy that stole her sweet virginity years earlier.Janet Evanovich brings together an outstanding group of characters who are all pretty well-developed. The storyline is very nicely defined behind her descriptive writing language, peppered with humor that will make you laugh out loud several times. Stephanie Plum is a smart, witty, exciting character in the world of mystery novels, and this first one is a good, solid effort.The book is loaded with plot twists, and the ending happens so quickly in this already-fast-paced book, it totally comes about as a shocking surprise. The suspense is superb. ONE FOR THE MONEY is a very entertaining read, and Evanovich does a super job of setting the stage for the following novels in the series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Evanovich's &quot;One for the Money&quot; is definetly a book I'd recommend for those who love light mystery book. This book combines the aspects of mystery, humor, and suspense to create a fascinating novel. The good thing about this book was that once you started reading it you were interested the whole way through. There were no slow or dull parts; each chapter and a new and exciting adventure."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"_One for the Money_ is the first book in the Stephanie Plum series. It is a light-hearted and hilarious mystery about Stephanie Plum, who becomes a rather inept bounty hunter for her cousin Vinnie(no grand specimen of humanity). Her first job is to bring in Joe Morelli, cop and murder suspect with whom she happens to have a romantic(or unromantic, depending on how you think of it) history. All the supporting characters are funny, Stephanie herself is a hoot(&quot;hoot&quot; is just the kind of word that comes to mind when you think of her), the mystery is satisfying, and there's a touch of rather antagonistic, comedic romance."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I loved this book. I have read all five books in the series in less than a week. I can't wait for the next installment!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"My mom gave me One for the Money over xmas break and now I've ordered the next three in the series. I found the beginning tough to get through - the story was very candid about things I found somewhat offensive, but I stuck with it and was really happy with the ending. I remember that I didn't actually laugh until page 64. I knew it was supposed to be funny but was too busy being offended. I don't know what it was on page 64 but it was clearly funny to me - from then on I loved the book. Really loved this book is a must have if you enjoy mysteries. I also read J.A. Jance's JP Beaumont series."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Don't know why I picked up *One For The Money* when I saw it (and the next two) at the bookstore, but after reading the blurbs, I bought them all. Hey, a heroine from my birth state! (Can't call it my home state because the Air Force moved us six months later.) She's expected at her parental abode for the occasional dinner [beats microwave frozen] and has to expect advice with the food... Her Grandma is even more eccentric than my late Granny was... Taking on a job for which she has no experience because she's got to have the cash [God forbid you should move back home]... Sounded as if the book could be funny -- and it is. I felt for poor Stephanie as she got her on-the-job training the hard way, but that didn't stop me from laughing. The byplay between Ms. Plum and Joe Morelli is the highlight of the book. (The revenge she took at 19 for Joe taking her virginity at 16 was too rough for real life but very amusing for fiction.) The scenes with them (especially! ! the conversation after Ms. Plum wore her &quot;slut outfit&quot;) help lighten a story that has some very ugly customers. One is a sadistic sicko. I'm glad he's not real -- I don't have to feel guilty for spending much of the book hoping someone would blow him away. I stayed up too late to finish this book last night and I'm paying for it today, but it was worth it. Ann E. Nichols"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"What a book. This was hilariously funny. Stephanie Plum is from NJ and having some money problems. Sold her furniture, her car has gotten repo and next she will be needing a place to live if she doesn't come up with an idea fast. She goes to see her cousin Vinnie ( Bail bondsman ) looking for a job. The job had just been filled but the bounty hunter he used was having surgery.

It combined humorous times with real life struggles of a single young woman struggling in the world. Great reading."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Real characters, a decent plot with realistic consequences to both good and bad decisions made by a spunky cast. Over the top at times, but an enjoyable romp."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Really loved this book--it was serious in places, but mostly just funny. The characters are a hoot. All-in-all a great read."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend recommended reading mysteries by Janet Evanovich, \\"if you want to laugh.\\" One of my favorite dealers had a clearance sale with several of her titles included so I took this as a sign I was to read this author extensively. If the remainder of the books in the series is as good as this, my friend was correct and I chose well. Instead of starting to read from the middle of the series, however, I also picked up the first \\"Stephanie Plum\\" (the hero of this fun serial) installment. I did so due to the fact that one wants background information on one's long-term associations and this relationship has the promise of being a LONG one.The reader meets Stephanie Plum when: she has been out of work (as a women's underwear buyer for a major department store) for six months, has had to sell most of her belongings to buy food and pay rent and is in the process of getting her car repossessed. She is desperate for a job, applies for one as a filing clerk for a Bail Bondsman but is told there is much more money to be made as a Bounty Hunter. Thus, she dives into a world of criminals as ill-prepared as possible. Her lack of preparedness is glaring when her first \\"wanted\\" is Joseph Morelli, ex-boyfriend and a presently suspended cop accused of a cold-blooded murder, a charge for which he skipped bail. Ms. Plum will earn $10,000 if she can return Mr. Morelli to custody. Her efforts to complete this task are fraught with danger, humor, a tour of Trenton, New Jersey and a decent mystery.There are graphic descriptions of violent acts, intense language, and inappropriate use of fire arms (I may never eat another roast chicken with a straight face) contained in this book. This is not a book that will stretch the imagination (I had the culprit pegged by page 100) nor challenge the beliefs of the reader. It is not meant to do either. Its target is a fun, rainy day/vacation read and it scores a perfect bullseye. I will enjoy spending many such days with my new buddy, Stephanie Plum."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Look forward to reading more of her books. Easy reading andkeeps you interested; a page turner. Minimum 'bad' language, whichI really appreciate."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I ordered the book on the recommendation of a friend and I'm sure I will like it after reading the summary, but I have not read it yet."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I have fallen in love with this series! I have just started reading this series in the past week and I have already gotten up to the fifth book!! I am in love with Janet as a writer and Stephanie Plum! Stephanie and I have so much in common!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"This one is just too funny. I laughed a lot during this book! I love how it isn't just romance, there is enough in there but not the while book. I wouldn't say that this is an all ages book.Late teens to adults. Great fun read though!!!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I was looking for an easy, mystery-type book to read on vacation. This turned out to be perfect but now I'm no longer on vacation & I've kept downloading the next book in the series. I downloaded #6 today.

It was so good and I hope that many people get to experience the excellent and delighted work of Janet Evanovitch as she truly has a great sense of humor. It seems that with Stephanie Plum that Murphy's law is perpetually in effect but by some stroke of last minute luck she comes out on top of things and wins the day. The book was received in excellent condition and arrived from Amazon a day before being due. Thank you for you beautiful and prompt service."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I knew, in this year of 2012, Janet Evanovich brought this \\"One for the Money\\" to the movies. My daughter had read 15 of the Stephanie Plum novels and loved them. So before I watched the movie, I wanted to read the novel first. Novels are usually better than the movies.I ordered an android book for my tablet. I could not, put this novel down. I love the easy writing of Janet. I am on Novel 5. Love it, Love it, Love it. Janet Evanovich now has 18 novels. Wow I can't wait to read all of them."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"A friend gave me book #6 in the Stephanie Plum series, saying she thought I'd enjoy the humor in all the books, since I'm a writer myself.She was spot on. After finishing #6, I went in search of all the books in order, starting with this first one, One for the Money.This review is really about the series as a whole. The characters and situations are often outrageous, particularly the antics of Grandma Mazur and the descriptions and dialog of ex-hooker, Lula. The books are fast reads and laugh-out-loud funny at times. I continued reading, enjoying books #2 through maybe #11 or #12, until the characters and situations began to get a bit stale for me. I mean, how long can Stephanie string along both Morelli and Ranger?I think it was the fried chicken plot in book #15 that finally made me put the series down. I bought #16 but haven't been motivated to read it so far, or to buy any more of the books. I don't know how many Ms. Evanovich has planned, but if the series ends without Stephanie ending up with Morelli, there better be a darned good reason why, or I'm going to be more than a tad upset. :)"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"\\"...Okay, so you know she doesn't die trying, since there are several other books in this series, but I had to say it anyway. I don't know if you could tell, but I thought this book was kind of awful, which really disappointed me. I've heard so many people rave about this series, about how funny it is, and all I can say is that I have no idea what they were talking about. I only finished reading One for the Money because I hate leaving a book unfinished. I might pick up the second book just to give Evanovich a second chance, but I'm certainly not going to go out of my way to find a copy.Stephanie is just ridiculous. The woman is a total joke. If you're going to take a job as a bounty hunter, wouldn't you figure it's a good idea to prepare yourself? Even if getting a gun and learning to use it isn't her first idea, I'd have thought she'd be smart enough to pick up a can of defense spray right off or to enroll herself in some kind of self-defense or martial arts class. Request to meet with one of her cousin's other recovery agents to learn some things, or try to find a book or something......Back to Stephanie and her new vocation, however. Her incompetence leads to a lot of things happening that are less than fantastic, and I am puzzled as to how she managed not to get herself killed. If it weren't for the hot douchebag who wrote lewd poems about her on bathroom walls after seducing her in high school and the sexy and mysterious ex-Special Forces bounty hunter, she probably would have been dead before the end of one week....\\"For the full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:[...]"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Crime and comedy with a heroine with moxie equal WIN. Yes, the ending of this book is tied up too neatly, but I was on the edge of my seat before then, and the voice of Stephanie Plum is so fun to read and re-read. She's one of my favourite heroines. Smart yet dumb, a soft-touch yet tough, lazy yet a go-getter, sexy yet daggy, independent yet attached to family. And funny as hell. If she was more deeply feeling and not SO blas&eacute; about everything, she'd be near perfect. But it's comedy, so... Yeah, I'd still rather she was a deeper character. As for the series, I think stopping at 12 and inventing your own ending of who she ends up with, Ranger or Morelli (I choose Morelli) is the way to go. The best plots and characterizations are up to 12 (the best plot), before the series drops right down to stupidity and re-hashing the love triangle.One For the Money establishes what will be the sexual tension between Stephanie and Morelli, and HE is one of my favourite heroes (in my head he looks nothing like the actor who played him)."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was absurd, funny, and clever, but mostly I think it was because I would love to be as badass as Stephanie Plum. She's spunky, sexy, entertaining, and makes the perfect character for this wild goose chase of a plot. Personally, I prefer books that have a bit more substance to their plots and characters but if you're looking for a book with lots of comedic entertainment value then this book is a great choice!"},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"I really like the Stephanie Plum series and decided to start at the beginning. There is actually a different reader on One for the Money than on some of the later books I have listened to but both readers have been great. Fun books and I would recommend this to anyone--funny as well as a bit of a mystery."},{"Title":"One for the Money","review":"Very funny. This is my first Evanovich book and I really liked it.
