There are quite a few people reviewing this book and suggesting works Patrick O'Brien, especially if interested in nautical fiction. I would also like to include anything by James L. Nelson. He writes nautical fiction with battle scenes and stories that suck you in at the same level of the Sharpe books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"This book is about the battle. The battle scene is one of the longest I've ever read, and every word is worth it.Pre-battle, the book is enjoyable, though marred with a continuity error here and there. Sharpe needs to get home from India. The ship he's on gets taken by the French (in circumstances I didn't find absolutely believable, but let that be), and he ends up on a man-of-war. Of course, as in every Sharpe book, he ends up in a love affair. It's about as believable as they always are. Some of the secondary characters, particularly Captain Chase and the merchant Fairley, stand out.The battle is wonderful, appalling, graphic, gory, exhausting, vivid and terrifying. No, Cornwell's no Shakespeare (and he's no O'Brian, either) but he writes a mean battle scene, and this is one of his best. As a non-specialist in the period, I didn't find many errors; and, again as a non-specialist, I found his characterization of Nelson especially vivid.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the period and in non-stop, no-holds-barred battle scenes."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, fresh from the wars in India, is on his way hometo England, to sign up for a company that is called the \\"green jacket.\\" He is young, carries stolen jewels, falls in love with a woman that he cannot have named Lady Grace Hale, he becomes involved in a piracy, and he becomes involved in the death of Lady Grace Hale's husband!

Sharpe is on his way home from India when he meets up with the captain of the HMS Calliope. After helping the captain get some money back, Sharpe finds out that his shipmates aboard the ship home include a former enemy, a member of parliament accompanied by his aloof wife Grace. Filled with stirring battles, suspense and passionate love, Sharpe's Trafalger is a rolicking adventure yarn where Sharpe meets the great Admiral Nelson in a battle to save England from invasion. This is a fun book, but it is not one of my favorites. I have no problems with it except that sometimes the story is overdramatic. However, this is an important addition to the Sharpe's series as it establishes much of what happens later in the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I have read and read the Sharp's series several times as well as the Starbuck series by Cornwell.

The battle scenes are riveting and horrendous - it is utterly amazing what these sea warriors lived through. Sharpe is his usual indestructible self, which strains imagination after awhile. I was disturbed by Sharpe's willingness to cold bloodedly murder a pathetic antagonist who tries to blackmail him. It took some of the sheen off his heroic character, and doesn't ring true. Still a great read if you're into this genre."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"As a General Rule I adore Bernard Cornwell's books. I've read all but one of his Sharpe and Starbuck books and have all of the Sharpe movies as well. As a big Hornblower fan I welcomed Sharpe's Trafalgar but found myself left wanting.The book opened well (the first scenes in India were first rate) I found the characters enjoyable sans a few minor flaws such as the pressing of East India men (forbidden by law) without hesitation and repeating it to Nelson. The willingness of at British Capt to try to break a blockade in a French SOL, (Given the realities quite a stretch but in keeping with the captians name.) The fights were not as inspiring as normal. (I think Cornwel may be out of his element here as was Sharpe.) These were small and wouldn't mean much if fact these at might not occur to people unfamilar with Forester's Hornblower books. But there was one scene which stopped the book for me cold.During one vital scene the Sharpe confronted a foe armed with a pistol in the dark bowels of a ship foils him by dashing the oil lantern to the floor now forcing his for to confront him in a darkened room with only one shot. A proper re-write of the page would be someting like this:'...Sharpe realized his mistake just as the lantern left his hand shattering on the dry wood, in a moment the dry deck fed by the oil and flame leapped to a firey life as the most feared foe of all wooden ships made itself plain. His foe screemed as the fire began to consume him, his struggles feeding the flames and spreading them to the baggage...'Cornwell could have made Sharpe come above decks, pretend he heard the shouts and alert the crew in time to save the ship but not in time to save the clumsey fool who dropped the lantern, but he didn't. Perhaps the book deserved another star or a half but I can't give it."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In the series beginning with Sharpe's Rifles, Bernard Cornwell took his hero Richard Sharpe through the battles of the Peninsula Campaign against Napoleon's armies, and on to Waterloo. Then, after backgrounding Sharpe's rise to officerdom in India with a four book series, Cornwell was faced with transitioning Sharpe from India back to England, and then to Spain. He starts this series of adventures by putting Richard in the middle of a major sea battle (move over, Hornblower!). We last left Richard Sharpe after the Siege of Gawilghur, where he revenged himself on the renegade officer he was pursuing, but his colonel decided that Richard was just not going to fit in the Officers' Mess. The colonel persuades Richard to accept a transfer to one of these new fangled rifle regiments that are being formed back in England. After all, that isn't the real army and maybe there will be a place for someone who isn't a real officer. After the merchant ship on which Richard, and a snooty Lord and his beautiful wife, are traveling becomes separated from their convoy, they are captured by a French ship of the line-under suspicious circumstances. The captain of the merchant ship sails away with the Frenchman, and takes Richard's poke of jewels with him. Sailing under a prize crew and as captives, Richard and his traveling companions are rescued by a ship of the Royal Navy that is chasing the Frenchman. Joining the navy vessel, and working as an honorary Royal Marine, Richard and the Royal Navy pursue the Frenchman around the Cape of Good Hope and almost to Spain. Just as they might catch up, they run right into the French fleet being chased by Lord Nelson on the way to the Battle of Trafalgar. Both ships join up with their respective fleets and participate in the historic battle. By a quirk of fate, of course, the two ships end up in battle and Richard gets his jewels back, and the girl, of course. Richard Sharpe is for the army what C. S. Forrester's Hornblower was to the navy - and I think the stories and the character are better. We still don't know how Ensign Richard Sharpe, with his poke of jewels and the girl, ends up as an impoverished quartermaster lieutenant in a beaten British army in Spain. There must be several more exciting tales to come, and I am looking forward to them."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell once again out does himself with Shape's latest adventure in the era of the French Revoloution.

But of course, the voyage is not as smooth and sweet as English tea: treachery lurks ahead. It is one of England's many enemies, in the form of a French warship called the Ravenant, which has been terrorizing the British in the Indian Ocean. Yet, the Ravenant possesses a treasure that could very well reignite the war between Indian and Britain.

Bernard Cornwell has now sent young Ensign Richard Sharpe on the high seas, and no matter what the situation, Sharpe does the only thing he's good at, killing. The book colorfully describes the Battle of Trafalgar with rich and flowing detail. Placing the book down for a nights sleep will keep you in suspense and longing for the next day to hurriedly arrive. In no movie theater on the face of this planet can excitement be as influential as in this epic. Bernard Cornwell has truly out done himself now by placing a young army officer in the middle of a boiling naval battle. French cannons are not the only aspect of danger to tear at Sharpe's heart, but love as well. An aristocrat married to another has done what no Indian warlord was capable of doing, subjugating Richard Sharpe. The callused heart and war torn body soon gave yield to love. Sharpe's Trafalgar is truly a must read."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is absolutely at his best when he is writing about either that lineal ancestor of James Bond, Richard Sharpe, or when he is writing about sailing. Well, here he does both and the result is truly satisfying. In the best tradition of the Sharpe's series, the odds against are enormous, but Sharpe wins through with a combination of brass nerves, lightning fast steel and a golden lady ready for the winning. Pay attention, another class will be in session to teach us Colonials one more lesson from the English book of battle history as horrifying chaos of Trafalgar unfolds as only Richard Sharpe could have seen it.I can end this with only one thought: sit back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Like some of the reviewers, I felt that it started much too slowly for a Sharp's adventure and I also felt that it had far too much on his love(?) interest. The last 1/3 or so was equal to his other books but I get the feeling that Cornwell has generated a book to prove to his agent or to his publishers that he can write &quot;sea stories&quot; to take up the Patrick O'Brian flag. We will all need to wait to see if Sharp fights his next battle on land, sea, or in the bed room!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The 17th Richard Sharpe book finds author Cornwell touched with a bit of \\"Flashman\\" syndrome&#65533;that is, the desire to place a swashbuckling title character on the scene of every major event of their lifetime, meeting all manner of historical personages. In George McDonald Fraser's Flashman series, this is acceptable, as the whole enterprise is comedic. However, the Sharpe series is a much more serious and realistic effort at historical fiction, and it detracts from it to have Sharpe shoehorned into the defining naval engagement in the history of the British empire. That said, the book is still fairly entertaining stuff sure to please any fan of the series.The gist of it is that Sharpe is making his way from service in India to join the 95th Rifles, the green-jacketed regiment that is his home for most of the series. Loaded down with jewels looted from the Sultan Tipoo, he books passage on an East India Company ship. There's the usual cast of characters here, a bluff Englishman or two who like Sharpe, a Lord who very much doesn't, a pretty young woman to fall in love with, and a few people who aren't what they seem. Intertwined with various shipboard skulking and skullduggery is a plot involving a French raider. This eventually leads to Sharpe's transfer to British naval ship. a lengthy cat and mouse game with the raider, and ultimately a meeting with the legendary Admiral Nelson and finally the great battle.The shipboard fighting is all extremely well described, and one gets a full sense of the terror and horror of naval warfare of the era. Similarly the shipboard deceit and treachery is ingenious and nasty. Less interesting is the love affair of Sharpe's, and given the intensity and outcome, it doesn't dovetail with the earlier written, though chronologically later Sharpe books. All in all, it's wonderful to have another Sharpe book, but one wonders how the series can continue without Cornwell having to shoehorn him into more and more unlikely venues."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The year is 1805 and Ensign Richard Sharpe is preparing to return to England in order to join the newly formed 95th Rifle Regiment. In the course of his preparations , he encounters Captain Joel Chase of HMS Pucelle at the home of a slimy Indian merchant who is attempting to cheat the two officers. The two officers become friends in spite of the vast disparity in rank , and their fortunes are intertwined in the course of this somewhat contrived tale.Sharpe sails on the East India Company's ship Calliope , has an affair with the lovely young wife of an aristocratic English lord , encounters Anthony Pohlmann (who we remember from &quot;Sharpe's Triumph&quot; as the leader of the Mahratta confederation armies) , and falls prey to a French warship , the Revenant. In order for Sharpe to be present at Trafalgar , Cornwell has the Calliope recaptured by Joel Chase and the Pucelle and young Sharpe joins in the sea chase for the Revenant which culminates at the battle of Trafalgar.The saving grace of the entire tale is Cornwell's description of the epic battle at sea! Even tho' some of the other writing is not up to the standard we expect from the author , it is more than compensated by the battle scene.I personally believe this novel to be a bit of a &quot;fill-in&quot; novel in order to get Sharpe to another theater of activity. Not one of my favorites in the series , but still three stars-plus."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I've marched with Sharpe since the very beginning.

She utters the best capsule description of Sharpe: \\"You're like a weed, Richard. You can grow anywhere.\\" Also, there's reminiscing of his orphan childhood, ignominious capture, rescue and pursuing the traitors, breakfasting with an admiral, and becoming a Marine for a crucial month. This is Sharpe \\"off-duty?\\"There are lots of interesting tidbits about fighting a sailing man-o-war, but little of the complex and esoteric business of sailing her that would confuse a lubberly admirer of the Sharpe series. The endpapers display a highly useful cutaway diagram of the type of ship in which Sharpe goes to battle. The description of ship-board battle during the crucial encounter off Trafalgar is better and bloodier than anything I've read in standard naval fare, focusing as Cornwell does on the stinking and bloodied men and not the cool captain as series hero. The French & Spanish line of battle was \\"capping the T,\\" normally the decisive maneuver in sea battle, but Nelson smashed it with his audacity and firepower. The relative casualties of the French & Spanish vs. the British, given in Cornwell's historical note, are simply astonishing, given the mutual slaughter described here. Note: there has got to be at least one more book to get Sharpe into his Rifles and then to Spain (yeah!)."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"This book centers around how Richard Sharpe left India and eventually found himself in the middle of the Battle of Trafalgar, the most defining naval battle during the Napoleonic Wars. The book is predictable though, the side plot of Sharpe and a prominent female character is filler to an otherwise muindane journey. The author though describes a good picture of how its like to be on a ship two hundred years ago. He describes the parts of a ship pretty well and the sounds and smells of the ship pretty well. The interactions between the characters in the book were pretty predictable, you just knew that the characters would now do anything surprising, the heroes would behave heroic, the aristocrats would behave like snobs, and the cicophants would behave cowardly. Despite it all, the book was pretty enjoyable and would probably be good for younger readers more than older readers. The book reminds me of a hollywood movie that uses a recycled plot with high profile actors. But despite all of the mediocre shortcomings of this particular book, I got out of it a good impression of a slice of life in the 19th century where all the evolution of today's world came."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Sharpe's Trafalgar brought the naval battle to life, even more than going through the wax work museum thirty years ago.

But he does, and it's a highly entertaining read.Sharpe's Trafalgar is set at the conclusion of the trilogy of novels in India in which he obtains some treasure, gets promoted to be an officer after saving the life of General Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington), and deals with the traitor Dodd. Shipping home to join the 95th Rifles, Sharpe initially takes passage on an East Indiaman, and finds an old opponent as one of the passengers. Treachery follows and the ship is captured by the French.However, as the story is about Sharpe's Trafalgar, we know that he will not remain a prisoner of war for long. And sure enough, after an involved series of events, including the obligatory rescue of a lady in distress, Sharpe and his fellow passengers find themselves guests on a Royal Navy 74 gun ship of the line, chasing a French battleship half-way round the world. Until both ships arrive off Cape Trafalgar on 21st October 1805 ...As usual Bernard Cornwell has done a great deal of research so that the Napoleonic era battles he describe seem real, and in the historical note at the end he explains that many of the events described during the battle of Trafalgar were based on things which really happened.The next novel after this in the chronological sequence is \\"Sharpe's Prey,\\" the main action of which is set two years later in 1807 when Napoleon's continental blockade results in war between Britain and Denmark. That book also tells you what happens to Sharpe's relationship with Grace, the heroine of \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\".If you liked the other Sharpe books, you will like this one."},{"Title":"Seeds of Inspiration: Deva Flower Messages","review":"As an example of channeled material from inner realms, Dorothy Maclean's book Seeds of Inspiration is excellent, especially for anyone interested in our relationship with the creative intelligences within nature.

We shut out eyes so only a crack is open, lookin' through our eyelshes, and pretend we live on the moon. The lights we see? They're stars, as many as the sky can hold. And sirens? That's wild wolves howlin' at the moon. If there's shots fired, we say it's the light of the stars crackin' the darkness...&quot; So begins Barbara Joosse's nameless young narrator's story of the dangerous and tenuous life in the inner city. When his beloved brother, Richard, stops coming home at night, he and his mother realize he's become a gang banger. &quot;We can't pretend no more,&quot; she says. &quot;We gotta be strong now.&quot; His mother implores him, &quot;Don't you be hanging' out with those bangers, Richard. Don't. Be somebody for this world.&quot; But Richard is caught up in the life, &quot;walkin' that walk, like he's King Stuff.&quot; When Richard comes home injured and bandaged, Mama and Richard's little brother hatch a plan, a plan to take back the neighborhood. &quot;We call 'em Peace Walks. Every night now, there's family on the street. We take turns walkin' the night. When it's my turn, I shut my eyes so only a slit is open, and I look through my eyelashes. I see streetlights, like before, but now I see flashlights, too. Stars crackin' the darkness.&quot; Ms Joosse's bittersweet picture book, geared to little brothers and sisters, &quot;the stars in the darkness,&quot; is neither judgemental nor sentimental, but truthful and filled with hope. Her evocative text, rich in imagery and magic, is compelling, written in realistic language and complemented by Gregory Christie's powerfully bold and expressive illustrations. Together word and art paint a vivid portrait of life in the inner city, family love, and the courage and strength to try and make a difference. With an Author's Note about the real Richard, to enhance the story and help open important discussions, and a comprehensive list of resources on gang prevention, Stars In The Darkness is an inspiring narrative that shouldn't be missed, and definitely one of the best new books of 2002.

A canon results when somebodies impose a boundary around a subset of these writings. Such action is not an obscure event. Since it requires strenuous, official action that is easily detectable because of the impact upon the religious community from that moment onward. Such action and impact can not be seen in the Vedic Upanishads, Taoism, etc., but it can be seen in Judaism and then Christianity. Later such action and impact can be seen in Islam as well (in the 7th century under the third Caliph, Uthman).This is where Dungan starts to get fancy. He asserts that the range of meaning for the term \\"canon\\" needs to be understood as a part of the rise of the Greek city-state. Fancy or not, that is what etymology is. No doubt one would want to study the uses of the term canon in order to understand its etymology. Etymology of the term canon shows that it meant more than a reed as a measuring stick. For example, in the sixth century BCE Pythagoras applied measurement to musical tones and came up with kanonikoi or \\"standard tones.\\" Such measurement permeated Greek philosophy as well. In a Hellenistic culture, early Christianity adopted the idea of canon as measurement, but Clement of Rome and Origen of Alexandria know no idea of a canon as a set of official doctrines. In fact, according to Dungan, no Christian scholar before the 4th century refers to \\"the canon.\\"At just about the turn of the era, Greek philosophical thought rebelled against the idea of pseudonymous authorship. A novel practice began in the first century BC/BCE. Dionysius of Halicarnassus made a biography of an Athenian orator and concluded it with a grading of the 60 books ascribed to the orator. By 230 AD/CE Diogenes Laetius uses a tripartite division of genuine, disputed, and spurious. So Eusebius was on firm *philosophical* grounds when he argued for the authenticity of books. To this he added apostolic succession. Apostolic succession has become a religious tenet among some Christians, but at the time of Eusebius it was also a solid philosophical argument.Eusebius' work is not a singular opinion but a compilation of the work of other scholars from the previous two centuries. This is the high point of Dungan's book. Because every book now in the New Testament canon had been challenged, it had to be defended. Just before the Council of Nicaea, Eusebius had published his _Ecclesiastical History_. After the Council of Nicaea and Constantine's order of 50 Bibles, Eusebius' analysis of the selection of scripture became the last word. Writers began to refer to \\"the canon\\" and the debate withered and disappeared. It was not until the 18th century that Eusebius began to be reassessed.Incidentally, after Constantine called the Council of Nicaea, Eusebius was put on the spot by being asked by the Emperor if he would accept the idea that Jesus was \\"of one substance\\" with the Father. There is no record of any objection by Eusebius or any other bishop to the Emperor's involvement into the affairs of the Christian Church."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"I don't blame anyone for giving this 5 stars, but I'm going against the trend and giving it four. Why? Well, let me begin with its good points:First, it does an excellent job suggesting a cultural/philosophical, and primarily Hellenistic, basis for the process of canonization. This one will undoubtedly stir discussion, if not derision, among some Evangelicals. On the other hand, showing just how thorough the legitimization of the eventually canonized texts was, through the rigorous historical work of Eusebius, should please Bible-lovers by showing that the choice of books which was selected was far from arbitrary, rooted in purely historical motives, etc.Dungan does well here in capturing an angle that will both irritate, but also comfort, sola scriptura folks. On the one hand, all of this nonsense about conspiracy can be done away with in discussions about gnostic and questionable works, which Dungan shows clearly don't pass historical muster. On the other hand, what we are left with as \\"canon\\" is the result of alleged politicization of the church through Constantine, and this brings me to some of the mild drawbacks of the book.In a nutshell, it has become fashionable in recent years to use Constantine as a whipping boy in church history, thereby raising a cloud of suspicion over every project to which his name can be attached--an influence which gave the Church \\"power,\\" and all too likely, we are led to believe, tainted the \\"purity\\" of an early age (and also one with many more loose ends--enough to allow for the disintegration of the Christian faith, one is often led in these discussions to suspect--though not necessarily by Dungan--if it wasn't for the artificial solidification of the Christian cultural base through the assertion of crass political force). While Dungan somewhat avoids the temptation to pass judgment on the unarguable political influence of Constantine, it is clear that he wishes for us to be left wondering about any decisions regarding the canon that evolve after the time of Eusebius. And this leaves a HUGE question completely unaddressed--the inclusion of the various deuterocanonical works in earlier Bibles, and their expulsion after the Reformation. This is a major divinding point in Christendom, and it is really not even mentioned by Dungan. One can connect the dots--these books were approved after the Constantinization of the church, so therefore, \\"draw your own conclusions as to whether or not this process was legit.\\" It's an important point to consider, but Dungan's failure to address it seems a bit fishy to me.One very very small final point. At the end, he tacks on a short discussion about how the development of the concept of Scriptural canon impacted Islam. This is an interesting question, but one that has the \\"feel\\" of being added primarily because an editor suggested to \\"put something in there about Islam...that's a hot topic nowadays.\\" It is a fun teaser, but the subject is raised, and dropped, so suddenly that it seems like it would have been better off not being mentioned at all--or being brought in a paranthetical or a footnote. It left the book with a \\"tacked on\\" feeling--albeit it provocative one.In all, a worthwhile read, but one that should be read with full awareness of the tendency to use Constantine (and \\"Constantinian Christianity\\") as an easy, and oversimplified, topic these days. On hte other hand, the work excels in showing just how well grounded the selection of texts at least through the time of Eusebius was, thereby \\"hushing\\" much of the noise that is raised these days by those trying to revive the \\"suppressed\\" secrets of gnostic works."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"Written by David L.

And it makes for a fascinating read.The Jews insisted on the truth of their one monotheistic God. Although they had many writings about God, these hadn't formed a canon before the arrival of Christianity. Nor had the writings of any other religion.In fact, Christianity was the first religion to insist on a canon. From the first, \\"Any deviation from the tradition that the church received was a dire threat to the whole community\\" (p 25). Paul insists that everyone adhere to tradition, as does 1 Clement, in a letter that was still being read in churches in the time of Eusebius.By about 100 years after Christ's death Christianity had spread widely and had such an impact that it now had to contend with heretics. It was the era of the Christian apologists. Irenaeus responded to the heretic \\"Valentinus' accusation that the Christian gospels were incomplete and were interpreted with a childish literalism\\" (p 45) by insisting that the four gospels were, indeed, the authentic ones.Oh, those Gnostics and their \\"secret\\" knowledge. It was the flood of made-up gospels that led to the four gospels becoming canon.But who was to decide which was a true gospel? There was an orthodox \\"church dispersed throughout the whole world, even to the ends of the earth, (which) has received from the apostles and their disciples this faith\\" (p 46). The church \\"could claim multiple international apostolic successions in each of the great centers\\" (p 47). Church tradition and church authorities decided.Eventually, Christians grew so numerous that pagan philosophers grew alarmed. Celsus and Porphyry wrote long polemics against Christianity. Porphyry is outraged that, as he claims, the entire world has heard of them, but no one is stopping them.And then began the great persecution. Christians were slaughtered, houses of worship were closed, and--and this is important--the Romans demanded that Christians hand over their scriptures so they could be destroyed. This is how closely Christianity had been identified with the canon they believed in.Constantine arrived soon afterwards, and the debate about which books should be included in the canon was soon over.This is a intriguing subject, a terrific and well written book, and yes, you should buy it."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"Over the course of 35 years of teaching a course \\"The Making of the New Testament\\" at U. of TN, Dungan has gathered gems from history and from the research of his many students. This book truly tells how the Bible that would be canonized in 325 at the Council of Nicaea was pieced together, and exposes how many Church fathers prior to that had very different thoughts on Jesus (Marcion, for example, claimed in the 2nd century that Jesus came down from heaven a full-grown man, and Dungan explains why Marcion would believe this based on the gospel of Luke). I've read this book twice so far and I will be reading it again this afternoon."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"Constantine's Bible is at the same time a history of the development of scripture and of the canon. Of course, these two histories are normally seen to be identical; in other words, canon and scripture are synonyms. Early on Dungan explains something of his rationale for this separation of commonly entwined concepts when he observes that \\"We lose sight of something truly important if we use the term canon as a synonym for any and every conglomeration of scripture. In what follows, I will demonstrate that the legal imposition of a kanon (Latin: regula, a rule, regulation) upon Christian scripture along with a kanon of the correct summary of doctrine (the creed), and the enforcement of both with the full power of the Roman government, was a phenomenon unique to fourth - and fifth - century Christianity.\\" (p. 8)In the first chapter \\"What a \`Canon' of Scripture is - and is not\\" Dungan elucidates the distinct concepts of scripture and canon by means of a study of the concepts in other religions. In his comparative religious study Dungan concludes that while a great many religions have the concept of scripture understood as as a set of \\"semidurable, semifluid, slowly evolving conglomeration of sacred texts ... in use by members of a religious tradition\\" over a prolonged period (p. 2). A canon however is different and is taken to be the resulting collection of texts \\"when someone seeks to impose a strict boundary around a smaller subset of writings or teachings\\" (p. 3).Chapters two through to offer historical overviews of the two trends in Christian history. In particular, Dungan locates the appeal to the canon as a legacy of Greek philosophy, especially the concern for accuracy that accompanied the Polis. With it there arose a concern for uniformity across the Christian Churches glimpses of which can be found in the New Testament emphasis on the proper construction of the ekklesia, as demonstrated in the Pastoral Epistles. In in the highlight of the book Dungan examines the tests of authenticity used in Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History; which, quite apart from the role int plays in Dungan's argument is a superb read.While the debate over the content of holy scripture had died down in decades following Marcion's challenge the Christian church had a broadly agreed scripture, it did not however have a canon. This came under the directian of the emporer Constantine had he launched into the political and theological debates that raged throughout the Christian world. One of Constantine's early actions was to order from Eusebius 50 bibles to place in his new state-sponsored church building endeavour. The effect, says Dungan was to creat a Christian canon for the first time: \\"After Constantine's Bible had been produced, and in the tense atmosphere that followed the Council of Nicaea, what bishop would dare use a bible in his cathedral that differed in content from the ones used by the bishops in Constaninople? He would likely be informed upon and investigated. He could lose his office or worse!\\" (p. 122).Hence from this point on, canon=law, where before the language of discussion concerning the authenticity of the New Testament documents had been made with vocabulary such as genuine, spurious, or disputed texts the language was now between canonical (legal) texts and non-canonical (illegal) ones."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"****\\"... emperor Constantine chose, more or less ham-handedly, a set of books henceforth to count as Christian scripture. As often, there is the merest element of truth amid Brown's distortions, and if one wants to know what it is in this case, one might read David L. Dungan's Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament.\\" --Robert PriceA brief comment:In \\"The First Edition of the New Testament, 2000,\\" Professor David Trobisch of the University of Heidelberg examines early Bible manuscripts, and offers a bold new thesis that during the second century A.D., a group of Church 'editors' produced a unified final redaction of a Bible that became the archetype for all later Bible versions. This overturns centuries of belief that the New Testament was compiled gradually over a long period of time, in different locations, harmonized at a later date after Nicea, to be canonized in Athanasius Paschal letter of 367.Constantine's Bible is at large a history of the development of scripture and of the NT canon. Dr. Dungan who in intellectual telepathy with Coote's, \\"Power, politics, and the making of the Bible,\\" adopted the concept, and found role players in Constantine, a Pagan Emperor, and Eusebius, the Arian Bishop of Caesarea, Palestine, stirred unbased doubts on the Canonization process. NT Canon is has a documented ecclesiastical history, that could be searched but has to be proven without doubt. Even an influential theologian as John AT Robinson, could not have consensus on his re dating of NT books, let alone a fictionized History of the New Testament canonization.The author, who grew his book out of a course, he taught for thirty years, on the making of the NT admitted (preface), that he kept changing the focus of his book, expanding the core of the canonization story, to include a non proven social thesis. He then slipped into praising Greek Philosophy, as a prelude to his explanation on the Hellenistic influence on Christianity. Although the writer elaborated on the selection of and defense of each of the 'Catholic' NT canonic books. After decades of writing serious scholarly books, has decided to go with the new wave of Ehrman et al to share the attention of general readers of limited knowledge.Constantine's Fifty Bibles:Few years after the council of Nicea (325), Constantine, wishing to unify Christian worship in the Roman Empire, authorized Eusebius to have 50 Bibles of the holy Scripture, in Greek, copied by professional scribes on fine parchment. In Eusebius own words: \\"Such were the emperor's commands, which were followed by the immediate execution of the work itself, which we sent him in magnificent and elaborately bound volumes of a threefold and fourfold form.\\" (Vita Const. 4.36.37) Eusebius has not uttered a word, on where they were made, but there was no alternative other than to turn to the Alexandrine Church, which had the most equipped scriptorium, and best trained scribes.Codices Vaticanus and Sinaiticus readily admit they are remarkably similar, to compel experts in the field of manuscripts, to believe that they have a common origin. Dr. Gregory, states, \\"This Manuscript (Vaticanus) is supposed, as we have seen, to have come from the same place as the Sinaitic Manuscript. I have said that these two show connections with each other, and that they would suit very well as a pair of the fifty manuscripts written (at Caesarea?) for Constantine the Great.\\" Gregory, The Canon and Text of the NT, pp. 345. Professor FF Bruce's comment should be carefully read, \\"There are several unanswered questions about these assumptuous copies..., the Christian scriptures were being assiduously sought out and destroyed by imperial authority. .... What type of text has been used in these copies? It has frequently been surmised that the Vatican and Sinaitic codices of the Greek scriptures are survivors from this consignment. That is unlikely; apart from some indications that the Vaticanus codex may have been produced in Alexandria, Egypt.\\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A Concise Background:Canon of NT Scripture:The Gospels, acts of the apostles and Paul's letters were written within the first century AD. While the remainder of the New Testament books while being written, other early Christian (Post Apostolic) writings were produced, including the Didache, or, Teachings of the Twelve, Ca. AD 70, I Clement (Ca. 95), the Epistle of Barnabas (Ca. 100), and few letters of Ignatius of Antioch (Ca. 110). According to the Muratorian list, Rome, Ca. AD 200, the basic NT books are the four gospels; the Acts; and letters of Paul. Hebrews, was not included); 1&2 John and Jude; and also the Apocalypse of Peter (Gnostic).The earliest extant list of the books of the NT, where the word Canon was used, dates half a century after Constantine's Edict of Toleration. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria, wrote in his Paschal letter of 367, in the exact same books in number but not exact order of our Bibles (The Catholic letters precede Paul's Epistles). Bishop (First Pope borrowed the Title in 523) Damasus, followed suit, in 382 a letter listing the New Testament books, in their present form, to a bishop in Gaul. Athanasius' defense of orthodoxy and authority which extended for 56 years, never yielding to Arian Emperors, superceded any of his contemporary Roman Bishops, was the key to settling the overlapping alternative Cannons.Post-Apostolic Writings:Early Christian works of the Post-Apostolic Church Fathers open a window into the Early Church. The most important epistles included are the Shepherd of Hermas, First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians; The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians,Romans, Philadelphians, etc. and to Polycarp; The Epistles of Polycarp to the Philippians; the Epistles to Diognetus and Barnabas, and the martyrdom of Polycarp. The Didache crowns them all, being the most ancient surviving, out of the canon, teaching document. An instructional handbook for Catechumens derived directly possibly from Q document, or the synoptic Gospels. This work could have been a consequence of the first Apostolic Council, c.50 C. E. (Acts 15:28). Many early Church experts agree that the original version of the Didache circulated possibly as early as mid first century C. E. Never rejected by any local Church, it was excluded from the canon of scripture, for its lack of apostolic authorship.Didymus Canon:Didymus the Blind, who was appointed by Athanasius to head the glorious Catechetical school, was revered as the foremost Christian scholar of the fourth century and an influential spiritual director of ascetics. Didymus uncensored voice was recovered through the commentaries among the Turah papyri, a massive set of documents discovered in an Egyptian quarry in 1941. This neglected corpus offers an unprecedented glimpse into the internal workings of a Christian philosophical academy in the most vibrant and tumultuous cultural center of late antiquity. By exploring the social context of Christian instruction in the competitive environment of fourth-century Alexandria, Richard A. Layton elucidates the political implications of biblical interpretation. In his commentaries discovered in 1941, Didymus refers to four Apostolic Fathers with frequency. In addition to the 'Shepherd of Hermas', and 'I Clement, which he highly valued, he considered these writings, in a quasi canonical status, and some of which you could read in Codex Sinaiticus, are not in our present New TestamentThe Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance"},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"This is a fine edition to any collection on the compilation of the Christian canon. The author does a fine job in making his point, i.e., that the politics of Constantinian Christianization of the Roman Empire provided the impetus for formalizing what was previously a milieu of sometimes widely disparate interpretations of Christ. Indeed, thought the author doesn't quite come out and say it, Constantine's adoption of the Christian cause as his own was both a blessing and a curse for the faith. It gave the movement permanent stability and acceptance at the same time as dogmatizing what had been a vigorous theological discourse. In a way, the Edict of Milan represented the first bow shot of democracy's victory over monarchial tyranny, but it was soon followed by the Council of Nicea's retreat into doctrinal rigidity and orthodoxy. The issue of canon selection was a natural offshoot of this normalizing process by which the Romans could regulate and control the theologically diverse Christian community. Eusebius' key role in winnowing the flock of the New Testament scriptures is described in some detail, though I would have preferred a bit more discussion on the controversy over the Book of Revelation, still a controversial text much abused and misunderstood by today's naive fundamentalists. Still, this is a good quick read about a process that we live with today."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"This book contains some valuable information for the christian mind in explaining some questionable things the christian church does. Great book for my library."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"\\"For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, ... it is fitting that she should have four pillars ... . From which fact, it is evident that the Word, [...] who was manifested to men, has given us the Gospel under four aspects, but bound together by one Spirit.\\" (III. xi. 8; Ante-Nicene Fathers, 1:428)Constantine's Bibles:To start my comments on the 'Davidci' Dungan insightful book, it may be helpful to remember that Emperor Constantine, baptized by Eusebius at his death bed, had nothing to do with the selection or collation of the New Testament's twenty-seven books. By the late second century, Christians throughout the world had accepted twenty books, including the four gospels, as authoritative guidelines for life. Debates about the other seven did persist into the fourth century; however, the final canon emerged from a consensus of church communities and their leaders, not from an imperial decree. After the Council of Nicaea (325), Constantine authorized the copying and distribution of fifty Bibles, but the editions copied before these fifty do not differ significantly from the editions copied after, something that should have been well clarified by the author.Constantine's Canon:Neither Constantine nor the Council of Nicea, had virtually anything to do with addressing the canon of scripture, that was not even discussed at Nicea. In his 39th Paschal letter, St. Athanasius, the infamous defender of orthodoxy, wrote to the heads of Churches in East and West, the list of the Canon of scripture. The Old testament contained the books of the Septuagint, the Alexandrian Greek translation of the Hebrew bible, and the twenty seven books of the New Testament as we have them now. By the time of Athanasius, or shortly before, the church had reached an informal consensus about most of the writings to be included in the \\"New\\" Testament, with various other post Apostolic writings. In fact, agreement on main books of the NT on this list had been reached in the main centers of early Christianity, more than a century earlier. The process of exhaustive study of most of the books forming the canon had begun even earlier in Alexandria by Clement and origen. However, long before Constantine, 21 books were acknowledged by mostly all Christians (the 4 Gospels, Acts, 13 of Paul, 1 Peter, 1 John. Hebrew in Alexandria and Revelation in Rome. There were other disputed books (James, 2 Peter, 2-3 John, Jude, Ps-Barnabas, Hermas, Didache, Gospel of the Hebrews) and several that were considered heretical (Gospels Thomas, Matthaias, Acts of Peter, Andrew, John, etc.)Thirty years later, in 397, the council of Carthage confirmed Athanasius Alexandrine Canon, sixty years after Constantine's death. Concerning allusions of manuscripts that were burned at the order of Constantine, there is really no mention of such edict either at the order of Constantine or the minutes of the Council of Nicea.Tests for NT Book Canonicity:Two main tests were imposed on any book to be part of the New Testament. Did it come from the time of the apostles? Based on this principles some of the most admired writings, as the Shepherd of Hermas, or the Epistles of Clement, Ignatius, or Polycarp were excluded. Did it agree with what was already known of apostolic teaching and tradition? The second criterion, was the motivation of early church fathers to refute Gnostic Christian writings. This is very articulately stated By Julio Barrera, \\"If the canonical nature of the NT books lies more in their apostolic origins than in mere inclusions in the conciliar lists, it has to be said that the NT was already established from the moment when the various books it comprises were written. However, the compilation of the lists of the councils required a long period and underwent a complex historical process until it had been defined which books were to belong to the canon and which were to remain outside it.\\"Outstanding Review:Didaskalex, Eusebius Alexandrinus review of 'Constantines Bible,' has some very interesting points which support his catechetical standing. I have to add that Constantine's fifty bibles constituted the Alexandrine Sepuagint, quoted by most NT writers, together with the NT twenty seven books. OT/NT based on Jeremiah 31:31 prophecy was an Alexandrine tradition, spearheaded by Origen's great work of the Hexapla. the NT books cotain some of the popular post apostolic fathers, and were produced most probably in the Alexandrian Scriptorium. For professor Dungan to neglect those pivotal points in debating his thesis, especially Dedymus the blind torah finding is strange. His discussion of Dionysius argument on the Apocalypse (pp. 75) is refreshing. Meanwhile he did not even mention why did Athanasius include it, together with the epistle to the Hebrews. Was it a balanced Canon to preserve the unity of the Catholic (Universal Orthodox) church, as mentioned by some scholars. the book remains to be apetizing to the general reader and fresh seminarian.Informed Review:\\"In the first place, it downplays the differences among early Christian communities that regarded each other as orthodox in those early centuries by implying that their collections of scriptural materials--and therefore their ideas of normative Christianity--were virtually the same. ... It would be unfortunate, however, if the contrast the book draws between pre-canonical or non-canonical uses of scripture and canonical uses were to lend support to a false opposition between two major and mutually supportive roles that scripture plays in the life of Christian communities-nurturing the life of faith and aiding the community in distinguishing between genuine and inauthentic teachings.\\" Charles Wood, Perkins School of theology"},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"If you've read the Da Vinci Code, forget what you learned about Constantine and the bible. The real story is far more fascinating, and the splendid little book \\"Constantine's Bible\\" is the perfect place to start.Dungan starts off by noting that the notion of a \\"canon\\" of scripture is actually unique to the monotheistic religions. When people talk about the \\"Taoist Canon\\" or the \\"Pali Canon\\" or the \\"Vedic Canon,\\" that's a little misleading, since in those instances there was never an external authority that definitively set the rule for what and what was not scripture. In the pre-Constantinian Christian world, scripture was an amorphous term, as different regional churches used different scriptures in their liturgies, and considered different writings inspired. The notion of a canon of scripture was influenced, according to Dungan, by Greek political ideology, which sought mathematical precision in knowledge. The term canon is derived from the Greek word \\"Kanon,\\" which literally means \\"rule.\\" The Greeks used the analogy of the \\"Kanon\\" of a carpenter for the precision of knowledge required in human endeavors. In addition, Greek philosophical schools, with their emphasis on preserving the writings of a founder, succession to the founder, and correct interpretation, influenced the idea of a need for a canon.After Constantine's famous conversion, he felt that he needed to unify the empire. Specifically, Constantine believed that if the Christian church continued to quarrel over scriptures and doctrines then God would punish him. That was the main impetus for the selection of a \\"canon\\" of scripture that would eventually be adopted as the bible. Dungan notes that once Constantine gave grants and privileges, at state expense, to churches and clergy, the church adopted the legal machinery of the Roman empire.I would highly recommend this book for anyone wanting a short, readable, and accurate introduction to how the bible as we know it came about. To make a church history book a page-turner is not an easy task, but Dungan succeeds in doing so.

More concerning is that Dungan is a good writer... he easily makes you think that you are reading history, not a fictionalized interpretation with leaping, sweeping conclusions. Trained historians will be dismayed, but others might be duped. For example, the development of a concept of a defined canon, church traditions, hierarchies of leadership, etc., seem to have been created (imposed) simply in medias res as part of Constantine's 'program' following the Edict of Milan (is he confusing Constantine with Theodosius? Is he unaware that Constantine had a co-Emperor? Quite astonishing how something could just change overnight, as Dungan promotes).

Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman).There is no reliable evidence or argument that currently supports the notion of either of manuscripts being one of the fifty. Likewise, there is nothing conclusive that would disqualify one of them from being one of the 50.THE ONLY LOGICAL CONCLUSION HERE IS THAT A LATER GROUP DISAPPROVED THE CONTENTS OF THESE BIBLES AND MADE THEM DISAPPEAR.Eusebius, at, this time was THE church theologian, Later, he would be denounced as a near heretic. If these bibles existed; the contents of the Canon (the exact list of included books) would be known. For instance, Eusebius personally disapproved the Book of Revalation, but was generally disposed to include it in approved texts, since it was highly popular.Besides just the Books themselves, we would have an official text, within each book.This issue is given only a very short shrift in this text, and I was very disappointed in that.However, it does contain a wealth of other good information."},{"Title":"Constantine's Bible: Politics and the Making of the New Testament","review":"A excellent read about the affairs of the 3rd century Christian Church and how the New Testament came into being.

It's tough to write a book for all users, novice and experienced. This book falls in between those two extremes.If you've never done any programming, you'll likely be frustrated by the slow start into actual programming. Some readers will need a \\"Hello world\\" routine up front. On the other hand, if you're an experienced programmer, you'll find that 60 to 70 percent of the book is way below your level and needs. But wait a minute, we're talking about a 1200+ page book! If just 10 percent is on target for you and you can find what you need, it's a steal.The content of the book is far, far, far beyond what Microsoft provides with built-in menus and help. Anyone who claims otherwise simply hasn't done any serious VBA programming. A large percentage of the commands and structures covered here absolutely cannot be generated by automated recording. For example, I wrote a code that scans a document, finds all the acronyms, determines whether the acronym definitions are provided, and builds and/or updates an acronym table at the end. It flags all undefined acronyms and it color-codes duplicate definitions and out-of-order definitions. It includes a toolbar for helping navigate the document. It also includes a capability for combining acronym tables from multiple sources. You have to really get immersed to code a task even as conceptually simple as this one, and this book is what you need to get through it.The most challenging thing about being productive with VBA is the horrendously large object model. Some of the best programmers I know -- and I'm talking guided-missile engineers and the like - have turned away from VBA because the object model required too much of a learning curve. This book does a good job of laying most of the object model out in logical order. (If you're unfamiliar with the term \\"object model,\\" don't be intimidated - it's not that it's all that hard to master in small steps; it's just big; and you may be able to find what you want and apply it quickly.)The book isn't perfect: I've found two errors, but that's not bad, considering its size. Overall, it's very authoritative.While using this book, I occasionally needed to turn elsewhere for additional information. My favorite companion book is Sams Teach Yourself Visual Basic for Applications 5, which has a strong orientation towards Excel. The bad news about both of these books is that they're getting old. I wouldn't yet call them \\"dated,\\" but the authors/publishers will need to produce updated editions in the next few years. I, for one, really hope they do. That's the (selfish) reason for writing this review. I have to wonder, though, how many Word users will ever need a book this advanced.I'm giving the book five stars, because it is, by far, the best ever written on its subject. I wouldn't want to do without it.Post Script: I wrote this review in 2004. Now in 2010, I still use this book, although not as often. The online help has gotten better, much better than Excel's, by the way, and many new VBA features have accumulated over the years. There has not been a legitimate follow-on to this book. Hart-Davis has authored some other books, but their coverage of Word VBA isn't even a shadow of what's in this book. I've written my own book on Word, most of which is VBA. It's about 150 pages, but the bad news is that I wrote it as a reference for myself. It's a sad state of affairs when we have to resort to that. The mainstream publishers just must not have the market for this kind of thing. If you have a chance to pick up one of these cheap, I still recommend it. I had worn mine out and bought a replacement just last year!I have to add one more point. If you had custom toolbars in Word 2003 or earlier, you may think you lost them when Word 2007 came along. Convert your old .doc files to .docm files. An Add-Ins tab will appear on the Word 2007 ribbon, and you'll find your toolbars on it. You can even convert your old normal.dot to normal.dotm and accomplish the same thing there! I have all of Microsoft's latest books on Word 2007, and none of them tell about that feature. I'm personally indebted to the Microsoft employee who put the feature in. There's a special place in heaven for that fine soul!"},{"Title":"Word 2000 Developer's Handbook (Handbook)","review":"I bought this book because I needed to learn VBA for my job. The author does an excellent job explaining things and doesn't wander off into theory like many other books do.

What VBA language knowledge I possessed beforehand I had gathered from hither and yon and by experimenting with Word. This book was fundamental to understanding the object model and to understanding many specific areas (bookmarks, find and replace, section breaks, to name a few). However, it is dated and occasionally threadbare. You will still need to gather information from online forums and such to round out your knowledge.

It helped me to structure my work and gave me more ways to analyze my code. It helped to find out more possibilities of Word VBA. The author goes deeper into explaining all the tools available.Plus there is a central idea.Although VBA is a computer language programming, we should not forget that we are dealing with a Word Processor and that Word VBA is a tool for automation of repetitive tasks and getting your work faster. The author provides a view that does not forget this central point.With a little of experience users will understand that a few times you will gain time if you record a macro and edit it rather than just trying to write the code from the beginning. Word VBA is not C or C++. This flexibility is clearly shown along the book. Yet, it also goes deeper into the complexities of Word VBA. So people interested in a more complete approach (like me) will be satisfied with the plethora of technical informationAs the author mentions in one of the Introductory texts, this book does not force the reader to read it from cover to cover to start coding. It is well written and (not excessively) good-humored, what, truth to be told, makes it easier to read a 1200 pages book."},{"Title":"Word 2000 Developer's Handbook (Handbook)","review":"Lots of imformation about MS Office Word Visual Basic Application programming.

Once as \\"Handbook\\" and once as \\"Paperback\\". I have bothered to duplicate my post on both listings because I thought the book was so good.I cannot give this book enough stars. It is really excellent for someone who is relatively new to programming (and or Word) but who is motivated to make VBA work for them in Word. The first time through the book (like all software books that I use) was an attempt to try to understand how VBA works and what it can do for you. I got lost in his explanations many times and my first impression was like the reviewer above (Ovma) who gave it only 3 stars. I could understand what the Author was saying, all of the paragraphs were easy to understand but I often got lost in the differences between \\"strings\\", \\"Variables\\" \\"Variants\\" \\"Objects\\", \\"Methods\\", \\"Arguments\\" \\"Constants\\" and the different types of variables. Guy Hart-Davis seemed to explain each term quickly and then assume the reader now understood each term as he moved on and referred back to the term. It wasn't until I started back through the book the second time that I realized that because the subject is so large, he often didn't address these terms in enough detail until later chapters where he explained them in more detail.The second complaint I had (and the negative reviewer above had) was that the Author seemed to use very few examples of macros, often only having one example per chapter. Often he would explain one element of a process or command and then show a table and say: \\"Here are the other 500 commands that go with this one process\\" I thought that this would not be enough to address the millions of commands each function in VBA used. I did notice, however, that the examples he did present in the book were types of macros that I would find extremely useful. This book is already 1200 pages and I understood his need to be brief. The trick to learning VBA for Word was not to read the examples in the book presented, but to actually type them and run them. (Math is like that too. You can't watch the teacher work a problem on the board and expect to understand it. You HAVE to work the problems!) After I did that, I realized the examples were sufficient for me to master the process and make it work for me under any particular circumstance that I needed. As it turned out, the seemingly scarcity of macro examples that I thought existed was a strength. Just about any macro a reader might need could be subsequently created merely by using Word's macro recorder and adapting the commands proferred in the example.This book did not have a CD. The codes in the examples were not available on the Author's web site. As it turned out, I did not miss any provided code in the slightest. The examples were just plain too easy to duplicate just by typing and recording and, really, learning to become proficient at recording macros was a skill that a reader/student MUST master right off the bat if they have any expectation of becoming skilled.This book is for Word 2000 but I have Office 2007 and the interface is different. Many times I had to use help in 2007 to see the differences with Word 2000 but I was able to overcome the confusion and this book is not outdated in that respect.About the last 1/3rd of this book covers things that are way too advanced for me. That part is still useful because occasionally you need something obscure for code and you can find it there.This book is written for \\"WORD\\". Largely, variables that involve integers or decimals or functions that involve complex logical code are not addressed here as it would be in a book about Excel. The idea behind VBA for word is to create input boxes or autotext type macros that make typing automatic and easy. This book will allow you to master it and it makes the subject about as easy as it could be made. It takes an extremely large confusing topic and makes it (relatively) easy for someone new both to Word (as I am) or to programming.After I had read this book but before I had worked through any of the example macros, I decided to order \\"VBA Developer's Handbook, 2nd Addition\\" by Ken Getz and Mike Gilbert. That book claimed to have a disk with Reusable Code for \\"more than 300 Programming Goals\\" There wasn't a single usable line of code in that entire book. It covered the most obscure and worthless processes I could possibly imagine. While I'm not fond of bashing someone's 1000 page work product, I have to say, that after trying to skim that book, I realized just what an excellent book \\"Word 2000 Developer's Handbook\\" was. After that, I was more inclined to look at the text harder and realized all of the things that I thought were lacking in the text were actually there for me to master with just a slower and more detailed effort.It took me several full days reading the book and playing with macros to get the hang of VBA as it was intended to be used. I did already have some experience with WordPerfect for DOS macro language and I already knew what IF statements and GOTO statements were and how to manipulate the 50 commands that came with that crude code to make elegant and complex autotext type macros and documents. (Before that, in the late 70's I had used Fortran in College with card readers. You talk about useless!) I still think that anyone without that type of programming experience, someone with no experience can get the hang of VBA for word with this book. In fact, this book is probably the easiest way (if not most novices only option) to get the hang of it. Probably the hardest thing about it is that the subject is so dull.

Once you've committed to taking one of the disease-modifying drugs, you are still left with the consequences of MS, an often dizzying array of interlocking symptoms. Facing up to life with MS means coping with symptoms that range from the inconvenient to the painful, debilitating, and disabling. It also means coping with the emotional fallout of both your current symptoms, and the likelihood that they will over time worsen and diversify.I was attracted to this book because it is written by a doctor. I am reminded constantly when reading it, however, that while he is an expert on MS, he is experiencing MS symptoms only second-hand. In consequence, it is clear that on many issues, he just doesn't get it. I was also attracted to the fact that this book has been popular enough to go through four editions. This means both that it sells well, and that it is likely to be up-to-date. The world of MS research is moving so fast these days that the information in books very quickly becomes outdated. Which is, of course, a good thing provided readers keep their wits about them. Not all of the book appears to have benefitted from a rewrite, however. Parts of it were written in 1986 and are, as we will see, beginning to show their age.It is my feeling that the presentation style of this book may run the risk of alienating a significant fraction of MS patients. The approach taken is top-down, and assumes that you need to know the mechanism (couched in college textbook terminology) of a bodily function or process before you can talk about it; but for many of the processes described in this book, it just isn't so. Often dry and technical for no good reason, it over-utilizes the passive voice. It lists a dizzying array of drugs, mostly dismissed with a few lines rather than given the in-depth description they deserve. It emphasizes the mechanics of coping, not the emotional side. In places it is downright patronizing about the emotions felt by a person with MS, a trait unfortunately shared by many medical professionals. For example, from Chapter 8, \\"A person with impaired mobility who does not use the right tool cannot accomplish the job of walking. Although it may be difficult at first, try not to have negative emotional feelings about using assistive devices. They are simply tools to improve mobility.\\"The visual presentation of the book is somewhat lacking. A significant fraction of people with MS have vision problems. I believe that this audience would be better served by a larger font size and the selection of a clearer typeface, both in the main text and in the figure labels.The book is broken into 22 chapters and four appendices, which are divided into four major sections. The second section alone is divided into subsections, five in number, comprising of from one to seven chapters each. I am somewhat skeptical as to whether this division is of any practical assistance to the reader. The chapters are as follows:1. What is Multiple Sclerosis? This chapter gives the standard explanation of MS, which will be of some interest to the newly diagnosed. It includes two excellent sections on \\"Choosing Your Physician\\", and \\"Complementary Medicine\\".2. Managing the Disease Process: An excellent, if dry, description of the standard disease modifying drugs, current as of 2003. It should ideally be supplemented with more up-to-date information by the discerning reader.3. Fatigue: This chapter is essentially the standard polemic on fatigue, including the usual tiresome lists of things you can do in everyday life to reduce the amount and effects of fatigue. These would be wonderful in an ideal world, but as many of us have to work and care for children while coping with MS, most of them seem bizarre if not totally divorced from reality. Some of them are merely condescending (\\"Plan ahead\\" and \\"Set Priorities\\" for example), others show a worrisome level of naivete (the person who wrote \\"Use the same grocery store on a regular basis and learn where various items are located\\" clearly does not do the family shopping, or shops in a quaint old grocery store where the shelves are not constantly reorganized in pursuit of a rapidly shifting and seasonal demographic), and some are antediluvian (\\"Use disposable diapers\\", honestly, does anybody in the western world use cloth diapers anymore?).4. Spasticity: A good chapter that discusses the three major options, exercise, drugs, and surgery. I was disappointed that there was no mention of either yoga or acupuncture, which in recent years have become popular in the MS community for managing spasticity.5. Weakness: I actually learned something about proper exercise in this chapter. I only wish that this chapter were longer than 2.5 pages.6. Tremor and Balance: Another good chapter.7. Paroxysmal Symptoms: At just over a page in length, I wish this chapter could have been longer also.8. Mobility: Putting it All Together: This chapter illustrates many of the minor presentational flaws in the book. For example, one must ask oneself why the use of the word \\"Ambulation\\" in the section heading \\"Walking (Ambulation)\\"? What advantages does it bring? Isn't it a gratuitous use of terminology? Doesn't it just serve to intimidate the less well educated reader? The author shows here and elsewhere a disregard for the MS sufferer who is on a limited budget when he states \\"Leather soles wear with time amd need to be replaced frequently, but their advantages far outweigh this minor problem.\\" The problem of replacing leather soles may seem minor to somebody on a physician's salary, but must seem daunting to somebody trying to live on a Social Security Disability allowance. Nonetheless, this chapter provides some excellent advice.9. Pressure Sores: Another good chapter. Some discussion of the relative merits of some of the choices presented, such as sheepskin versus gel pads for wheelchairs, would be a useful addition.10. Bladder Symptoms: An excellent chapter. I'm in two minds as to the applicability of the figures, however. I found them confusing. I suffer from DSD (detrussor sphincter dyssynergia) myself, and was surprised to see the disorder described but not mentioned by name.11. Bowel Symptoms: An excellent chapter.12. Speech Difficulties: A very good chapter that should perhaps be longer.13. Swallowing Difficulties: A good chapter in the sense that I already do the things that he recommends to compensate for swallowing difficulties.14. Vision: A chapter that is again too short, particularly given that many MS patients are diagnosed during their first bout of optic neuritis.15. Pain: It's nice to see a doctor who admits that a significant fraction of people with MS experience pain. I can't begin to count the number of people with MS who have confided to me that their doctor has pooh-poohed their report of pain, responding that pain isn't a \\"normal\\" symptom of MS. The truth is that chronic pain can be debilitating and can seriously affect the quality of life for MS patients and their caregivers.16. Dizziness and Vertigo: This chapter is again too short, and contains almost no useful information aside from a drug list.17. Numbness, Cold Feet, and Swollen Ankles: This chapter seems to exist solely for the author to blow off these symptom. Terms such as \\"annoying\\" and \\"nuisance\\" are used over and over. Despite the author's claims (and methinks he protesteth too much), numbness can significantly reduce quality of life. This chapter would benefit from a serious attempt to analyze and advise courses of action with less condescension.18. Cognition Difficulties: This chapter contains the usual frustrating list of bullet points containing didactic and quite impractical advice, including \\"make lists\\" (I do, but I lose them), \\"organize your environment so that things remain in familiar places\\" (but I have young kids), and \\"carry on conversations in quiet places\\" (and on which planet exactly are these quiet places to be found?)19. Diet and Nutrition: This chapter, written by Daniel Kosich (who has a PhD), is sound but \\"old school\\", based on the traditional food pyramid. There is no mention of Atkins or other diets currently under investigation. Some of the advice, such as reading food labels, is a good idea. If your diet is the traditional American meat-and-potatoes fare, then this chapter will probabaly be an eye-opener for you. But if you show any degree of dietary sophistication, it will probably be ho-hum.20. Exercise: A chapter with some solid messages, such as the fact that \\"no pain, no gain\\" does not apply to people with MS, but it consists mainly of pointers to other chapters, indicating perhaps that a reorganization of material is overdue.21. Sexuality: The clinical approach in this chapter is a big turn-off. It leads me to ask whether there are ways of coping that are more sexually attractive. Although some interesting advice, such as the use of a bag of frozen peas as a sex toy, does slip through the clinical facade here.22. Adapting to Multiple Sclerosis: An excellent chapter. It however does not mention the use of on-line forums and support groups for those unable or disinclined to join group counselling sessions.There are 47 pages of appendices, as opposed to 142 pages of ordinary text. I'm used to the appendix being a minor organ, not almost a quarter of the organism. I'm led to wonder why these are appendices at all and not chapters? The appendices are as follows.A. Glossary: I found the Glossary useless, neither comprehensive nor particularly well explained.B. Exercises for Spasticity: A great section with many well-explained diagrams.C. Transfers and Mobility: Another great section with many well-explained diagrams.D. Resources: A somewhat shabby list of books and electronic references. This should be replaced by a web page that is updated regularly by the author.This book contains an Index, which I applaud. So many MS books do not, which is particularly frustrating when searching later for misremembered topics. This Index was however obviously not done by the author. If it were done better, it would have perhaps uncovered some of the inconsistencies in the book, such as the subject of drinking water. The Index refers us to pp. 115-116, omitting references to fluid intake on p. 76, 81, 118, and 133. In all we are exhorted to drink \\"six to eight glasses per day\\", \\"8 to 12 cups daily\\", and \\"eight glasses of water per day\\" in three different places in the text, leading one to wonder at the disappointing quality of editing of this book.In summary, this is a good book in the sense that it contains much useful information, but its primary weakness is in presentation. It does not appear to be designed to be read by the patients who have the very problems that it describes. It could become an excellent book if the author would take on a co-author who knows how to write for a general audience, is compassionate, and has first-hand experience with managing the symptoms of MS."},{"Title":"Managing the Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis","review":"This updated fourth edition of Dr. Randall Schapiro's Managing The Symptoms Of Multiple Sclerosis uses clear language and illustrations to explore all the common symptoms of MS and tested, proven treatments for it; from tremor and weakness to bladder and sexual difficulties.

There are no images (or at all in this book) of the fabrics you want to deal with, so after you've found your potential fabric or any other company, you still have to go on investigation on the internet about the company.Hope this review was useful to you."},{"Title":"Small Design Company's Guide to Wholesale Fabrics and Trims","review":"This guide gives you the needed information along with the min. requirement to place an order.

Time seems to slip by and one day we wake up with wrinkles and our bodies not cooperating with all our minds are telling it to do. Frustration certainly sets in, but sometimes things can be down right funny. In this laugh out loud book, \\"Getting Old Still Ain't For Wimps,\\" Ms. O' Connor takes the everyday situations we 'older' ones face and help lighten the load with her words and stories. She helps us to understand we are not alone, as we giggle and relate to the numerous tales told of others experiencing our situations. What is that old saying, \\"Misery loves company?\\" It sure is a nice feeling to know we are not alone, and someone out there truly does understand. So uplifting!I have to say this is a wonderful book. I smiled for days after reading it just thinking about the different tales I had enjoyed and related to. We can't stop the clock, so we might as well giggle our way to Heaven, and this book will definitely light up the path as we make our journey. I am proud to recommend this book; it is a jewel and definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Gettin' Old Still Ain't for Wimps: Laughing Your Way Through the Senior Moments","review":"The Bible says that \\"a merry heart makes a cheerful countenance,\\" but is there anything to be merry about getting older? Karen O'Connor says a resounding \\"YES,\\" in Gettin' Old Still Ain't for Wimps. From adventures at the grocery store to tales of mistaken identity, and the failures of various body parts to overcoming the offense of senior discounts, O'Connor presents real stories from real people who are facing aging with laughter.Using a warm and affable style, the author tells each short story with a Bible verse and prayer at the end. She divides the book into seventeen sections, with titles such as: \\"Lookin' Purdy,\\" \\"No Laughing Matter,\\" \\"Lost and Found,\\" \\"Hands Up!,\\" and \\"A Little Compromising.\\" Some of the stories leave me laughing, others stir up a few sentimental tears as in the \\"Daughters Are Dandy\\" society in the nursing home, and some make me indignantly think, \\"What's so funny about that? It happened to me yesterday!\\"Karen O'Connor is a speaker, author of forty books, and writing consultant. As the author of Gettin' Old Ain't for Wimps and Help, Lord! I'm Having a Senior Moment, she's no stranger to the concerns of aging.This book would be a great relaxer in doctor's offices, as well as a pleasant book to read just before bed or after a long day at work. The author takes the ordinary bumps on the road of aging to help readers see the humor, rewards, and even joys of growing older. (P.S.

Descriptions of frost fairs and of swan upping, together with the role the river played in better known historical events were all engaging and interesting.Recounting of tragedies including the 'Great Stink' of 1858 and the impacts of the surge tide in 1953 served as reminders that nature does not always lend herself to the control of man.But most of all, the opportunity to read about the Thames as a primary character rather than as a secondary backdrop to other events made this an enjoyable, and informative, reading experience.Highly recommended to all with an interest in the history, geography and character of the UK.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Thames","review":"Jonathan Schneer writes in his introduction that there are lots of books on the Thames, but most are either highly specialised (tomes on flood control, environmental concerns, economic impact, etc.) or rather out of date. Schneer's intention with this book was to provide a more general, and more generally accessible, book on what is perhaps one of the most important rivers in history, with an impact that far outweighs it relative length. Schneer points out that most other major rivers (the Mississippi, the Danube, the Yang-tze, the Ganges, etc.) have major impact, but not the kind of dominating presence on their surrounding cultures that the Thames has had on its (perhaps the best comparison would be with the Nile, perhaps the only other river that was central to defining the culture of the lands around it).Schneer begins with the prehistoric and early historic settlements and influence of the Thames, and how it has been seen by Celts and early peoples, Romans, Angles and Saxons, Danes and Jutes, Normans and Middle Englishmen, Renaissance and Reformation people, all the way up to modern times when German bombers used the outline of the river to find London, and modern governments have seen the Thames as the gateway to Europe. Chapters go in a logical, chronological progression, and describe in socio-economic and historical narratives how the culture around the river ebbed and flowed, just as the river would rise and fall. Some seems a bit further afield than discussion of the river might require, but then, this is more of a labour of love for the English culture, of which the river Thames is certainly apart, but in fact the book is geared more toward the understanding of the history and culture itself.The Thames features in art, music and literature - the book contains a generous collection of print reproductions, both black-and-white as well as colour plates of artists such as Turner, Canaletto, Spencer, and more. Handel's Water Music is one of the better-known pieces from the time, inspired by the river, and literature past and present draws from its inspirational depths (Edmund Spenser's 'Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song' was used by Ewan McCall as title for his song, 'Sweet Thames, flow softly'; also, author Matthew Kneale uses it for one of his works of fiction).'More generally the Thames's accumulation of meanings over the centuries, its interconnectedness with so much history, has linked it with evolving understandings of the nation and its heritage. Britons identify themselves as heirs to a record through which the river has always run.'This is an interesting, accessible, and well-written general book detailing various strands of English culture with a connection of the river Thames.

It is more a book of essays on London or broader English social history--with the notion of the Thames included in all, whether needed or not. For example, the exploits of London's red mayor, Ken Livingstone, do not strike me as being central to the book's title. Some of the chapters are very good at explaining some interesting aspect or another of the history of England, like the infamous prison hulks once located on the Thames, flood control, and fine art as inspired by the ancient river. Professor Schneer is not a fan of the modern Conservative party and this bias is reflected in the final chapters."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"THIS is the Great American Novel, capturing all the finest qualities in, not only an American soldier, but in an American Man.

They simply cannot bond.4) Both put their ambitions way before family and are therefore selfish characters.5) They both commit adultery.Given the choice to be either the Protagonist (Damon) or the Antagonist (Massengale), I would choose nether.

Killer Angels is the only book I can think of that comes close to it. But I believe this book is better, because Sam Damon puts his duty to his country ahead of everything. This should be required reading in schools so that the citizens in our country will know that war is possible and horrible. The only remedy is preparation and vigilance. It is apalling that our military cannot even enlist the required number of men it needs to keep up to strength. It is apalling that our country lacks a missle defense system to protect our shores. We can thank the ultimate Courtenay Massengale-William Jefferson Clinton and the other ignorant social welfare planners of his ilk. We all need to do our duty as citizens to force the politicians to do what is right."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"On literary merit alone, this book would get about 3 stars. It is a competently written popular novel. Myrer did have an ambitious aim, to lay out the history of the US Army from WWI up to the 60s. His protagonist, Sam Damon, is a young Nebraska man who enlists in the US Army prior to WWI, receives a battlefield commission in France, and then becomes a career officer. Myrer uses Damon's career to show the development of the Army. Myrer does a good job of showing the relative amateurishness of the US Army during WWI, the very constrained interwar period, and the huge expansion of the military just before and during WWII. The battlefield scenes are said by many to be realistic and are the best parts of the book. Damon's character and career are contrasted with those of a unprincipled careerist officer whose actions through Damon's meritorious actions into high relief. This book is certainly not outstanding literature but is generally written competently. The themes are good ones. While the characters are reasonably well developed, the contrast between the hero and the bad guy are is too strong to be creditable. Damon is really too good to be true and his opponent is not only a callous careerist but also a coward, a sadist, and sexually inadequate.This book has some sociological interest. It is very popular in the military and has been used in courses for officers. The edition I read was published by the Army War College Press. The hero is generally held up as an example for young officers. I suspect this book is going to experience another surge of popularity among the military. One of the hero's last acts is an attempt to forestall greater American involvement in a thinly disguised version of Vietnam, presented clearly as a principled act of leadership in opposition to powerful but uncritical political and military leaders. There appears to be quite a bit of disatisfaction among the officer corps about the complaisance of the military leadership in the runup to the invasion of Iraq. Myrer's Sam Damon is again going to be seen as role model for officers."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I picked this book up at the airport to kill some hours in the air. The story wonderfully woven and vibrantly told. For once an author has accurately captured why so many soldiers hate war while they dedicate their lives to fighting one. It is an excellent read and just as relevent to today's readers as it was when it was originally released in 1968. Fortunately today's readers lose out on some of the irony in the story now that we are not in the Viet Nam war."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"If you serve, that is your reward.Don't expect anything else.A lesson upheld by Sam Damon, hero of the novel. For anyone considering service, you must read this novel and its painful and very often true lessons."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"this is the best novel about a person and war that i have ever read. to see someone coming up thru the ranks like he did was outstanding. i also saw the nbc miniseries, which followed the book to a tee...i had two long tours in vietnam and i wish we had someone like that to lookup to like this outstanding person in the book. i wish nbc, would release it for vedeo so very one can see it."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I just finished my umpteenth reading of Anton Myrer's Once an Eagle. This book is basically a character study of Sam Damon, an American army officer who enlisted before WWI, won the Medal of Honor and received a battlefield commission. The book follows Damon from his late youth, just before enlisting, through WWI, the inter-war years of privation and boredom, WWII and finally, his death in a thinly disguised Vietnam. Damon is a man of great intelligence, bravery, forthrightness and integrity, who always balances military necessity with the need to \\"take care of his soldiers\\".The counterpoint to Damon, and the \\"villain\\" of the novel, is Courtney Massengale, a West Pointer and a man who is completely self-absorbed and only concerned with the advancement of his career. Massengale is always one rank superior to Damon and the two men clash repeatedly throughout the book starting in WWI, and ending with the US involvement in \\"Khotiane\\" a thinly fictionalized Vietnam.Within the framework of this story Myrer explores many different themes of military life in the early to mid 20th century. He illustrates the tedium of life in the peacetime army, the way relationships between high-ranking officers in WWII were grounded in the relationships of these men as junior officers, and the impact of war on the families of the soldiers. The most important theme of the book is the hard calculus of the commander and his need to spend the lives of his soldiers to attain military objectives. While both Damon and Massengale are willing to do this there are two key differences; first Damon is willing to put himself in harm's way along with his troops and second, Damon is constantly judging whether or not a military objective is worth the lives of his troops and attempting to minimize their losses in way that is completely foreign to Massengale.I've read this book four or five times now and it still resonates with me the same way it did when I first read it as a teen-ager. Not only do I recommend it highly, but so does the Commandant of the USMC, who placed it on reading list for all First Lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps, and the faculty at USMA who frequently use it a text for Cadets in leadership classes."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this years ago and it made an indelible impression on me. I forgot the title and was unable to find the book for my perminent library. His description of the Artillery barages of WWI still leave me uneasy! I recommend it to anyone wanting to better understand the real life of members of the Military. In the vernacular; It's a taste of reality!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Right from the start, I was engrossed in Sam Damon's character and the storyline of this novel. It starts with a small town boy who decides to make his career in the Army and follows him through WWI, peacetime, and WWII. Damon enlists and then is made an officer through a wartime commission. Its a compelling storyline, but most of all I found its inner-woven leadership lessons to be the most interesting aspect of the book. Sam gets presented with tough choices over and over again and finds a way to make the right decision each time. Yes, its not realistic, but it does teach important lessons. For a young military officer, this is definitely worth the read. For a very long book, it does go fairly quickly. However, it was about 300 pages too long. I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through and couldn't finish. Overall a very good novel."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Should be required reading for every military officer and NCO. Besides telling the life story of a brave and honorable man, it is an excellent course in leadership describing both the best and worst types. From the integrity and \\"lead from the front\\" style of the main character to the callous and self serving style of the politico-military types who all to often rise to positions of immense power, this book nails it dead on. Scenes of battle are chillingly described and accurately depict the horror and tragedy of warfare. It also tells of the trials and sacrifices of the wives and families of those who must leave them behind to follow their calling. An incredible read."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This book, bar none, does a fantastic job describing the two kinds of leaders in the world. While the lessons are particularly important to warfare professionals, it also applies to everyone - for little league coaches to corporate executives.Colonel John Boyd, USAF had a speech that speaks to the heart of book:\\"Tiger, one day you will come to a fork in the road,\\" he said. \\"And you're going to have to make a decision about which direction you want to go.\\"He raised his hand and pointed. \\"If you go that way you can be somebody. You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.\\"Then Boyd raised his other hand and pointed another direction. \\"Or you can go that way and you can do something - something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won't have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference.\\"He paused and stared into the officer's eyes and heart. \\"To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call.

This is a great read."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This great novel is the biography of a career soldier who served in four wars.

I've worked for Sam Damon's and Courtney Massengales, and unfortunately more Massengales than Damon's. I just read the book for the second time and learned even more from it. It should be required reading in business school as well as West Point. You'll have choices in life, to be someone who works hard, cares about people like Sam Damon, or to be a self-serving s.o.b. like Massengale.

I enjoyed reading this book and will look for other books by Anton Myrer."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Simply the finest book I have ever read, and re-read. I first read this book as a homework assignment at West Point over 15 years ago. It changed the whole way I looked at leadership and personal integrity. I re-read it when Army life gets a little overwhelming, to re-learn those valuable lessons about keeping grounded in who you are and what is really important in life. The leadership lessons here are applicable to any walk of life, and the main characters represent the extremes of Army life without being the least bit campy. There are no pure Sam Damons or Courtney Massengales out there; they represent the polar extremes on the scale of leadership and integrity. The trick is to figure out where on the scale you want to be. You may be suprised at where you place yourself. As a WWII vet, Mr. Myrer has painted a portrait of small unit combat in a vivid style that will grip you. Combat Veterans consistently rate it as the most authentic description they've read. More Stephen Crane than Tom Clancy, it makes you an intimate part of the story."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"There is one purpose for the existence of a professional military organization. That purpose is to engage in warfare, when necessary, to defend the nation. Peacetime, which unfortunately is usually just a breathing space between wars and lesser fights, should be spent training and preparing for the next go-round.Once An Eagle brings that fact of life chillingly home to roost. I first read this excellent novel in the 1970s and I have reread it many times and learned more from the book each time. It also served me well throughout my military service as a Marine artilleryman.The main character is a composite, a combination of Woodfill from War I to Eichelberger in War II. The author has caught the essence of both military service and the military life, even though he salts the dialogue with Marine terms instead of the corresponding 'Army talk.'The characters are real, the battles were actually fought, both on the battlefield and off (the off battlefield ones, unfortunately are still being waged and not always for the 'good of the service'), even though a good part of the fight in France during War I was taken liberally from the book Fix Bayonets! Artistic license is both acceptable and valuable, especially in this case.Soldiers, not carpet knights, win the nation's wars. Unfortunately, they will still have to be waged, fought, and won. This excellent volume makes the distinction between the soldier and the courtier, and what the country needs to defend itself. One retired Marine officer who is also a prolific author of Marine Corps lore, has termed these two types of officers 'lions and lambs'-the distinction should be obvious to the casual observer and reader. This book should not only be required reading for every military professional, but also for the politicians who are their civilian masters and who send them into harm's way."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"\\"Showing\\" leadership can be more effective, at times, than \\"teaching\\" leadership. This book demonstrates the finer points of great leadership excellently. The protagonist becomes a leader of men to be emulated. It does add some drama that he has a competitor who's a real jerk. That competition, the battle scenes, the gradual rise of the protagonist, the love interest, all aid in carrying the story line. However, I must admit that the book grew a bit lengthy. I read it in entirety but wasn't driven. I think the book could have been briefer without losing much."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Despite its 1000 or so pages, this is a FAST moving book, with terrific insights about human nature.

This is not just the story of war, death, and destruction, but of honor, integrity, bravery, sacrifice, infidelity and many other things.

Everyone can learn from this book, no matter what you do or what you plan to accomplish in the future."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this book soon after publication, in Reader's Digest condensed books of all things. I found it affecting, as others have, and was impressed enough to list it as my favorite book in college applications.

I assume this article had something to do with the sudden surge to #5 on the Amazon bestseller list. For those in the military who worry that the Courntney Massengales are running things, you might take heart in the following excerpts:Quote:Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says it is the only book he has ever read twice. The Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., recently brought the book back into print because military schools wanted it for courses in ethics and leadership. . . .The book is on the Marine Corps commandants' reading list -- making it required reading for all Marines. The U.S. Army War College holds an annual leadership seminar that uses the book. For West Point cadets, who are assigned the book in classes and seminars, reading &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; has become a rite of passage, much like discovering &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; as a teen-ager. Favorite passages are quoted routinely, especially Sam Damon's dying words: &quot;Joey, if it comes to a choice between being a good soldier and a good human being -- try to be a good human being ...&quot;And the names of Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale have entered the language of the U.S. military as code words for the good officer who thinks first of the troops and the other one who thinks only of personal gain.When Shelton wants to exclude a candidate from a promotion, all he has to do is tell the board of review: &quot;This is another Courtney Massengale.&quot;&quot;It's a household name and I've used it to say we shouldn't have an individual like that in the ranks -- someone who is motivated for all the wrong reasons, someone you don't want leading the troops,&quot; Shelton said."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I first was introduced to &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; in 1977 when it was made into a movie.

It has a great story and a fantastic hero, and the battle scenes, especially in World War I, are gripping.I would like to focus on some aspects of the book that I didn't expect, because they are overlooked in most reviews.One is the left-leaning politics of the book. The hero (and presumably the author) clearly admire the Chinese Commmmunists, abhor the Chinese Nationalists, and are opposed to US involvement in Vietnam. The villian of the story is not only careerist, opportunist and manipulative, but is eager to foment an unnecessary war with China, has no qualms about wasting lives, wants an American colonial empire in the Pacific, and believes that war is a preferred state. American businessmen are portrayed as shirkers from battle, war profiteers who unscrupulously sell to the future enemy materials that will be used to kill poorer Americans' sons, and as pushing the US into unwise involvement in Vietnam in order to protect their exploitative profits.Whether one agrees or disagrees with the politics of the book, it is interesting that this book is so warmly embraced by US military officers. I wonder whether they agree with the political implications of the book, or simply oblivious to them.I also found interesting the portrayal of the stress on the hero's marriage, which displays a lot of sympathy for the wife's opposition to various postings he must take as part of his career. The author makes it clear that she has every right to be miserable with the horrible conditions of interwar service and his wartime postings.One minor aspect of the book I found annoying was the &quot;good&quot; characters' ability to fortell the future, whether regarding the unsatisfactory nature of the Versailles peace which must lead to a new war, the future victory of the Communists in China, or the lack of wisdom in advancing to the Yalu in Korea.Otherwise, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I actually bought this book back in 2004, received it, was a bit overwhelmed when I saw it was close to 1,300 pages and put it on the bookshelf to read later. Just recently my son requested a copy of this book for his birthday. After I ordered a copy for him, I thought it sounded familiar. I looked around a bit and found my copy. I picked it up, cracked open the cover and pretty much read it straight through, hardly stopping to eat or sleep.What a magnificent book! And what a hero! I think all of us, military, non-military, leader, follower, male, female, can learn from \\"Once An Eagle\\" and aspire to be better because of it. I learned a lot about military life from it that I needed to know - as a military mother - things my son would never discuss with me. I think every service man and woman should read this book along with the people who are important and integral in their lives - spouses, parents, older children(at least early teens), fiances, any loved ones. I think it gives a pretty true-to-life portrayal of the daily hardships, ordeals, boredom, decisions, and fear of being in the service. And I don't believe that has changed that much even though this book spans a number of years and wars. I believe it is as current and as meaningful now as it would have been in World War I.Sam Damon is shown as a real man with real fears who overcomes adversity and is still able to epitomize an ideal of courage and integrity. He is not shown as perfect; he does make mistakes. But I think almost all of us would like to be friends with someone like Sam, or would like our sons or daughters to grow up like him, or would like to employ him, or... He is everyman's hero because we are all able to relate to him.It ended up that 1,300 pages wasn't long enough to spend with Sam and his family and friends and fellow soldiers. I loved this book, will read it again and again in the future and I am sure I will discover new insights during each reading. I hated to have the book end."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This was another book which I owned for several years, but did not read (probably due to the length) until recently; what a shame. I rank \\"Once an Eagle\\" by Anton Myrer as one of the five best novels I have ever read. The strength of the narrative is amazing. In Sam Damon the world of literature has one of its greatest protagonist heroes. Though he clearly abhors war, he returns to it again and again knowing that because of his character and leadership ability his men will follow him and many of them will die. He tempers his feelings of anguish and grief with the belief that if he did not lead his men, someone else less qualified or concerned would have and even more men would have died. Damon's antagonist, Courtney Massengale, is a careerist military officer more concerned with his own clout and advancement then the well-being of his men. He exemplifies all that is wrong in a military officer and leader of men, hidden beneath a thin veneer of charisma and stately manners. To be sure, Damon has his flaws as well, adding depth and dimension to his character.In some of the top reviews for this book it is mentioned several times that it has been required reading for officer candidates at West Point. That is surprising considering that the book does not always shine a favorable light on some of the traditions and practices within the military establishment. However, there can be no finer literary example of what it means to be a \\"Leader of Men\\" than that which is embodied in the character of Sam Damon."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This was the first book I had &quot;read for fun&quot; ever, being that I just got out of college. But the subject matter (History) and length (1,000 pages) told me otherwise. But I insisted, since it was on every reading list I saw for Junior Officers, including the USMA and Army Chief of Staff lists.You follow Sam Damon through his entire life, from the Mexican Punitive Expedition in 1915 up to the beginnings of the Vietnam &quot;War.&quot; From the lowest Private to the General Officer who people worshipped. The story is amazing and unbelievable. I was so attached to the book. I found myself highlighting passages and quotes of the &quot;real&quot; moments that I have either seen or assume I will see. Sam is everyone's hero. And this hero has his sworn enemy in Courtney Massengale. I hated Massengale. Just like the book wanted me too. But Myrer makes you understand everbody's view in this work by shifting the perspective from Sam to Massengale to Sam's Wife on occasions. But still, I hated Massengale.The book trashed two of my immediate expectations. First it was an Army book written by a Marine. I thought, &quot;what could a Marine know about the Army?&quot; Second, I never expected much regarding Sam's relationship with his wife/family and the toll that the Army life took on them. This was not distracting to the book, but rather intensified the relationship between Sam and his family, and the &quot;relationship&quot; with myself.Highly recomended to anyone with an interest in the history of the battles of the early part of last century, the military minded, or even those who hate the military, but need a bit more knowledge. Yes, this book can be read as an &quot;Anti-War&quot; book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I purchased this book based upon the rave reviews below and was definitely not disappointed.

I would love to use portions of the video version in some of my classes, but have not been able to find a copy anywhere I can't believe that will all the trash that is available on VHS and DVD that whoever owns the rights to this gem has not released it; it should be in every school and public library in the country."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Other reviewers have given short summaries of the story so I won't do that. But if you want an exciting story, filled with incredible historical detail, and a great rivalry, and great realism, and huge values, this book is for you. It is long but you will not want it to end!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Anton Myrer has written a book for the ages with this impressive work. The book follows two officers from just before America's entry into World War I all the way to the opening days of Vietnam. The officers are archetypes of leadership: Sam Damon leads by example, cares for his soldiers and always strives to do what's best for the mission, while Courtney Massengale works equally hard to do whatever is calculated to advance his career. The book both shows how to be a great leader and provides the reader with an excellent look at America's Army, particularly in the interwar years. Anyone interested in leadership, regardless of how they need to apply it, would do well to read this book. Although it is unlikely any of us can live up to the example set by Damon, simply making the attempt can help make anyone a better leader."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This novel is a classic of the military genre. It takes some literary license, but basically it's the study of the development of two officers, one good and true to his oath and duty, and one careerist, ticket punching self serving typical 'REMF'. As a career enlisted soldier, I recognizes both protaganists and the stage on which they play. It's a great exposition of the trials and tribulations of the Army in peace and war, and of an officer's struggle to survive long enough to make a difference when the balloon goes up. Required book for young soldiers. A good read for any American, male or female. The TV series was good, as well."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I am a retired soldier. I have read &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; many times, and I cannot imagine life without this book on my bookshelf. I have presented copies to budding leaders and will continue to do so throughout my life. If you truly want to understand the Army, its ideals and those who do and do not share them -- if you want to understand the soldiers who fought for you, from World War I to Viet Nam -- if you want to know what it truly means to be a soldier -- then read this book and try to be like &quot;the Night Clerk,&quot; Sad Sam Damon.If only we had more Damons, and fewer Courtney Massengales -- in every walk of life."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This was a monster of a book; i'd never heard of Myrer until I heard this advertised on the radio. I've never read such a vivid and compelling description of war; it was more realistic and horrifying than any movie. It was gripping from start to finish and completely absorbed me for the several days it took to read it. When it was over I was emotionally exhausted; that is how evocative and powerful it is."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Anton Myrer has pulled off the stunning feet of putting the reader in battle and through death. In between, he lets you live the life of an unsung hero. Virtual reality camoflaged as a novel."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I bought this a few years ago, but never got around to reading it. During my last vacation, I finally picked it up and started reading. It was very good, and I was quickly engrossed in it; I should have read it much sooner.The novel followed the adult life of a (fictional) man who joined the Army before WWI and following his career. He marries a General's daughter. I could relate to the story on many levels, professionally and personally. However, his experiences in the Army after WWI were eye-opening. A lot of the things in the book actually happened to people (like getting demoted at the end of WWI just because the Army was down-sizing)!Although set against an Army background, the story was primarily about relationships and overcoming life's challenges. Ultimately, it was the story of an honorable man. Sam wasn't perfect, but that is what made the story believable.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I ordered this book as a result of the recent NY Times article and after having read the rave reviews here. But I couldn't anticipate the profound effect this book would have on me. I have read many novels, but few have pulled me into the world of a character so proundly as this one, and made me care about someone as much as I did about Sam Damon. We do forget about what it means to be a person of principle and compassion, and all the reviews about Sam's character are spot on. But the book is also such a gread story, with many profound and moving moments. I have to say the most powerful sustained portion of the book for me is the World War II section ... I made the mistake of starting this section late in the evening and read all night to finish the book.This book has everything: a great hero and a fully developed and despicable villian, excellent supporting characters, compelling scenes. It's not a stretch to compare it to Tolstoy in its sweep and majesty.Finally, my thanks to the War College for the reprint."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"\\"Once An Eagle\\" is the epic tale of two military men in conflict with each other over the span of 50 years during the middle decades of the twentieth century.Meet Sam Damon. At the outset, he's a dreamy, idealistic teenager in the small town of Walt Whitman, Nebraska. He's the night clerk in the local hotel and eatery. He's possessed with a first class intellect and a fiery ambition to \\"do something great with his life.\\" He dreams of getting an appointment to West Point.Sam applies for admission to the U.S, Military Academy, but gets impatient at the bureaucratic delays. He enlists in the Army, serves with General John J. Pershing in the 1916 \\"punitive expedition\\" to Mexico, and ends up in the trenches of France a year later, during the last year of World War I. It is there that Sam performs his greatest act of military heroism, an act that earns him a battlefield commission as a Second Lieutenant; the Medal of Honor; and the affectionate sobriquet \\"The Night Clerk.\\" Throughout his tour of duty in France, Sam continues to distinguish himself not only with valorous deeds on the battlefield, but also with his no-nonsense leadership style, centered upon his passionate dedication the welfare of his men. He consistently sets a superb example of the highest ideals of personal behavior in his dealings with both his superiors and subordinates. It is here that he begins to understand the ultimate futility of war.It is also here that he has his first encounter with his lifelong \\"bte noire,\\" Courtney Massengale. Massengale is the complete antithesis of Sam Damon and everything he stands for. Like Damon, he's keenly intellectual and ambitious, but he seeks recognition and career advancement through being in the right place at the right time; currying favor with his superiors; and his incessant political maneuvering. His disdain for his subordinates is evident during his first encounter with Sam Damon shortly after Damon's unit comes \\"out of the line\\" in France.Throughout their parallel careers in the Army, most of which occurs in the years between the two World Wars, Massengale, the unctuous West Point graduate, and Damon, the heroic \\"mustang\\" (a term of respect for officers with prior enlisted service) occasionally find themselves stationed together, and almost always on opposite sides of whatever issues confront them at any given moment. Their relationship comes to a head in the heat of battle against the Japanese the Philippines during World War II, and again, two decades later, in the jungles of Southeast Asia.The Damon/Massengale relationship forms one of the central themes of this wonderful novel. For, in this relationship can be found a study in personal ethics as it applies to those not only in military life but also in the business sector as well. Through these two disparate characters, Myrer asks a fundamental question about human nature: why do people who rely on slipshod ethics and oleaginous double-talk so frequently successful at the expense of those whose moral compass is based on a well defines set of noble values and principles? It's a question that's plagued society from its inception, and such an important question that the U.S. Army War College includes a study of \\"Once An Eagle\\" as part of its curriculum in advanced leadership training for senior officers.\\"Once An Eagle,\\" originally published in 1968, was re-released in a beautifully bound hardcover edition in 2000. It's newly billed as \\"...a classic novel of soldiers and soldiering.\\" It is indeed that, but it's also much more. For, at its heart, this beautifully crafted novel is one of the finest ANTI-war novels I've ever read. Anton Myrer, himself a veteran of some of the bloodiest fighting in the Pacific theater during World War II, pulls no punches in his condemnation of war. His battle scenes are consistently tough, gritty, highly descriptive accounts of men fighting against other men. He describes combat on the most human terms... from the perspectives of those who did the fighting and dying. Myrer takes the reader inside the minds of his characters, allowing the reader to understand the character's hopes, fears, anxieties, and physical torments...\\"Once An Eagle\\" is a long book - over 900 pages - but it's well worth reading. Anton Myrer's style is polished and highly literate. Despite its length, it's actually a fairly quick read. I finished it in about 10 days. The book always held my interest, and in places, actually proved difficult to put down. It is an eloquent condemnation of war and its effects on the human soul."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"First off, let me say I loved this book. I thought that Meyers wove an intricate plot that fully engrossed me. I could not put the novel down and often stayed up late in the evening unable to pause until I finished just one more chapter. I picked up this book because I had seen it on the Chief of Staff of the Army's reading list for Army officers. I am a professional officer and wanted to read this book that was recommended by several senior, successful officers. They all spoke of how the main character was someone they wished all military officers would emulate and his arch nemesis someone to ostracize and avoid. So I came at this book with some preconceived notions.My point of contention with many of the reviews both on the book cover and from my superiors and peers was the hero worship aimed at the character of Sam Damon. He is a wonderfully constructed hero and Myers has done a wonderful job but, as in all great literature, he is flawed, sometimes painfully so, and his flaws in the end are his undoing.This concerns me because some of the traits I know senior officers in the military want us to emulate are those same tragic flaws. Sam Damon sees his service to country above all else. He sacrifices his family to his duty. This is what I see as a major element of his tragic flaw. At times he better serves the soldiers under to the detriment of his own family, in effect, subjugating the needs of his family to those of the Army. Too many senior officers in today's military expect this sacrifice from their subordinates and that is why this book is so popular amonst senior military officials. They all wish they had a flock of Sam Damons working under them for they do not see his tragic flaw as such. They do not want balanced well rounded officers with lives outside the military. Instead they want officers willing to sacrifice everything in their life for the Army.As I see it, Sam lacked the ability to balance his life. He gave everything to the military and when it was done he had nothing and was easily pulled back in to his doom because he had not invested some of his time in his family, friends, community or religion.A wonderful story and cautionary tale and I would recommend it to anyone. To military personnel who are reading it based on advice from others, come to the table with an open mind and understand that Sam has many wonderful traits to emulate. It is up to you to intelligently decide which traits are noble and which are flaws."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"THIS IS THE CONSUMMATE BOOK ON LEADERSHIP. I AM A CAREER MARINE WHO IS A VETERAN OF THE GULF WAR, SOMALIA, AND IRAQ WARS. MYRER SUMS UP THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE IN LEADERSHIP LIKE NO AUTHOR HAS EVER DONE. THIS BOOK DOES NOT APPLY JUST TO THE MILITARY. CORPORATE AMERICA COULD STAND TO READ THIS BOOK ALSO. SAM DAMON IS THE OFFICER THAT MEN WOULD DIE FOR AND FOLLOW TO HELL AND BACK. MASSINGALE IS THE WORTHLESS SELF-PROMOTER WHO LEADS A HOLLOW LIFE AND DOESN'T TOUCH HIS MEN IN ANY POSITIVE LIFE-SHAPING MANNER. EVERY MILITARY OFFICER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN HOW TO LEAD MEN THROUGH THE HELL OF WAR AND THE JOURNEY INTO MANHOOD THAT ALL YOUNG SERVICEMEN ARE FACED WITH. ANY MAN WHO HAS SEEN WAR WILL UNDERSTAND WHY DAMON IS A HERO TO ANYONE WHO SERVED UNDER HIM. THIS BOOK TOUCHED ME IN A WAY THAT NO OTHER MILITARY BOOK HAS SINCE JAMES WEBB'S FIELDS OF FIRE. WHAT A DEEP, THOROUGH CHARACTER STUDY OF THE LEADERSHIP QUALITIES THAT ALL MILITARY OFFICERS SHOULD STRIVE TO HAVE....AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I am a retired Army Guard and Reserve officer of twenty eight years. I was first introduced to the book, &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; while I was going through OCS and college. I was amazed at the detail of thoughts of the young Sam Damon and how much they paralleled my own thoughts. I could really identify with him. I tried throughout my military and civilian careers to model myself after the leadership examples of Sam Damon. I looked for and became very aware of the Massengale officers. Once you are aware of that type of &quot;problem&quot; you can combat it. Later I re-read the book when I was a company commander. Boy had Sam become smarter. It really helped my at that stage of my career.This past weekend I saw a huge write-up in the Minneapolis Star and was suprised that the book had that big of a following. I am re-reading the book again, for the third time, and I find my self re-identifying with the characters. I recommend this book for all young NCOs and young officers to help them formulate a mentoring guide book, like a set of rules to work towards, that they can use in the daily experiences that will make up their careers. If you use the book to help focus your committment to leadership, you will have a great experience, a great career, and a love of adventure."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this when I was 16 years old, roughly twenty years ago (and missed out on a lot of nuances because of I was too young to get them, but a lot of the book stuck with me). Then I recently re-read it and have to say this is one book that stands the test of time. It's a book with true characters that live in your memory, and what better can you say about any novel?Just to note, the TV adaptation from the late '70's kind of \\"trashed up\\" ONCE AN EAGLE, so I can't agree with the reviewer who wanted to have it issued on VHS or DVD. It's not that it was a bad miniseries, but it lacked the depth that the book has, and changed its story lines drastically."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"&quot;Once An Eagle&quot; deserves an intellectual analysis that goes beyond any military perspective. The novel depicts the humnan condition as seen through history as a whole, whether its in reference to ancient Greek comedy or Asian spheres of influence. Anton Myrer brings to life a vast assortment of cultures proving that by no means is this literary work biased in any fashion. I recommend this book for anyone interested in international affairs, psychology, political science, philisophy, womens' studies or the human condition in general. The importance of this novel cannot be stressed enough for it reveals the truth about the culture of our world, and not just that of the United States."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"&quot;Once an Eagle,&quot; by Anton Myrer, is a huge book: the main text is 1291 pages long in the paperback edition. The book tells the story of Sam Damon, a Nebraska man who enlists in the Army and gradually rises up the ranks; his career spans a great portion of the 20th century. His story is intertwined with that of his rival, fellow soldier Courtney Massengale. The men are polar opposites: Damon is a down-to-earth guy who genuinely cares about his soldiers, whereas Massengale is a cold, ruthless puppetmaster with grand dreams of power and conquest.Myrer brilliantly focuses his vast story on these two archetypal characters. In the end he creates a sweeping tapestry into which he weaves many relevant issues: leadership, love, marriage, racism, courage, politics, etc. He offers an intriguing look at such things as the role of military wives, officer-enlisted relations, the relationship between the military and civilian political authorities, etc.The book is full of memorable characters, vivid scenes, and powerful dialogue. Myrer has a real skill at descriptive writing. Ultimately, this is a novel of ideas which never loses touch of the humanity (or inhumanity) of its characters. I especially liked the fact that Myrer creates compelling female, as well as male, characters.It's really like an epic TV mini-series in book form. Recommended as companion texts: &quot;A Narrative of a Revolutionary Soldier,&quot; by Joseph Plumb Martin, &quot;Bridges at Toko-Ri,&quot; by James Michener, and &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; by Robert Heinlein. All are excellent books in particular for military leaders, or for anyone with an interest in the military."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I could never do justice to the story by trying to describe it in a few words here. Suffice it to say that I read it right after Myrer's death while stationed overseas, and it enthralled me with it's powerful statement about duty and loyalty as opposed to power and its misuse. The book was lent to my buddies and I unfortunately forgot it when I flew back to the world, but have never forgotten its message. I've tried to instill the same values in my son while he is in Army ROTC in college. Even if you've never served; never plan on serving; or cannot serve anylonger, (as in my case), read this book for its story and characters. I will stand this book alongside any other for pure story telling and believability."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Simply the finest book I have ever read, and re-read. I first read this book as a homework assignment at West Point over 15 years ago. It changed the whole way I looked at leadership and personal integrity. I re-read it when Army life gets a little overwhelming, to re-learn those valuable lessons about keeping grounded in who you are and what is really important in life. The leadership lessons here are applicable to any walk of life, and the main characters represent the extremes of Army life without being the least bit campy. There are no pure Sam Damons or Courtney Massengales out there; they represent the polar extremes on the scale of leadership and integrity. The trick is to figure out where on the scale you want to be. You may be suprised at where you place yourself. As a WWII vet, Mr. Myrer has painted a portrait of small unit combat in a vivid style that will grip you. Combat Veterans consistently rate it as the most authentic description they've read. More Stephen Crane than Tom Clancy, it makes you an intimate part of the story."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"&quot;As a teen this book shaped my life, but saddened me as behaving like &quot;Sam Damon&quot; brings you scorn and confrontations with the &quot;Courtney Massengales&quot; of the world. I looked for real life characters who marine Myrer used as a basis for Sam Damon. My conclusion is that Sam Damon is actually marine General Evans F. Carlson who founded the marine Raider Battalions in WWII---he marched with the Chinese route Army, was a tactical genius with fluidity of thought and egalitarean (not snobby) like Myrer's GEN Sam Damon and made an impassioned speech against war after WWII. &quot;Massengale&quot; is the embodiment of the careerist types at the WWII hqmc who opposed a human mc based on small unit excellence in favor of mass battalions using robotics and frontal assaults to create a seperate service bureaucracy now bloated to 174,000. Myrer is really writing against the mindless carnage of the mc butchers who ran the frontal assaults in the north Pacific in WWII who were eager with other men's blood to create the mc seperate service bureaucracy for them to command over like a &quot;Courtney Massengale&quot;.This book is timeless for we are in the same quandry today with the military profession run by &quot;lifer-careerists&quot; who as another reviewer wrote, do not love &quot;Soldiering or Soldiers&quot;. They simply want to be in charge like Courtney Massengale. These men do not want to put a big gun on a light M113A3 armored vehicle for our Airborne, thus we will have to throw something together like Gen Damon does in the book when he straps a 37mm gun to a jeep to knock out Japanese tanks, in a WWII island fight--- otherwise our men will die. The reasons are selfish--they want a role for heavy armor types that will not make it to the fight in time (too heavy to airdrop in) just like Massengale wants his liberation troops to take the town while Damon and Chrysler have to take the enemy's suicidal banzai attack by themselves. I like the TV mini-series better than the book in that ! Damon calls Massengale &quot;on the carpet&quot; then and there as the real Damon (Carlson) would have done. We could use a General Damon today who would resign in protest and get us the light tanks/AFVs and the Iowa Class Battleships we need for our U.S. Airborne/light divisions. As the book shows, men die from a lack of fire support every time we go to war.The book is awesome in that Damon and Massengale meet one last time for thinly veiled early-Vietnam type meeting with a charismatic enemy leader like &quot;Ho Chi Minh&quot;, and Damon is able to stop the war from widening at great personal cost. This is profound since if we had maintained better relations with the Vietnamese leaders its possible we could have tolerated a peaceful socialism with French control diminishing over time than the 2 wars that were fought. I concur with all the superb reviewers that this book is a MUST READ for every American and military Soldier. How do we get this? The armed services should create a set of questions and those that read the book and others from a required reading list would answer them for correspondance course credit. We need to build young &quot;Sam Damons&quot; in our armed forces and I hope we can utilize this finest of books to make it a reality.The book's ending to me says it all--and I have to say it--if you have to choose between being a good Soldier and being a good human being--BE A GOOD HUMAN BEING. This is the message that &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; builds to. This is our moral compass, our call to action today!It is up to each.... generation..... to fight the evil of its day....our time has come!...it is NOW.&quot;Airborne!Mike Sparks1st TSG (A)"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"To some, Once An Eagle is a story of an idealistic boy scout, named Sam Damon, who fights (stupidly) against the Army establishment in the vain hope of making a better world. Well, this book isn't written for them.The hero of Once an Eagle, Sam Damon, is not a boy scout nor is he some wishy washy do gooder who dreams of the impossible. Sam Damon is a man who I would want as my commanding officer or manager or political leader--honest, loyal, brave, wise, strong and most of all, compassionate.Sam leaves his Nebraska home to join the Army and serve in two world wars. By the end, he goes to a South East Asian country that sounds a lot like Vietnam. Sam's nemesis is a Courtney Massingale, a man who is almost the polar opposite of Sam, who rises through the ranks faster than Sam does because he is skilled in the art of office politics rather than the art of war. Their paths cross with deadly consequences over the two world wars until things come to a head in the faux-Vietnam of Anton Myrer's world.This is one of a classic of military literature and if you enjoyed The Thin Red Line (not the movie) or The Naked And The Damned then this is worth buying.BTW, the person who wrote that Massingale was actually MacArthur is dead wrong. Massingale seems more like the 1st Marine Division's apparent Korean War nemesis, Ned Almond (X Corps Commander durng the 1950 Chosin Resevoir battle and protege of MacArthur.)Anton Myrer did his research well. Although I suspect that Sam Damon is a composite of two Marine legends, Marine Raider Commanders Carlson and Edson.

It won't let you put it down."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"ONCE AN EAGLE HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTENAN UNBELIVABLE BOOK ,I FIRST READ YEARS AGO BEFORE THEY MADE THE MINI SERIES FOR TV I JUST KNEW THAT HAD TO BE SO WATCHABLEAND OH BOY WAS IT FROM START TO FINISH SUPERB I WOULD LOVE TO GET MY HANDS ON A TAPE OR DVD TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT AGAINMR J PARKER"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I have been looking for a first addition copy of \\"Once an Eagle\\" for some time now, and I was happy to have found one. I received the book as described and had no problems with it."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"The book was delivered in 4 days and was in great condition! I'll definitely order from this seller again."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. It validates my respect for the American soldier, in particular the career soldier, who sacrifices personal liberty and gain for the sake of his country and his men. The battle scenes are graphic and deeply moving, clearly illustrating the escalating impact of weapons of war during the twentieth century. The unsavory politics of military culture is laid bare. The story of men and women's struggle to preserve love in marriage is timeless. It is a thoroughly good read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I have read alot of books and this one is the best. Thats all that needs to be said."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"\\"Once An Eagle\\" is one of the best books I've ever read, second only perhaps to \\"Winds of War\\". I'm a West Point graduate, and after reading the book I was amazed that it wasn't required reading for us at the \\"Point\\". Then I checked the publication date and saw that it was published two years after I graduated. The fact is that it IS now required reading at West Point.The book follows the career of Sam Damon from his enlistment in the army as a private prior to WWI to his final campaign in Southeast Asia and his rise from private to Four Star General over the course of several campaigns and three wars. The author does a great job of getting you inside Damon's head and you feel the pride he takes in doing his job well as well as the anguish he feels when he loses men and particularly when he loses a close buddy. You sense his frustration as he deals with his constant superior and thorn in his side, Courtney Massengale. Massengale has come to represent that arrogant officer whose ambition overrides his consideration for his men and his mission.You will enjoy reading this book. You will also come away with a new appreciation for the men who have served, particularly those who have stayed in peacetime to maintain a defense force that is unappreciated and poorly treated. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I have just recently finished &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; and encourage anyone with an interest in military history, historical fiction and/or America in the 20th century to read it. Above and beyond the compelling characters, especially the protagonist Sam Damon, and the scope of the story, this novel is beautifully written. The narrative is perfectly paced and moves along with alternating speed and slowness (not in a bad way) as the characters move from peace to war and back again. My only criticism of the novel is that the last part &quot;Delta&quot; appeared to me to lack the same development as the rest of the novel. No doubt that is in part due to the events described, and the fact that when the book was written America was still involved in Vietnam. Still, it was a slight letdown from the rest of the writing in the book. If you have read and enjoyed Winds of War, War and Remembrance or Flags of Our Fathers you will enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Came across this title and read due and was overwhelmed by the scope and breadth of this book. Should be a perennial best seller as it covers the range of human experiences through the world wars. Incredible leadership lessons contained in following Sam Damon through his life. A must read!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I love to read fictional drama taking place during the World Wars. I got a little more than I emotionally bargained for in this book. This turned out to be one of the most haunting and captivatingly powerful stories I have ever read. Several times I broke down in tears while reading the soul-wrenching portrayal of war and it's aftermath. I cheered in my heart the courage and dignity of Sad Sam and the soldiers who followed him to the battlefield. Unforgettable and magnificent!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This book was recommened years ago to me and other soldiers by a the Post Cdr, Thomas A Schwartz. He recommended this book as required reading by all his officers and noncommissioned officers. At the time, on or about 1994, I did try to obtain a copy of this book and I did find an old copy. I found it a difficult book to read. I truly did not understand the value of the words written. You know, I put it down after about 200 pages and I would have trashed it, but I didn't. When I became a First Sergeant in the Army, I remembered this novel and I thought it would help in my leadership style as well as show me things I should not do; and I gave it a second try. Anyway, the general said it help him, but could I apply it to me as noncom. I did get pass 200 pages but I did not finish this giant book. The story revolves around the respect for a soldier and how they should be treated. This is a great idea for civilians to read also. The story conveys the idea that all soldiers and people must be informed by talking to them, showing some sensitivity to their needs, and providing some predictablity. The story cause me to think about how leaders are in the military. My book was lifted by a low life and I was glad to see it in reprint in HC. I will make this remarkable novel, its engrossing story, and the sheer excitment and a overwhelming account of the 20th Century War a part of my personal library. Oh, by the way I did finish the book this time and I must say, difficult read or not, you, the reader should not pass this huge story up. Those of you, who have read this book years ago, I recommend you read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"A wonderful book anyway, for anyone, it is indeed an exceptional book for military of all ranks and branches. I wish I'd had it when I was an Army lieutenant pre-Vietnam. I can see why it has joined Shahara's THE KILLER ANGELS as one of the most-read books by military people."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I first read this book in 1976, have read it three times since. I was quite pleased when it was made into a movie for tv. Starring Sam Elliot. He was the perfect actor to portray Damon. With sadness I could never find a copy of it in video store or anywhere else. Since i first read it I could never forget it. A book that everyone should read filled with triumph, sadness, glory, despair and HONOR. A story of a man we all would like to be and hope that others are like him."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"My father, an Army General, read this book three times before I finally picked it up. It was a tattered paperback, and I searched years for a hardcover copy with which to repay him for the finest reading experience I've had in my life. This book could stand alone as a novel that successfully unravels the mystery of man's endless cycle of construction and destruction. But it is at the same time a lifetime inspiration, telling the story of a small-town Nebraska son who's got the stuff to change the world around him, and does. Myrer's gifted description brings into mind's view the gas-lit town of Sam Damon's beginnings, the battlefields on which he fights, recognition of his life's love, and other life-shaping experiences with such impact that Once An Eagle constantly causes the reader to close this book and let what he has read sink to the bone, praying that the essence of this brilliant commentary will never be forgotten"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I doubt that I can write a review with anything insightful that hasnt been stated in the other reviews. As mandatory reading at West Point and \\"highly suggested\\" by the Commandant of the Marine Corps, this is one of the greatest books ever, military or otherwise. Every instance in the book will undoubtably surface in your military career."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"While Sam Damon is the putative hero of this book, it is really about two people--Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale. Damon enters the Army as a private and works his way up through the ranks. Massengale enters as an officer through West Point. Damon works at his job. Massengale works the system. Damon is loyal to his men. Massengale is loyal to himself. For those of us who have worked in organizations, these two characters are quite familiar. Anton Myrer separates them in a very black-and-white, yin-and-yang fashion, although most real people evince each behavior pattern at different times. This turns &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; into a morality play that puts our own foibles at the forefront. Who do you want to be, after all, Sam Damon or Courtney Massengale? Myrer does all this while maintaining a page-turning pace in a very readable story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Although it's difficult to add much of anything original to the voluminous reviews which testify to the greatness of this novel, I feel compelled to add my thoughts as well.Though I have never served in the military (I grew up surrounded by military personnel and spent a lot of my early years on and around Andrews Air Force Base, however), I can see why so many military folks treasure this book. Still, I do not believe that a military background is in any way essential to an appreciation of this work. It is simply a great novel which happens to focus on the lives of men in the military.I first read Once An Eagle in the '70s and have re-read it two or three times since then, and it is probably my all-time favorite novel. We get an imperfect hero for the ages in Sam Damon, battle scenes of unforgettable impact from two world wars, a trip through six decades of American history and a fascinating morality tale all rolled into one wonderful read. Supporting characters, as well as Damon's primary antagonist throughout his career, Courtney Massengale, are richly drawn and equally memorable; I have always been particularly struck by Gen. George Caldwell, Damon's father-in-law, and have long assumed that he is a fictional representation of one of the 20th Century's greatest soldier-statesmen, General George Catlett Marshall.A truly great book in every respect and one I would recommend to anyone, regardless of age, gender or professional background. An American novel for the ages."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"As a Marine Corps officer I have read several books about war and warriors and I can honestly say that Once An Eagle rates as one of the best. Not only does this book provide numerous inspiring examples of leadership and courage, both physical and moral, it also gives the reader a penetrating insight into the different types of personalities within the officer corps.The reviewer who questioned the authority Mr. Myrer's insights on leadership due to his rank as an enlisted Marine in the Pacific theater demonstrated his irretrievable ignorance in so doing. Therefore, anyone interested in this book should completly ignore his review. As an officer who was once enlisted, I can assure you that our enlisted Marines are provided ample oportunites to both practice and observe effective leadership. It is often our NCOs and SNCOs who are the best judges of an officer's effectiveness."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This book is the best that I have ever read. I'm presently serving my country, and I carry Sam Damon's example with me where ever I go. Sam is everything that we should be...and could be if we would only pay attention to the troops and the task at hand. Thank you Mr. Myer for this book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this book along time ago and still remember Sam Elliot doing a fine job in the made for TV Movie.(I hope that they bring it out soon in DVD) This novel captures the inner conflict that all leaders face of mission versus troop. (Taking care of yourself & your career versus getting the job done. Hopefully the little voice in you will make sure that you put career way behind the troops & doing the right thing)Even though the book is now 30+ years old it still has a lot to offer to those willing to listen & learn."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"The other 85 reviews tell it all. I read the book and loved it. I served in the Army for 22 yrs. and finally, fully understood and appreciated it. There ARE men like Damon. They are few but they are there and they deserve to be honored in fiction and film. I remember the TV series based on the novel and thought it was terrific. How is it possible that it is not available on DVD? Shogun is available on DVD, Thorn Birds is available on DVD, Winds Of War is availabel on DVD. For crying out loud Natural Born Killers is available on DVD! How is it possible that Once An Eagle is NOT available on DVD? As John Stossel would say: &quot;Give me a break!&quot;"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Given to me by my commanding officer, Once an Eagle has become one of my all-time favorite books. It traces the story of a young soldier who continually finds himself placed in positions of incredible responsibility and danger and gives the reader a peek into his soul. Through the eyes of Sam Damon we see that soldiers are people, too, and that they reflect personalities of every type, from the courageous to the reckless to the evil. By watching how Sam Damon deals with all these different types of people and still gets them to follow him both in peacetime and in battle, we realize that leadership abilities have little to do with education or upbringing, but rather with whether or not subordinates believe that their leaders truly care about them. Once an Eagle is an unforgettable lesson in leadership and soldiering, and I'm sure I'll read it many times over."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I was in combat for one year in VietNam. I thought I knew some things about the interaction of human responses to extreme situations, but this book really opened my eyes to the heights and depths that men and women can go to both in combat and in day to day living. It is an exceptionally well thought out expose of our human condition."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This was one of the best books I've ever read. Lengthy, but at times engrossing. The lead character is terrific, you really believe that this guy actually lived. From a literary perspective, the ending is a masterpiece, but I HATED it. Felt like I'd actually lost a friend, almost cried, for pete's sake, and I'm not the sentimental type. A picture of what man can aspire to be. Gritty battle scenes give some idea of what war is really like, why it's something to be avoided. But it also clearly demonstrates that as John Stewart Mill has said, \\"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.\\" I highly recommend Myrer's epic tale of being a soldier, but more than that, being a man."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this several times and it is a classic of what it means to be a military professional. I also recommend Bob Mayer's Special Forces books or Company Commander a classic in the genre."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"The best book and movie in years,needs to be out on tapes so all of us can have a copy/copys and every one needs to read this book a couple of times,it will help you understand that era and what people when through,it was a hard time for every one.I'm glad to have a copy of &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I cannot add much to the other reviews but as a young LT entering into today's US Army, I was completed amazed at the lessons taught in this book. The author has managed to show the reader two of the leadership styles that exist in today's military, and how each of them worked/didn't work for the characters. A &quot;MUST READ&quot; for any leader of troops!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I am excited to read the other recent Reader reviews and find that people are still reading Once An Eagle. Like some of the other readers, I read the book after seeing the TV Mini series. I was young and just beginning my Leadership career. The protagonist Sam Damon is an outstanding role model. He is much like the great Marine 'Chesty' Puller...or my other hero, the Army's 'Stormin' Norman. Now I am 53, and a small town City Manager; I keep the book on the shelf with other leadership guides as a reminder of my roots, and that you can only lead if others trust you enough to go with you. One of the best parts of my life is to have actually met and been led by Leaders who had the qualities of Sam Damon. Col. Bud Taylor, BG Bob Brainard, Col Dave Gustufson, Col. Joe Sergeant, Col. Paul Myron, all of the CalARNG. Great First Sergeants like Fred Flores and all the NCO's who cared enough to train me. City Councilmen like Rex Sturdevant, Jack Terrell and Gary Strack. Managers like Mike Walker. Read ONCE AN EAGLE; you deserve a good role model! Read Chesty Pullers Bio too!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This is one of those books that should be read by everyone &amp; proudly displayed on your bookshelf. For those who love military historical novels and those who want to know something about combat &amp; warrior code, this is the standard. A most impressive work."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This book inspired me as a adolescent. It, and my father (an enlisted man who gained his commision) inspired me to join the Air Force to serve my country and, hopefully, lead troops. I accomplished both. Unfortunately, the &quot;Courtney Massengales&quot; are winning in the institution, so I'm turning down promotion and getting out. This is the finest novel of the American military and the idealism of young men. It should be required reading for anyone who aspires to leadership."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This is by far the best book I have read. I remember watching the movie years ago and would love to see it again. Sam Damon personifies all the traits that should be commonplace in todays military but is pushed aside by political agenda. I have my own copy that I encourage my Sailors to read."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this book as a 2LT and kept it with me for the next 23 years. It is a goal that every military officer should strive for. Unhappily, most become the antithesis of Sam Damon once promoted to the higher levels. Should be required reading at the War College."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Put simply, this book (or at least excerpts from it) ought to be on every mandatory reading list of every leadership school of every service in the United States. If it were, leadership instruction would be a matter of saying, &quot;Read 'Once an Eagle' and be prepared to discuss.&quot; Request someone help me find a copy of the movie."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Once an Eagle sums up the total experience of a soldier. Sam Damon as written by Anton Myerer is perhaps one of the best characters he ever portrayed. The life and death struggle, not only of war but relationships make this book a must to read. I lost my library in a home fire in 1996 and have searched for this book, my old friend, for sometime now. Having found it again on Amazon.com is marvelous. For those of you that have not read &quot;The Last Convertible&quot;, it is also an excellent book by Myerer. Capturing the lost innocence of the late 30's and early 40's."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"If you want to read about what war in the 20th Century was really like, do not read this book. This book is war-lite, an attempt by a novelist of limited means to create an unrealistic hero who is never wrong in his decisions. Readers of this novel will be edified in no way: the main character is a cardboard cut-out of what Army officers should be, and his antagonist is portrayed as an effete snob. If you want propaganda reading material, read this novel. That's why the Army/USMC likes it so much: it stresses the core values of the modern military. This novel fails in every attempt to create real characters in real situations: the main character, Sam Damon, is a man who does no wrong (and we all know how false a premise that is). If you want to read about what WW2 was really about, pick up something by Wolf Heckman."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"If you are in a position in the military where you are forced to read this book and you wonder why you find it boring when so many others love it, you may rest assured that it truly is boring. I slugged it out to page 137 in the 938 page hardcover version and I give up. I cannot stand to hear another word from that corny character named Raebyrne. Here are the problems with this book. The dialog is insipid. The character development is shallow, much like the science fiction genre. There is not much action. It is a pokey, slow moving book that offers little else except perhaps a depiction of military life and action that is accurate enough to please those who have been there. I have not been in the military, but I have enjoyed many books on military history that are far more stimulating than this novel. If you love this book, fine. If you don't love this book, you are not alone."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Courtney Massengale is a douchebag, Sam Damon is the hero. Got it all. In one sentence. Not about a thousand pages or so. Bleah. Damon also takes too much crap from Massengale, can't police his zipper and doesn't kick his cheatin' wife Tommy to the curb. Mind-numbingly dull and long for a saintly martyr of a hero who could be improved. If you're picking this off a professional development reading list, pick Starship Troopers instead (it's shorter, actually entertaining and more informative)."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I will never understand how I grew up reading all the great soldiering/adventure books I could get my hands on, and managed to never discover this gem. This book is one of those few \\"must read\\" books every young man should be required to read. Sam Damon's life, albeit fictional, is one that exemplifies what it truly means to serve. The takeaways from this book are unrivaled. Sam's advice to \\"always choose to be a good human being, versus always choosing to remain a good soldier\\" represents the precise sentiment I feel so many other great books have fallen short at. I plan on reading this book every 5 years or so throughout my life to keep me grounded and remind myself what life is all about. I sincerely hope every other person who reads this book embraces the one-of-a-kind messages found within these pages."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I was required to read this book several years ago for a class at Virginia Military Institute, and it has stuck with me ever since. I've re-read it twice, and I will again. Sam Damon is at once a great hero, and a normal man; his story shows how even strong leaders are subject to the fear, self-doubt, and temptation that we all face, and how even with mistakes, we can overcome all of these internal as well as external obstacles, and succeed."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. I can't put it down. You will also enjoy this book. I will look for more books to purchase soon. Major Paul"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This novel is really a terrific read. I read a condensed version many, many yearsago and enjoyed it then but find this novel is more detailed and although very lengthy....a great book. It is more than I had expected it to be but I am definitely not disappointed in it. It is a wonderful military novel. I also wasable to purchase the DVD through Amazon as well and though I have not viewed it yet, I believe it will be an asset to the book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"While this is a great novel, it is also one of the best books I have read about war. The plight of Sam Damon is captivating from his enlistment early in the book, through to the end. Damon excels at every position he holds in the military because he truly cares. He cares about his soldiers first and the Army second. He is intelligent and courageous and leads us through his decisions and considers his own leadership. He evokes a self-analysis of anyone in the military, or in a leadership position anywhere, as his plight is not unique."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I read this book 20 plus years ago, and it is compelling reading. The characters are drawn from real life, and could only have been written by a man who has lived life in the army. His intimate knowledge of military history and understanding of how the military thinks are so clearly the recollections of a man who had a career as a soldier. Anyone who wants to know why wars are fought should read this book. They remain fought not for the reasons we are told by our leaders, but for politics both national and global. The point of view of the young enlistee who rises to the GeneraL rank is perhaps a creation of two or more people, but thed names Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower are clearly two who could have been that soldier. If you read 1 novel about the military, this would be my choice."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Once an Eagle dispells all romantic notion of war and heroism and at the same time paints an outstanding picture of what it takes to be an outstanding and effective leader. Sam gets out in front 100%. He won't issue an order unless willing to carry it out personally. A great, inspiring read."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I am an Army ROTC cadet and will soon be an officer. This is absolutely the best book I have read concerning the science of warfare and the art of leadership. I highly recommend it to anyone charged with the responsibility of the nation and the populace."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Very informative. Once an Eagle explains in concise prose the maxims of leadership and relates military truths that are so much the dramatic foundation of popular military fiction titles like The Triumph and Glory or superb films like Saving Private Ryan."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"In college, while I was still gung-ho about the military, I read this book and it inspired me. This overdone novel centers around the life and times of its protagonist, Sam Damon. An athlete, scholar, and leader cut from the finest cloth, Damon epitomizes everything the military wants in its leadership. He is &quot;a soldier's soldier,&quot; able to see things from the point of view of the common joe. As he climbs through the ranks, we are able to see everything the Army went through in the first half of the 20th century. Chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico with &quot;Black Jack&quot; Pershing, WWI, the deterioration during the inter-war period, WWII, and Vietnam are all covered. We also witness the dichotomy between a humanist leader (Damon) and his nemesis, the careerist Courtney Massengale. Myrer also illustrates family life in the Army. The choices Damon makes in the battle between Army and family demands seem to indicate that in order to go to the top, Army comes first. Since entering active service, I have re-read this novel. It seems that Myrer makes an excellent argument against making a career in the military. Damon, the perfect leader, experiences nothing but frustration the higher he rises. Army politics and an &quot;old boy&quot; network are too much. There are some who argue that idealists should stay in and try to make a difference. On the personal front, Damon alienates his lovely wife, Tommy. During their marriage, he passes up several chances to leave the service and take on a normal civilian life in a lucrative field. At least Damon had the oppurtunity to go to war and prove his manhood. Not that I'm eager to test my mettle, but today's military is almost run like a business. Why devote your life to a profession that no longer maintains its honor? Meetings are conducted regularly to talk about budgets and readiness rates. Having spent time on staff, and knowing several staff officers, I can say that units regularly fudge their numbers to make commanding officers look better. The Courtney Massengales of the world are crushing the Sam Damons. Perhaps this is what happens when an army is at peace too long."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This is the book that Clancy, W.E.B. Griffin, and all the other military groupies wish they had written. It is a great read that appeals to the military officer class, but it is no great literary work. There are no great lessons to learn here, as put forth in other reviews, and this book has no other great value either. But, for a darn good story, I recommend this book wholeheartedly!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"No offense to anyone that loves this book, but I just couldn't get through it. The corny dialogue and cliched descriptive passages make the book seem as if it is aimed at boys between the ages of 10 and 14. Also, I was annoyed that every female character in this book is completely one-dimensional."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This book is the most over-rated book on leadership I have ever read.Sam Damon is the knight in shining armor who can do no wrong. As a teenager, prior to even joining the Army, he spends his time writing analyses of Civil War battles that one would expect from a graduate of the Army War College. He decisively beats the lumberjack-size town drunk in a fist-fight hands down. He does everything right.Oh, excuse me...he commits adultery by having an extra-marital affair. But hey, Sam Damon is such a stud, he deserves the right to blow off a little steam with some Army nurse.What aspiring leaders need to understand is that it is possible to be an exceptional leader, maintain your integrity and dedication to your subordinates, and accomplish the mission despite human limitations. Aspiring leaders need to understand that while innate talent is important, dedication and perseverence and living by a set of firm moral values will enable you to succeed as a leader.We don't need an &quot;out of sight&quot; Sam Damon to inspire our aspiring leaders. Instead, consider studying the paths to greatness of real human leaders who actually walked the face of the Earth, such as Abraham Lincoln.My point is, how can you truly credit anyone, such as the hero, Sam Damon with such honor, courage, and commitment, when the author has already built-in so many talents that the humans among us can't even relate?I admit, this is a pretty good book...it reads extremely well, and of course Sam Damon is a model of the very best motives and attibutes all combat leaders should aspire to. I guess it was the extra-marital affair that really put me off, as if that's no big deal. The way I see it (I've been married for eight years and an officer for ten), if a man or woman cannot or will not honor the vows they made on the altar, I have a hard time believing that they would honor the Code of Conduct under pressure. Like, 'I can't resist my urge to do the wild thing with some nurse behind my wife's back, but on the other hand, you can push needles under my fingernails or torture me with electric shock, but I will never betray my country.'Yeah, right."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"It's strange that an anti-war book has no advocates outside of the military, but plenty within it. This book is a period piece, when liberals like the author had a residual respect for the military left over from World War II, but wanted to distinguish that war from Vietnam. So the author wrote this book positing a \\"good soldier\\" against a \\"bad soldier.\\" The book received all sorts of acclaim, but the Left moved on to its current hatred of all soldiers and this book soon became forgotten, justifiably so.But it came back through an unlikely source. The US Marine Corps has a reading list containing books which its personnel are expected to read. Most of these works are useful and well written. This one is not.Neither the good soldier nor the bad soldier are the least bit credible. The good Sam Damon comes across like some sort of comic book hero while the evil Courtney Massengale is Darth Vader in khaki. Massengale is, of course, like the villain in all too many pulp novels by unimaginative writers, a repressed homosexual who tortured squirrels as a youngster. One admires the authors restraint in failing to give Massengale a mustache to twirl.For the first part of the overly long book, the plot meanders along innocently enough. Then Damon spends time with the Chinese Communists. The storyline goes that his career went off the tracks at that time. I don't know about that - he does, after all, get promoted to general - but the book certainly leaps the rails.Forget that the Communists spent more time trying to undermine the Chinese effort against the Japanese invasion than combat Japan. This book has a lot more serious problems than that. The author would have you believe that a general whose entire career was spent as a staff officer could suddenly become a corps commander in charge of an invasion (don't use Eisenhower as a counterexample: he had plenty of command experience); that a general could cover up a blunder which results in the destruction of an entire regiment; that a general like Damon could be bought off with a medal and is too stupid not to demand in writing the order he knows will result in a disaster; that a general like Massengale can convince the US government to invade China and only the intervention of another general can stop him. The absurdities get worse.I suspect that the only reason this book is on the Marine's reading list is because it makes the Army look bad. If the military wants to have its officers get a real lesson in leadership, have them read The Thin Red Line by James Jones. There are no comic book heroes there. You learn how a good officer can lose the trust of his men by promising something he doesn't deliver on, how treating your troops as fellow humans can make them willing to die for you, how bad soldiers can redeem themselves.There is no reason for anyone to read Once an Eagle."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Once again Hollywood writers have taken what is considered a classic military book and turned into a lousy movie. They have corrupted the story line so bad to the point I quit watching after the first DVD! Maybe one of these days the producers of movies like Pacific and Band of Brother might consider re-making this movie and make it more truer to the book."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"It is a good story and the writing starts off good and clear but when it gets to the battle scenes, the abstract, jumbled up what is going on starts, and the author assumes (I guess) that the reader understands french and North Carolina hilly billy isms, I know about 3 french words and thats it, the phrases that Raebyrne the North Carolinian comes with were for the most part beyond my figuring out what he was trying to say, I like to know and understand what is going on in a story, perhaps most readers just skim thru it and see the \\"big picture\\", every marine has to read this book?, how do they know that they did? are they given a test?, an edited version omitting the gibberish would suit me far better."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Perhaps, all the rave reviews and hype were bound to be too great for the actual book to live up. If that were the case, I would leave it right there.The author, Anton Myrer, overreaches in both scope and time. His begins from just prior to WWI to the advisory period of the Vietnam War. This four decade span is too much for Myrer to cover in this one tome, leaving out the Korean War and many of America's &quot;little wars&quot; while concentrating on the dreary, poverty-stricken inter-war years of the '20s and '30s. While making a good facsimile for Army life of that time period and certainly exposing the rank (using all meanings of this word) politics of peacetime service.The real problems with this book have to deal with the &quot;so-called&quot; lessons that I see military officers believe are afforded by this book. They would like the future leaders of our military to read this book and learn its lessons. And what lessons would that be?Would it be the lesson that most military marriages are failures? Would it be the lesson that the hero, Sam Damon, a.k.a. the &quot;Night Clerk,&quot; would as a mustang and an idealist lose out in almost every career turn to the West Point Protection Association and one of it's perfumed peacocks? Or do they prefer the almost ludicrous and cliche-ridden dialog of the Khotiane protagonist whose sophistic comparisons of his fight to be the one on par with our Founding Fathers and Lincoln's Union would seem to have an affinity with the hero? As it certainly does with the author.I say every citizen who has to register for Selective Service or contemplates enlistment, should be required to read this book. To familiarize themselves with those types of men who would send them into combat and risk their lives in doing so. To see the reality of the best they could expect and, more importantly, the worst they can expect of those who would lead them."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Do not be deceived by the praises heaped on this novel by military officials: it is not nearly that good. It is a passable foray into the minds of two military men, but it is also about 300 pages too long. No reader who is unfamiliar with U.S. military history &quot;insider knowledge&quot; will understand why the two main characters are so diametrically opposed in their approach to life in the military/warfare. The book is more of an inside joke than a story, but only Army brass would get it. If you've never been in the military, this book will mean very little to you and disappoint you. If you've been in the military, you'll understand what's going on and wonder why nobody in charge learned anything from reading it. I've been in the military and think it's a boring book with occasionally interesting sections. Myrer is dead, so save yourself the cash and read &quot;Red Badge of Courage.&quot; You'll enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"You will be disappointed. This book was written by an Harvard graduate. He never made it very high in rank as a Marine etiher and it leads one to naturally question his viewpoint, since he never had to command anything larger than a fire-team. So, if you think you're getting good insight into the real nature of leadership, forget about it. If you want to know what life is like in the military, read &quot;Brave Men&quot; by Ernie Pyle. It's a book with real stories about real people in the Army. Or, read &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; by Stephen Ambrose. There's so much more in those books than this book. I don't see why everyone lauds &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; after all, it is an absolute fiction. It's military mythology. It's a comic book without pictures. Sam Damon is too good to be true, almost comically - which is why it becomes ridiculous fiction - he's a Dudley Do-Right to the Army's Officer Corps. Meanwhile, the book's Snidley Whiplash, Courtney Massingale, is busy being a busy body, hobknobing with the senior ranks to get ahead. True, you see this in the military, but people are much more mean and nasty over even more mundane and petty things than getting ahead in the ranks. It's what a Harvard grad thougt a good leader should be: egalitarian to the extreme, humble, technically proficient beyond his ability, the ability to be predict the future, and a commie sympathizer. Remember: Myrer graduated from Harvard. Let's not forget what that crowd gives us (read: socialists.) As if you couldn't tell, Myrer's character &quot;Massingale&quot; really was patterned after General MacArthur. Unfortunately, Mac led troops in WWI and wasn't a staff officer. I'd read TR Ferenbach's &quot;This Kind of War.&quot; No book better describes what goes wrong in the military and what we could do to correct it better than that one! Yep, &quot;Once an Eagle&quot; really lets you down."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Quite Simply, one of the finest books about professional soldiers ever published. This is the story of the US Army from WW I to the beginnings of Vietnam. It is also the story of one true American hero, &quot;Sad Sam&quot; Damon, the former Night Clerk and Nebraska farm boy who receives the Medal of Honor in France in WW I and goes on to retire a general officer in the early stages of America's involvement in Vietnam.Sad Sam is a Mustang who learned early to take care of the people he was responsible for. In the process, he also earns a battlefield commission. In the interwar years, he sweats out numerous moves,terrible pay and slow promotions. But, he never loses his way.His foil is the ambitious, scheming West Pointer, Courtney Schuyler Massengale. Courtney Massengale is the quintessential &quot;staff puke&quot; who doesn't like to lead troops, doesn't like the field and doesn't like to get dirty. Like our vaunted Commander in Chief, he also doesn't like to tell the truth, either. As a result, he manages to manipulate his way to the top of the officer corps, where his brand of leadership (or lack thereof) can do the most damage.I read Once and Eagle when it was first published (I was 14 at the time) and it made me realize that I wanted to be an officer just like &quot;Sad Sam.&quot; I even tried to live my life by the code established with his dying words to the son of his dead friend Ben Krisler. He said to Lt Col Joey Krisler, &quot;if you ever have to choose between being a better person and a better soldier, always try to be the better person.&quot;It is reassuring to see that the Army and Marine Corps think so much of this book that they have influenced bringing it back into print. It should be the required leadership primer for all second lieutenants and ensigns. I hope every potential Courtney Massengale at West Point, USAFA, USCGA and USNA see themselves in its pages and mend their ways before it's too late (for them, their service and their troops).This is a book about honor, integrity, loyalty and service. These are noble words for concepts which have been erased from the popular lexicon of everyday American life. While the military has once again re-discovered this book, I believe it should be introduced as required reading at the high school level, where it might have a real impact.As a caveat however, I offer the quote from the flyleaf where Myrer found an eagle, stricken with a dart, said when he saw the fashion of the shaft, with our own feathers, not by others' hands are we now smitten.&quot;AeschylusThis is a powerful warning to those who would do right by America and her armed forces. There are numerous enemies operating from within. This book gives us a wonderful hero but, it also warns us to look over our shoulders as well. The resurgence of this book should also serve as a reminder to the &quot;perfumed princes&quot; in the officer corps that their oath is to the Constitution, that their duty is to the country and that honor demands that they put the nation above personal consideration.The men and women of the armed forces, who are sworn to obey the orders of the officers appointed over them, deserve no less. The nation deserves no less and Anton Myrer's novel from 1968 reminds us of that even today."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I don't have the education to be as eloquint as these other reviewers, but I was a soldier, and a NCO.

For my money, this one of the truly GREAT novels of our time. The war hero who hates war may be a cliche character, but Myers hero, Samuel Adam &quot;Sad Sam&quot; Damon, is no cliche, but one of the strongest characters in fiction. From boyhood on a Midwestern farm in pre-WWI America to Indochina, Damon leads men, and leads them not by saying &quot;Forward men&quot;, but with the old infantry credo of &quot;Follow Me&quot;... yet despite his ability as an officer, he is always torn by his own doubts of that ability and by guilt for the deaths he feels he is responsible for. Damon stand as an example of the &quot;perfect officer&quot;, so of course he is required to be opposed by a perfect example of the non-perfect officer, the ambitous and ruthless Courtney Massengale, who is always at least one rank above Damon. The battle scenes are horribly realistic, and helpness Damon feels, especially in one part when he realizes that he and his command have been betrayed by Massengale, and if he (Damon) can save any of his men, he must do so at the expense of his best friends life, involves the reader to a degree seldom seen in any novel. I have been told that &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; is required reading in the Marine Corps and the Army War College, as an example of all a officer should be, and if true, no book can serve better as a textbook for that than this work of fiction. It grabs you and refuses to let you go, ever. You won't read &quot;Once An Eagle&quot; just once. It is truly deserving of being called &quot;One of the World's Great Novels&quot;...."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"In the military or not, this book captivates you. I have read it several times over the past 10 years, and the parallels to my business-life are uncanny. My whole point in writing this reveiw was the result of seeing one person who rated it with 2 stars. I appreciate one's opinion, but wanted to make sure the overwhelming positive reviews stood out!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"A book comes along once in a great while that not only entertains but inspires... not only educates but enlightens. There are few of those. Then there is another kind of very special book that is in a league entirely of its own - Anton Myrer's Once an Eagle. Not only does it do all of the above, but it also uniquely serves a niche audience - budding young military officers. In terms of capturing what it truly means to be an officer in any branch of the service, this book has no equal. In ensuring an eminently readable work of fiction with broad, universal appeal, Myrer's prose is simply as good as it gets.Once an Eagle reminds those of us who have chosen the military profession what a legacy we have to uphold, the one handed down by our forefathers and embodied in these words: duty, honor, country. One need merely observe Sam Damon, the protagonist in Once an Eagle, for an example of how one serves a cause greater than himself. Though a fictional character, Damon exhibits an All-American authenticity uniquely his own. The reader cannot help but feel a deep affinity for him and to believe unreservedly in his inherent goodness. He is someone who you, frankly, would love to meet and share a beer with. That he is the creation of a gifted novelist matters much less than the opportunity to learn from his abundant qualities as a soldier, as a leader, and as a man. He IS the ultimate leader, unparalleled in his ability to motivate soldiers to do what no human being wishes to do: assault an enemy fighting position.Damon, a WW I battlefield commissionee and Congressional Medal of Honor winner, is every man's hero and every military officer's demigod. He is the epitome of professionalism. His dedication and selfless service to the nation in spite of the many hardships he experiences in far-off lands stands out as practically anachronistic - a throwback to the era of the Roman legionnaire. Although several times in the story it seems the Army has finished with him, Damon somehow receives yet another duty assignment, smartly salutes and moves out. He eventually achieves flag rank and another combat command. Through all he maintains his deep and abiding commitment to his profession. He lives his life stoically and by a higher set of ideals than many Americans of his era. His integrity is awe-inspiring.Courtney Massengale, Damon's antagonist, by contrast epitomizes the careerism and self-centeredness that was an unfortunate feature of the Army during parts of the early and mid-20th Century. A West Point graduate, Massengale ascends the rungs of the career ladder effortlessly. What makes his behavior particularly odious is that it often results in soldiers being killed needlessly in combat. Equally disturbing, he relies on a Machiavellian approach to manipulating individuals and circumstances such that he is best positioned for promotion and highly coveted commands. Unlike Damon, his loyalties are not to his country, the Army or his soldiers... no, simply to himself. In spite of an unremarkable combat record, he ascends to flag rank by relying on intellect, a magnetic personality, and cunning.Myrer's strength as a novelist is clearly in his ability to spin a mighty tale pitting good against evil. Once an Eagle, though quite lengthy at 1,200+ pages, reads so easily and grips the reader from start to finish. In addition to ensuring the book is historically accurate, the author does a brilliant job of capturing almost every nuance of serving as an officer in the U.S. Army (even though he was an enlisted Marine!). It's uncanny how accurate the story details are! The characters are so real and richly textured! And as the book wears on, they act even truer to form. We can even anticipate what they will do in the next situation. One is able to easily identify with the people who populate a Myrer novel. All of us have known a Courtney Massengale, but likely very few a Sam Damon.In one great novel we get an epic tale spanning the major 20th Century wars along with the all-too-human Army officers who fight them. Courage, selfless service, and honor are but a few of the qualities demonstrated in abundance in Once an Eagle. Most significant, we readers witness a consummate leader at the very pinnacle of his profession who is able to get there purely on merit. Lesson learned for those newly minted military officers out there: Sam Damon's success springs from an unshakable belief in placing duty first, serving honorably, and taking care of soldiers (or sailors, airmen, or Marines). He offers an extraordinary example of a fearless and committed warrior without an ounce of guile... only an uncommon character and an intense desire to accomplish the mission.Sam Damon represents the very conscience of the U.S. Army Officer Corps!Every reader connected to the military would do well to follow Damon's example.For everyone else: If you are ever going to read a military novel, this is it!Simply awesome!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This is my favorite book, period.It is the story of a soldier, Sam Damon, and the issues he faces as an infantry commander during World War I, during the era between World War I and II, and during World War II. More than anything, it is a reflection on the nature of war, and most importantly, it is a reflection on the nature of leadership. It has become such an icon in military that many difficult ethical issues are often framed in \\"What would Sam do?\\"The lessons in leadership are told through the career long conflict between Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale. Massengale is a caeerist who cares nothing for anyone but himself and who especially does not have any concern abut how his actions impact the soldiers under his command. Sam Damon is exactly the opposite. He cares about the people under his command, and acts accordingly, often to the detriment of his own career.Many, in both civilian and military life, have tried to model themselves on Sam Damon. It's a worthy aspiration."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I've read this novel at least a half dozen times.

The major conflicts are between Damon and his wife, Tommy, who is thoroughly sick of the military, and between Damon and a self-promoting officer named Massengale.There is not a cardboard character anywhere in this well-written work and its chapters are chock-a-block with memorable phrases. A reader's loyalties to the characters will likely change several times before the final page. The author's consideration of duty -- and conflicting duties -- and the costs is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I just finished reading this book for the second time and loved it just as much as the first. This is definitely an anti-war book because it takes an honest look at war and its savage effects - and Myrer should know as a Marine who served in WW2 and got wounded in the Pacific.Myrer does an amazing job of characterizing a military man and his family/friends in both war and peacetime.Many of the military/political ideas continue to be valid as America finds herself in another ambiguous war.Though Once an Eagle is a historical novel it packs a realism most histories (or even military novels) don't possess. It should be required reading for anyone in the military whether active or reserve, enlisted or officer."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"In a country where Goldie Hawn can share a stage with Zig Zigler and share stories of their successes; here is superior fictional story on how to live one's life. You see, the two protagonists in \\"Once an Eagle\\" are very different. There is a bit of black and white imagery used by Mr. Mryer, but the story of the choices that Sam Damon and Courtney Massengale make, need to be told and re-told.When were young and read Remarque's \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\", the quintessential war novel, I'm sure not many of us identified with Paul's former teacher. Why? Because, Paul's journey is more interesting and his character's development is the focus of the book. It's the choices of an idealist youth who grows into a man after seeing the horrors of war that calls to all of us. Anton Mryer has updated that story, made it fuller, more complex and has extended it over two adults lives. And, yes there is a message here to be found here. I was taught that the choices we make determine who we become. Well, what better life model than that of Sam Damon. As a father, I can only hope my own children make similar ethical choices!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Anton Myrer, a former U.S. Marine, has written the all-time greatest novel of a soldier's life of service. The protagonist, Sam Damon, was commissioned on the battlefield but never forgot his simple and honorable roots as a citizen and enlisted man. He lived a life of dedicated service, loyal to his subordinates, leaders, the Army, and the nation, and rose to two-star General officer rank. His nemesis was a West Point graduate, Courtney Massengale, who was never a soldier at heart, but merely a careerist... out for himself. On one level, these two characters provide contrasting types of military officers, one noble and self-sacrificing, and and the other obsessed with personal aggrandizement. On a more intimate level, these two characters represent the struggle within every soldier's heart between the allure of promotion and prestige, and the call to duty and humble loyalty to his men and profession. Myrer died of cancer on Robert E. Lee's birthday in January 1996. I read the book before I was commissioned at West Point in 1976 and the story stuck with me throughout my own humble 20+ year career as a constant conscience and counselor against self-promotion.

Vietnam was reaching it's peak and the Armed Forces was never out of the headlines. Since that time, I've taken it dwon from the shelf and re-read it. I have found it of value in my military career as a reference on leadership and personalities. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest or need to know about positive and negative leadership traits. The lead charecter starts his military career in the desert and scrub of Mexico searching for Pancho Villa. Sam Damon is not in the branches that might have a little dash or adventure such as the cavalry or air service. He is a ground pounder in the infantry as a private who's biggest concern is learning water discipline. He moves on through ranks and gains a commission during World War I and manages to retain it following the war. The inter-war years and Damon's adjustment to both married life and military life on officers row is insightful. World War II is Damon's moment to shine; he does but not without personal costs both within his immediate family and his service family. His end is both moving and I felt, almost inevitable. This book is not a quick read, nor is it one that is good for only one time. It's value is from rereading it and learning something new each time. I highly recommend this book. My only criticism is that it is rather high priced; I wish the publisher could get it down to where more people would be able to purchase the hard bound edition and not the paperback."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"You've had Total Quality Management. You've read Sun Tzu and Musashi on business as war. You've been to Outward Bound and you've undergone Team Building exercises until you're blue in the face. Now read the novel that has more to say about the qualities a real leader should have than any text written by a management guru--Anton Myrer's classic &quot;Once an Eagle.&quot;The book is a youth-to-death story of &quot;Sad&quot; Sam Damon, a midwestern boy who steeps himself in military history and a code of honor that requires him to step forward and take the lead in almost every situation. Myrer has tapped into a simple truth. That's what real leaders do; they lead.While Sam Damon is a military hero, he's no marble monument. Myrer shows us that real world leaders are assailed with doubts, real fears, and insecurities that can lead them to cave in to expediency under extreme pressure. But in Sam Damon, Myrer shows us that true leadership can consist of recognizing your mistakes, swallowing hard, and stepping up to the plate again to do the right thing.Such a strong protagonist clearly needs a strong opponent. Myrer delivers with Courtney Massengale, a supremely brilliant and ruthless adversary whose weakness, as Sam Damon realizes, is that he does not love any man. It is the byplay between these two characters that Myrer uses to telling effect in illustrating how love is a key element in leadership.&lt;b&gt; I know of half a dozen executives who have patterned their management styles on Sam Damon's lessons. They are the best bosses I ever had. This is a book that should be required reading in our service academies, and as part of every MBA program and civil service exam in the country. Fortunately, it's also a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"When you sit down to read this book by Anton Myrer, you may realize that you are reading one of the most memorable books of your lifetime, even though I found the beginning almost a different, less polished writing style from the rest of the book.Myrer introduces us to a night clerk who has a gift for leadership and a photographic memory. He joins the infantry in time to search for a Mexican raider, with little realization that he is about to be caught up in the most turbulent decades of the century where he will succeed and also fail.Through combat, a battlefield commission and being awarded the Medal of Honor, \\"Sad Sam\\" Damon, \\"the night clerk,\\" experiences the excruciating trials of war and the loss of a best friend just before war's end in 1918. Determined to learn from the lessons and losses of war, Damon prepares himself for the next one while marrying and raising a family in the peacetime army of the 20's and 30's.Courtney Massengale is his nemesis, an ambitious and heartless West Point graduate who is a veteran of many staff assignments. His personal success is more important than the lives of men, duty, honor, or country. He is always one rank ahead of Damon who is his counterweight. Massengale's ambition depends on Damon, and Damon and his troops will depend on Massengale.Thirty years of checking and blocking are put to the test as Major General Sam Damon finds himself subordinate to Corps Commander Lieutenant General Massengale who masks the real purpose of his operations order to his generals, except Damon sees what his true purpose is. Massengale is after one of the most singular achievements of the Pacific in World War II. Damon exacts a promise from him. A promise kept will save Damon's division, or if broken, be the cause of its annihilation.Will he succeed?From the pursuit of Pancho Villa to the escalation of hostilities in a small Asian country called Khotiane in the 60's, we see through Sam Damon the struggle of one man to maintain honor and loyalty, prepare his country for war, and endure the revulsion and tragedy that war brings.I have not read before or since an author who can bring the fear, and peril of battle and make it seem so threatening and so intense. You almost expect to smell the death, and feel the heartache of personal loss and grief. This is an anti-war story; it is not one of patriotism. It is a reminder that in the heat of battle, soldiers are not fighting for a cause, a flag, their honor, or pride. They are fighting for their friends and for their lives.Although I read this story thirty years ago, the characters and the story stay fresh in my mind.

The book vanished -- his way of sparing me. I did not wish to be spared.A visit to the US Army War College and a recommendation by MG Edward Atkeson inspired me to buy ONCE AN EAGLE and to realize that this was the same book I had investigated as a teen.Coming to it as an adult, a writer, and a civilian scholar, I know what I'm reading: one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, possibly in the English language. It's an extravagant claim to compare it to WAR AND PEACE, but I think it's a claim that may stand the test of time.Here is a whole world: not just the men who fought and fight, but the men and women who support or oppose them. Here are not just nations in conflict, but values. And here is what we all want and need: a clear moral choice as exemplified by Sam Damon, mustang, straight-arrow, MOH winner, who made not war, but duty, honor, and country his career (though he never went to West Point) before entering his last war.I am grateful to the War College for reprinting ONCE AN EAGLE and hope that, once again, civilians will also read it as they did upon its initial printing. At a time when an immense, post-Vietnam gap exists between US military and US civilians, the work of Anton Myrer, the Harvard man who was a gentlemen ranker on Guam, is very necessary.And I would like to thank the other reviewers here on Amazon (whose work I found very moving) for their reviews, certainly, but -- much more important -- for their service to our country."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Literally the only non text book I read in four years of college...I've probably read it 5 times since. I've since worn out that first copy and I continue on another. Myrer has written, quite simply, the finest modern American war novel.Damon's (Myrer's) prayer for strength in leadership (&quot;...let me not fail them...&quot;) was on my desk or wall or wallet in every leadership or staff position I had for all my years of military service, as was his statement that a man must be prepared for the awful shrieking moment when he knows he may die on a lonely hilltop 10,000 miles from home.I made my lieutenants read and discuss the book, named my tank 'Sad Sam' after Damon (my XO's tank was 'The Wolverine' after Ben Krisler)and had it been in print in the late '80s would have had my students buy it as their leadership primer. When he is old enough, I will ask my son to read it.Composed of the traits of fine American officers and sergeants, Sam Damon's life is a rich tapestry filled with great success and great failure. That is the magic of Anton Myrer, he created a character who was truly believable.His protagonist, Massengale, is just as real - and he exists today in one or more arm chair senior officers. I've met him, as have others.A must read for all leaders, military or civilian...truly one of the finest examples of modern tragedy that anyone could write.I salute the memory of Anton Myrer...it was an honor to have read his work and known him through Sam Damon!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"As a young man in a USMC commissioning program, I can say that Once an Eagle is the finest leadership lesson I have been exposed to. It should be instituted in all officer ascension programs. Unlike some of the clinical, and impersonal leadership training I have recieved, Once an Eagle humanizes leadership. Myrer artfully shows how Damon becomes a great leader. To put it simply, he cares about his men. This book has helped me clarify my goals for my future military career. The excerpt from when he is preparing for an amphibious assault is especially moving. &quot;Sad Sam&quot; prays: &quot;Help me be wise and full of courage and sound judgement. Harden my heart to the sights that I must see so soon again, grant me only the power to think clearly, boldly, resolutely, no matter how unnerving the peril.

I would like to note that Anton Myrer was also a Marine rifleman at one point of his life. . .Once an Eagle's characters are inhuman. No man can match the dignity and sense of duty of Sam Damon. Few men can match the evil of Courtney Massengale, and none of those have worn the uniform of our country. The situations in Once an Eagle are preposterous; each one is form-fitted to provide the reader with the most insight into the characters.All these alledged flaws (which other reviwers have used to justify their low marks given) are the very things that make Once an Eagle such an outstanding book. By making the world of Once an Eagle such a high-contrast and black-and-white place, Anton Myrer gives military leaders the perfect yardstick to measure their actions. Each new lieutenant aspires to be a Sam Damon, and wishes to God that he does not become a Courtney Masengale. The qualities of Sam Damon- integrity, a sense of duty, the deep parental feelings towards his men- are the qualities that make armies strong. These qualities, above technology or resources, are the qualities we hope that our military possesses. To paraphrase a former Marine Corps Commandant: while the circumstances of war change, the essence remains timeless: war is a struggle of will. Once an Eagle is the perfection that our military leadership aspires to, because the qualities of Sam Damon ensure victory in that &quot;struggle of will.&quot;Other reviewers have disparaged Mr. Myrer's military experience; how can a mere corporal speak of leadership? I believe that a corporal in charge of three other men in a fire team has the most tangible grasp on leadership- the results are always in front of him. As a corollary, it can also be said that as one rises in rank, the more difficult is becomes to grasp the principles of leadership that a corporal plainly sees. The qualities of leadership necessary to be a corporal are magnified proportionally as one commands more men, but the requirements are the same: integrity, a sense of duty, and a parental attitude towards the men he commands. Perhaps that is why Mr. Myrer has written such a magnificent work.During the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I was told to take nothing but the most essential items. I skimped on the extra underwear and put my copy of Once an Eagle in my pack instead. I wasn't afraid of running out of clean underwear- I was afraid that I would not live up to the example of Sam Damon if and when the moment of truth came. I think Once an Eagle is THE moral compass of fighting men."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Having last read OAE when I was in junior high, reading it again in my 30s was a real treat. All of the innuendos and references to common cultural icons as well as being in the U.S. Army for about 2 decades made the book come alive like new.To fully understand OAE you need to be in the military or a veteran. Just to understand the lingo of such things like &quot;TO and E&quot;. If you are not Army, get that way!When I first OAE I was desperately looking for heroes. Today, I see myself in the book. The reason is that if you care about the mission and the men certain inevitable conclusions will follow. Sam Damon is concerned about saving lives and he is a technotactical wizard who sees the connection between cargo net construction and wasting valuable time at sea exposed to enemy fire. As a military professional, I am able to read the book and vicariously live the experiences of WWI/WWII Army life as Myrer knew that life was.I reread the book to try to understand Courtney Massengale and why he is such a monster and how many today are like him. Clearly the answer is that Massengale believes in nothing. Life is what you can get for yourself and he goes through the motions of life in his own mental caccoon not loving anyone least of all himself.Massengale got this way by losing daily contact with lower ranking people in the Army. In contrast, Sam stays close to the men and can handle the truth unvarnished whereas Massengale wants it sanitized. Interestingly Myrer has Damon meet General MacArthur and shows him in a good light as anguished over leaving his men in the Philipines yet employing creative bypass tactics saving lives.OAE is a very clever book full of hidden meanings and connections if you look for them. I even found Damon advocating the speed march as a way to &quot;maneuver warfare&quot; and collapse enemies, as his gamble at Moapora did. The insights into how the Germans failed to take Gibralter to control the Med were very interesting..I suggest reading the book with a highlight pen, making your own notes in the margins the next time you read OAE.If you get a chance to see the TV mini-series, the U.S. Army and Armed Forces Radio-TV is said to be showing the series overseas in a few months and perhaps you could get a serviceman to tape it for you.Sam Damon is making a big comeback in the U.S. military!I think its time we write a sequel to OAE. I like the 1976 TV mini-series cover and wish to see it on a new version of the book in paperback. The TV mini-series has a better ending than the book, but the book's ending is designed to trouble you.SAM DAMON LIVES!"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"Anton Myrer's \\"Once An Eagle\\" is a magnficantly written novel, on an epic scale, of life in the United States Army from World War I to Vietnam. In it, Myrer, a World War II Marine Corps veteran, describes the highs and lows of the life of a soldier, from the adrenaline rush and awful fear of close combat to the dreary routine of dilapidated peacetime army posts between the World Wars. Myrer manages to capture the awful truth known to all professional soldiers, that war is both a fearful waste of individual human life and the final abritrator of the destiny of nations and ideologies.Myrer's narrative is built around the life of one Sam Damon, a farmboy from Nebraska with character, common sense, and a determination to make a difference in the world. Damon enlists in the Army, gains a battlefield commission in the First World War, survives the long tedium and glacial promotions of the interwar period, and goes on to make Major General in the Second World War before his final service in the beginning throes of a thinly disguised Vietnam War. Damon is the epitome of the professional soldier, dedicated to his soldiers and to the ideals of his profession. His nemisis throughout his journey is Courtney Massengale, the ambitious, successful, and selfishly cynical staff officer, who dreams of personal glory on the scale of a Caesar. Their paths will repeatedly cross, Damon a believer in the possibilities of men's souls, Massengale just as firm a believer that \\"neither grace nor nobility nor love existed in this world.\\"Myrer has populated the novel with a richly developed cast of supporting characters, most notably Sam Damon's wife Tommy, a fiery officer's daughter who will dutifully follow Sam through a succession of assignments and deployments while raising their children. Myrer deftly captures the tug of war between the call of duty and the demands of home, and the painful compromises and deferred hopes that result.Myrer has also a gift for capturing a sense of time and place, whether the small Nebraska hotel where Damon earns his nickname, \\"the Night Clerk\\"; a chateau in wartime France; or a muddy line of rifle pits in the Southwest Pacific.This book is highly recommended to the reader looking to understand in fiction what often gets hidden by the facts about armies and about wars. It is a long book at around 900 pages, and it pulls few punches, but the dedicated reader will be well rewarded by the effort."},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"This may well be the best book I have ever read-and I have read it at least five times. It is certainly the best book of its type with which I am acquainted-better even than War and Peace. It is about everything: war, and the awful waste of combat; the price of idealism; the choices and compromises we make in our lives; love and truth; the search for the meaning of life; and mostly about the costs that living and choosing entail. The hero, Sam Damon, is one of those very rare characters in fiction who touches-and changes-the lives of readers. Caught in turbulent times, he only rarely gets to glimpse the &quot;glory&quot; and glamor of them. But he takes part in more than his share of the awful, bloody, dark side of historic events. Myrer's gift is that he is able, despite sparing the reader nothing of the truth, to transport this into an uplifting, optimistic experience. Reading Once An Eagle is an unforgettable experience, providing more insight about life and soldiering, and being a person of honor and integrity, than dozens of good biographies or histories ever could. I envy the reader who has yet to experience this book for the first time"},{"Title":"Once an Eagle","review":"I concur with most of the other reviews...read this years agoand never forgot it.

I have a grandson who will enter NROTC (Marine Corps Option) this month, and I am hoping that his reading of ONCE AN EAGLE will lay out a pathway for him as to HOW to become a leader of men. In almost all instances Sam Damon, the hero-protagonist, reveals himself as a man who can make the hard choices, who has the courage and composure for coolness under fire, and who possesses the noble instincts to choose the right act at the right time almost always, and his recognition and acceptance and love for his enlisted men is a monumental and pivotal attribute of his character. Pretty simple: he loves them and they love him right back, and he is right there, wherever there is, with his men. There includes the absolute FRONT anywhere and everywhere.Courtney Schuyler Massengale lll is the exact oppposite of Sam and is the slickest and most adroit officer in the Corps---a marvelous study in contrast to Sam.We get to observe them both as they work their way slowly toward becoming general officers...three and four stars.

But after reading it, I wish it had been two or three thousand pages! It is basically a history of the Army and the nation from Pershing's Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa to the beginnings of the Vietnam conflict. The protagonist is everything a combat commander should be. He has trouble advancing in peace time however, because he's not a good politician. Balanced against him is an officer who knows staff work back to front, and is good at persuading people to do what he wants. Unfortunately, he is more interested in advancing himself than in serving his country. In the end though, he is not evil, just bad.

It just shows Russ as a regular kid, doing regular kid stuff. Any child who likes fire engines will love this tour of a real firehouse.

Looking forward to it!"},{"Title":"Russ and the Firehouse (Day with Russ)","review":"This is a terrific book about a little boy with DS who visits his uncle's firehouse in Chicago. The story is simple and clear. The photos are lovely. The actual story never mentions Russ' DS which I think is just the way it should be. He's just a little boy visiting a fire house, however, kids with DS will be excited to just see him in the photos and other kids will benefit from what I can only describe as his \\"normalcy\\". I purchased this book initially because my own son, who is almost 3, has DS. He really loves this book and it has become one of our regular story books. Which puts it in the ranks of classics like Brown Bear, and Goodnight Moon at our house. Russ is just a little boy who gets to help out around fire engines one day. What kid wouldn't want to do that!"},{"Title":"Russ and the Firehouse (Day with Russ)","review":"As an educator, I absolutely adore the inclusiveness portrayed in this book.

If I had to pick a subject obscure enough to have escaped the onslaught up till the end of last century I might have ventured: 'Pataphysics, an intellectual peral whose creation we owe to the unique and tragic genius of Alfred Jarry. But even this unlikely target seems to have now fallen under the pomo scalpel if one is to blame Christian Bok's recent \\"'Pataphysics: the poetics of an imaginary science\\".Finding himself a letter short of a book, Bok opted to write an \\"obfuscule\\", i.e., a statement to his own misaprehension and misappropriation of his subject. These start appropriately with the title. Presumably because it concerns itself with the search for imaginary solutions, 'pataphysics becomes \\"an imaginary science\\"! By the same token the Chemistry of aqueous solutions would surely become an \\"underwater science\\" or the Psychology of Serial Killers a ... \\"a murderous science\\"! In fact, 'Pataphysics is not A science, real, symbolic or imaginary much less the pseudo-science that Bok keeps harping but, as Jarry forcefully underscored, 'Pataphysics IS Science!The remainder of the book belabours the presumption that 'Pataphysics represents a stage in some secular clash between Poetry and Science (read Good vs Evil) without offering any kind of evidence for the existence of such confrontation, not to speak of why 'Pataphysics would be called into the fray! Bok regards this downturn as a remedy to the avowed disengagement of 'Pataphysics which does not apparently square with his own militant anti-science agenda. Thus he vows to outjarry Jarry by making him a born-again Nietzschiean and liberating the little Derrida inside him (as if Ubu was not enoUgh)! Though he calls his work \\"a survey\\" he is quick to veer of his purpose under the ridiculous pretext of \\"avoiding the normalization(?) of patahphysics\\" ... \\"by alluding intermittently to 'pataphysical enterprises' that do not refer to the tradition of Jarry but nevertheless represent some of the exceptions to the genealogy that this survey posits.\\" And, immediately following, he takes exception to his own anti-normalizing scruple by offering a classification of the exceptions found in the lore of pataphysics --- not questioning, of course, whether once classified under his rule these remain exceptions! But even his translation of the pataphysical bon-mots betrays Bok's distorting agenda: sizygy becomes 'alliance' as opposed to the confluence it has expressed since the greeks, clinamen is 'deviance' rather than the simply 'deviation' to better echo the 'transgressive' postures that the post-modernist must fashion him self to assume. Soon enough the Deleuzian deleuzions, the Althusserian trussles, and the Baudrillardian inbroglios raise their wrongheadeness overshadowing any other pretense to \\"survey\\" Jarry or his 'pataphysical descendance. Bok gives hardly more than a page to the College de 'Pataphysique (most of it invoking Samuel Butler!), which he calls and 'absurd school' and equally short shrifts Queneau, Torma, Daumal, Arnaud, Duchamp and Shattuck (all very interesting individuals on their own.). who animated it before its self-occultation in 1972 He never mentions Vian, Satie, Salvador, Miro, Dubuffet, Ionesco, Marx (Groucho, of course), Clair or Prevert: all Satrapes of Highest Munificense in the 'Pataphysical Pantheon. He ignores the contributions of such classical american 'pataphysicians as Gelett Burgess, Walter Arenberg, Tex Avery or Frank Zappa or current ones like Bill Griffith, Peter Shickele, Mark Leyner or Karen Mantler. Instead he picks three 'case studies' of 'pataphysical influence which he insists in parochializing as Italian Futurism, French Oulipism and Canadian Jarryism. Needless to say these excursions are hampered by Bok's peculiar myopia and thus remain perfunctory and unfair to the movements and individuals he sets to describe in all respects, including their different 'pataphysical inspirations. Aware of Bok's credentials as an expert in recent Canadian literature I was hopeful of gaining some enlightenment about the late \\"Four Horsemen\\" and their intensive experiments in sound poetry, in comics and VoIdeo or the unique work of the intriguing Christopher Dewdney, to which Bok dedicated a number of articles. What Bok delivers is some unsufferably pedantic description of anecdotical exploits wrapped in some diatribe against the poetic promoters of canadian nationalism, a subject which only becomes 'pataphysical malgre' soi, much as Bok's own language does at its worst. Here is a typical gem [p.15]: \\"Science graphs a rhizomatic flowchart, an agonistic force field of diversified catastrophies, some which collide with each other, some which collude with each other, all of which operate together simultaneously in fits and starts as asynchronous rates of incommensurate change\\". The only thing conveyed by such bouts of verborrhea is that Bok takes 'pataphysics to be something like and extension of his poetic license to sokalize his mixed metaphores well beyond the merely silly into the much netherer reaches of the truly idiotic (or \\"ideotimistic\\" as he no doubt would call it)! All he manages, finally, is to become the joke he does not get. Ah Ha!For all the talk of parody and irony, the single remarkable thing about Bok's prose is how entirely destitute it remains of humour, wit and charm --- the recognizable signposts of the 'pataphysical, as of the scientific and the poetic at their very best! If is is any indication of what his poetry may be like, I am sure to never find out and that may be the one devisable merit of this essay. For anyone truly interested in 'Pataphysics I urge the Fayard 2000 edition of \\"Les Tres Riches Heures du College de Pataphysique\\" which you can get from Amazon France or, in the english speaking world, the &lt;a href=\\"www.atlaspress.co.uk\\">Atlas Press publications&lt;/a> of the Institutum Pataphysicum Londoniense."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"This book is a fine addition to any organic chemist's library.

He has systematically synthesized and, with his wife Anne and a group of trusted psychonauts, \\"bioassayed\\" a wide variety of psychedelic/entheogenic drugs. I use both terms because the subjective effects of each substance vary tremendously, from the entheogenic properties of MDMA and 5-MEO-DMT to the less pleasant but nevertheless fascinating properties of many other substances that are more psychedelic (mind-manifesting) than entheogenic (deeply spiritual). Shulgin's work deserves to endure and stand among the great works of science.One of the things that impresses me about Alexander (Sasha) and Anne is that they somehow avoid the over-the-top trippy new-ageyness that many psychonauts who consider themselves to be \\"in-the-know\\" fall prey to. It is true that the experiences reported in this book and in many other places are weird, transformative, beautiful, terrifying, and ultimately laden with facets that are unexplainable. The problem comes, in my view, when people start believing that they truly understand the meanings of the experiences they have and then build elaborate cosmologies upon that basis. The Shulgins avoid this. Instead they report upon the subjective experiences and the potential of these to benefit when used under the right conditions, as well as their potential to do harm. Certainly the descriptions of their experiences are interesting, compelling, intriguing, and in some cases quite moving.This is a book that anyone who is interested in consciousness, the nature of reality, and shamanic (and similar) spiritualities will find deeply rewarding.

They are there, in full detail for the chemist though lacking basic instructional material for the enthusiastic but untutored. (Like, they might not say what LAH in Et2O is, or that LAH can explode...) The syntheses include not just the overall gist, but grams of this and mls of that, including the extractions and purifications.However, what Shulgin will give you that you didn't plan on is an insight as to why this is interesting in a scientific sense - the benefits in psychotherapy, the DRASTIC differences between effects of these chemicals in humans as opposed to rats, to the point where one compound is a highly effective analgesic in the one &quot;taster&quot; who has tried it so far, yet was ignored because rats had no effect, for example.Last but not least, note that his DEA-approved research laboratory was busted and shut down in retaliation for his publication of this book. Solidarity...!The &quot;love story&quot; itself (biography of the authors) ranges from fascinating to dull as you go along.

I find it fascinating that Shulgin has synthesized so many psychoactive derivatives of phenylethylamines and he has without question laid the groundwork for future research into these compounds, however, this can be assertained from any of his scientific papers he has published throughout his career.This book does not provide insight to how pyschedelic phenylethylamines work on the brain and serotonin receptors and how they change/alter our conciousness. This is the chemistry that is vital to our understanding of these drugs. While he does touch on certain topics regarding functional groups and their positions in relation to pyschoactivity it would have been nice to see him elaborate further. The synthesises in the second half of the book would not be of any use to anyone who has not taken several years of organic chemistry along with years of lab experience.I also found that a majority of the pyschological and philosophical discussions wrapped within the trip reports to be of no use to educating the reader on the inner workings of our mind and conciousness and may even confuse them. There are aspects of both Eastern idealogy and Western philosophy in the discussions, but they seemed to be misinterpted and leave the reader feeling as if nothing was accomplished mentally and spirtually. The MDMA experiences mentioned were the only ones I felt that gave some insight and expressed its capablity as a theraputic tool.Shulgin was probably one of most influentual chemists/pharmocologists of the 20th century and an amazing human being, yet I feel PIHKAL falls short in providing the reader with enough knowledge of psychedelics. I thought Straussman's 'DMT: The Spirit Molecule' was a more thought-provoking read and a better educational tool on the subject.

Could these pharmaceuticals be helpful in ameliorating the emotional flatness associated with disorders on the autistic spectrum?"},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"Only people who already use psychedelics could actually like this book. The first parts (the story parts) are horribly written. Dr. Shulgin sees fit to add the line, \\"And he's a good friend to this day\\" after he introduces anyone. Ann Shulgin's part is no better. The part where she describes her first use of Peyote is so contrived she might as well have lifted the dailogue from a 50's propoganda film. The story they tell could be interesting if they could actually write, but sadly they can't. Each chapter, a chemical is picked, and they write the story about it. Sometimes, Dr. Shulgin even describes its effects. This is so obviously some fan service for the users who read it, because the effects sound in no way enticing. If you're looking for an entertaing read, look elsewhere. If you're looking to learn about psychedelics, look elsewhere. The final part of the book, the recipe collection is quite useless unless you're a chemist who knows how to get those compounds and make them. Don't let anyone say different, he doesn't teach you how to trip off of the nutmeg in your kitchen. If you already do psychedelics, this book will just reinforce all that you believe. This book would've been better if Dr and Ann Shulgin could write, and if they weren't so dogged in trying to convince that psychedelics are good for us."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"This book is divided into two halves. The first half is the story of Shulgin's life, from childhood to modern times. It is a moving and beautiful tale of one man's attempt to make sense of the world and his place in it. Intertwined in this personal experience is a budding love affair with a woman who could only be rated as amazing.The second half consists of Shulgin's recipes and notes on the synthesis of every compound in the Phenethylamine category that he has ever made.Overall, this book will change the way you feel about psychedelics, and the reasons that people use them. The story is at times inspiring, at times heartbreaking, and always genuine. Highly recommended as an introduction to the spirituality behind psychedelics and some of the issues involved with them."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"This book is fascinating. It is not an &quot;I like trippin' and listenin' to the Dead&quot; book. It is a very thorough, interesting account of the work of two very intelligent and thoughtful people in the area of psychedelic drugs and their influence on/application to human life. Here's a quote that gives some idea of the orientation of the book: of marijuana (not a phenethylamine, and thus, not really addressed fully in the book), Shulgin writes, &quot;I have chosen not to use marijuana, as I feel the light-headed intoxication and benign alteration of consciousness does not adequately compensate for an uncomfortable feeling that I am wasting time.&quot; Of psychedelics, he writes, &quot;the potential of the psychedelic drugs to provide access to the interior universe, is, I believe, their most valuable property.&quot; This isn't a book about seeing jerry-bears and setting up clandestine labs. It's an introduction to a new way of exploring one's relationship to the rest of the universe. It is wonderful and an invaluable resource to all who are willing to try to deal with this piece of the puzzle."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"I purchased PIHKAL from Amazon and read it in it's entirety.The most poignant aspect of this book reveals that as we are organic machines, our consciousness is just another chemically induced perception and therefore only one valid reality predisposed by evolution for survival.Shulgin's Genius is honed with such objectivity, innocence, dedication and clarity that he is able to both successfuly and interestingly document the human-mind altering effects produced by the synthesised compounds entirely dedicated to the second-half of this book.Furthermore, I have read all of the Amazon reviews regarding PIHKAL and feel that some just do not get the extreme depth of this work. Reading this incredibly open account of Human reality means that there will always be dull bits and parts that make one cringe because that's how real life is for one and all.The potential reader needs to approach this work with an open mindset and absorb the content without pretence, preconception or professional envy affecting clarity because this book is about the other side of the coin.Finally, to dedicate ones life to recording Human perception so openly in hardcopy is a tremendous quantum leap ahead of the absurd revisionist realities that people in our \\"Soap World\\" prefer to pretend that they live via TV and use to deal with personal issues through the application of anger, violence and greed which are wrongly accepted as legitimate relief mechanisms.In summary, PIHKAL is an extremely important piece in the Jigsaw of the \\"age of reason\\" and awareness. Don't be threatened, it definitely deserves at least \\"5 Stars\\". Read it, do it and get to the next level...... the evolution of mind."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"I had assumed this book to be new-age fluff after havingseen it referenced so often in other new-age fluff books.So I was quite surprised to find that it is really afascinating scientific biography, a genre I ampersonally addicted to. The 'love story' wanders into thefluff zone occasionally, and the chemistry recipe bookwanders into extreme alchemical arcana, but overall itsa comprehensive compendium that is unique as far as I know,and a valuable record of the behind-the-scenes historyof the California new-age 80's. I am only puzzled atDr. Shulgin's lack of comment or experience in the traditionalspiritual practices, since even though he frequented Zen centerswhile doing his assays, he seems not to be the least curiousas to the perspectives of these traditions.I was also interested to read more about the mysterious therapistreferred to as 'Jacob' in the book 'The Secret Chief' by authorMyron Stolaroff. Check out this book after 'Pikhal' and youwill get a fresh and equally important perspective on thepractices of this seminal group of psychic healers/explorers.somebody oughta make a movie! :)"},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"While the story itself is rather interesting, the last section of PIHKAL ('book II') is the true star. It's not a story...it's a list of aprox. 200 psychoactive and potentially psychoactive drugs, each lovingly described as to structure, synthesis, dosage, and effects. Each item is based on the core skeleton of phenyl-ethyl amine, which Shulgin laboriously explored at virtually every point, substitutive alkyl groups, thio groups, halides, etc. (Methoxy ring substituents are especially popular in his work.) The result is an astonishing array of hallucinogens, amphetamines, and some seemingly inert materials. While he is perhaps best known for his work on MDMA, the drug that would later gain infamy as the illegal drug 'ecstasy', it will surprise most readers to discover that MDMA is only one of an entire family of psychoactive drugs, each with their own sometimes subtle, sometimes astonishing differences. A truly extraordinary, landmark work for the pharmacologist, or simply those curious about psychoactive drugs from a more technical, exploratory stance. (That said, if you wouldn't know a carbon atom from a Honda Civic, you'll still like the biographical part, which is anything but dry and technical.)"},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"What's amazing about the Shulgins is their ability to isolate the nuances that make drugs like MDMA and MDE different from one another. The separate entries at different dosage levels are not only insightful, but essential to the potential experimentor. Reading this will make anyone cautious about buying what is considered &quot;ecstasy&quot; by the current youth culture.The Chemistry is beyond me, but it's still fascinating. Buying this book is worth being put on any government list. Yes, it's that good."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"Very rarely would one find a scientific journal worthy of study. This is one. It is jam packed with experiments, observations, thoughts and procedures related to the chemistry of mind altering substances. As I am not a chemist, I glossed over the more technical aspects of the work, but as an Engineer, I was \\"blown Away\\" by the methodology and unique perspective. In his own way, he is a trail blazer and a real inventor. A person who like Telsa, Bell, and Howard Huges persued a dream of discovery and exploration. He used his scientific training to forge ahead where other fear to tread, and he makes light of it in such an off hand way. THis book is an INSPIRATION to any BUDDING young CHEMIST.

And I am shamed to admit the reason I read it was to see if all the rumors were true. They are. But that's not the interesting part of this book. The interesting part is that it has a really wonderful story about the athors and their lives. Alexander Shulgrin seems like kind of a jerk but his philosophy on life and why he does what he does more than makes up for his behavioral quirks. Also, it has some good guidelines for people who are looking for something spiritual rather than just a good high.It is an incredibly informative book, I recomend it highly. (no pun intended)"},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. This is the Shulgins' first autobiographical account of the search for new derivatives of mescaine, includuing the re-discovery of ecstasy (MDMA).. It lies on the cusp between top-level synthetic chemistry and guru-level self development, and is a must for anyone interested in selfdevelopment or recreational drug usage. Cannot be too highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"Haven't finished. First part is a autobiography, second part is a synthesis and Shulgin's reactions to the chemicals he experimented with. Larger than you'd expect, but thats cause its basically 2 books in one."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"The only useful part of this book is the catalogue of chemical syntheses in the second half of the book. It is important to have this information documented and available, either in a single volume like this book or scattered through the scientific literature. Whether buying this book for the collection of synthesis is worth it to you is entirely up to you.That being said, I must say that I find this book almost entirely useless and pointless. Yes, I like knowing how to synthesize these substances (and I suspect that I'm in a minority when it comes to those who've read this book in that I understand the syntheses). I also want to know how these drugs work. How are they metabolized? What receptors do they bind to? PIHKAL offers none of that information. There is no useful biochemical information in this book. I think monoamine oxidase is simply mentioned once.I find this book very disappointing because Shulgin's scientific papers are excellent and this book offers almost no insight into psychedelic drugs. The first and second parts of the book aren't linked together in an interesting way. The collection of syntheses in the second part is just that: a collection of syntheses with some notes on effects when the substance was ingested by volunteers and a few asides.Shulgin summarizes some of the empirical findings regarding structure and activity (eg. '. . . an ethyl group here makes this compound last longer. . .' or '. . . this analogue is more of a stimulant, while the parent compound is more hallucinogenic . . .') but that's it. There is almost no hypothesizing about why these structural relationships are observed. Not even a guess about how a structural change might result in altered metabolism or increased affinity at one receptor or anything like that. Nothing about how enzymes work on these drugs; receptor binding; the blood-brain barrier; metabolic products; receptor action and secondary messengers.Reading this book will tell you almost nothing about psychedelic drugs and that is why I think this book isn't very good. You will not understand anything about how or why psychedelics work. You won't even remotely understand the general principles of phenethylamine-derivative synthesis unless you already have a working knowledge of organic chemistry.If you are looking for a book that will give you some idea of how the brain and psychedelic drugs interact to produce such amazing experiences, then this is NOT the book for you. If you're hoping for a book that might tell the story of how a pharmacologist got interested in psychedelics, trying to blaze the trails into psychedelic research with all his hopes of what these substances might do for us or tell us about the brain then you'll be disappointed. Nothing in this book to shed light on how these drugs produce some of the most profound alterations in consciousness.Part I could have been very inspiring, but it wasn't. I think that so many of the things that make the chemistry of psychedelic drugs fascinating were overlooked (and I suspect that Shulgin finds many of those things fascinating). Part I (Shulgin's life) and part II (syntheses and tests with compounds) could have been linked in very interesting and inspiring ways. Life and consciousness depend on chemical reactions. Psychedelics alter those processes, sometimes to make us aware of our limited perspectives, the beauty of a simple object, the hilarity of the fact that life is finite and that we worry about the inevitable. I got no sense of wonder from the author - something that might inspire young people to get into chemistry or current chemists to think about psychedelics again. Instead, part I is relatively uninteresting and part II is just a collection of syntheses, with a few interesting facts thrown into the discussions.Ultimately, the only part of the book that I find valuable is part 2, but even as a drug-using chemist with a long-time interest in psychedelics, the value of part 2 (for me) is simply knowing that I have the information readily available.PIHKAL contains very little useful or interesting information about psychedelic phenethylamine-derivatives."},{"Title":"Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story","review":"This book is long! Even though half of it is chemical breakdowns of almost every type of drug. Not bad but very long winded towards the end, found myself flipping just to interesting parts.

The amount of things that can be done to this little handheld is astonishing, and there isn't another book out there on this console that covers this much. The flashy, foil cover isn't just for show. It's there to grab attention away from the other books on the same topic because they're nearly rendered useless.Hacking the PSP is a 300+ page book that offers something for anyone who owns the console. The basics are here, from simple things like getting video onto the console to playing around with photos. The extensive coverage of the web browser is by far the most well written guide on this feature yet. The layout is simple, easy to follow, and the pictures clear enough in black & white to understand.That's the type of thing covered in other books and the manual though. To make this stand out, Auri Rahimzadeh digs deep to offer some remarkable things to do. He goes above and beyond the call by including a chapter on basic C and C++ programming to get simple code up and running. It would have been expected to toss the code out there for the people who understand it, but Rahimzadeh takes the time to explain the origins of the code, how it works, and why you would want to do this in the first place.Little tips strewn throughout the book offer tiny tidbits that are useful and possible without any hacking. All of those game save pictures on the memory stick can be changed to your liking, something not covered in Sony's manual. It's not the easiest process (and it's arguable that it's not even worth it), but it's here in plain English if you want to give it a shot.The side bars, like the explanation of widescreen and various resolutions is informative, not just filler. Rahimzadeh tosses in some light commentary at times too. This breaks up the guide and offers something different than instruction.Hacking the PSP covers things away from the internals of the system too. If you want to build a cheap car stand for your console, the deeply involving guide is more than enough to do so. It may not look pretty, but it seems functional. There is plenty of information on keeping your battery going, even going as far building an external battery pack if your addiction has gone way over the point of no return and you cry if the included battery dies.The only complaint here isn't against the author, but time. There's zero coverage on newer firmware updates, and while the hundreds of links provided will guide you in the right direction, it's now history to be discussing the 2.0 firmware. The speed of PSP development is simply too fast to keep up with in a book like this.It's the same problem with the other PSP-based books too. We'll never see a definitive guide until this console is dead and gone. Until that finally happens, we have Hacking the PSP, and aside from the web, it's all we need. O'Reily's PSP Hacks, while a solid book on its own, pales in comparison to how comprehensive this is."},{"Title":"Hacking the PSP: Cool Hacks, Mods, and Customizations for the Sony Playstation Portable (ExtremeTech)","review":"Despite the obvious reference to programming in the title (alas, the term \\"hacking\\" has been used for much less worthwhile pursuits lately), the book contains very little with respect to writing applications for PSP.

But now, like it or not, there was a beautiful woman involved. One who could ride, arm wrestle, and play poker like one of the guys. A woman who made him wish for things he could never have. But keeping a watchful eye on Shauna put Ben's sheltered heart at risk. If he continued on, leaving Shauna when the assignment was over, his heart may never find peace.

Smith and Milton","review":"I bought this book for its sub-title: \\"How not to run a design company\\" - expecting to find insight into the management of consultancies, and especially practical insight into how not to do it. In fact the book offers little if any insight into this - so the authors and publisher shoud be prosecuted under the trades description act! - only kidding!! Instead, the book offers a lively (and, as you would expect from a design book, heavily illustrated) account of the life and times of a graphics, packaging and communications design agency based in London - from its start up in the 1980s, through its going into recievership in the late 1990s and subsequent rebirth. I read it with great enjoyment from cover to cover and would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the sector, how it has developed (e.g., through the impact of computers), and operates (client relationships, the coming and going of staff, etc). If, on the other hand, you are looking for practical guidance as to how to run, or not run, a design agency, this is not the book you are looking for (but buy it anyway!)."},{"Title":"ART OF WARFARE IN THE AGE OF NAPOLEON","review":"Gunther Rothenberg's \\"The Art of Warfare in the Age of Napoleon\\" is a highly readable survey of the changes in the art of war during the 23-year conflict spawned by the French Revolution and the Wars of Napoleon. Despite its brevity, \\"The Art of Warfare\\" is remarkably comprehensive, addressing weapons, tactics, strategy, and supporting military services such as engineering and medical care. Rothenberg provides a short synopsis of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and commentary on the military establishments of the principal combatants.Rothenberg rightly devotes much of the book to the innovations of the French Army as it evolved under the necessity first of defending the Revolution and then under the hand of its martial Emperor, Napoleon I. The concept of the nation in arms made possible mass armies which often overwhelmed the small professional armies of its adversaries. Lack of training led to an emphasis on shock in battle, produced by fast moving infantry columns, massed artillery fire, and operational maneuver against the flanks and rear of opponents. Rothenberg notes the effects of a persistent French failure to build a robust supply system. French soldiers in the field were expected to forage to survive. The Army as a whole was forced to disperse to find food, and Napoleon had to rely on exquisite timing to mass his forces in time for battle. The lack of a supply train imparted operational mobility, but when foraging failed, as it did in Russia, or provoked guerrilla war, as it did in Spain, French soldiers starved or were picked off in ambush.The many success of the French Army prompted varying degrees of emulation by the Austrian, Prussian, Russian, and British armies. The Prussians sought most to copy the French methodology, while the British prefered to enhance the professionalism of their forces rather than build a mass army.Rothenberg wrote \\"The Art of Warfare\\" in 1978. Close students of the Napoleonic Wars will find a few mistakes, and the volume has a surprising number of misspellings. However, these imperfections really do not detract from what is an excellent work.This volume is highly recommended to the student looking for a manageable introduction to the Napoleonic Wars, and to the serious student as a superb companion volume to the longer operational-level histories. The casual reader with some background in military affairs may also find this book a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"ART OF WARFARE IN THE AGE OF NAPOLEON","review":"I have several books titled 'Art of Warfare' covering several military history periods, and for the life of me I cannot understand why they are all so thinly bound!

In any case, this book is a prized part of my Napoleonic history collection, and serves as a useful complement to Elting's 'Swords around the Throne'."},{"Title":"ART OF WARFARE IN THE AGE OF NAPOLEON","review":"Rothenberg expands on the typical Napoleon book about war by concentrating on the human factor by explaining what the soldiers went through in victory and defeat.Rothenberg also dissects the French Army like few of his contemporaries by starting with the pre-revolutionary make-up through the advances which made Napoleon famous and victorious.Well written and educational, necesary as a companion to other classics as Swords Around a Throne by Elting, How Far From Austerlitz by Horne, European Diplomacy by Ross, and biographies by Markham and Schom."},{"Title":"ART OF WARFARE IN THE AGE OF NAPOLEON","review":"This work is a clear, concise and readable work on French organization, strategy, and tactics from the French Revolution to Waterloo.

Instead, it's mostly about organization, comparing numbers of battalions per regiment, regiments per demi-brigade, etc., over time and between armies; also logistics, staff, artillery weight, medical corps, and suchlike.

Considering the interesting subject matter, it should have been a hard book to put down. I don't understand how anyone could write so much about so little. It goes on and on and on and on about what she is thinking, it's so repetitive that a few pages later you get to read about the same or similar thoughts for a few more pages. Dialogue between characters is rare and there are huge gaps that leave out much needed information to get the gist of Malinalli. So disappointed, like I said before, with the subject she chose to write about this should have been chock full of historical information and adventure, instead it spends it time trying to make you sympathize with this women who sold her whole people out to the Spaniards. Like she was this before her time feminist, against human sacrifice, new agey chica. How can the author know this? Esquivel takes a lot of leaps in this one, so many that maybe she shouldn't have even used the Malinche name, but wrote it on a completely made up person. Surely there must be a better novel out there on this subject."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"Like several others, I really enjoyed \\"Like Water For Chocolate.\\" I was looking forward to another book by Laura Esquivel, and this story seemed interesting - I knew nothing about the character of Malinche.Malinche (or Dona Marina as she also known) was a slave who became a translator for Hernan Cortez during his conquest of Mexico and the Aztecs. It is believed she betrayed her own people because of this, and she has become villanized. This book is supposed to protray another version of her, a bit more understanding of why she did what she did.There isn't much really known about Malinche, other than legend, so Ms. Esquivel could have taken a lot of poetic license. In some ways, I believe she did, but I don't feel she went far enough to develop the characters. I never really knew who Malinche was. I was not familar with her culture or the system of the society in which she lived. Perhaps, because Laura Esquivel writes to a mostly Mexican audience, she believes people already have that background? But I'm not Mexican, and I don't have the background. I got the Spanish were evil and bloodthirsty - but were ALL of them like that? It also seems the Aztecs were the same way. So, everyone, everywhere was filled with bloodlust?Laura Esquivel goes into a LOT of detail about the religious culture of whatever background Malinche was. The reader is constantly bombarded with the Native names (which are difficult to pronounce - I tried!), and going on and on and on and on and on - ad nauseum - about the snake goddess and the overall god and this god and that goddess. If I wanted to read a book about Native American religions of Mexico, I would have borrowed a book from the library, or enrolled in a class! It seems this is the main focus of the book, and not the story of Malinche!Unlike the flowing language and magic realism of \\"Like Water For Chocolate,\\" this book struggles to find itself and it never quite does. It is dull and tedious and shallow. Perhaps it reads better in Spanish? Well, in English it is such a disappointment."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"Pienso que no es lo mismo leer el libro a que te lo cuenten....

I don't understand the woman at all and it is hard to care about her too much because she is such an underdeveloped character. Is she that desperate for phsyical attention? I am halfway throught but there is no context or explanation for why she would find her sexual subjugation desirable. It is pretty annoying and offensive to me as a woman. Maybe Esquivel should have worked longer on this one."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"There is nothing worse than an author who tries to re-write history for the sake of entertainment. Laura falls into the same politically correct category of historians who paint Cortes as a gold hungry murderer. Although it's true there were many conquistadores who sold indians into slavery and exploited, Cortes was not one of them. His enemies stationed in Cuba, jealous of his conquest and imagining him to be hoarding 'all that gold' to himself, would start up rumors about him and send them via letters to Charles V back in spain. But eventually the rumors were rectified. The friar and soldiers who traveled with him, who wrote down the actual accounts in journals and who were first hand witnesses, all agree that he was a hero risking his very flesh to end the evil of hummingbird wizard's bloody holocaust and bring christianity into the lives of the Aztecs. Under the Aztec rule of terror, tens of thousands of human sacrificies that lasted for days were performed on a regular basis depending on the feast day. At one point, Cortes knew that his fellowmates would be tempted to leave on the ships they came inon so he burned them and told his soldiers to march forward. He was badly outnumbered and beaten down and hungry since Montezuma had cut off food supply to the spaniards. these were not the actions of somebody who was gold hungry. Cortes was determined to stop the horror. Later on after the fall of Hummingbird Wizard (the man who was really the power beind the throne) and Montezuma, Cortes traveled south to catch up with a rebel and he foolishly left mexico city under the rule of 4 governers, all who disliked him. They started their rule of abuse. The indians started associating this with all spaniards until Isabel of Spain sent more support and more friars. The friars, who the Indians loved and respected for their vow to poverty and their indifference to gold, were sometimes martyred and abused by the money hungry rebels of the spanish crown.

'Malinche' was interpreted from Spanish and tells the saga of a young native girl. Always Esquivel brings a brilliant and unusual blend of point-of-view, story & magic. In this ambitious and creatively crafted book, the historical facts she offers in an at-times-chronologically-defiant story line is fascinating and brings to vivid life the historical figures, culture & climate of the 1500's Yucatan Mexico. I feel sorry that one reviewer didn't even give this powerful character and worthy story a chance to be understood before quitting after page 50 and then giving a bad review.I admit the long Mexican names slowed down the flow of reading for me initially but once I got past this, the story was so captivating that upon reading the last sentence, I immediately started it all over again and appreciated it even more this second time. One other thing to understand is that there is a very spiritual aspect to the main character, Malinalli. For me, that is what is so sparkling in the book. Esquivel is one of those rare & gifted writers who brings to life a contemplative woman who is deeply connected to the Elements, the Sun, Corn, a Horse and all of nature. The descriptions of the powerful relationship and the conversations she has with her wise blind grandmother I read and re-read. If the reader is not aligned to a mystical way of perceiving life, it may not appeal. I did appreciate, too, how much of the mysterious history of that period was brought to life for me so that I gained new understanding of those tumultuous times.It is now among my favorite inspirational books and some day, if I am ever ill or impaired I will request some kind person to read me this book aloud.

Very disappointing for a 'historical account'. Worst book I've read in over a year."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"MALINCHE by Laura EsquivelAugust 26, 2006Rating: 4 StarsFor those who enjoy historical fiction, MALINCHE is a captivating novel that takes the myth of Malinche (Malinalli) and recreates her story - the woman who aided Hernan Cortes in the demise of the Aztec Empire during the 1500's. For those who have read and loved LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE, MALINCHE is a different type of novel, a story that is based on history. Malinalli is considered a traitor in the history books, but Esquivel writes her main character in a way that will garner sympathy from the reader, a different viewpoint of the woman who was Cortes' right hand man, as she was the translator between the Spaniards and the Aztecs. She is portrayed as an innocent victim, someone who made poor choices and lived to regret them.Starting with Malinalli's early years, MALINCHE traces her story from birth, to childhood, to her life as a slave. The novel is filled with myths and fables, and for those who love those little extras, the inside cover to the hardcover book displays a pictograph story of the entire novel, similar to those that were drawn back in the 1500's.MALINCHE transforms Malinalli into a heroine of sorts, while in truth the word malinchista today means traitor. But in this novel, she is portrayed as a woman who was torn between two worlds, a woman who tried to save herself but at the save time, was hoping to destroy the Aztecs and their barbaric human sacrifices. I didn't feel that this was the perfect book, but it was definitely time not wasted, as I learned a little bit of history that I had not known about before, and was entertained with the fascinating (fictionalized) story of Malinalli, the woman who helped destroy the Aztecs."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"Actually, there are any number of curses one could associate with dona Marina, la Malinche. In the present instance---Laura Esquivel's novel about Cortes' remarkable translator---it is \\"The Sentimental Pudding Curse,\\" by which fictionalized accounts of La Malinche have been reduced to mediocrity or worse for over 100 years. I should be grateful that we have this version of the Curse, not the uglier \\"Wicked Harlot Traitor Curse\\" in which Malinche is burdened with just about every nasty character trait imaginable. Still, this is historical fiction at its most unseamly: neither good history, nor good fiction. Esquivel trivializes or pointlessly distorts known facts, and in mashing poor Malinche into a kind of New-Age superwoman posterchild for Toltec dreamers and other such crystal-gazers, she commits as violent an injury on her subject as those who would paint her as \\"chingada\\" (see Octavio Paz) or traitress. It's a silly book, and even if you are, as I am, a lover of all things 16th Century, you will likely conclude there just isn't any meat here. It is at least consistent: read a few pages online. If you like that sort of writing, by all means go buy the book, and I apologize for any implied criticism of your taste. If you, on the other hand, cringe with embarrassment, trust me that ahead lies only another 180 mercifully short pages of the same fluff-headed nonsense.Fortunately, the Curse does not extend to non-fiction, for there is a world of good material on Malinche, the Conquest era, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Start with the astonishing 16th Century documents themselves---they are the source for our knowledge of Malinche, and there's great reading here. Bernal Diaz was a soldier who knew Malinche personally---his \\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\\" is not only a trove of first-hand information (and some first-hand axe-grinding, perhaps) but is delightfully (and sometimes chillingly) readable. Grab a copy of Anna Lanyon's \\"Malinche's Conquest,\\" for a good contemporary look at what we really know about this startling woman. Malinche's world does not need to be puffed up and colorized---it is supremely dramatic all by itself."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"I have read everything that Laura Esquivel has written. Her novels are always filled with images and with passion, imagination and with love. While Malinche is not the best book she has written (that spot is held by Like Water for Chocolate and The Law of Love) it is still one amazing read.Malinche, given away at an early age, finds herself the interpretor of Cortez, who does not speak the native Aztec tongue. Malinche sees Cortez as the re-embodiment of their Aztec lord and stands by his side, even when it looks as if he is intent on slaughtering the Aztec people.After being taken over by the Mexicans, this is the last thing that Malinche wants. She believes him when he says that he has no intention to engage in the mindless slaughter of her people and a love begins to grow between the two. A love so passionate that it threatens to blind Malinche to the truth about who Cortez really is and what he intends to do.This novel didn't have the flow of her other books; it felt a liiiitle stilted, as if it were trying to find its pace well into the short book. But nevertheless, it is a beautiful read. Part novel, part commentary on life, part philosophy text book, Malinche is sure to delight with words and with a pure love that may survive all that threatens to distroy it.Most striking of all is the Codex's included with the novel. The Aztecs used Codexs (pictures drawn in sequence) to tell stories and one is here for us to see. Some of the pictures are scattered through out the novel to divide the chapters; but it is the books dust jacket that is the true masterpiece.If you unfold it, you will be able to follow the love story of Cortez and Malinche without words. The art is beautiful (drawn by Esquivel's own nephew) and is a testament to the Aztec people and a grand love affair.Read and be enlightened.Jamieson Wolf"},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"Nearly five centuries after she helped Hernan Cortes conquer the Aztec Empire, Malinche is still a controversial figure in Mexican history.A noble-born child sold into slavery by her mother, she used her unusual ability as a linguist to enable the Spanish to negotiate alliances with the native tribes against the Aztec Emperor Montezuma. As a result, she's reviled as a traitor to her people and, because she was Cortes' mistress and bore him a son, regarded as the symbolic mother of the Mexican people.In \\"Malinche,\\" Laura Esquivel reimagines her in this latter role, as a deeply devout woman caught in a clash of civilizations and attempting to make sense of what she experiences.Because so little is known about Malinche's life, Esquivel gives her imagination free play, renaming her heroine Malinalli and giving her a grandmother who teaches her reverence for the gods and the natural world.Malinalli's beliefs are challenged when she is given to the Spanish, where her beauty and linguistic gifts are recognized, and she becomes Cortes' translator.At first, she sees him as the personification of Quetzalcoatl, the benevolent god who will put an end to human sacrifice and free her people. But the massacre of a town and his hunger for gold disillusions her, and her baptism into Roman Catholicism challenges her to integrate the two belief systems.\\"Malinche\\" is a short novel, unusual in that Malinalli spends much of it reflecting on her beliefs or recalling scenes from her childhood. The result is a cool narrative that tells of awful events but is emotionally distant.\\"The search for the gods is the search for oneself,\\" Esquivel writes, and in the end, Malinalli's quest for her gods remains firmly within herself."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and frankly never got past page 50. I rated the book 2 stars instead of one because the real story of La Malinche is a fascinating one and at least Esquivel ATTEMPTED to popularize it. But the writing is awful. I read \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" and I recall that it flowed alot better and the storytelling was more believeable. But \\"Malinche\\" just is badly written.For one thing, there is an absence of historical context that would make the tale more compelling; the bloodthirsty gold-seeking Spaniards, the innocent subjugated peasant,and the brutal Mexica theocracy--all are portrayed without any depth. Yawn. Also, the narration in \\"Malinche\\" is as though written by a sixth grader. An omnipotent narrator should be able to convey what's in the character's head without spelling it out as though the reader were an idiot. Here's the sentence that made me slam the book shut and give up for good: \\"Malinalli was completely opposed to the way in which they governed, could not agree with a system that determined what a woman was worth, what the gods wanted, and the amount of blood that they demanded for their survival.\\" Well DUH.Isn't a story more interesting when the characters' beliefs and motivations become apparent through their actions?I wanted to mention: In the first chapters Malinalli spends a lot of time bemoaning her slave status, but she sure seems to have a lot of free time on her hands: visiting fortunetellers, hanging out with her gramma, staring up at the night sky. I'm not saying that being a slave wasn't a bad thing--I'm just saying that the author isn't convincing!!Anyway, the book is short (186 pages) so if you're just dying to learn what Esquivel's take is on La Controversial Malinche, go for it.

These two novels tell the same story--Cortes's conquest of the Aztec empire, aided by his slave-mistress-translator--and explore the same themes--the clashing of 2 cultures, languages and religions--but in wildly differing styles.Sherwood describes her work as \\"contemporary historical\\" fiction (on her own website). She explores events and characters taken from history using modern language and psychology. Her novel is a sensual feast, evoking the place in all its color, texture and flavor and exploring the characters' experience in a visceral way. We get to know a large cast, with Malintzin and Cortes at the center, and the story moves forward with action and suspense.Laura Esquivel, on the other hand, delivers an undulating meditation on the spiritual themes of the story. We are inside the mind of Malinalli as she struggles with her own past, her spirituality, and her role as liaison between her own people and the Spaniards. This is not a linear telling of the tale, and it is all about exploring the highly subjective feelings and beliefs of the main character. It places demands on the reader, in terms of attention span, and a willingness to go to an otherworldly place. This may be why some other reviewers did not want to hang in there for it.The experience of reading both these books was one that I relished and would recommend to any lover of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"Laura Esquivel wrote both the novel and the screenplay for Like Water for Chocolate; her husband, film director Alfonso Arau, directed the movie.Malinche is the story of Malinalli, a young girl who is a slave given to the conqueror Cortes following one of his first battles after landing in Mexico. She had been raised by her father's mother, after her father's death, and she has beautiful memories of lessons her grandmother taught her; lessons connecting her to the earth, fire, wind and water of the native gods.When her grandmother died, her mother sold her into slavery--at age 5. After years of serving in various Mexica tribes, she is good at languages, learns Spanish quickly and begins to serve as interpreter for Cortes. She becomes \\"The Tongue.\\" She is acutely aware of her role, and what her fate will be if the Spaniards fail--and she tries to translate with as much accuracy as she can.At the beginning she is baptized, and she likes this new religion that does not require human sacrifice; it seems much kinder and gentler. Then she witnesses the wholesale slaughter of the town of Choluca. Malinalli knows that Cortes is not Quetzelcoatl--not the god returned that many think he is, but human and flawed and in love with only gold and power.Esquivel's talent is her words and phrases; her images are poetic. She tells the tale in a format not usual for western novels, more in the style of Garcia Marquez's magical realism. One of the strengths of the novel is the philosophical comparisons between Mexica beliefs and those of the Catholic conquerors, as Malinalli tries to comprehend what is going on around her.Armchair Interviews says: This will make a superb book club selection, a challenge for sure, but worth it. Especially recommended for church-affiliated book clubs."},{"Title":"Malinche","review":"I was very impressed with Lucia Mendez' reading of Malinche. The author, Laura Esquivel did a good job, but of course Malinche does not come close to \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\" However, Esquivel brings life into the ancient story of La Malinche. Nevertheless, Esquivel and Mendez make a great team. Mendez is a wonderful actress. Congrats to both. Yes, I recommend this audio-book because to listen to La Mendez is a treat and such great entertainment.Marian."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"Garth Murphy took fifteen years to write this book, which explains why a reader without prior knowledge of the Californio days will close it feeling satisfied--having learned his history wrapped within an exciting story of love and betrayal. A young Easterner, Bill Marshall, is lured to California in the mid-1800s and his adventure becomes our history lesson. The women in his life--the mayor's daughter, Lugarda, and the native chief's daughter, Falling Star-take their place as unwitting heroines.It's fascinating to read about the nature of the hardy and unworldly individuals of the times, since all but the best of us know instinctively that we couldn't survive one month in similar situations. The details of their living flow, revealing the enormous amount of research, though the facile way it is written belies the effort. The descriptions of the natural settings are enchanting; those of us most content in nature will love reading every single detail of the land and sea, smelling and feeling the living in the canyons under the oaks and the sleeping on the beaches.Murphy writes about Bill Marshall's sexual relationships with an uncanny knowledge of the way a woman's mind works. With native women, he finds sex is wonderfully natural, earthy, uncomplicated. When Falling Star finally surprises Bill with what every woman can relate to, that he was initially an insensitive lover, we have to chuckle. One minute Murphy has on the eyes of the cynical male, the next minute he makes us laugh with his female perspective on callow sex. Not since Larry McMurtry's \\"Lonesome Dove\\" have I had the pleasure of thinking a male has figured us out.At the end, Falling Star's dispassionate outlook is strangely soothing; it lends itself to a sequel. This story spins and spins. It's good and strong like beef stew and biscuits."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"I was quite pleasantly surprised at the depth and breathe of the writer. Is this a man who can also know and write about women and animals so well? Even though I am a strict vegan I appreciated the hunting descriptions as well. Great sensitivity towards the Native American quandry combined with engrossing story. The area will never again seem the same. Thank you for your gift Mr. Murphy."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"The other reviews sum it up... it's a great book, especially if you live in the area. It's really fun to read about places you've actually been to. Also, it's quite an eye opener to see how badly the natives of California were treated by wave after wave of immigrants."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"This entertaining historic novel is a must read for anyone that grew up in California and is amazed by how wonderful this state we live in is and has any interest in what it must have been like in the early days. The writer did a great job of painting a picture of the simple and harmonic life the local Indians enjoyed and the turmoil and injustices they endured. The book made me wish i could have spent some time sharing the good they enjoyed!"},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"Every day, due to comercial and housing developments, there are fewer untouched areas of San Diego that can transport you to the time of the Gold Rush. THIS BOOK IS A TREASURE WORTH MORE THAN ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD. I remember as a child roaming the wild wheat feilds and rolling hills of pure unadulterated Southern California. Every time I read The Indian Lover I relive the adventure of long horseback rides through the countryside and discovering the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of plants, streams, ponds, lakes, canyons and animals. The romance is steaming hot with fantasically descriptive scenes but still leaves something for the imagination. The history of the Native American tribes in the San Diego area is not widely known and it is quite a blessing to finally be awakened to some of the beauty as well as harsh reality. This is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"As a Californian and lover of cultural and natural history, I was excited to find this book. \\"Finally,\\" I thought, \\"Some historical fiction about the early days of California. And he includes a native viewpoint, excellent!\\" Then I started to read it and read passages like the following, from page 23: \\"Grizzly bears are native to California, and were the undisputed kings of the land until the Spanish arrived. The native people revered them, not as gods to worship, but as equals.\\"Say what? You can respect something as an equal, but the word \\"revere\\" automatically suggests a sense of, well... REVERENCE! Okay, maybe I'm splitting hairs here. Murphy spent a lot of time in Australia; maybe they use the word differently there. But I must ask: if the bears were the undisputed kings, how could they be equal to the native people?This is just one of many passages in \\"The Indian Lover\\" that reads like a bad encyclopedia entry. This style even finds its ways into the speech of the characters, who sometimes sound as if they are reading something off of Wikipedia to their friends. For instance, on page 74, Murphy's Indian character, Pablo, tells his white friend (the main character, Bill), \\"An ocean-going trout or small salmon called steelhead returns to this river each year to spawn.\\" Then there is the nearly two-page history of California up to 1845 from the perspective of a Catholic friar, given as a speech by such, to Bill. Yes, it's true that a friar could give a lecture to a newcomer, but the whole thing sounded fake to me.The author also seems to be a bit of a mission apologist. While I applaud him for writing about the complexity of native Californian cultures -- one of the good things in this book -- he paints the Missions as some kind of Catholic utopia that was only ruined by the greed of the Californio ranchers after the Mexican revolution. Murphy rightly states that the Missions were built by Indian labor, but neglects to mention any threat of coercion or violence on the part of the padres. On page 64 he writes: \\"...Mission San Luis Rey was a miracle. Before the mission, the local natives had been known by their village names... Forever after, they were called Luiseno, proudly linking themselves with the mission they had helped build.\\" Murphy is a little misguided here: the Spanish could not pronounce the local names, nor did they really care about such \\"heathen\\" things, so they gave their own name to the locals. They did this throughout California, which is why the Tong-va are also known as the Gabrielino, for instance.Then Murphy writes that it was the awesomeness of the building that caused conversions to to Christianity: \\"The wily padres conceived most of their new Christian conversions by the power of this awesome temple.\\" I laughed out loud when I read that. The Missions were an abject failure and failed to attract many native converts until they had been present for 5-8 years, by which time the large number of live-stock (sheep, horses, pigs, goats, cattle) introduced by the Spanish, combined with the suppression of native burning regimes, had decimated native plant food sources. This, along with a high incidence of Spanish-introduced disease, forced many of the natives to seek food at the Missions and spiritual protection against the strange diseases by the ritual of baptism.I am gravely disappointed by the lack of human complexity in this novel. Each culture comes off as a different stereotype: The innocent, spiritual Indians. The well meaning, peaceful padres. The greedy, dirty, violent, lazy Californios. The land-hungry industrious Americans. Instead of creating a novel in which the main character has his loyalties divided between different people who may happen to come from different cultures (as the book jacket hints), he has written one where the main character is afflicted by different stereotypes.Murphy does write beautifully at time of the southern Californian landscape, but these descriptions are often marred by factual errors. He writes that condors and golden eagles both have eight-foot wingspans. He also has his characters eating corn on the cob and harvesting acorns in the middle of January. While it its true that California is and was a place of abundance, not every food source is available year round. If you think I'm wrong, try harvesting acorns yourself in the middle of winter. If the feral pigs, deer, squirrels, and scrub jays haven't eaten them all by then, that is.This novel idealizes the Californian Indian way of life by making it seem like the people didn't have to do anything to procure food sources from wild plants. This is entirely false and laughable. With few exceptions, Native Californians intensely managed their environment through low-intensity fires at different times for different reasons, one of which was to increase the yield and abundance of certain plant species they relied on for food. As I stated before, the Spanish altered this relationship and it was disastrous for the native peoples. By the time of this novel, the California Indians would have had a hard time living in their traditional way -- and they did indeed. One of the few cultural complexities Murphy includes is in writing about Indians making their living in the Californio or Mexican manner through farming and cattle-raising, but this is seen more as a kind of \\"not-wanting-to-seem-savage\\" status thing than as an economic and environmental necessity.But Murphy does write good descriptions of man-woman interactions. Some of the other reviewers wrote about this. Perhaps he should have written a contemporary love story set in California. It would would have come off as more truthful and real. Each one of the problems I mentioned is not a big thing on its own, but all together just makes for poor writing and a n uneven novel. I thought after 15 years of writing Murphy would have created a masterpiece, instead he has sorely let me down."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"This is a wonderful book...Especially for those of us from theSan Diego area...those of us who are familiar with the Sacredplaces mentioned in this story..."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"Garth Murphy takes you on a time travel back to the beginings of california. The atmosphere is wonderfully engaging and his blend of history and romance is compelling. I could not put the book down once I had started. A must read for anyone ready to be transported back into an adventurous and unpredictable world!"},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"I was quickly entranced by the historical details and beautiful descriptions of the land and life in southern California before it was annexed to the United States. The author created a believable and endearing cast of characters and a story that was engaging and made it hard to put the book down. As the story progressed, I began to care more and more about the main characters until I fell in love with them (not unlike Bill Marshall did with the Cupa Indians). The author did a great job of avoiding hackneyed or cliche dialogue, a pitfall a lesser writer would be apt to fall into in a novel of this sort. In particular, when it came to the Indian characters, their voices were each unique and authentic sounding. Overall, the handling of dialogue in multiple languages was done seamlessly and clearly. Although I am not an historian by any stretch, I felt throughout that the details (historical, geographical, and cultural) that put the meat on the bones of the story were accurate and thoroughly, if not exhaustively, researched. The author gave me confidence that I was in good hands throughout the story.The bottom line is that I found this to be an excellent read (I would give it 4.5 stars if that was possible), thoroughly moving and full of beautiful, deftly rendered prose. For anyone with an interest in the history of California, specifically San Diego County, Mexican/American relations, the history of the cattle \\"industry\\" or who just likes a good love story - you'll find it all here and more. If tears are a measure of emotional investment in a story, then by the ending I was fully vested."},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"A fictionalized history of San diego for a ten year span when the United States beat the Spanish and CAlifornia became part of the US. The novel focuses on William Marshall, a Euro American, hung by the American military for siding with the Native Americans and committing treason. Murphy revises that history (a revision that historians have also started to adopt) to argue that Marshall was not involved in any of the attacks he was accused of and was only guilty of being friends with (and married to) Indians.Murphy does a wonderful job of painting California at this point in history, the cultural clashes and the largely unsuccessful attempts to bridge the gaps across culture.The novel is engaging and the history interesting. I would like to know more about California history of this era. As usual, the white people do not stand out as particularly tolerant of difference"},{"Title":"The Indian Lover: A Novel","review":"I read this book because I lived in North County San Diego for 15 years. As previously mentioned it took the writer 15 years to write this book, well I feel like it took 15 years to read it. Although the history is interesting to somebody who knows and cares about the area the characters and story line are elementary and boring at best. The development of characters and dialogue are forced and unrealistic.I've read text books the held my interest better."},{"Title":"Mixed: An Anthology of Short Fiction on the Multiracial Experience","review":"I read a couple of positive reviews for this book and decided to buy it. Previously, the only similar book I'd read was Half and Half: Writers on Growing up Biracial and Bicultural. That book was nonfiction. What I liked about Mixed is that it is comprised of only fiction, which I've always preferred to memoirs, essays, etc. Short stories are easier for me to relate to, analyze, and explore on a more personal level. I found the stories of very high literary quality (expect nothing less from W.W. Norton). One standout is Ruth Ozeki's \\"The Anthropologists' Kids,\\" which addresses the theme of mixed race and culture with such acuity and nuance that the story transcends its context and becomes a universally sympathetic tale of adolescent discontent and unrequited love. Mat Johnson's \\"Gift Gifting\\" is so brazen and gritty compared to some of the other pieces that its impact is jarringly good. I also enjoyed the elegant simplicity of the pieces by Emily Raboteau and Neela Vaswani. The author's comments on their own stories are sometimes as fascinating as--or even more fascinating than--the stories themselves, as is the case with Kien Nguyen's \\"The Lost Sparrow.\\" Overall, I came away from this anthology with a better sense of what the term multiracial (or \\"mixed\\") means, and how complicated, strange, and powerful a factor race continues to be in many people's lives. This is a unique book, and well worth checking out."},{"Title":"Mixed: An Anthology of Short Fiction on the Multiracial Experience","review":"many generations ago, someone of my racial background-- english protestant, irish catholic, scottish, and german-- might have been considered to be \\"mixed.\\" today i am just considered \\"white.\\" but there are a growing number of americans whose racial backgrounds defy easy categorization in the modern terminology of race. someday, they too may find themselves with a single moniker. for now, though, they struggle with multiple identities in a society that doesn't quite know where to place them. \\"mixed\\" explores the many facets of such an existence, in a diverse collection of stories that have been expertly chosen and arranged into a cohesive whole. for me, some of the standouts were the sly humor of emily raboteau's \\"mrs. turner's lawn jockeys,\\" the awkward adolescence of mamle kabu's \\"human mathematics,\\" the brutal reality of kien nguyen's \\"the lost sparrow,\\" and editor chandra prasad's own haunting contribution, \\"wayward.\\" and danzy senna's \\"triad\\"-- the same story told three times, with the protagonist's race changed for each telling-- is a brilliant conclusion to the collection. on the whole, these short stories should find an audience not only among mixed-race readers, but even among those who never have to check \\"other\\" under \\"ethnicity\\" when filling out forms."},{"Title":"Mixed: An Anthology of Short Fiction on the Multiracial Experience","review":"MIXED explores the mixed-race experience and successfully dismantles so many common misconceptions about people of mixed-race or cross-cultural heritage.

Ninety-seven-year-old Aana Clearwater strongly believes in the traditional ways. She opens her door to the gala attendees, but one of the revelers knocks her down and threatens her with a whaling knife. Her nephew Justin sees the wide open door, enters, and finds a trail of blood, a broken amulet, a swatch of his aunt's dress caught on the doorjamb.Inupiat officer Raymond Attla receives Justin's call. Raymond finds a murdered Aana stuffed upside down in a wheelbarrow inside the victim's shed. The culprit sliced off Aana wedding ring finger. Evidence points towards Ronald Pilchick as the killer, but Ray arrests him only after seeing Aana's finger in a jar next to the prime suspect's bed. Soon Ray begins to believe Ray is innocent and investigates with renewed vigor even if it places his life in danger.Torn between two worlds, the Inupiat straddle both taking what they need from both cultures to survive. Raymond Attla is an honest likable hero who is a modern person who scoffs at the old ways while unable to totally let go of them. Through him and other strong characters, Christopher Lane describes the whaling community so that the reader feels more like a participant rather than a watcher. Though reminiscent of the works of Dana Stabenow, SILENT AS THE HUNTER has a freshness of its own that will provide much pleasure to fans of Alaskan police procedurals.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Finding Courage: History's Young Heroes and Their Amazing Deeds","review":"This is a great gift for a pre-teen or teen!

It takes place entirely in the narrator's head- he rarely mentions any personal contact with other people, and there's almost no conversation at all. The narrator is a struggling writer who spends the whole book analyzing himself and other artists. If you're into painting and literature of 19th century England and France, you should like this book a lot, because he spends much of it talking about his thoughts of painting and writing.

Yet, Wenzel's book, believe it or not, may be the best of the bunch.His writing is so good, that it makes Sklansky seem like a hack. And while many beginners will pick up this book, I think intermediate players (such as myself) will get the most out of it. This is because Wenzel comments on and refutes many things that have been written in some of the other books. What's more, the book is easy to read, yet packed full of useful info.I also like that he doesn't just go forward step by step, but interjects all kinds of useful info. throughout. Thus chapter one is just as valuable as the final chapter. And again, the range of material that he covers is mind boggling.If you want a book that \\"tells it like it is,\\" rather than just giving you a bunch of theory, \\"The Everything Texas Hold'em Book\\" is your baby.

It is not one of those extremely basic beginner type books that does little more than explain the rules of the game and tells you to play tightly. It's quite a bit more advanced than that and I found myself agreeing with most things the author had to say. My only problem with the book and the reason I didn't give it five stars is his treatment of internet poker. He more or less claims it is rigged and is strongly against it. He also makes silly claims like it is impossible to play more than one table at a time well etc. Obviously he is more of a live game type of guy and that is fair enough but he is wrong about internet poker.

Without being preachy or mushy, this book is a wonderful story about land conservation in the real world."},{"Title":"Pumpkins: A Story for a Field","review":"I am lucky enough to be able to see Ms. Ray and thumb through her books at the Concord Farmers Market each weekend. She is a lovely, magical lady and this is a lovely, magical book! I cried when I first read it and it still makes me weepy because it shows such love and hope. (I am a grownup.) It is also very witty and it SOUNDS good out loud, so parents won't get tired of reading it over and over to the children. Everyone should have a chance to read and re-read Pumpkins, any time of year (it's not a Halloween book, really). Several local conservation organizations carry this book because it demonstrates (in a technically unrealistic way, but that really doesn't matter) how one person can make a big difference. I can't imagine anyone not being touched and amused by this book."},{"Title":"Pumpkins: A Story for a Field","review":"This sweet book captivates younger readers with its wonderful painting illustrations, and the simple story of one man's determination. I love the spare, simple text full of evocative details (when he needs to write explanatory tags for every pumpkin he ships to countries that don't have pumpkins, &quot;luckily he knew how to write in many languages&quot;). This is one of those that I get a lump in my throat reading even after who knows how many times through it."},{"Title":"Pumpkins: A Story for a Field","review":"Our 5th grade uses this book to review and demonstrate real uses of economics terms we've learned. Kids have a worksheet with simple definitions of terms and the following columns. Production- Natural Resources,Capital Equipment,Human Capital; Distribution - How?,Where?; and Consumption - Uses. As we read the book together, the kids write examples from the story under the correct heading (we stop often and prompt \\"Did we hear some Natural Resources?\\" YES - the field, the seeds, sun, rain. etc.) This book is such an easy-going way to introduce 10-11 year olds(possibly younger) to the terms and understanding of Economics. Illustrations are also very engaging and gentle."},{"Title":"Pumpkins: A Story for a Field","review":"My son's (4 1/2) current enthrallment is pumpkins--he loves the book Pumpkin Day, Pumpkin Night. So when we found this book at the library the other day he was happy to sit and read it. For some reason we didn't check it out and had to go back the next day to get it (and I've since purchased it here). The subtle absurdities and lovely turns of phrase make this a wonderful book--subversive on the order of Good Dog Carl--and the illustrations are lovely. We love reading this together so much that he's memorized the words and loves to talk about walking in the field amoung the young hills that grow up to be mountains. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pumpkins: A Story for a Field","review":"I use this book each year to teach my class about different countries and means of travel. I made up math related questions for small group work that includes estimating how many pumpkins could fit on/in each means of travel, How many for sale signs the man had to make, the children time themselves writing out the for sale sign that was attached to each pumpkin. Each child also uses multiplication, divison, estimating with the use of calculators.

Catherine Galasso-Vigorito is a most exceptional author and woman of faith. Her beautiful message of hope and encouragement leads me to a place of quiet reflection. She reminds me that God is with me always and this instills within me a sense of calmness and faithful assurance.My personal life has been filled with \\"what ifs\\" and \\"I wish I hadn't.\\" Catherine reassures me that God does love and forgive all of us and reminds me that we should also follow His way.I assure you that if you read this book, you, like millions of others, will feel hope and peace in your life.Catherine writes, \\"Consider the words that are used when talking to our precious children. Criticism and putdowns, even when delivered \\"\\"in fun,\\"\\" can hurt feelings and stunt the growth of a healthy self-image. Words spoken in anger can deeply wound and have lasting effects. \\"\\"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\\"\\" Ephesians 4:29. If your words do not build up or encourage another, it is better to say nothing at all.\\"This may sound simplistic but how many of us have said a thoughtless, unkind word to another, whether it be a stranger, a service rep, a co-worker, neighbor, our children or spouse...anyone who may pass our path at a moment of frustration. This beautiful book reminds us of God's loving kindness and gives us the positive direction we need in our lives.This book is broken into three sections: Mind, Body and Spirit. It speaks to me on all levels.

She doesnt profess to be a biblical scholar or preacher and that approach is refreshing.I read her column in my local newspaper every week and it is a welcome respite from the violence and diatribe of base human behavior that fills most of the newspapers pages.The world is full of clowns who think that they have been shown the way to God and that they have somehow cornered the market on holiness and understanding the will of God. The world we live in is full of people who think their way is the only way to salvation. Who are they to judge others?Catherine is none of that and her writings dont profess that either. Buy her book, enjoy her writing and her upbeat optimism!"},{"Title":"A New You: Words to Soothe the Body, Mind, and Spirit","review":"This is a reprint of a bunch of Ms. Galasso-Vigorito's columns. I find the appearance of her column every Monday in our local paper (she started out her column here in New Haven)really annoying. Her writing has all the psychological and theological depth of a cheap greeting card. Her columns are all very wordy, but they basically recycle three sentences: \\"God will get us through\\", \\"The world is beautiful\\" and \\"Let's be nice to one another\\".The shallowness of her approach is really irritating. She quotes freely from the Bible, but selectively avoids anything that might be challenging or tough. Around Easter time, for example, she talks about the glorious Easter morn, etc., but purposely avoids Good Friday. Nothing as messy as the Crucifixion enters Catherine's strawberries-and-butterflies universe.This, in my opinion, does a disservice to her readers. Christianity is frequently about hearing things we don't to want to, but need to, hear -- about redemption through suffering, about making moral choices, about committment. By ignoring this and replacing it with cotton candy platitudes, faith is reduced to a \\"feel good\\" attitude which is ultimately false and self-delusional -- more \\"New Age\\" than Christian. \\"Soothing\\", by Catherine's defintion, is more like \\"Anesthetizing\\", which is just plain escapism, not faith.There are hundreds of Christian writers that offer more depththan this one. Don't waste time or money with this book."},{"Title":"A New You: Words to Soothe the Body, Mind, and Spirit","review":"This book is full of superficial platitudes from the New Age Rainbow Coalition of the 1980s, John Marks Templeton, then Norman Vincent Peale (Mason and Shriner) and Robert Schuller (\\"Hour of Power\\" television program; do most weird things come from California?). This is the Gospel of Success and Possibility Thinking. His book, like \\"The Course in Miracles\\" teaches that \\"forgiveness\\" is simply recognizing that sin does not exist and therefore there is nothing to forgive. To accept the Courses teachings is to reject all Biblical doctrine, yet those who embrace it are able to call themselves Christians.Like Courses, \\"A New You\\" is the promotion to ignore our sinful nature, which is right in line with Schuller's philosophy. This non-offensive positive gospel of to \\"believe in SELF\\" is hardly new. This new reformation is not repentance or a renewed sense of dependence on God and his word. No humbling ourself before Almighty God. In fact it is the very opposite, a boosting of ourselves to a \\"divine self-esteem.\\" (Schuller was helped into ministry by Masonic brother Billy Graham.) Schuller's salvation was one of eliminating the pain of fear. To Schuller, \\"faith\\" is visualization, a power of the mind; \\"God\\" is there to help one \\"believe\\" and activate our mind power which will change our environment. Schuller smiles as he says \\"now believe and you will achieve.\\" He declares in \\"Self-Esteem:\\" \\"Christ was the world's greatest possibility thinker. Do we dare follow him?\\" Peale has said, \\"Positive thinking is just another term for faith.\\" The Bible says \\"God forbid that I should glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\"It would be better to define sin, demonic influences, hell, salvation, the gospel, and the term \\"born again.\\" The Bible tells us that we are all sinners; our righteousness is like filthy rags before God, that we've all sinned and fall short of His glory, and that there are none who are naturally good or righteous. The Christian strategy is the attempt to make people aware of their lost and sinful condition. This book is psychology and it has come into the church disguised as a help to our self worth. But this is HUMANISN and is antithetical the very essence of the gospel. Read I Tim. 1:15. (Google search: schuller minister).This book is full of disturbing thoughts: We should seek angels as our protectors and intercessors (207). Try nature worship! \\"Nature is nourishment for our souls\\" (197). We must turn over a new leaf (self-reformation); \\"this is a new day\\" (195). Imagination is the key to the door of the future (62). You can have whatever you say if you believe in your heart and doubt not. Your imagination [not faith] creates your reality (59). You can lift up YOURSELF into the realm where all things are possible (245, don't give God the glory). We are Christians if we remain positive (173). Faith is though our own efforts of \\"persistence and determination\\" (79). God loves everyone, that's why He made so many unbelievers. Therefore everyone is basically good in God's eyes. You must bring out that love of God [whoever is your God] and the goodness within yourself to realize your salvation, because God is love, and love never fails (229). There is NO mention of Jesus as personal Savior, only the universal force \\"Master Map Maker\\" (241, so no faiths will be offended). Every member [every life form, including trees and birds] of God's creation is linked by a common thread; watch nature for the answers (233, shades of PANTHEISM). \\"We [all] are sons and daughters of the magnificent King\\" (173, NO Biblical salvation needed !!!)."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"A powerful book that will send God-bumps down your spine!

Believe it not, this book used to be required reading in many High Schools across America.I found this book on the Washington Monument (Mall) grounds July 4th in the early 70's after the police broke up a very large demonstration (i.e. very large dope smoking party) against the war in Viet Nam. The place was littered with many items left after a &quot;hippy vs police&quot; riot broke out (the hippies actually stated fighting among themselves, I remember hundreds of coke bottles flying through the air); the police intervened by deploying tear gas and tactics...battling the demonstrators up Pennsylvania Avenue. It was an exciting day, but it also proved to be a day which my eyes were truly opened to the power of Lord... after I started to read the worn copy I had found in the mud. I couldn't put it down. This book opened the eyes of my understanding in so many ways, and started my path towards the recovery from the battlefields of southeast asia, from the struggle to survive in the brutal climate of war. From the conflicts of doing my job as a warrior, and seeing the death and destruction of lives all around me -- I was a shell of what I should have been at 25, a survivor a fighter, enduring the ravages of the human race and coming out physically capable but mentally tormented.

I can never forget that, I can only praise God for the redemption and revelation."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"If you are looking for a profound theological treatise you may want to pass on this. If you want an inspiring real life story, dig in.This is a simple true story of a country preacher who obeyed God and went way outside his comfort zone to rescue drug addicts and gang members in the streets of New York.He dared to believe that the same power that launched the early Christian church could penetrate the shells of hardened substance abusers. As the story chronicles, God still is in the business of rescuing the flotsam and jetsam of modern society.His faith in stepping out launched a movement that is still with us today, Teen Challenge. This movement has seen an unparalled recovery rate amongst addicts. It is still based on the premise that faith in a living God can transform anyone's life.Relatively recently I spoke with a friend of mine from 1974 who was a male prostitute junkie and a mess when I first met him at Teen Challenge. He is still clean. Another friend from the same era who was an acid head (abuser of LSD) today pastors a church."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I had been interested in reading this nonfiction work since I became a part of a Teen Challenge Development Committee in our small community. Drug abuse is running rampant here, and starting our own drug recovery center seemed to be the obvious attempt at a solution. In this memoir, Pastor David Wilkerson takes his belief in the power of Christ's love from a gentle congregation in Pennsylvania to the most dangerous streets and gangs of New York. He shares accounts of both miracles and disappointments, as he develops what would become Teen Challenge International with centers around the world. Ironically, the same week that we had our first major fundraiser, a community gospel singing, Pastor Wilkerson died in an auto accident. His wife died not long thereafter of complications from cancer. I pray that we might share in the same kinds of victories as the Wilkersons did. I would encourage all people to read this book.

When I was reading about Reverend Wilkerson's journey to New York to try to meet these boys, I realized how much faith he would have to have to believe with all his heart that God was calling him to do this and that he would be safe in the gang part of New York. He had no ties to these boys what so ever except for the fact that he knew he needed to be there and try to turn their eyes to the Lord so they could understand what this \\"Christianity thing\\" was all about. When I began reading this book I started out hating these boys for what they did to that innocent boy in the park, but as Reverend Wilkerson continued his story, I started thinking about how awful their lives had to have been to even begin to think that this behavior was in any way acceptable. I started to wish I could have been there to see first hand how he helped boys just like the ones he read about in the news article. I started looking for ways I could be a witness to others and try to turn them to Christ. How can someone hear a story like this one and not believe? How can they see a man who was terrified to leave his small country community to bring God into the lives of teenage New York gangsters, despite any hesitation he felt at first. When Rev. Wilkerson started to get to know these kids and opened the shelter for them to come and try to get over their drug addictions, I was amazed that anyone could have so much love and faith in something so big! This book opened my eyes to things I knew were going on around me, but never really though about.

I was disappointed when I read it after giving it to my teenage son to read because of the graphic and disturbing descriptions of NY gang members' perverted sexual activities. I found it interesting that the authors chose to blank out certain unacceptable words when used in dialogue among African American gang members (n-----) but they obviously did not use the same discretion with sexual imagery. Some might argue that sinful sexual acts are mentioned in Scripture; however, God did not give graphic descriptions but simple commands not to participate in those acts.Also, this book is from a Pentecostal perspective, emphasizing the \\"baptism of the Holy Spirit\\" as an act separate from salvation and the necessary means for helping the gang members overcome their addictions.

I don't know if You want me. If You do want me, you can have me...\\" This was what one of the toughest, meanest, and hardest gang leaders in New York said one night at an alter call at one of David Wilkerson's youth rallies. Nicky later became a preacher.This book was not only a good read, but a good experience. It takes you from David Wilkerson's small town to the slums of New York City, where there are kids with many problems. Some are homeless, some have homes but would rather stay out in the streets, and some are drug addicts, just to name a few of their problems.David Wilkerson was drawn to New York City from seeing a picture in LIFE magazine of kids who were on trial for murder. He wanted to try to help these kids, but wasn't allowed to speak to them, and was thrown out of their court when he tried to speak to the judge. This actually influenced how he was accepted on the streets by the gangs, because he was fighting the law too, like them, or so they thought.David started off just meeting kids from different gangs, and soon was known all around New York City by these kids and their parents. He called it \\"street evangelism\\" and that's exactly what it was like. He was getting new \\"disciples\\" every day, and changing lives. He was changing kids from drug addicts, to preachers. Some of the gang members who \\"got religion\\" were beaten up, because they didn't fight back because of their faith. This is how it was for many of these new converts.After four years of driving to New York City on his days off, David and his family moved to New York, so he could work with the kids every day. He had many supporters around the city to help him financially and spiritually. Some were preachers, and some were just regular people who sent in money as a tithe, or just felt the need to send money. After about a year David started on his idea of a center for the kids who were homeless, or had a drug addiction, or other problems. This could be where they could stay for help, or just a place to feel loved. They could learn about GOD and go to church in their chapel in the center. The center was run by volunteers mostly, but some were paid ten dollars a week. They had nurses, preachers and street preachers working there, helping these kids recover from the harsh city of New York.All in all this was a really good book...very eye opening. I'd recommend it for ages 15 and older."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"More than 35 years have passed since I read The Cross and the Switchblade, but it remains active and alive in my memory.

I personaly knew the Man that wrote it.You will love it to."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I read this book because a homeless women whom I've grown to really like a great deal, has a real burning love for homeless teens. She made me promise I would read it. It is a very easy read and wonderful story of how the Lord steps in to help those who walk by faith in taking on what appears impossible to others. It is also a very strong testimonial to how one person can make a tremendous difference in the world.My most important take away from this book isn't &#34;to trust God&#34;, that is a given, but to not give up on teens. So many people have good intentions in working with teens, the homeless and other disadvantaged group. Like the seed thrown on poor soil they start with a flurry and wither in the competition from other things in their life. I have worked with many disadvantaged and the worst thing you can do is show your face and then pull back on your commitment.The Cross and the Switchblade really brings to light the importance of not giving up on this group. As I write this during the Christmas season where good meaning people bubble over with generosity, I'm deeply saddened because the people whom get the attention during this season are forgetten the other 11 months of the year.I would recommend this book to any one he believes a social situation is hopeless and they can't make any difference."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I wasn't sure about this book at first, however from the first moment , I kept wanting to read more and more.It was difficult to put down.I really enjoyed it, A story of what change faith and the Holy Spirit can have in people's lives."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"Great inspiring read of a man who had God's love for souls that are often forgotten in our society.

All I could find were used copies so I ordered one and read it again. It may not be considered great literature, but I love for the true story it tells.God led David Wilkerson when he was a young paster in a small Pennsylvania town to go to New York City to serve Him there.He started preaching on the city streets and led Nicky Cruise and some of his fellow youth gang members to the Lord.Now Nicky is an evangalist himself.

David Wilkerson was willing to say yes to loving others and it changed the lives of so many people, giving them hope where nobody else wanted to give it. I really enjoyed reading about his wife in this book as well. The book mostly focuses on David Wilkerson and the ministry he helps to start but he had a pretty strong woman standing as backbone for the family. I appreciated reading about the wisdom and strength she displayed through the hard times and the long term vision. David Wilkerson and his wife are an inspiration and everyone should take the time to read about these two willing and sacrificial people."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"This book made me weep with the \\" awe \\" of God , I was so moved , no wonder they made a movie out of the story .

I had the privilege of working in Catacomb Chapel in Greenwich Village, and witnessing to a Jewish young man named Stanley, who not long after, received Jesus as his Savior, Lord, and Christ.These events are recorded in the book \\"WHO IS GOD, AND WHAT HAS HE EVER DONE FOR US?\\" Written by me: David L.

They have made such a u-turn in their lives. Because of the transformation I heard about, I was curious about the program and picked up this book.And it's amazing! The story unfolds just as it happened in real life so suspense builds as you wonder how this skinny, conservative preacher was going to connect with the violent boys he meets up with. I could barely put it down, but you might want to read it slowly and savor the miracles.I gave this to our local Young Life pastor. I think he will be inspired by this story.Please read it for yourself. This book would make Jesus smile!"},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"Great book and in excellent condition!

Gave me a great deal of hope."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"What is reported in the book may be true but the author has definately taken poetic licence in the telling of the events. Is Wilkerson such a meglomeanic that he sees this book as an appendage to the Acts of the Apostles? Maybe so. The pictures that are contained in the book come from the movie which starred Pat Boone.Several references are made to the devil. As a matter of fact, the devil is mentioned as mush as God in this book.I have also heard Wilkerson preach. He should enroll himself at some divinity school and learn the concepts of Christianity"},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I went to a Catholic High School so I could stop being beaten in school every day. In sophmore year this was on the summer reading list. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence. And I really had no respect for Father Lauri when the class started in september.

If you like this one, you may want to check out Dianetics as well, its just as inane."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"The book is not a good copy...it may be because it is old, but the pages are tearing out as I read them"},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"Book was soiled , written in and smelled bad. Very poor condition. Took longer to arrive, as well. Not at all as advertised."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"The story of how David Wilkerson came to found Teen Challenge should be a must read for anyone who follows Jesus Christ. The Cross and the Switchblade describes how Wilkerson put feet on his faith that took him from rural Pennsylvania to the streets of New York City. It's the story of how a pastor followed the leading of the Holy Spirit and reached out to minister to people with whom the churches would not associate.Wilkerson describes in his book how essential it is to meet the unloved where they are, rather than waiting for them to show up in church all dressed up and ready to worship within the ranks of the clean and respectable. He also rightly emphasizes the importance of follow up, how one can't just expect to go out and distribute tracts or preach from street corners without also developing real, loving relationships with people and ministering to their needs, both spiritually and physically.Now that Teen Challenge International has grown to over 200 centers around the world, it is interesting to note that the struggle in recovery ministry continues to be much the same: It's extremely difficult to get people to reach out in love to those who have never been loved, and it's nearly impossible to get church members to venture outside their doors to love their neighbors as they love themselves.I praise God for Rev. Wilkerson and the way that he listened to God and ventured out in faith. I thank him for sharing the story of his work."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"It's hard to believe that a book written about events that took place almost forty years ago could just as easily have been written today. David Wilkerson followed God's call to work with &quot;lost&quot; children, and the work continues today. Miracles do still occur, and Wilkerson has witnessed them. His story about the inner city gangs of New York is gripping, but the fact that his &quot;Teen Challenge&quot; centers may be found all over the world is just as gripping. An incredible story."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"Through the OBEDIENCE of David Wilkerson to God's call on his life, our son is getting the help, deliverance and freedom through the ministry of Teen Challenge. If you know of anyone who is between the ages of 18 and 80, and is addicted to life controlling substances, this book is a MUST READ...as it will lead you to a place where your loved one can find healing. The pages of this true life story and experiences will transform your perspective and understanding of what changes Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit can do!"},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"If you want to know what Pentacostal means in real life, this true story will give you a hands on answer.This testimony of David Wilkerson shows clearer, than I have ever read, that only by the power of the Holy Spirit the fetter of drug addiction and the hopelesness of gang life can be broken and turned around 180 degrees to brimming joy, hope and true life in peace.This gripping story takes you to the heart and the utter and fearsome loneliness of gang members in 1958 New York City. It shows how the mercy of God wipes the sin and fear away and how HIS grace gives new hope and a purposeful, meaningful life. The book also tells us the birth of the now world wide ministry of Teen Challenge.I think the situation of downtown New York City in 1958 still exists today and it exists in thousands of large and small towns across the USA and the world. It is one of big everyday challenges to the church today. Jesus has promised us, that the poor will always be with us. The question is - what do we do with them?I want to call this book a must read for every youth pastor and persons involved in youth ministry."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"This book is as relevant today as it was almost 50 years ago. I read it first as a teenager in the 60's, then as a Jr. High teacher I read it to my class, and I'm reading it again now. My Dad became a Christian after reading this book. My husband read it on guard duty in Vietnam, and became a Christian a short time later. It is a powerful book about a vibrant ministry, Teen Challenge, that is still reaching drug addicts today. Don't read this book unless you are ready for the Holy Spirit to \\"Grab\\" you!"},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"This book brought tears to my eyes at God's love and mercy, and made me want to dance for joy at His provision and greatness. David Wilkerson started out as a preacher in a country church -- where he is a good Christian, and doing God's work. But one day, he feels as if God is leading him to New York to minister to a few thugs who have killed a boy. He follows the still small voice of the Holy Spirit and goes, and what follows is an amazing ride. God comes through again and again -- often at the 11th hour, when all seems lost. Isn't that just like God?I highly recommend this book because it is a great testimony to what untold miracles can happen in the lives of Christians when we step out of our comfort zones and go out on a limb for God. And the way He comes through will take your breath away. If I wasn't a Christian, I would think the story was pure fiction because it sounds too amazing to be true. But because I am one, and I have caught glimpses of what God can do for His children, I can say of the miracle upon miracle in Cross and the Switchblade: &quot;Yes, God is totally capable of that!''To my mind, most of us don't enjoy this exhilerating journey with God because we don't trust Him enough to take risks for Him. David Wilkerson did, and God displayed all his wonders. Read this and be challenged. I certainly was."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"The book The Cross and the Switchblade, which took place in 1958, was an excellant book. It was an really inspirational story. It can open people's eyes and let them know that things in this world are worse than we think. It made me more considerate.This book is about a reverend named David Wilkerson who went to New York to get seven teenagers off a murder trial. He spontaneously went because he saw their faces in LIFE Magazine and felt the need to help them. It helped people know of a Christ through reverend Wilkerson.This story opended up a lot of people's eyes. The reverend's for one, because he didn't know theat these problems existed in New York. It also affected the people that he came in contact with and the people who read his book because he was and still is an inspiration to all of them. Me personaly because it helped me become more courteous and aware of people with those kinds of problems."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"David Wilkerson listened to the voice of God and obeyed. When he did, the Lord grew a holy unction into an international ministry which has now touched millions of lives around the world. From Teen Challenge Centers around the world to Times Square Church, now representing a congregation from 135 countries, to European Crusdaes and worldwide missions, this ministry is centered on Jesus Christ.It is the unique focus on the personality and power of the Holy Spirit which separates this work from so many others.The call to action was spoken into his life, and into the lives of a New York City street gang, headed by Nicky Cruz, in the late sixties. The Cross and the Switchblade is a modern day classic of God's power and grace infusing the most dangerous and difficult layer of society; the violent gangs.The message is life changing, then and now."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"A truly inspirational story about the power of the Holy Spirit and the messenger it found in the person of an intrepid preacher from rural Pennsylvania. David Wilkerson, author and protagonist in this personal account, feels grabbed by a drawing in Life magazine of five teenage boys charged with the brutal murder of a disabled youth. His interest in the lot of the nefarious boys, who are part of NYC's notorious sub-culture of street gangs, is ignited. He senses a calling from God to help them. The early pages chronicle his unsuccessful attempts to contact them, which ironically are felled at the final hurdle by a fellow clergyman who (without a hint of verismilitude that belows his position) claims that Wilkerson in fact poses a threat to the boys' well-being. Wilkerson's account of his inspiration to help has nothing of the pharisee about it.Through his unsuccessful attempts, Wilkerson was introduced to the turbulent underworld of NYC's youth gangs, to their lives of misery, despair, squalor and sense of hopelessness, and to the solace they found in gangs and that life of serious crime, violence, hard drugs and sexual promiscuity. Wilkerson would leave his tidy life in his rural parish and commit his his time to helping the gang members by introducing Christ to their lives. Teen Challenge was born, and the book describes its growth from loftily conceived idea to reality and the incredible efforts of its team of workers who, defenceless except for the carapace of their religition, would bring hope and divine redemption to literally hundreds of the city's most incorrigible youth. The charity is now a major orgnization working throughout the world.The story ties particularly well with the best-selling book by Nicky Cruz, whose story parallels Wilkerson's own. Cruz, the renouned former leader of the notorious 'maw maws' gang, experiences a metamorphosis through the help of Teen Challenge, commits his life to the Lord, and evenutally becomes a preacher himself working with Wilkerson's team. There could be no greater volte face.The book's theme of the enormous force of the Holy Spirit as an insrument for positive change might turn off those readers who have not been touched by its power. However, the story has a magnetism that will draw you in, page after page, giving comfort and hope that - with a little help from above - good can be extracted from the very nadir of our humanity. This significant message makes compelling reading for all. DO read it and your life will be touched."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I first read this book as a teenager 30 years ago. Its impact has never left me.

I recently read it to the Sunday School class I help lead, they are 7th - 12th graders. David Wilkinsons obedience to the Lords leading produced a huge ministry that is still helping people to this day.

This novel has changed and impacted the lives of many teenagers.I encourage every adult and teenageer to read these books. Run Baby Run by Nicky Cruz, The Cross and the Switchblade by David Wilkerson, and Coming Clean. I am also trying to find another book \\"PURER THAN THE DIAMOND\\" by J.C De Ferrieres, publshed in the late 60s. I will be going on a mission trip next year, so I will be purchasing those books to distribute among the youth. I have read so many books when I was growing up as a young Catholic Christian, but these are the first novels I would recommend for our teenagers.These novels shoud be advertised in and out of season; be in every bookstore in the USA, Caribbean, Europe and the whole world, at every Youth Rally, every Crusade, convention, bookstores in churches.

Both my wife and I read this text on the Kindle and we both attempted to report each typo through the reporting feature on the Kindle for Mac, but there were so many that we just eventually gave up somewhere around half way through and tried to ignore them. The main reason for the the one star is that I paid money for this book for the convenience of having it on my Kindle and was annoyed with a text riddled with errors. I am dyslexic and know ahead of time that I must have everything I write to be carefully proof read, and I am positive that after this book was transcribed to the Kindle, no one at the publisher cared to read it over again because the errors are very obvious. Amazon, as I said has a reporting feature for errors if you catch them, and perhaps in the last three weeks since I read the book someone has got around to fixing them. However, I was disappointed in the lack of quality control from the publisher on this text, they can do better.Secondly, I would rate this book's content as five stars. The reason is that as young ministers in the Assembly of God, my wife and I identified with the testimony of David and Gwen as they walked by faith in the purposes and plans God had for them. It was encouraging for us and, gave us hope to keeping moving forward during our current time of transition. As for the clarity and simplicity of the text's writing, I am guessing that David Wilkerson's co-authors should be commended for this, because it was a very easy read for me who struggles with reading and am glad to read something other than seminary textbooks which make me wonder if I ever really knew the English language to begin with (those who have been there know what I am talking about). Altogether this is a personal rating based on our situation in life and to highlight the easily avoidable quality problems on the Kindle edition.*EDIT* Taking a look at the Kindle page for this text after publishing this review I noticed that Amazon as pulled this text from their digital shelves to review for errors, etc., and to try to correct the problems with the publisher. So, good for you Amazon staff. For all those that posted corrections through their Kindles, apparently Amazon takes them seriously, and if it is fixed at a later date I will fix my star rating."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"This book is based on a true story.

The story tells of God's power in the life of a country preacher who lived a life sheltered from much of the world, and enters the streets of New York City with a message of God's love to gangs, drug addicts, and prostitutes.I recently went on a mission trip to South Padre Island, TX on spring break. To those who don't know, South Padre is among the worst places to be on spring break--lots of partying, stripping, sex, bing drinking. I can truely relate to what Rev. Wilerson saw in the gangsters of New York--lost and dying souls. Having been sheltered myself, I was taken with a great fear of what I would see on the island, but just as my team arrived, the fear was gone, and I was gripped with the power of the Holy Ghost. This is the same Holy Ghost that empowered David Wilkerson in New York City when he brough the Cross in contact with the switchblade."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I first was given this book to read over thirty years ago as a very young Christian. I could hardly put it down. I was so struck by the very personal relationship David Wilkerson had with God and how God led and guided him so intimatley. It caused me to seek God's direciton in my own persoanl life and I can honestly say, changed the whole depth of my relationship with God.I work with teens who are incarecerated and I recently had one of them tell me that becasue of reading this book, he now believes there is a God. He was struck at how God led this man so personally. The kids love the book.

Even though I am sceptical about &quot;spiritual&quot; things, especially regarding organized religion, the book was interesting above and beyond that angle of it. It was just interesting and heartening to read about anyone who was SO passionate about what he wanted to do. It is just fascinating to read about someone wanting to help others so much. It might make you take a second look at your career and wonder why you aren't doing something to which you can feel so committed. No one should avoid this book because it so &quot;christian-oriented.&quot; It is an interesting story about an incredible man in any context."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I believe the book has a valuable moral which is: Even the roughest and toughest of gangs has a soft side, that can be shown.

I have no way way of paying for them online and as a single mother I sometimes have a hard time coming up with the money anyway."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I can't believe they gave us this book at my christian school in the second grade. The Rev. had been in town and gave out hundreds of copies to area schools. The first couple of chapters taught me about gangs, intravenous drug use, crime, violence, and unhealthy sex. This is the book that showed me what street life was all about-much more useful than fare like \\"The Basketball Diaries\\". So, at the age of seven, I had a window to the gritty world out there beyond the cotton fields of Mississippi. I learned that heroin was definitely not something to try, gangs would get you in trouble, and loose sex would have bad consequences. In other words, very titillating and forbidding at the same time. Since the movie Grease came out at the time I got this(77 or so), there were two visions of teen leatherboy rebellion out there-one as good, the other as bad. Mrs. Neill shouldn't have given us little kids this book, considering we were so young, but I got some good lessons, since I might have turned out even wilder than I did."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"I was sort of puzzled when the book ended, because the story seemed to just drop off. It wasn't until I read the Epilogue that I realized what David Wilkerson was saying. The story if far from over. This account of a man trying to help New York's street teens is one small part of a bigger story. And that is mankind's struggle for love and acceptance. Don't be put off if you hate \\"religious\\" stories,for the book goes well beyond it. Yes, it is the story of a pastor, but the Christian themes do not take away from what is an excellent story. I say, read it. It doesn't take long, and the benefit is well worth it!

It helps us to realize that God wants us to step outside our comfort zone and to trust Him, to keep our faith in Him. He has a better plan and it will all work out in His timing. There is a reason for things. He did a great job of showing the human being behind the gang member including reasons why many join. This book was written in a story format that chronicled his life from small country preacher to working with gang members. I would recommend it, though to mature individuals as it includes reference about sex, drugs, etc. It was done very well and is needed to show the context of the gang member's life."},{"Title":"The cross and the switchblade","review":"Friend of mine said that he actually got saved by reading this book.

As long as He remains in charge, the program will thrive. The minute we try to do things by our own power we will fail.\\"I first read this book 20 or more years ago, as a teenager. Now on rereading it I found where some of my thoughts on how God works in this world originated. This review is far drier than the book and is a result of thinking and looking for why I like the book. I have been told I think too much, but the book is fun, it is thrilling to read and see how God worked in the life of David Wilkerson. The ideas found in fad driven books like The Purpose Driven Life, The Prayer of Jabez, even Made to Count are seeds presented in this book. David Wilkerson lived those ideas, guided by the Holy Spirit, and he shares them with us in this book.Wilkerson lives a life led by the Spirit of God and this book shows us how he did it, each story bigger and better than the next. Wilkerson shares many principles given to him by his Circuit Rider Grandfather. Thoughts on how and why God works in the events surrounding David Wilkerson's life are prevalent throughout the book. On p 39, \\"The day you learn to be publically specific in your prayers, that is the day you will discover power\\" is shared relating how his father at death's door, was cured of a stomach ulcer. He talks of prayer: when and how he does it, when he prays, how long he spends doing it, what he asks for, and how they are answered are found throughout the book. On p 11 he shares the place of TV in his life. On p 138-141 he relates a lesson on prayer that for all who read it will learn something for he writes \\"Lord . . . teach us a lesson in faith that will live with us forever.\\"On p 42 Wilkerson tells us that his grandfather, a Circuit Rider Preacher, said over and over again in his sermons \\"The heart of the Gospel is change. It is transformation. It is being born again to a new life. . . But that's the theory. The heart of Christ's message is extremely simple: an encounter with God--a real one--means change.\\" Many people are changed in this book and Wilkerson tells us about who was changed, what was changed and how they were changed.I have experienced it, but until I read it in print I never thought much of it. I recognize God has been at work or even is working when as Wilkerson relates it on p 26 \\"I felt the little shiver I always experience in the presence of God's perfect planning.\\" Wow, other people react to God's working out his plan in this same way!Wilkerson's take on tears: \\"Bit by bit I came to the horror these young people have of tears. What is it about tears that should be so terrifying? I asked them again and again, and each time got the impression that tears to them were a sign of softness, of realize weakness and childishness in a harsh world where only the tough survive. Yet I knew from my work in the church how important a role tears play in making a man whole. I think I could almost put it down as a rule that the touch of God is marked by tears. When finally we let the Holy Spirit into our innermost sanctuary, the reaction is to cry. I have seen it happen again and again. Deep soul-shaking tears, weeping rather than crying. It comes when that last barrier is down and you surrender yourself to health and to wholeness.\\" p 66-67On p 133 Wilkerson writes \`\\"I've finally got it figured out, Reverend Wilkerson,\\" said the girl, \\"Christ's love is a love with no strings attached.\\" Elaine is right. Chris's love is a love without angles: a love that asks nothing in return. It is a love that only wants the best for these boys and girls. And this is the quality that redeems.' And later he writes of the Holy Spirit on p 161: \\"The Holy Spirit is what you need. And when you receive him, you will also receive ten special gifts which you can depend on. . .\\" (read the book for these)An idea that Wilkerson came to fall upon time and time again is this: \\"It was becoming increasingly clear to us that the hand of the Lord was in our work. As long as we really let him lead, miracles all along the path were going to be ours to enjoy.\\" p 103That is why the book is exciting to read: Because he really let God lead, miracles all along the path became ours to enjoy. Praises to God Almighty!The Epilogue states the truth about this book and Teen Challenge Centers worldwide (yes, they have gone to Europe and elsewhere, check out http://www.teenchallengeusa.com/about.php) p 173 \\"The Holy Spirit is in charge.

The genial bear-like Inspector Fox was always in support. Ngaio was a single child brought up in Christchurch New Zealand by parents who loved books and the theatre. Ngaio (pronounced \\"Nye-oh\\") shared their passion for the arts and went to London where she was an interior decorator, a painter and by 1934, a published author of detective stories. For much of the rest of her life she spent several months a year in Great Britain, and the remainder in Christchurch. She directed very successfully a variety of Shakespearean plays for the University Dramatic Society and toured some of them around New Zealand and to Australia. She was a vibrant and outspoken force for the awakening of the arts in her homeland. She was witty and classy and wonderfully well-read and her novels are laced with humour and blood-thirstily conceived murders. She became famous the world over and was made a Dame in 1966.She never married or had children but had a wide-ranging circle of good and loyal and loving friends. Her house in Christchurch is still open to the public. A great talent. Margaret Lewis has done a fine research job and writes well, clearly with affection for her subject, but we'll never know whether Ngaio died or virgin or not from this polite history."},{"Title":"Typhoon & Other Stories","review":"Typhoon and Other Short Stories -By Joseph Conrad *****\\"She seemed, indeed, to have been used as a running target for the secondary batteries of a cruiser. A hail of minor shells could not have given her upper works a more broken, torn, and devastated aspect; and she had about her the worn, weary air of ships coming from the far ends of the world - and indeed with truth, for in her short passage she had been very far; sighting, truly, even the coast of the Great Beyond, whence no ship ever returns to give up her crew to the dust of the earth.\\" TyphoonConrad is a master of observation. His novels and short stories aren't great narratives and dramas so much as they are depictions of the mind and the human spirit. In Typhoon, to be sure, nothing really happens: a coastal ship with a bizarre captain encounters some \\"dirty weather knocking about\\" and barely survives. Except for the ending, it's \\"The Perfect Storm\\" without the A-List cast.The relationship between Mr. Jukes, the first officer, and Captain McWhirr, the distant and preoccupied ship's master, is the story, such as it is. The Captain is infuriatingly obtuse, choosing to trust his own judgment rather than the experience of others:\\"Captain McWhirr, took a run and brought himself up by an awning stanchion.\\"A Profane man,\\" he said, obstinately. \\"If this goes on, I'll have to get rid of him first chance.\\" \\"It's the heat,' said Jukes. \\"The weather's awful. It would make a saint swear. Even up here I feel exactly as if I had my head tied up in a woolen blanket.\\" Captain McWhirr looked up. \\"D'ye mean to say, Mr. Jukes, that you ever had your head tied up in a blanket? What was that for?\\" It's a manner of speaking, sir.\\" Said Jukes,Stolidly.I cite another paragraph of Conrad's simply for the beauty of his language (which, after all, he didn't learn until he was 20 years old):\\"The Nan-Shan was plowing a vanishing furrow upon the circle of the sea thathad the surface and the shimmer of an undulating piece of gray silk. The sun, paleand without rays, poured down leaden heat in a strangely indecisive light, and the Chinamen were lying prostrate about the decks. Their bloodless, pinched, yellowfaces were like the faces of bilious invalids.... The smoke struggled with difficulty out of the funnel, and instead of streamingaway spread itself out like an infernal sort of cloud, smelling of sulphur and raining soot all over the decks.\\"Another reviewer has taken other critics to task for panning Conrad's work. I won't bother: it's enough for me to know that Conrad is ranked among the greatest of writers of English. From his novels (Nostromo, Lord Jim) to short works (Heart of Darkness; The Secret Sharer) he is a universally acknowledged master. -Philip HenryFIVE STARS *****"},{"Title":"Typhoon & Other Stories","review":"The stories in this book are sea tales in Conrad's tradition of pessimistic, psychological fiction. Typhoon is particularly good, but the other stories are interesting as well. If it seems like Conrad is just writing adventure stories, well, that's just not true. He's writing about the most important themes, and setting them against a backdrop of exciting seafaring and travel.If a reader finished Heart of Darkness, and enjoyed it, then that reader might want to pick this book up next, and give it a whirl."},{"Title":"Typhoon & Other Stories","review":"This Penguin edition assembles 4 stories that were first published together in 1904, and written in nearly the same sequence. 3 were first published in magazines, 1 not. The reasons why 'Falk' was not able to find a magazine publisher are attributed either to its inconvenient length, or to the upsetting subject of canibalism.The stories share several themes: the sea is there, even when the action is on land, and so are ships and the people who spend parts of their lives on them. Alienation is in all, being a stranger, being expatriate, as is the reverse of the medal, xenophobia, condescension, racism.One common theme is 'imagination', twice for the alleged lack of it, twice for the obvious overabundance of it.Best of the crop is Typhoon, which I have reviewed separately and longer. A funny adventure story, as I see it.The other long story is Falk, which is actually 2 for the price of one. The main story, the frame, is a farce about expatriates in Bangkok; inside the main story, the title hero tells the narrator his adventure on a Danish steamer that went adrift in the Southern ocean, leading to the horrifying experience that some readers found disgusting.2 shorter stories are set in Kentish villages near the sea, and both deal with strangers. Amy Foster is the far better one of the two stories, dealing with a shipwrecked man from Eastern Europe who gets stranded and is treated like an animal until he slowly manages to establish a rudimentary foothold in a hostile environment. The title hero is a domestic helper who is the first to show pity for the 'madman' and even falls in love. Tragically, she is not fully able to discard the prejudices of her countrymen. (Is there an autobiographical component here? John Stape, the Conrad biographer who wrote the introduction, thinks not. I guess he is right.)The last story (To-Morrow) is maybe the least remarkable piece of writing from Conrad that I know, and quite forgettable."},{"Title":"Typhoon & Other Stories","review":"Conrad is a genius. His works are among the great works of world literature and these stories are among Conrad's best.I read the paperback Modern Library edition of Typhoon and Other Stories. This is a good edition. It is very nicely produced and printed. The introduction by Barry Unsworth is useful and this edition also includes an author's note and short bio of Conrad. The notes by Nels Pearson are a bit odd and some are distracting. He makes questionable literary comments and defines some obvious terms but leaves many others undefined.

Emerson trains his mesmerizing prose and piercing insight on England and the English from nearly every angle - not his most interesting or original subject but nonetheless intriguing. This is highly recommended for anyone interested in the subject, and Emersonians should come here after the more famous works.Emerson's thoroughness is impressive; his examination is so detailed that it is near-ethnographic. However, the book begins on a personal note, detailing his first trip to England just after he resigned his pulpit when he was unknown, had published nothing, and was unsure what to do. He recounts eminently absorbing visits with luminaries like Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Carlyle that anyone interested in them or the era will relish. These first-hand accounts have significant historical value, letting us see a side of these major figures that is rarely mentioned - not least because Emerson is as honest as ever and does not spare them. This section is so worthy that its brevity is regrettable; Emerson declines to describe visits to landmarks or his initial impressions of England and the English, perhaps because he had changed so much.Next comes a fairly detailed history and description of the English \\"race\\" that is notable mainly for historical context. Much of it has been disproved or highly questioned, and it is far from politically correct by today's standards, but this makes it all the more interesting. Anyone wondering how a representative mid-nineteenth century Anglo-American saw the land of his ancestors need look no further.Some may find this trying, but I encourage them to persevere, because the bulk of the book is far more interesting; Emerson examines his subject much as he had done with abstract ones like self-reliance, experience, and love. He begins with a basic rundown of England itself: historical, geographical, economic, etc. Emerson also looks at English institutions like the church, colleges, etc.; his most interesting observations here are about the class system, particularly the upper class, and the political system. He describes them on their own terms and in contrast to other countries, including of course America. This has merit, but several seemingly obligatory topics are unfortunately missing. Emerson says almost nothing about royalty and, a fascinating Stonehenge section excepted, neglects to treat landmarks. He also mentions in passing meeting many notables - Dickens, Tennyson, Thackeray, etc. - out of which notable anecdotes could surely have been made. In any case, though, the real meat is his analysis of the English people, including topics like manners, character, speech, and habits. Emerson was a keen observer, and his foreign status gave a perspective the English could not have had, yielding many noteworthy insights.Perhaps surprisingly, given that Emerson was arguably the first truly American writer, vigorously urged cultural independence, and otherwise preached self-reliance and originality, he reveals himself to be a pretty thorough Anglophile. Maybe this should not surprise; he was after all a New Englander of English stock, and England was the world's most powerful nation. It is indeed generally hard to deny the basic truth of even his most rhapsodic compliments, but current readers - especially Americans - may grow frustrated and impatient with his constant glowing descriptions. He has also been recently taken to task for what some see as a sort of unintentional racism. However, those willing to continue will see that he eventually gives substantial criticism, particularly in regard to religion and literature; he also lambastes England's general conservatism, zeroing in on several specific abuses. All told, his honesty and willingness to criticize were quite remarkable and in many ways as instructive as ever.Such a book would generally be of little more than historical interest, but Emerson's ever-strong writing raises it; anyone alive to his style will find much to love. Perhaps more importantly, it now has considerable value for a reason probably no one could have foreseen - mid-nineteenth century England was in essentially the same position as present-day America. It was the world's most powerful nation, the military and economic superpower whose culture and language had global influence. Emerson was clearly in awe as few could help being but also deft in noticing that England was near its apex or had already passed it; great as it was, the future did not belong to it. He vividly describes how many centuries-old institutions were rapidly crumbling and prophetically notes that England would become more and more like America, to whom the future belonged. This came to pass, perhaps letting blue blood Americans annoyed by the Anglophile aspect breathe a proverbial sigh of relief - or even have a laugh at England's expanse. In truth, though, they should be more cautious, because the book has much to teach them. Many traits then dominant in England - arrogance, insularity, disregard for outside opinion - are now preeminent in America, and America may fall from the top just as England did if not careful. A close reading of this may go a long way toward preventing that, and Emersonians will want the book in any case. Like all geniuses, Emerson both epitomized and was ahead of his time; full of subtleties beneath an already appealing surface, this is an overlooked exemplar of that Emersonian paradox."},{"Title":"English traits,","review":"These days, celebrity authors earn thousands of dollars for a speech, but back in the 1880s, Ralph Waldo Emerson, the first American author known to receive payment for delivering a talk, was paid $5 and oats for his horse."},{"Title":"The 19th Indiana Infantry at Gettysburg: Hoosiers' Courage","review":"The book outlays every detail of the Indiana 19th's movement during the Gettysburg campaign all of the way down the graphic depictions of death scenes.

We've all been victims of bureaucracy at some point. Hopefully he is right in predicting this dysfunctional managerial system is coming to an end.In the next couple of chapters he hones in on two of his areas of expertise, leadership competencies and managing the dream. He continues on with his thoughts on various other matters. Overall it is interesting to see his perception on his own life and his thoughts on broader matters."},{"Title":"An Invented Life: Reflections on Leadership and Change","review":"Warren Bennis is a prolific writer on leadership, having penned Leaders and On Becoming a Leader amongst other books. In this books, he turns inward reflecting on the lessons involved in analyzing his own life. He willingly covers the negative experiences in his life, including an experience where he offered a partial resignation in protest of administrative policy.This is not a good first book on either the author, or leadership, but is very valuable for someone already familiar with Warren's work. It'll add context to his ideas, and show how he tried to apply them throughout his life. Certainly worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"50 Great Horror Stories","review":"While the copyright of this collection is 1971, which is almost 40 years ago, many of the stories within contain references and subject matter to much earlier times. Many of the stories contain \\"olde english\\" and talk of times as early back as 1500 or 1600. Mostly the stories do contain a common element in that they are for the most part actually scary.

It is not a recent book, but it is indeed a classic in the self-help shelf.Recommended."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"MacLean's HMS Ulysses is a classic book of man against man but more importantly, man against the sea. Set in the brutal Murmansk Run, this book is an account of the men of a ship marked out from the rest of the Royal Navy by a resistance to discipline. The crew is rebelling against mindless authority but is still ready to do its duty - along the lines of the great Mutiney of 1797, when ships of the Royal Navy effectively deposed brutal and mindless officers but always maintained that it would up anchor and fight any attackers. The men of Ulysses strike me as linear descendants of the sailors fighting Napoleon's fleet.There is a great cross section of British society in the officers and men of Ulysses; from aristocratic flag officers to gentleman rankers in the lower rates. Petty tyrants and officers one would gladly follow anywhere. MacLean has included them all and made it work to perfection in his tale.THe constant theme is not the brutality of war, or men killing each other, but the constant battle with the sea in all its many forms. MacLean's attention to detail gives an almost 'you are there' quality to his writing. The reader feels he is right there on the bow of Ulysses as it gets underway for one more run to Murmansk, to being on the bridge in her ultimate engagement with the German Navy. You can almost feel the bone breaking cold whenever you are placed out on deck. MacLean puts you right in the middle of it.If any of MacLean's books deserve to be made into movies, this is one that is long overdue.I found this book to be one that I didn't want to put down. I felt the charecters were all extremely well developed, men that were almost real. I don't know if MacLean was in the Royal Navy during World War II, but reading this book, I certainly get that impression. This is a classic in Naval literature."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"I didn't make the Murmansk run, but I have lost shipmates due to inclement weather and cold in the North Atlantic.I didn't make the Murmansk run, but I have had to abandon ship due to enemy action.I didn't make the Murmansk run, but I lost friends who did.I didn't make the Murmansk run, but the author of H.M.S.Ulysses (MacLean 1955) certainly did. And he writes with a sureness and skill that makes me realize again what I knew so well during World War II -- that I was blessed and favored by God in not having made that run.This is NOT a book for those who cherish the fairy tales of Aubrey. It is strong drink for those raised on the pallid tea of Bolitho and Ramage. It will stretch the sensibilities of followers of Hornblower or Fox. It will bring tears and anguish to those who like me recognize what men can go through, do go through, must go through.Of all the war stories I have read from The Iliad on this is unequivocally the best Three times I have read it and each time with more pain than joy. I have almost a feeling of duty as if in the reading I am paying tribute to the men who made that run and -- in a sense -- exulting in my having been spared from the same.There have been reviewers who have suggested that this would make a good movie. To them I say nonsense. There is not a producer with the guts to produce it nor an actor who could convincingly play most of the parts. And I doubt if there is an audience with the stomach to watch it.I didn't make the Murmansk run, but better men than I did -- and they died there."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"MacLean never wrote a better novel than this, his first.For those who love the sea and yet respect her fearsome savagry, HMS Ulysses satisfies. Brilliant character development, superb technical detail.HMS Ulysses is a good novel -- more than that, the book pays tribute to both the Royal Navy and the Merchant Marine, and homage in equal measure to all -- German, British, American. It reminds us that brave men sailed the North Atlantic, and that courage knows no boundaries.The book follows the fortunes of a fighting ship whose crew is slowly self-destructing after months of convoy duty in the North Atlantic. They are offered the prospect of a break in the Mediterranean if they can complete one final convoy to Russia through the murderous North Atlantic, and thereby atone for a mutiny that has left two people dead...Their voyage -- and ultimate atonement -- tests the mettle of all on board, and challenges the base assumptions we tend to make about the inherant goodness of Humanity. It will leave you pondering how you would have responded under similar circumstances, and perhaps may leave you less than satisfied with what you learn about yourself.As a tale it compares well with Noel Coward's wartime movie &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;. MacLean paints his tale with prosaic pictures that stay in your mind more persistently than any film could. The final image of the HMS Ulysses, with battle ensign flying, stays with you long after you put the book down.MacLean's book reminds us that things like this happened every day, once. It is a reminder of the gallantry of a generation that is fast disappearing."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"The HMS Ulysses was built for one mission - escorting convoys from Scotland to Murmansk, Russia. Though a novel, \\"Ulysses\\" stays to a very specific historical context - the RN's desperate missions to keep Russia supplied during WWII. In this novel, he follows the travails of the Ulysses as it sets forth on a convoy that has every hint of disaster. It's 1943, the tide of the war had turned against the Axis on every front but on the seas. Though devotees of either nautical fiction or WWII novels are actually the last to label WWII as \\"the good war\\", even they might be shocked to learn the desperate straits through which MacLean sails his titular ship. The \\"Murmansk Run\\" has convoys sailing through waters rife with terror both natural and man-made - horrors to which Ulysses has long become familiar with, yet never immune. Worn down by the arctic storms, by constant attacks from German subs, dive bombers and cruisers, by outbreaks of TB and under constant threat of the mighty Battleship Tirpitz, Ulysses is a ship coming apart at the seams. The only thing holding the crew and ship together is there respect for its young and ailing captain and the desperation of the allied war effort. Their superiors in Admiralty would gladly supply less outdated escorts with more experienced crews, or replace their undersized (and outgunned) escort jeep carriers with fleet aircraft carriers - if that were available (during a deceptively simple dialog early on, officers detail the desperation of their situation, which includes rusty old ships with ripe crews, and escort carriers which would never be confused with the main-fleet monsters). But disintegrate the ship does, under attack by u-boats, Hipper-class cruisers, Condor bombers and the ceaseless assault of the Arctic. McLean does a superlative job taking both crew and vaunted ship apart. While he doesn't glorify war, he doesn't stoop at taking cheap shots at those who lead the war-effort either. (Those familiar with the lore of the \\"Murmansk Run\\" may wonder if this book fictionalizes the tragedy known only as \\"PQ-17\\"; in fact, MacLean mentions that tragedy in an extended foot-note early on. It's an unusual device, but an effective one, since it allows MacLean to state unequivocally where he stands, and bravely make the case for RN planners who doubtlessly suffered the blame for PQ-17's casualties. Further, it frames the context of the \\"Murmansk Run\\" while implying that, though he's aware of the background behind the Russia-bound convoys, he won't be enslaved to write a bloodless fictionalized version of them. Instead, the footnote makes it plain that MacLean wants to write his own book, a promise that he fulfills). Neither does McLean stoop to gory effects. \\"Ulysses\\" neither glorifies war nor condemns it with cheap tactics. One reviewer took issue with the book's poor characterization, and that complaint is actually dead-on with respect to one of its characters. Though MacLean's treatment of an incompetent junior officer who blames others for his clumsiness is gratuitous (MacLean, rather than his characters, personally concludes the officer's active-duty status is the result of numerous mistakes, adding plenty of proof that the subject isn't even worth debate), it takes up a mercifully short amount of the book. Slim character development is acceptable because the author makes it clear that individuality was one of the sacrifices (like fresh food, and not having to worry about frostbite) that Ulysses' crew are forced to forego due to the war. Instead of nuances, the only sense of singularity that any crewman can have under those circumstances is whether he will bend or break with the arctic tide - a question that will keep you guessing to the end. Many authors will claim that they can put their readers on the decks of ships or in planes in war, but MacLean is not only one of few who suceeds but achieves the incredible feat of brining the tale to life - stingingly icy salt spray, U-Boats and all - but makes it a world you can't quite tear yourself away from."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"MacLean's first novel, this is easily his best. It is a little different than his usual adventure-thrillers. This is a serious book about the naval war of World War II. The North Atlantic convoy runs saw some of the highest casualties during the war and MacLean puts the reader squarely in the middle of that icy Nordic hell. What happens when men are pushed far too far makes for some of the most gripping reading around."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"If all you have read by Alistair MacLean is &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, you have missed a much better read in this book. HMS Ulysses is a fine action tale, with all the drama and tension of The Hunt For Red October. But there is so much more--the realistic descriptions of life on a warship in the North Atlantic, men who reflect on the nature of war, individual acts of heroism and tragedy. All these things raise it above the common lot of the war novel. You will be inspired by some of it, fascinated by some of it, and you may even have to stop---as I did---to put the book down for a moment to recover when the terrible savagery of War becomes too gut-wrenchingly alive. Strongly recommended; a fantastic book."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"My grandfather was a Master Mariner - qualified in both steam and sail - and he was also a captain on these Murmansk convoys on a merchant vessel. There was no armour plate for him or rapid-fire Oerlikon guns, just a few out-dated machines guns, and the selfish hope that it would happen to someone else. He could not outrun the bombers or the torpedo, a little zig-zagging was the most he could manage, and pray that his colleagues in the destroyers and other warships would look after them, and that his engineer would keep the steam pressure up.His enemies were the German Navy and AirForce, and the incessant Arctic weather. There was no hiding place, or port of respite, the supplies had to get through, the ammunition, oil, guns and tanks - the bricks and mortar of war. If the merchant ships sank, soldiers were left unable to fight or planes could not take off - these thoughts were always in the sailors' minds. It was always the sacrifice of the few for the good of the many.The crews of these warships were the forgotten heroes, toiling in the cold, damp, dark chambers of these warships, stoking the boilers, minding the pumps, carrying the ammunition; knowing that in the event of a leak, the hatches would be sealed above them, and the would drown or suffocate, whilst they were separated from torpedoes and gunshells by a thin layer of steel, instant death was a second away. The admirals and captains got the fame and credit, but it was paid for by the flesh and blood of the ratings and those marines who volunteered to serve aboard.This book just tells it like it was."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"Alastair Maclean's books tend to run along formulaic lines - the good guy good humouredly taking a fearful beating, the bad guy snarlingly getting his eventual comeuppance. Whether it's a Formula One race track, an island in the Barents Sea or a submarine beneath the polar ice cap, the pattern is unshakeable. Not bad, you understand, but familiar.This book, however, is completely different. Mr Maclean served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War and took part in several convoys similar to those described in this book. His experiences have coloured his writing and given this book an immediacy and a depth that the others lack. This book serves as a tribute to the men that lost their lives in the fearful Arctic Convoys of World War Two, a critical theatre of war that was largely forgotten."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"I recently made a couple of business trips to London. On the first I toured the H.M.S. Belfast, now part of the Imperial War Museum, moored in the Pool of London on the River Thames just inside the Tower Bridge. (See http://www.iwm.org.uk/belfast/belfast.htm for more detail.) It was a self-guided tour. With pamphlet in hand the curious tourist can poke through practically every passageway in the ship. Lifelike mannequins represent life on board one of Her Majesty's proudest vessels. Even the ship's cat is represented keeping guard over undesirable stowaways. The mighty turrets seem invincible. The crew's quarters seem cramped, but the atmosphere is adventurous and almost romantic. The ship seems large and powerful and puissant.In between trips, I picked up an old copy of H.M.S. Ulysses, by spellbinding mystery and adventure author Alistair Maclean. Through the eyes of the crew of the Ulysses I experienced real life aboard the Belfast. The Ulysses, though not exactly the same ship as the Belfast, nevertheless shared many commonalities with her. They were both used as escorts for the savage arctic convoys, brutally trying to bring supplies and arms to Russian ports desperate for help. They had similar armaments, crew, assignments, and even paint jobs. The Ulysses became the Belfast for me as I witnessed the awesome forces of nature and the brutal effects of prolonged exposure to frigid elements, sleep deprivation, death, sacrifice and just plain old fear.The ravaged and bone-weary seamen move ghostlike through day after numbing day. Branded mutineers and traitors by the brass, they're given one last opportunity for redemption. Escort one last ill-fated convoy from Scapa Flow, Britain's arctic sea base north and east to Murmansk. Harangued by reconnaissance planes, U-Boats, destroyers, stuka fighters, and even threatened by the invincible German warship Tirpitz, the Ulysses gallantly accompanies her convoy ever nearer its goal.My second trip brought me back to the Belfast. I didn't pay to go on the tour again. I didn't need to. In my mind I could envision every nook and cranny. From the Tower Bridge I gazed at the beautiful ship and remembered the Ulysses.Don't read this book unless you plan on leaving a part of yourself in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"If Alistair Maclean had written only this novel I am sure it would be ranked alongside The Red Badge of Courage, The Naked And The Dead and All Quiet on the Western Front as a classic novel of men at war. Unfortunately his subsequent thrillers, so lightweight by comparison, have meant a lot of people would pass it by. It is a powerful testament to the men who suffered and died on WW2 convoys. Brilliantly told, it evokes strong emotions as it brings you face to face with the cruelty of war, and the devotion to duty that drives men on in spite of hardship and terror."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"This is a gripping tale of survival on the high seas during World War II. The HMS Ulysses is a British light cruiser taking part in a large supply convoy making the dreaded Murmansk run from England to the Soviet Union. The ship's crew is already stressed and on edge from mistreatment and near-mutiny. Now they must contend with ever present dangers like Nazi U-boats and Luftwaffe attacks, not to mention equal (or greater) danger from the angry ocean. As the crew realizes, stricken ships and their crew can rarely be rescued because the other ships must keep moving or share a similar fate. Of course, how long could a sailor survive in those frigid waters anyway? Among the memorable characters are Captain Vallery, an ill but duty-driven man, and more than one ordinary seaman that define duty and bravery. Readers feel as if they are there aboard the ship as they dare angry seas, fog, and ever-present danger of Nazi U-boats, surface ships, and Luftwaffe. This was the first novel by Alistair MacLean (1922-1987), a worthy, fast-paced naval thriller.For those that don't know, the Murmansk run brought vital war supplies from the USA and Britain to Soviet Russia, but it involved a hazardous sailing trip from Britain and up around Nazi-occupied Norway. After reading this book (as a teen), I met a veteran of those death-defying runs, and his face expressed many memories of his harrowing experience."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"This was Alistair Maclean's first book and what a book to have written.A ship has to make a run to Murmansk during the height of the Second World War battling dreadful seas and the marauding enemy. On board there are a crew who are worn-out and on the verge of mutiny. There is the Captain who is deathly ill. Conditions could not be worse.This is a tale of great bravery under the worst of circumstances. Maclean using a third person narrative tells the tales of a number of characters well and although at times he becomes a little melodramatic, he writes a novel that is justifiably regarded a classic of the sea.It is a book that starts off a little slowly but builds up to a dramatic ending."},{"Title":"H.

They either have a spectacularly gruesome death, or die in an act of suicidal bravery, or more likely both. How much of this can you take as reader? There's not a single bright spot in this whole book. Every time you think the mood is lifting with some character redeeming himself by an heroic act he is either blown to smithereens or frozen to death within a page or two.There's not even any logic to it all. The idea that the Admiralty would sacrifice an entire convoy just to draw out the Tirpitz is stupid. The goal of the Admiralty was to get convoys through, not sink German warships.

He had never heard of the book, though he was familiar with the author.I commended the title to him, and have since re-read it myself. It remains one of the most fraught and depressing, but extraordinarily compelling, novels of naval warfare I've read. MacLean's character development - like the detail and minutiae of the wartime nautical world on the Murmansk run - is intense and complete, even as the characters die from the myriad perils that surround them.This is an epic story of men's ability to endure, the indifference of the sea and the weather, and the stark cruellty of war."},{"Title":"H. M. S.

Thought it would be interesting, as my father had been in the Royal Navy during WWII and did North Atlantic Convoy runs, similar but not quite as cold as the Artic Convoys described in HMS Ulysses to supply Russia with much needed medical and military armaments.From the very begining of the book to the end it was gripping, I devoured it.The constant tension, hardship and vigilence, the weakness and courage of each character was awesome, not a word I frequently use but this story is awesome.We follow the H.M.S.Ulysses on her last Artic Convoy, before promised deployment in the Mediterranean. Nothing goes as planned despite the senior officers capabilities. The unrelenting cold, poor nutrition, disease and psychological stress just keep on coming. The characters are plausable, fully realized and capable of truely heroic actions, while being fulnerable and very human. No amount of planning, training or experience is possible for the unexpected that they find in this, harshest of conditions.It's not an easy read but I think it's his best novel, I've recommened it to all my family and friends.I know this story and it's characters will stay with me for a very, very long time."},{"Title":"H. M. S.

The poor sods crewing this escort ship are officially about to have a very bad trip. They are slated to do yet another run of the convoy to Murmansk, which is pretty much Dead Men Sailing In Ships. They are pretty sure that they do not want to do this again. However, the ship is sent out again, under the auspices of the kindly, overworked doctor, the kindly, stoic captain, and the kindly admiral. The whole book could really be titled \\"HMS Ulysses and the Terrible, Horrible, No-Good, Very Bad Convoy\\". In only a rough semblance of order, here are SOME of the things that happened.* U-boats* More U-boats* Henkels* Being bombed* Being torpedoed* Catastrophic winter hurricane* Rogue waves* Stukkas* People having to be trapped on the wrong side of a flood door to Save the Ship (x2)* Tall taciturn strong man sacrifices self in misguided expiation of sins* Captain dies of TB* Betrayal by the command structure* Poor bastard finds out his sisters and mother died in a bombing the day they ship. Then his brother is killed. Then he has to fire on his father's ship because it was endangering the convoy.* Admiral goes crazy* Admiral dies of frostbite/amputation* Bad apple saves the engineer who gave him a chanceReally, it was like a microcosm of horsemen, what with the war, pestilence (TB), starvation, and death.

One of the greatest and mostly unknown sites of WW2 is the history of Northern Convoys.This book, written by the Navy Officer and Patriot Alistair MacLean , is the best source for people of new generations to learn what happened that time in that place.Glory and Remembrance to all seamen who made possible and impossible to save the World and defeat Nazism."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"Haven't thought about this book in years...but seeing it here brought it all back.At the end of the book a character is asked \\"What happened?\\". I remember clearly thinking \\"There's no way someone could describe adequately the horrendous experience of those crewmembers.\\" Then it dawned on me that I'd just READ IT IN A BOOK!I think this is one of those cases where a successful writer's best work comes earliest, with subsequent output getting progressively less well crafted. Sadly.I'm gonna go buy the last available copy."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"With \\"HMS Ulysses,\\" his first novel, Alistair MacLean established himself as a writer with a flair for action, humor, and pulse-pounding plots. He showed a penchant for capturing the heroism of men in tough spots, the cold of icy environments, and the crash of the waves on the high seas. He gained fame through books such as \\"Ice Station Zebra,\\" \\"The Guns of Navarone,\\" and \\"Where Eagles Dare,\\" but some of his later books seemed to devolve into predictable affairs.\\"HMS Ulysses\\" still stands as a remarkable first novel and as a classic of war on the sea. With nail-biting scenes and teeth-grinding suspense, the story shows the fight for survival of men aboard a ship. I miss the straightforward storytelling of dear Mr. MacLean. I sincerely hope his books remain with us, to be passed to the next generation."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"In his other work, MacLean is an adventure/spy writer. The stories are interesting, some of the work and dialogue cliche'd.H.M.S Ulysses is different. Much different.I had an uncle who commanded an escort in the North Atlantic, and went to Murmansk at least once. His view of the book, which he recommended to me, was that it was perfect in every detail.While there is the suggestion that MacLean puts together everything that could happen to a convoy, and happened to some or many of them at one time or another, into one story, the fact is that it remains perfectly feasible that the convoy is hit by unbelievable Arctic storms, air attacks, submarine attacks, and a surface raider.Some books write of cold, but if you read this book, you will be cold. Some write of fatigue. If you read this book, your eyes will burn and your face will feel as if it's sliding off your head. Some write of despair. If you read this book, you will understand going on and on despite there being no hope simply because that's what you've been doing.MacLean's characters make mistakes. The admiral orders a tactical turn which results in several ships being torpedoed. He realizes that his tactics are old and predictable. The Germans set him up because he was not sufficiently aggressive with himself. An officer orders guns to fire before the tompions are out and several men are killed. This is the way it is. War involves, among other things, a sharp and determined enemy who will mess you up and use yourself against you.Kipling refers to \\"the drowsy second's lack of thought that costs a dozen dead\\" in a poem referring to adolescent naval officers in WW I. These are men who should be hospitalized but instead are forced to operate on overdrive every moment of every day with no relief in sight.In other books, you will read of the immense tonnage of war materials brought to the USSR during the war. The numbers stagger the imagination. This book explains the cost. Good men. Good men, all. All gone.Read this for entertainment. Read it to know how much you owe to men you've never heard of."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"\\"H.M.S. Ulysses\\" was famed author Alistair Maclean's very first novel, a raw, emotional, and thinly-disguised account of a British warship on the Murmansk Convoys of World War II. The convoys carried war material to the Soviet port of Murmansk in the high Arctic under the guns of Nazi planes and ship operating out of occupied Norway. Between the frigid weather and the Nazis, convoy losses were extremely high.The warship of the title suffers the disgrace of a mutiny aboard ship after too many days and nights on the convoys. The British Admiralty, short on escorts, sends the ship and crew straight out again on a voyage of redemption.Maclean's service in the Royal Navy during World War II included time on the Murmansk convoys; he populates the crew of H.M.S. Ulysses with the kind of battle-weary men he served with, and their portraits ring true. These were men with no illusions about themselves or their chances for survival, and no loyalties save to the ship and their shipmates. Among the most memorable is Captain Vallery, the Commander, a duty-driven, almost saintly man, slowly dying of tuberculois but unwilling to abandon his crew. His sacrifice is only one of many portrayed by Maclean; an ordinary seaman's refusal to leave his post under fire, even to save his own life, is made believable and memorable.H.M.S. Ulysses and its crew will strive to the very end; few readers will be unmoved by the penultimate scene of the book. This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to others looking for a first-rate reading experience."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"This is probably the best fiction book on WW2. It is very tragic.. almost every character you come to like so much, dies. At the same time there is a lot of romance, a lot of (perhaps unreal, definitely impractical) bravery. Maclean has one of the most descriptive styles of all writers I have read and his language is superb. A must read for all those who like to read stuff about the sea and/or about war. A truly great book."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"Possibly, the greatest novel of WW2 ever written. It certaintly is the best I have read, and I've read many. Like another reviewer, I also shed a tear. How could you not? Read it."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"Enjoyed this book when I was a young lad and repurchased a few years ago in my forties. Tale of life (and death) on a WW2 Cruiser running a convoy to Russia against overwhelming odds. Read through in one sitting every time. Classic finish."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"HMS ulysses is a raw and brutal portrayal of life on the Russian convoys. There is no glamour here, just the story of a ship and its crew that is sent time and again on what was probably the worse convoys of the war. Alistait Maclean brilliantly portrays a crew that are desperately tired, have endured incessant attacks from the enemy in the near permanentdaylight of the Northern latitudes. Add the numbing cold from which there was no escape, the reader begins to feel the feeling of desperation, tiredness and resentment of the crew. Why us every time? One of the strengths of this book is the superb creation of the principle characters, especialy Captain Vallery. A veteran seaman who was pulled out of retirement to command a modern light cruiser, a perfect fighting machine, but crewed by men who were starting to perform their duties like zombies. Vallery's loyalty to his men was reciprocated by his crew.Simply put, this is the story of men on the very brink, men who only keep going because of their captain, a captain who, like his ship is slowly dying."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"In H.M.S. Ulysses, Alistair MacLean attempted to marry a first rate action novel with a tribute to the men who fought the Battle of the Atlantic. The result probably comes as close as possible to achieving two divergent goals. An action novel should have top rate suspense and a series of minor actions which lead to a rousing climax with a victory of good over evil. Conversely, a tribute should reflect the boredom, the horror, the tension and ultimate futility of war while honouring those who fight it. The conflicts occur in trying to portray both boredom and tension as well as a rousing climax and a sense of futility. It's a credit to MacLean that he succeeds as well as he does.As an action novel, H.M.S. Ulysses works quite well. There are a series of actions including progressively larger battles with the enemy and a tremendous North Atlantic storm culminating with a climactic surface battle. Typical MacLean tension builders such as traitors within are present.Conversely, the tribute works well. There is a great sense that the ship is a family. Many of the men either have no other family, have lost them during the war or their families are now irrelevant to their day-to-day lives. One of the most poignant passages occurs when one sailor is ordered to torpedo a ship on which his own father is sailing. The physical and emotional ordeals of the Murmansk run are well detailed. This was cold and harrowing duty against bitter elements and a determined enemy without any obvious results for the sacrifices made.Some compromises are necessary to marry the two genres. The convoy is savaged worse than the ill-fated, real life PQ-17 and faces all the extremes of weather and enemy attacks. This fits the action genre but is excessive for a tribute novel. Conversely, the action novel suffers because there is no sense that anything important was accomplished nor is there a rousing triumph of good over evil in the climactic battle scene. However, it is amazing how little the novel suffers overall.MacLean went on to do the rousing WWII action novel better in The Guns of Navarone and Where Eagles Dare and Monsarrat's The Cruel Sea is a better tribute; but I doubt that anyone else could attempt such an ambitious compromise and succeed."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"What exceptional story of naval combat! Alistair MacLean gives us the best of his work. The story is that of a Marine convoy, comprising warships and vessels, civilians, merchants, the departure of British coast to Russia. However packs of U-boats attacked the convoy without respite. In the cold, snow, the misery of war, these episodes glaze your blood.25 years after reading this book, I remember many vivid passages. A book of great emotion."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"From the opening excerpt of Tennyson's stirring 'Ulysses' to the tragically courageous ending, H.M.S. Ulysses is a wonderful tale. You feel the weariness of being constantly at action stations, the exhiliration of battle, the hunger, and most of all, the terrible cold that men such as these knew. The desperate struggle in the hurricane is unforgettable, as is the valor of the last surface action. But while a great action story, and a fine read for WWII buffs, on a deeper level, it is about the endurance of man's soul, and the redemption of it's honor. A great epic of the sea, it's ending even evocative of possibly the greatest American novel, 'Moby Dick'. Most gratifying."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"I read this as a very young man, experienced the sea as an older one, and found his rich descriptions of the convoy's battle with the storm to be realistic, and every bit as bad as I remember winter in the North Atlantic to be. I carry some of the scars he speaks of, and the workmanlike bravery of his characters, as well as the very human fears that some of them give in to, speak about ordinary people we all know. This one's a winner for anyone who wants to experience a winter hurricane in the North Atlantic, in the saftey and warmth of their favorite chair. I've been there, and apparently, so had the author."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"This story takes us on-board one of the most popular fictional Destroyers of the story's WW2 era Royal Navy; yet it is anything but a war-propaganda-based tale! In fact, quite the opposite. I found that quality curiously delightful in spite of the common writings of the period. We had just gotten out of Korea then, and would be soon embracing for Vietnam. My sympathy went sky-high for the sailers. Mr. MacLean did a great job 'humanizing' the characters. I was compelled to care for them, worry about them hope with their hopes and be sad with their sorrow.. Mr. MacLean gave us details of the ship with extreme delicacy. I could see the curves of this great ship; the outlines of her guns, the water furrow off her bow and the sillouettes of the enemy's planes but I never was burdened with macro-intensive, semi-relevant details typical of military writers. I was never bored with the descriptions and always sad when she (the ship) was damaged. This is a good read. If you've ever wondered what life aboard a military vessell was in WW2; ever wondered what men thought that were facing death over and over again and how they dealt with (or didn't deal with it), then this is a story for you. I think it breeds the imagination very well. This really is good movie material."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"Probably one of the best ever WWII naval novels. The writing made you feel you were part of the crew, living with characters like Valerie and the Kapok Kid. Not only the crew but you felt you were part of the ship and all that happened to her. A book you couldn't put down nor one you wanted to put down."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"I just re-read HMS Ulysses after about a 30 year hiatus. I don't think anyone has capture the desolate, cold and terror-filled world of the Arctic Convoy run from Halifax to Archangel, like MacLean. It is a classic, unforgetable photograph of a brief period in history when men with undaunting courage, loyalty and almost superhuman endurance, put their lives at risk in unparalled sacrifice."},{"Title":"H. M. S. Ulysses","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was an example of how futile war is and how people are considered expendable by leaders and still are. The story was written more as a screen play than a novel so was very visual."},{"Title":"The human mind","review":"A professional's glimpse into the world of Freudian psychoanalysis from the early 1920's to the early 1960's. May not be in line with current thought and practice but the multitude of examples of abnormal behaviour and the patient quotations, illustrating the various forms of mental illness, are well worth the time investment of reading this book.

I love how the battle between good and evil was portrayed. The way the white spot was the sign of swiftness and the wheat ear on Sham's chest foretold evil. Also, how these influenced Sham and Agba's life.Sham is a Godolphin Arabian that lived in Morroco with his new horseboy, Agba. Sham only listens to Agba and even the most talented horse trainer cannot convince him otherwise. This book is about their journeys through life from living at a palace in Morroco to living nowhere on the streets of England. This book is very moving, and at times, sad. On the way through good and evil, Agba and Sham met a cat named Grimalkin who is very sweet and loving to Sham and Agba. Sham encounters a beauitful mare in Gog Magog, the best, Lady of Roxana.

It's one of the kids books that has carried over to my adult life."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"Like her other books, Marguerite Henry's King of the Wind is beautifully written, holding your interest constantly. I remember reading this wonderful book in school.However, while one can romanticize a story, it should still be true. The book mentions the 3 sons of Sham and the grey Lady Roxana - Lath, Cade, and Regulus. The chestnut Roxana only had 2 foals by The Godolphin Arabian, Lath and Cade. Regulus was by The Godolphin all right but out of a daughter of Bald Galloway named Grey Robinson. (Roxana was also by Bald Galloway but out of Sister to Chauntner).Roxana died in 1734 not too long after foaling Cade. Regulus was foaled in 1739. So there is no way Roxana could have foaled Regulus because she died 5 years before Regulus was born.Hobgoblin was written of very badly in King of the Wind. Actually, this horse was very well bred. He was by Aleppo who was by The Darley Arabian and out of a daughter of Darcy's White Turk. Hobgoblin was out of a great-granddaughter of Darcy's Yellow Turk, and has many of the same horses in his pedigree as does Roxana. Both of these horses Hobgoblin and Roxana trace over and over again to Turkish, Barb, and Oriental horses. Some known to be Arabian, and some thought to be.This is not the first time Marguerite Henry has so blatantly changed facts. Her beautiful Misty of Chincoteague was inaccurate too. Misty, the Phantom, and the Pied Piper were all domestic ponies at the Beebe Ranch and Misty was foaled there. Kind of takes the romanticism out of it when we find out that the Pied Piper really didn't come back for the Phantom.The Godolphin Arabian is real, we even know his strain which is Jilfan Stam El Bulad. To so blatantly change the facts of this story of such an important time - the origin of the Thoroughbred breed - should never have been done, no matter how well written."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"I think that King of the Wind is a wonderful well-written book about the Godolphin Arabian (or Sham) and his life with Agba (a stable boy). It starts out at Man O' War's (a famous, fast racehorse) race. Man O' War always carried very heavy weights for a racehorse, and his trainer had to retire him before his spirit was broken by the weights. To have fans understand, he told them the story of the Godolphin Arabian......The story of Agba and Sham's life. I thought this book was really good because it showed how the bond between horse and human can be so strong, nothing can ever break it. Also, I like that Sham and Agba started out a nothing but a small horse and young black stable boy -- and ended up as the Godolphin Arabian and Agba, one of the most famous horses ever and an important person that made Sham the Godolphin Arabian. I recommend this book because it is a historic book and a wonderful story about how far a bond between boy and horse can go. Definitely a 5-Star book!"},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"This book gave me much much much more than I have expected.

The black and white drawings lend character and intimacy to this ever-moving horse story."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"Newbery medaled book, King of the Wind, is written by Marguerite Henry. This book is part of the horseshoe series, is about friendship and hope between a young horse and boy through their chilling lives in a new country. Marguerite Henry wrote other books as part of the horseshoe series. Some examples are Misty of Chincoteague, Sea Star, Brighty of the Grand Canyon and Justin Morgan had a horse. King of the Wind is a fiction classic and 192 pages long. The illustrator is Wesley Dennis and the publisher is Aladdin. The book was an interesting, adventurous, emotional story that may hunger you for more.The Sutan has called Signor Achmet to bring him six of his finest stallions to be shipped to England for the King as a gift. One of them is a spirited Arabian stallion with a young mute Arab stable boy that become the best of friends. In England, Monsieur Le Duc, the King's adviser, sent Sham, the horse, and Agba, the boy, to work for the King's cook. Days later the cook sold Sham having Agba search for him by will. Out in the cold with no food, nor shelter he's given a job where once again he's united with Sham but along the trail he meets new people and a friend. But a switch off good luck now turns bad he searches again for Sham and ends up getting thrown into jail for being accused for \`horse stealing'.I enjoyed some of the characters in the book because they have different actions. Some examples are the king's cook is stubborn, Agba is caring, the mean man that treated Sham wrongly is greety. In the beginning when Sham was born, he was born with a wheat ear and a white spot on a back ankle. These represent the even battles of evil and good luck. That had Signor Achmet believing that the colt will die as the mother had. This had Agba feeding the colt camel's milk for strength to grow. Before the two left for England weeks later Agba had made a promise to Sham that sham will be come King of the wind when he becomes a man. For a spirited horse should belong to no one.Signor Achmet chose Agba and five other boys to go to England. With their stallions that have been chosen for them. The journey that Agba and Shan go through as they live in this new place felt as if these events in the story were real. But the details in the setting sometimes pulled me in to get a better image without the pictures. Like when Agba gets a job so he can support Sham and himself living in a market shed. That was sad that they can't seem to stay in one decent place, like at their old home.This small twist of a story of an Arabian stallion named Sham and a young mute stable boy go on an adventure. Surviving threw the harsh streets of England relying on one another on dreams to make differences. An Arabian horse and boy get in a mess of trouble and distress and still seam to come out fresh and new in their lives in the end. This King of the Wind is a memorable story to read without to much boredom but the thought of what will happen next. My recommendation is the only best parts are when the story flops to the good side of things. Like when Sham finds love with another (female) stallion. But it was terrible that he can't have her. The switching of good and evil luck, threw out their years, must drive Sham and Agba wild without them knowing themselves."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"a colt is born in a stable with a star on his head which stands for ''speed'' but the spot on his chest stands for \`\`misfortune\`\` but as his life goes on he is mistreated by some owners and others are very good to him ... agba is a boy that loves him and wants to be with him forever but can not the golden stallion is named ( shame ) as the sun ... this is a very good but and i hope you read it"},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"King of the wind is a great book.

Ordered it for myself and a second one for my Grandson. This is a Great book for all ages."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"It seems like all the \\"classic\\" books about horses follow the same mold; the horse is born, grows up, learns how to handle humans, goes through a casting out period where they are treated horribly and become separated from the people they love, then somewhere toward the end they find their family or human again and all is restored in the world. This book fits right in with that category, so why do we all love it so deeply?The story of Sham is the story of hope, of struggle through hardship and the return to grace. It is also the story of the strength in friendship. But more than all of this, it is the story of a great horse who was made great not by his deeds, but by the deeds of his children. King of the Wind captures the essence of Sham's greatness, showing it to the readers in a way that his actions were never allowed to do, all while describing the experiences in the most beautiful and heart-touching detail. Horse lovers and fans of racing will find that this book is so all-encompassing that they simply can not put it down, because after a while you realize you don't see the words on the page, you see the image of the experience in your mind.Easy to see why this was a Newbery winner and is still a must read."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"First I must say I'm not a \\"young reader\\" which is who this book is intended for.

Another plus, which I didn't know until after reading the book, is that it is based on a true story. I found the book to be enjoyable and frustrating/sad at the same time. Sad because of how Agba and Sham continually were abused or just plain treated awful.

Such judgements have shaped the history of the world. Man's appraisal of man has consequences for the judge and judged alike.\\"King of the Wind\\" is, on the surface, an engaging, epic, satisfying horse story. Underneath the surface, however, the novel questions how man assesses the worth of others, and shows how such assessments can benefit or harm individuals or groups.In \\"King of the Wind\\", the reader never questions the value of Sham, the Arabian horse, nor his life's companion, Agba. But the question of their value is put before every other character in the book. How a dark-skinned, speech-challenged human and his alien-breed horse are valued determines everything that happens in the book. Will the world appreciate the magnificence that stands before them in horseflesh and human spirit? Or will the tale of Sham and Agba be a tragedy of wasted opportunity?How do we judge those that we meet on our roads, or in our markets, or in our houses?

My mother bought it for me after it received the Newberry Award back in the 1940s--I was around 10 at the time and I was in love with horses! I've read the book numerous times as a child and then later as an adult as I was an elementary teacher in 4th grade; I read it to my class every year still using my original copy from childhood. Hurricane Wilma in 2005 destroyed many of my beloved books, including this one. I was thrilled to be able to find a pefect copy from Amazon.com of the hardback edition with a \\"brand-new\\" book jacket and it had all the beautiful paintings made by Wesley Dennis. The copy I bought was published before the book won the Newbery. I still love the wonderful story of the beautiful horse who was the father of many of the racing giants in history, including the great Man-of-War.

I like that it is gender-neutral, so you can feel free to buy it for either one. The sketches, here and there, are also excellent."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"Marguerite Henry took great license in telling the story of the Godolphin Arabian, but it's likely there were two reasons she did so; first, because she based the majority of her novel on heavily romanticised reports like that which appeared in Western Horseman in 1949; second, to illustrate to young children what could happen to perfectly good horses that were considered worthless because of prejudice or unwillingness to see what was there.The real Sham was born in Tunis and given by the Bey of Tunis to King Louis XV with a group of other horses. But there's no evidence that he was reduced to pulling a cart in the Paris streets before rescue by Edward Coke. Coke probably got him from the Duke of Lorraine, who'd gotten him from the King.A contemporary described Sham as \\"beautiful but half-starved\\", so the rough sea voyage with the greedy officers and crew is likely true, even if the cart-horse story is not. He also said that Sham (he spelled it Shami, and other accounts have \\"Scham\\") was temperamental and generally disliked by the stable hands. A vet who cared for Sham in his last years said he was built to sire champions: \\"his shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than those of any horse ever yet seen. Behind the shoulders, there was but a very small space ere the muscles of his loins rose exceedingly high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his hindquarters with greater strength and power than in any horse I believe ever yet seen of his dimensions, viz fifteen hands high.\\"Agba was real; there are portraits of the little horse with a handsome dark-skinned young man in flowing Arab dress and turban. Whether or not he was mute is debatable. Again, many of the later accounts have been greatly romanticised. But Grimalkin the stable cat was real too, according to early records which report his presence in the famous portrait.There is no record of the apocalyptic battle with Hobgoblin. We can look at that, and Sham's subsequent exile to Wicken Fen, as symbolic of the prejudice felt by the complacent English toward this relatively small, strange-looking newcomer. The truth is that Sham did mate with Lady Roxane and sired Lath. He sired 116 others in his long lifetime.With all the interest in Seabiscuit of late, one would like to point out that as a direct descendant of Man O'War, he was also a direct descendant of the Godolphin Arabian. Just another horse who seemed worthless, but was not, and came from behind to prove the superiority of Arabian blood.Look up \\"Davenport Arabians\\" to learn more about this proud line."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"This book was given to me when I was barely eight years old, almost thirty years ago. I learned how to read books that took more than one sitting with &quot;King of the Wind&quot;.The story is of a mute Morrocan stable boy, Agba, and a foal, Sham, who is born to one of the royal mares Agba cares for. Sham...and Agba...are selected to be part of a gift to the King of France. Their adventures in Europe are filled mostly with despair and cruelty, until Sham sires a foal that becomes the beginnings of the Thoroughbred breed we know today (this part is true; Sham was renamed &quot;The Godolphin Arabian&quot;; all Thoroughbreds must include in their pedigreeone of the three specific founding sires, and the Godolphin Arabian is one of them).There's a lot here: adventure, triumph over adversity, a respect for other cultures, the care of the creatures that share our lives, and a healthy dose of humor about the absurdities of the powerful or elite.As a kid, I eagerly devoured any Marguerite Henry book I could find. It's well worth it to get hard-cover editions that include the wonderful full-color illustrations by Wesley Dennis."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":".... Marguerite Henry's novel King of the Wind is a beautiful story of a horse and his faithful groom. Throughout the novel the boy and the horse suffer through triumphs and tribulations. Their struggles are in silence, however, because the boy cannot speak. By making the boy a mute, Marguerite Henry makes the reader aware of the emotional aspect of the book. The audience is able to sympathize with the characters as the book progresses. The story begins in Morocco where Sham, the horse, is born in the Sultan's stable. Agba, the mute boy, is in charge of taking care of Sham. The Sultan decides to send the King of France a gift of six of his finest stallions, of which Sham is one. He commands the six grooms to remain with their mounts until the horses die, then return to Morocco. The trip is a disaster and five of the horses are returned to Morocco. Sham is kept to be used as a carthorse because of his fiery temper. He is sold many times and is forced to endure many hardships. Throughout all of his ordeals Agba is there taking care of him. The story ends when Sham is bought by the Earl of Godolphin and becomes the founding sire of the English racehorse. Nearly every Thoroughbred today can be traced back to the Godolphin Arabian. The story brings out feelings from the audience and Henry captures this emotion in Agba. Agba and Sham are the best of friends. No one can do anything with the horse if the boy is not around. Neither the boy or the horse can communicate verbally and this makes their emotions even more acute in the book. Their pain and suffering were made even worse by the fact that they couldn't explain to their tormentors what was happening. Henry does a wonderful job of putting the reader in the boy's position. It is very frustrating to want to tell someone something so bad, but not be able to. Portraying Agba as a normal speaking boy would have ruined the story. It forces the reader to feel the boy's pain and frustration rather than just reading about it. On page 169 the narrator states, \\"For the first time in his life, he was glad he could not talk. Words would have spoiled everything. They were shells that cracked and blew away in the wind. He and Sham were alike. That is why they understood each other so deeply\\". The bond between the horse and the boy would not have been nearly as strong and compelling if Agba communicated verbally. As mentioned in Dr. Allen's article some studies have suggested that people with speech disabilities can have bonds with animals that are as strong as past friendships with other people. These most frequently perceived aspects of animal-human relationships were described as companionship, emotional bond, usefulness, loyalty and the quality of needing no negotiation. Agba and Sham could communicate with each other even though they could not communicate with the rest of the world. This special bond between horse and boy brings the story to life. This story is a beautiful version of the story of the Godolphin Arabian. Portraying Agba as a mute gives the reader the opportunity to feel and experience what the boy and the horse both feel. Had the boy been able to talk this story would not have been nearly as effective or interesting. The bond the horse and boy share is unlike any other a normal speaking human could possess with an animal. Because Henry chose to take away the power of speech from the boy and the horse the reader has gained a wealth of emotion and feeling in this novel."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"I am now 32 years old, and this book remains vivid in my mind as one of my all-time childhood favorites. The story of the mute stable boy Agba and his travels with 'his' beloved horse Sham exposes young readers to a variety of cultures and stressses the value of faithfulness and loyalty without being at all preachy. Sham, sent as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco to the King of France, is mistreated during the voyage and arrives looking like an old nag instead of the young, well-bred Arab stallion he is. The king's rejection of the horse is the beginning of a new journey as Sham -- with Agba always there to care for him -- passes from one owner to another, eventually becoming &quot;The Godolphin Arabian&quot; one of the three founders of the Thoroughbred bred.

I rate this book with five stars. This book is about the adventure and friendship of a spirited horse named Sham and his horse boy. Agba the horse boy is a mute. When Sham was born hewas a weak horse but grew strong thanks to Agba's careful care. Agba and Sham were part of the royal stables in Morocco. The sultan of Morocco wanted to send six of his finest horses and their horse boys to the king of France as a present. Sham and Agba were chosen and endured the rough, long journey to France. By the time the small group of fine horses got to France they were mere skin and bones. The little group was laughed at and sent away lickety split. Agba and Sham stayed to help carry food to and fro the market for the kitchen at the kingdom. Eventually things happened leading them to live in many different places each time with different experiences. They had many rough times and sometimes by themselves. In one of the events a cat joins the boy and his horse. These three are quite n sync with each other and are quiet. The three endure many hardships as the story continues and in the end the story unexpectedly twists leading to ahappy ending.King of the Wind was an awesome book.

That's why this book received a Newberry Honor Award."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"The Christmas I was nine, I got a boxed set of Marguerite Henry novels and while I loved all of them and read them day and night during the break from school, I think this one goes down as my favorite. A few years after I first read this novel, my family moved and I discovered it was also, by a nice coincidence, one of the favorite books of a girl I met in our new neighborhood, who went on to be my best friend to this very day. That connection, too, makes this a special read. However you might come to possess this wonderful book, I think you'll agree, it's one to be cherished.King of the Wind is the story of a mute boy named Agba, who lives works in the royal stables in Morocco during the eighteenth century, where the Sultan has perhaps the finest collection of horses on earth: maybe the greatest ever in history. Among the animals Agba cares for is a colt who has long been Agba's favorite. This horse was born with a mark called the wheat ear, that is regarded among Moroccans as so unlucky, custom mandates that any foal possessing it be destroyed at once. However, this colt also is marked by a sign of extraordinary good fortune, which reprieves the death sentence and is there to battle the wheat ear in the animal's life: the good in constant yin/yang conflict with the bad.As a gesture of goodwill, the all-powerful Sultan elects to send a shipment of his finest horses to his friend and ally, King George of England. As the horses chosen for the journey are prepared, Agba is given the chance to accompany these prized animals by ship to the far-off Christian kingdom. One of the colts hand-picked by his Excellency is none other than the omen-marked horse Agba has grown to love. The journey northward upon the ocean is undertaken, but an unscrupulous sea captain has shortchanged the Sultan's agents and not provided food for the equine passengers. Therefore, the cargo of fine desert steeds who are unloaded in England appear little better than half-starved nags, and never find their way to the royal court.Cast out among beggars and in a strange, cold nation where he knows no one and does not understand the language, Agba refuses to leave his beloved horse's side and the happenings that come to pass in the life of the desert stable boy and the fine, though seemingly run-down stallion, form the basis of a delightful novel that is simultaneously a tale of a boy and his extraordinary horse, and a history lesson in eighteenth-century equine lore. In Miss Henry's story, fact and fiction meet as Agba's horse becomes the celebrated Godolphin Arabian, from whom roughly one-third of all modern thoroughbreds can trace descent.I guess you can tell I really like this book, and I think almost anyone would as well!"},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"This book I read when I was about 9 or 10. I still remember how well Marguerite Henry's imagination worked. This book is about a loyal horseboy and a beutiful Arabian named Sham who is as wild as a lion. In the beggining when Sham is born, with the white spot, his mother will die and she does. Sham almost dies too, but the horseboy saves him with camel's milk and honey. Sham and him grow up together and the one day gets called to the sultan. He sends the to Europe where they perform for the king. After a while they travel all over Europe going through tough times, fun times, and times when they are split up. During the story a cat joins them. Some people are happy to help them when they are in trouble and others cause the trouble. In all the books by Marguerite Henry, I feel as though when she wrote these, her imagination must have flew wildly. What I mean by that is her writing is amazing. Some people think her writing stinks, but in my opinion, she's great."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"Uh-oh. A horse book. As a kid, I always avoided horse books. They were the kinds of titles plucked up by fellow girls for the purpose of indulging their pony-laden fantasies. I never read \\"The Black Stallion\\" or \\"Black Beauty\\" or any of the classic equine titles out there. I read \\"Equus\\", but I don't think that counts. Then I decided to read all the Newbery award winning books I could get my hands on. That meant getting my hands on a copy of \\"King of the Wind\\". Fortunately, I've found that the older I get the more prejudices acquired during my youth are sloughed off with every book I read. With \\"King of the Wind\\" you get a thrilling one-horse history based on a true story. Though not the most satisfying of children's novels, kids reading the book will find themselves rooting steadfastly for this, the original underdog.Quiz Question of the Day: Where in early 18th-century were some of the finest horses in the world raised and bred? If you answered Morocco then you are correct. At the time of this story, a mute stableboy by the name of Agba witnesses the birth of a most unusual foal. Born with a white spot on his foot (a good sign) and a wheat ear (a bad), the horse is named Sham by the boy and under the child's care grows healthy and strong. The horse is so impressive that it is only one of six sent as a gift (with horseboy Agba in tow) to the King of France himself. Unfortunately, this marks the true beginning of Sham's troubles. A malicious sea captain starves the animals and they end up looking very poor gifts indeed. Sham becomes an unruly workhorse. Then he's separated from his boy and given to an uncommonly cruel man. Boy and horse are reunited (and a cat comes along as well) only to pass from a kindly Quaker to a thoughless innkeeper. Our heroes together weather jail, banishment, and all sorts of ills until Sham's talent is finally discovered at long last... sort of. Though Sham never runs a great race (as any normal horse book would have him do) he sires some mighty-fine offspring who win all the races they're entered into. Happy ending for all.Well, maybe \\"happy ending for all\\" is a bit much. The book's focus, should anyone forget it, is not supposed to be the Muslim boy, Agba. Author Marguerite Henry's choice of making him mute isn't too surprising when you think about it. After all, the fact that no matter what country he ends up in he manages to understand the language is shaky ground at best. If he can't talk then he can't suddenly burst into fluent French when the moment calls for it. Also, he can't get out of tricky situations (like his unfair jail time) and is a perpetual victim as a result. What struck me as particularly odd, however, was the end of the book. Agba's fate is reduced to a single sentence. After Sham's death Agba goes back to Morocco. End of story. Guess we know who the real hero in this tale is, huh? This is especially frustrating when you consider that you've been rooting for this kid for roughly 173 pages. To just drop him at the end without further to-do is harsh, to say the least. I mean, we're talking about one of the first Muslim heroes in children's literature. Surely that counts for something? Consider, after all, that this kid is banished from a beautiful home at one point and forced to practically starve in a cold scary fen at another. Then, at the end, the horse's newest owner tells the boy that all is forgiven and no hard feelings for making you live like a common thief, eh? Why the boy doesn't end up just the tiniest bit bitter is beyond me. I wonder if a kid of European blood would've been treated in a similar manner? Methinks, not so much.And while I'm thinking about it, the ending's a little odd as well. That, however, I'm a bit more lenient with. Since this is based on a true story, Henry was limited in what she could or could not embellish. Most books in which a racehorse is ignored for his true talents end with that horse winning a big race at the tale's end. Not so here. Sham never wins a single race (aside from unofficial ones in Morocco). Instead, he simply sires more and more fast horsies, thereby \\"winning\\" by indulging in a most natural horse-like activity. Still, if that's what actually happened then who am I to complain?I enjoyed this book thoroughly (in spite of my petty snipes). Henry knows how to write a gripping tale, full of soaring highs and truly awful lows. If you've a child with an affinity with horses, make sure that they won't feel too out of sorts when they see Sham beaten continually and abused in consistently awful ways. Animal cruelty aside, \\"King of the Wind\\" is one of those Newbery winners that kids (if they skip the Prologue chapter) will get into immediately. Consider pairing it with another boy-tending-a-great-horse book \\"The Star of Kazan\\" by Eve Ibbotson."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"I think that King of the Wind is a wonderful well-written book about the Godolphin Arabian (or Sham) and his life with Agba (a stable boy). It starts out at Man O' War's (a famous, fast racehorse) race. Man O' War always carried very heavy weights for a racehorse, and his trainer had to retire him before his spirit was broken by the weights. To have fans understand, he told them the story of the Godolphin Arabian......The story of Agba and Sham's life. I thought this book was really good because it showed how the bond between horse and human can be so strong, nothing can ever break it. Also, I like that Sham and Agba started out a nothing but a small horse and young black stable boy -- and ended up as the Godolphin Arabian and Agba, one of the most famous horses ever and an important person that made Sham the Godolphin Arabian.

I bought it for my own children and as I read it to them, I was taken back to the day I first read the story. Even after thirty two years, Sham and Agba still make me cry.It's writing is simple, the words easy for a child to understand, but the story is so full of awe and respect for the great horse that you can't help but be moved. The illustrations are also some of the finest in children's literature.

But the French laugh at the little horse and Sham is sent off to a series of owners, here and there, loved and hated, until he finally ends up in England. It is only in England when the true nature of Sham's racing abilities are realized through his offspring, three horses who win for their owner prize after prize.In fourth grade, my teacher read this book aloud.

When I first read this book (which I read before \\"Justin Morgan Had a Horse\\"), I was amazed at the information coming at me -- that horses (and, by extension, any animal) could possess a set of genes so distinct that they passed them on to their offspring in such a way that their genes dominated. I'm not saying I understood it in these terms, but I did grasp the essence of dominant genes through stories such as King of the Wind.This story of how a faithful boy and an under-appreciated horse triumph is powerful, uplifting nonfiction.

For that matter, Marguerite Henry is simply one of my favorite authors. I've always loved horses, and I love the way she makes her characters and animals come alive. Add Wesley Dennis' superb illustrations and you have the captured feelings and expressions as well!King of the Wind is the fictionalized story of the Godolphin Arabian's journey to greatness. Beginning in Morocco, a colt is born just as the fast of Ramadan comes to a close. Agba, a mute horse-boy who has charge of merely ten of the twelve thousand horses in the Sultan's stables, names the colt Sham because he was born at the rising of the sun. Sham has the mark of the wheat ear on his chest: a sign of misfortune, or \`bad luck'... but on his hind heel he has a white spot, promising swiftness.The head horse-keeper, Signor Achmet, promises Sham's mother will die and believes Sham should die as well because of the bad luck of the wheat ear. As he said, the dam does die; but this could be easily explained as the outcome from having limited eating supply during the last month of pregnancy. Sham, however, thrives on the camel's milk Agba feeds him - and bonds to the boy who is both a father and mother to him - as he grows strong and swift to live up to the promise of the white spot.Throughout this book the \`powers' of the wheat ear and white spot weigh in on the scales, commonly explained as the luck and chance of one or the other. Agba and Sham, along with seven other horse-boys and their charges, are chosen to be sent as a gift to King Louis XV. The unexpected happens on their journey and when they reach the king's court they are considered nothing but laughingstock (\\"Nothing but skin and bones, and a crest so high you can hang your hat upon it!\\"). Agba and Sham are chosen to stay and work for the chief cook, but the cook takes a strong dislike to Sham because Agba is the only one who can handle the spirited horse. Without Agba's knowledge, the cook sells Sham off to a nasty carter who works him very hard. Agba and Sham's paths cross again though, and after a time of working for the monstrous carter and acquiring a faithful cat named Grimalkin (not to be confused with the black cat with green eyes from Henry's other masterpiece, 'Benjamin West and his cat Grimalkin'), they find happiness for a time with Quaker Jethro Coke and his cheery housekeeper, Mistress Cockburn.Yet again, misfortune strikes, and Sham becomes a horse for hire at The Red Lion Tavern. Agba is allowed to stay with him as a groom for a while, but the owner's wife hates him distinctly, and Agba is thrown out to the streets again... then deposited in Newgate Prison and labeled a \`horse thief' after going back and trying to spirit Sham away from The Red Lion. Mistress Cockburn comes to see him (after what I would call an extremely providential run-in with the Duchess), and Agba is released and given a job as a groom at the Earl of Godolphin's stables. While there, Sham's health begins to improve and he meets Lady Roxana, a filly imported to be bred to the pride of Gog Magog, Hobgoblin. In a fight between the two stallions, Hobgoblin is injured, and the angry Earl sends the threesome (Agba, Sham, and Grimalkin) into the gloomy Wicken Fen.

This is simply one of the greatest horse books ever written, and a treasure of my horse-mad girlhood. The pictures--you have to get a copy with the gorgeous illustrations--are dramatic, romantic, and realistic, like the most moving of mid 19th Century art. (Think of \\"The Horse Fair.\\") This is the story of the so-called Godolphin Arabian, one of the founders of modern Thoroughbred stock. I believe every line today includes this horse. As it's an historical novel, I'm sure a great deal of it is fiction, but it is certainly an imaginative recreation of the long journey of an Arabian stallion and his devoted boy servant, from their home in the palace stables of the East, to the estate of the English Godolphins. Even European race horses were enormous in the 18th Century, and still carried lots of the antique war horse in their genes. Europeans, and in this case, the King of France, to whom the Arabians were sent as a gift, could not believe that these small animals were as strong or as swift as they proved to be. The French King scornfully disposed of these royal gifts to the lowest bidder. This horse, however, managed to survive and eventually ended in England, where his speed and great strength for his size were noted with approval. Sometimes gut-wrenching, this is a gripping, thrilling, story written by the same talented writer who gave us \\"Misty of Chincoteague.\\" It is an absolute essential for the library of any child who LOVES horses and is interested in the how and why of history."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"King of the Wind is an exciting story!I love Marguerite's ideas.She must love horses verryy much.My mom grew up on a farm, and she had a horse named,King.He was her baby.She loved him very much.When i was born my mom introduced me to a horse,and I fell in love with it.When I moved I thought that all of my friends were left behind,along with the books about the animals I love.My friend,Kourtney,knew that I loved horses and she told me to read Misty of Chincoteague(probobly spelled it wrong)and I loved it!

I love how the battle between good and evil was portrayed. The way the white spot was the sign of swiftness and the wheat ear on Sham's chest foretold evil. Also, how these influenced Sham and Agba's life.Sham is a Godolphin Arabian that lived in Morroco with his new horseboy, Agba. Sham only listens to Agba and even the most talented horse trainer cannot convince him otherwise. This book is about their journeys through life from living at a palace in Morroco to living nowhere on the streets of England. This book is very moving, and at times, sad. On the way through good and evil, Agba and Sham met a cat named Grimalkin who is very sweet and loving to Sham and Agba. Sham encounters a beauitful mare in Gog Magog, the best, Lady of Roxana. From there life is just as it was meant to be. I highly recommend this book !!"},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"While many may pass it by as just another horse book, Marguerite Henry's 1949 Newbery Medal-winning classic is truly the story of the bond between a slave boy from Morocco and a horse that become the patriarch of centuries of Thoroughbred racehorses. Agba is a mute young groom in the Sultan of Morocco's vast stables. At the age of eleven, he and his beloved charge Sham, the Sultan's finest Arabian, are sent as a gift to the King of France, only to be scoffed at and left to pull the cook's cart to the market. Throughout the horse's miserable series of abusive ordeals, the faithful Agba sacrifices his own existence to protect and comfort Sham, who never fails to return his devotion.Beautifully descriptive of numerous cultures spanning Morocco, France, and England, the novel portrays the universal traits of kindness and cruelty in characters of high and low means. As heroic as the horse that maintains his pride in the face of humility is the boy. Agba's devotion is rooted in the special bond that comes from raising an animal, further reinforced by his inability to speak. He and Sham communicate silently, and become one when they are together. The novel will appeal not only to horse lovers, but to anyone who appreciates friendship and adventure."},{"Title":"King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian","review":"Like \\"Sham\\" himself, this story is a classic--beautifully written and illustrated.

Not only to own but to be friends with something as beautiful and proud as a horse is truly remarkable.

Henry's writing is so beautiful, the story so touching and the characters so real. A plot unfolds about a young stable boy in Morocco and his golden-bay stallion who would one day be known as the Godolphin Arabian, who's bloodline still runs in race horses of today. It's quite possible a lot of this book is based on fact. A simply amazing story in all respects! I must warn sensitive readers however, there are some very intense parts of this book, some sad parts which are sure to make most people cry and a few parts where there is fairly harsh abuse and neglect of animals. Maybe not the best choice to read to very young kids, especially if they are the type to get scared easily. Overall, I would say the book has an excellent balance of tragedy and triumph.

I also liked it because it was full of adventure. It was sad and exciting and there were many parts where Sham and Agba were seperated. Agba was very brave for a young, mute boy and Sham kept him company with his firy spirit that only Agba could control.My favorite part was when the cook tried to drive Sham. He wanted to show that he did not need Agba to drive Sham. He left Agba at the royal kitchens then set out. Sham bidded his time till the cart was groaning with goods and a young pig. Then \\"BAM!\\" He went wild and ran like the wind, sending the goods, the pig, and the cook into the air. The cook runs after first the pig, then Sham, then the pig, until he is so confused that he catched nither.

This was his second political book, published at the height of Vietnam war protests. The book begins with an in-depth examination of the Pentagon Papers. This confidential history of US policy toward Vietnam was made public in the late 1960s, leading to a lawsuit by the US government against the New York Times and other newspapers. The newspapers won (when midwestern papers started printing the confidential history, making the lawsuit irrelevant) and everyone was finally able to see what the Pentagon had been up to since the 1950s.It's not a pretty picture. Chomsky quotes the Papers relentlessly, citing multiple versions of it. He lets the generals and politicians speak for themselves, revealing their real commitments, showing how they prevented democracy from breaking out in Vietnam in 1954. From there, he shows how the war expanded to Laos and Cambodia. The footnotes for these chapters are massive, citing hundreds of reliable sources. This section of the book is one of the best examinations of the Vietnam war you'll ever read, right up there with Gabriel Kolko's &quot;Anatomy of a War&quot; and Marilyn Young's &quot;The Vietnam Wars.&quot;Then Chomsky shifts gears. He writes a brief but powerful essay on war resistance and the role of universities as subversive institutions. These chapters show Chomsky's commitment to peaceful, intelligent, democratic protest --- and his honesty about its limitations.The final chapters are about behaviorism, anarchism, and human nature. Although these topics are quite a change from the Vietnam war material at the beginning, they are no less impressive. Chomsky's review of BF Skinner's behaviorism completely demolishes the concept. This essay single-handedly brought the field to a halt in 1972. (Skinner responded once, failing to counter Chomsky's arguments, and behaviorism never recovered.) He even takes time to explain, in a single footnote, why Richard Herrnstein's study of IQ is useless (which made &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; irrelevant twenty years before it was written). Chomsky's notes on anarchism and his reflections on the mystery of human nature describe his underlying attitude about people and their relation to the state.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an education on Vietnam or Noam Chomsky's political work. The lies of Vietnam --- and the illegitimate authority of the state --- continue today in new forms. This book will inspire you to activism, and to learn more."},{"Title":"For Reasons of State","review":"\\"For reasons of state\\" and \\"American power\\"; both written at the height of the vietnam war are chomsky at his most passionate. The works are obvoiusly written when the hopes of real change in the power structures of society seemed like a real possiblity. The condemnations of US policy are fast and furiuos as Chomsky turns scrutizing State dept papers into calls to action. There is no punches pulled here, hopeful thoughts of future stuctures of human freedom are disscussed in chapters with titles such as \\"notes on anarchism.\\"Agree with him or not this is one of the few political books that can actually raise your heart rate."},{"Title":"For Reasons of State","review":"Those wishing to understand the hijinks that led to the US invasion of Iraq can do no better in reviewing this seminal \\"nostalgia\\" piece on American war planning.

The essays are called \`bold' but the reality is that disagreeing with the Vietnam war isn't exactly revolutionary. No original thought is found within these essays instead they are the typical \`America is evil' mentality. One essay in particular focuses on the war in Laos and Cambodia but it ignores the Vietnamese invasions of these countries and the destabilizing influence that Vietnamese troops caused as they rampaged through the rice fields of Cambodia in order to invade South Vietnam. The reality is that these essays completely ignore and in fact deny the truth about Pol Pots regime in Cambodia, a communist regime that killed 25% of the country and especially murdered minority groups and Muslims.

It was very long, and the style of writing didn't jive too well with me. Of course, I don't know who I am to criticize Cardinal Newman. I still would recommend this to those wanting a fuller understanding of how tradition develops, but I like Congar's book \\"The Meaning of Tradition\\" a lot better. Shorter, more readable, and to the point."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"John H. Newman wrote four magisterial works (not including his large body of sermons) of which this Essay is one of the most important and influential. It is perhaps the most accessible of J.H.N.'s works, and the most significant.The problem that Newman wants to resolve is how can Christian doctrine develop, if, as is commonly believed, Jesus embodied all revelation, once and for all. Another way of attacking the same problem is to determine how certain doctrines not stated in an overt manner in the Bible (e.g., purgatory) can be shown to be a licit and legitimate development based on scriptural integrity. Newman doesn't hold the view that the Bible itself is the only form of revelation, but he does hold the view that subsequent development of doctrine cannot repudiate biblical statements. Broadly and coherently developed, Newman shows that development of Christian doctrine under certain restrictions is both necessary and fundamental to the Christian dispensation.Where Newman is less convincing is with more recent papal doctrines like the immaculate conception and the assumption of the blessed Virgin Mary. While these latter two doctrines have different aetiologies, one clearly developed in a manner consistent with scripture while the other is plainly contradictory. The Assumption (or else, Dormition, Glorification, etc.) of Mary has very ancient traditions and is the manifestation of the doctrine of our own glorification on the Last Great Day. Conversely, the immaculate conception was determined by Thomas Aquinas, the angelic doctor and preeminent theologian of the church, to be inconsistent with the sacred deposit once and forever revealed and directly contradicted by scripture.What do these two doctrines have to do with Newman's book? Newman wants to insist the doctrine continues to &quot;evolve&quot; or &quot;develop,&quot; but that this growth, be be licit and legitimate, must be consistent with the initial sacred deposit once received, and that this development must grow organically out of that which the Church has inherited and must not be a novation or innovation. The doctrine of Papal primacy has likewise remained consistent with some form of belief from the Church's earliest beliefs, but the notion of papal &quot;supremacy&quot; is of recent origin and not consistent with scripture or church history. Both papal supremacy and the immaculate conception are at odds with the Church's earliest positions, was repudiated in the Middle Ages, and is contrary to Scripture's insistence.So Newman's task is a difficult one. He wants to defend the Roman tradition, but the Roman tradition, especially as it embarked on the nineteenth century, created a few novations that and innovations it heretofore had repudiated. Newman, I think, succeeds in walking this fine line of showing how the sacred deposit fully and for all time singularly received does develop over time by the synthesis of episcopal collegiality, consensus fidelium, sacred scripture, and venerable tradition. Newman's hermeneutic allows for the Spirit to breathe multiple understandings of the same ostensible dogma in such a way as to be said to &quot;grow,&quot; but it remains consistent with the original deposit through the four-fold synthesis through which the Holy Spirit operates.Where a chasm occurs is with doctrinal novations, such as the immaculate conception and papal supremacy. The dogma of the immaculate conception is not only INCONSISTENT and INCOHERENT, it is also CONTRARY, to the received tradtions; likewise, the magisterial belief in the primacy of the Petrine See having been remade into the supremacy of Papal infallibility. In all candor, it is Newman who remains consistent, while the Church that has breached its historical deposit.Newman, except for these two important exceptions, shows how development of doctrine is not only consistent, but necessary, over time. To keep the Church static in one solitary interpretation or understanding is to deny the Church's variety of charisms. Perhaps more importantly, to deny an evolving and developing plethora of understandings is to stifle the Third Person of the Most Holy Trinity, which is the Person guiding and governing the Church since Pentecost, from expressing its kerygmatic and paraclitic mission.These exceptions set aside, this wonderful book can be profitably read by all Christians of all stripes to great personal and collegial benefit and enlightenment."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"Before I begin my review, allow me one caveat: the casual reader, to be sure, who stumbles upon this work after seeing it quoted in popular apologetics books (i.e. Keating's Catholicism and Fundamentalism), risks being in over his/her head completely. Such was the case with me about 3 and a half years ago when I was starting out my study of doctrine and history. For 3 years this book sat on my shelf, all attemts that I made to read it having failed because I lacked the proper foundation. It was only after I spent considerable time studying history and especially the ancient heresies that I was able to grasp what Newman was saying. The following example, taken from a passage found on pages 314-315, should demonstrate my point:\\"It is very observable that, ingenious as is their theory and sometimes perplexing to a disputant, the Monophysites never could shake themselves free of the Eutychians; and though they could draw intelligible lines on paper between the two doctrines, yet in fact by a hidden fatality their partisans were ever running into or forming alliance with the anathematized extreme. Thus Peter the Fuller the Theopaschite (Eutychian), is at one time in alliance with Peter the Stammerer, who advocated the Henoticon (which was Monophysite). The Acephali, though separating from the latter Peter for that advocacy, and accused by Leontius of being Gaianites (Eutychians), are considered by Facundus as Monophysites. Timothy the Cat, who is said to have agreed with Dioscorus and Peter the Stammerer, who signed the Henoticon, that is, with two Monophysite Patriarchs, is said nevertheless, according to Anastasius, to have maintained the extreme tenet, that \\"the Divinity is the sole nature of Christ.\\" Severus, according to Anastasius, symbolized with the Phantasiasts (Eutychians), yet he is more truly, according to Leontius, the chief doctor and leader of the Monophysites. And at one time there was an union, though temporary, between the Theodosians (Monophysites) and the Gaianites.\\"That being said...The premise of this book is to examine the developments of doctrine that have occured both within and without the Catholic Church since the earliest times. In the earlier part of the book, Newman spends considerable time discussing the methods used by the Anglican Divines to discern developments from corruptions, and shows how their methodology is flawed, and how in many cases they rejected things which had more early concensus than things they accepted.Other points he makes throughout the book is the treatment of the Catholic church by the various heretical sects and dissident groups. He shows how despite their disagreements with each other, they were usually united in opposition to the Catholic Church, using the same blasphemous phrases to describe her as the Reformers did and many Protestants continue to this day, while the latter group would generally accept the body accused of these things as orthodox in earlier times.After his rather long introduction, so to speak, Newman lays out his seven principles which will serve to distinguish developments from corruptions: 1. Preservation of Type, 2. Continuity of Principles, 3. Assimilative Power, 4. Logical Sequence, 5. Anticipation of its Future, 6. Conservative Action on its Past, and 7. Chronic Vigour. Newman then goes on to examine each of these in detail (though the first 4 are examined in far greater detail than the latter 3), showing how doctrinal developments in the Catholic Church throughout history, as well of those proposed by groups deemed heretical, have fared when these 7 principles are applied to them.The details of his agruments are covered well in other reviews, and indeed a thorough examination of them cannot be done justice here in my 1,000 word limit. Suffice to say that this book will be guaranteed to give the informed reader, be he symathetic or skeptical, something to ponder seriously, as this is indeed the most comprehensive work written on the subject of the development of doctrine."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"That might sound like an exaggeration but I am serious. There is no book in print that I am aware of that discusses this most crucial of areas in the Christian revelation with the degree of nuance and thoroughness then this work of John Henry Newman's does. One of the founders (and the soul) behind the Oxford Movement in England in the 1830's and early 1840's, Dr. Newman's research into Church history troubled him because he did not realize how far the Church of England had drifted in essence and principles from those of the early Church. Newman examines the different distinctions between the beliefs held by Catholics, the Eastern Churches, and Protestants and seeks to show through the records of history - both what they reveal and what they conceal - how to distinguish between &quot;developments&quot; of Revelation and &quot;corruptions.&quot; The major doctrines of the different Christian churches are looked at with an eye towards explaining how often what appears to be an &quot;addition&quot; to the Christian faith is but a development or a greater understanding in an explicit manner of what was held in earlier times implicitly. These are properly termed &quot;developments.&quot; Likewise, many beliefs that are taken as &quot;givens&quot; by Christians are shown to be anything but &quot;givens&quot; in terms of their relationship to the ancient Church or their profound absence from it in any form explicitly or implicitly (the latter are properly styled as &quot;corruptions of Revelation&quot;, &quot;inventions&quot;, or &quot;traditions of men&quot;). Undoubtedly the conclusions drawn will not make everyone happy of course. But then who said that the purpose of Truth was to conform itself to the individual whims of man? Rather, man must conform his views to that which is true. I firmly believe that this is the one book that every Christian honestly in search of the Truth should read and read again meditating upon its contents. A wonderful work by one of the most brilliant minds of the 19th century (or indeed any century) by a man who was as deeply spiritual as he was brilliant."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"There are many books, indeed series, which attempt to account for the development of the Early Church, and how things became settled over the centuries. There are far fewer people who have any sense of these things. Newman treats these issues with utmost seriousness, and challenges long-held beliefs, and inverts those who are upside down in their faith and practice. Newman's compedium knowledge of the early Church helps him to distill the plethora of works into an easy-to-read single volume. This is ONE of those rare books that every Christian should be required to read. The past is explained as a venture toward the future. Newman's style is at his usual best."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"The sainted Cardinal Newman's &quot;Essay&quot; is a masterpiece, one of the few books of it's kind. This work, which was undertaken by him while he was in the process of deciding to convert to Roman Catholicism, is based upon a simple premise - that the nature of the human intellect is to grasp the full implications of an idea or set of related ideas slowly, over time, by a process of development. Because of this, any set of formal doctrines held to by a body of believers will necessarily grow and *apparently* change over time, in just the same way that a human being gorws and changes over the span of a lifetime. However, just as the human being is physiologically and metaphysically identical with himself over the course of his life, so too will be the body of doctrine and the standards of practice given to the faithful, provided it is guarded from corruption by a teaching authority insured from error.N.B. - this is *not* the same thing as saying that revelation must be ongoing. The faith itself may be delivered once and for all, in it's entirety. What needs time to develop, and what can never be truly completed, is the systematic exposition of what that faith means, and why it is so rather than otherwise. For example, that there is a God is an article of the Creed that can be communicated once and adhered to forever. But why there should be a God, and only one rather than five or six, and why that God should have such attributes as He is said to possess - these matters are the doctrines that are historical and developmental, and each of them will in turn raise more questions that will need to be answered. Revelation is finished, but theology, the explanation of revelation, is a continuously growing enterprise.Newman's book does not stop at these abstract considerations, which, after all, could apply to any religion built on a alleged revelation. It proceeds to examine the specific points of controversy between Protestants and Catholics as to whether or not the Catholic faith or the Protestant faith is the authentic inheritor of the Apostlic community. Needless to say, it comes down on the side of Rome. The only real flaw in these detailed portions of the book is the lack of specific footnotes for the points Newman cites in the Fathers of the Church. The editions he used, or course, would be long out of print, but it would still be useful to know what portion of St. Basil's or St. Augustine's texts he was quoting from.If you are interested in the history of Christian dogma, orare looking for a highly erudite Catholic apologetic, this is a fine book to own."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":". . .of an outstanding work.This is it. This is the book which, upon its completion, convinced John Henry Newman that he needed to make his submission to the Catholic Church.This painstakingly researched book describes the historical process by which doctrine develops in the Church. It has, in the years since its publication, become the primary text for anyone wishing to study this subject, regardless of their denominational background.Unfortunately, the typical response to this book, by Christians of other denominations, is NOT to actually engage the specific points raised by Newman, but rather to attack Newman's person and character. This was true while Newman was alive, and remains true to this day. (The notable exception is Adolph von Harnak, who, while sharply disagreeing with Newman, actually did engage the concept of doctrinal development itself).An interesting historical note: The Catholic Church was, at first, not particularly sympathetic to this work, as it was not written in Latin, nor in the fashion of Catholic theological works of the day.This edition, with a forward by Ian Ker, is, for me, the preferred volume. Ker is noted world-wide as being a top Newman scholar - and his scholarship shows in this work."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"Cardinal Newman's piece remains the definitive work on the development of Christianity.

It is a must."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"This is the eighth (and final) edition of \\"An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine\\" by John Henry Cardinal Newman from 1878, which includes \\"various important alterations... in the arrangement of its separate parts, and some, not indeed in its matter, but in its text.\\" It was while the first edition of the work was in the process of being published in 1845 that Newman converted to Catholicism; \\"it was his intention and wish to have carried his Volume through the Press before deciding finally on this step. But when he had got some way in the printing, he recognized in himself a conviction of the truth of the conclusion to which the discussion leads, so clear as to supersede, further deliberation.\\"Newman's conversion was inevitable, as evidenced in the Introduction where he writes the lines chilling to any Christian not in communion with Rome:\\"History is not a creed or a catechism, it gives lessons rather than rules; still no one can mistake its general teaching in this matter, whether he accept it or stumble at it. Bold outlines and broad masses of colour rise out of the records of the past. They may be dim, they may be incomplete; but they are definite. And this one thing at least is certain; whatever history teaches, whatever it omits, whatever it exaggerates or extenuates, whatever it says and unsays, at least the Christianity of history is not Protestantism. If ever there were a safe truth, it is this.\\"He follows just a few sentences later with his oft-quoted aphorism: \\"To be deep in history is to cease to be a Protestant.\\"This work is divided into two parts and the first, \\"Doctrinal Developments Viewed in Themselves\\", takes up the first third of the book. Here, Newman looks at the question of development in and of itself: How do ideas develop? What kind of developments take place? Can we expect some kind of authority to referee these developments, and would that authority have to be infallible if we're dealing with Divine Revelation - and what form would that authority take?Newman backs up his answers to these questions with the historical record and, importantly, with holy writ:\\"the Kingdom of Heaven\\" is even compared to \\"a grain of mustard-seed... which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree\\" it \\"shooteth out great branches, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof... so is the kingdom of God... the seed should spring and grow up... for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself.\\"So how is true development discerned from heresy or innovation? The answer is the subject of Part 2, \\"Doctrinal Developments Viewed Relatively to Doctrinal Corruptions\\"; and wherein the first part is plodding by necessity of its establishing a proof, it is here in the second part where Newman excels as an exegete, an historian, and a writer. It's all the reader can do to keep up as he traces the bark of Peter through the secular currents and heresies which buffeted it from its inception. Historical fact, holy writ, and right reason are woven together in a fascinating depiction of the growth of Christianity using seven measures or \\"notes\\" of authenticity. True doctrinal development will:1. Preserve its Type2. show a Continuity of its Principles3. demonstrate Its Power of Assimilation4. have a Logical Sequence5. be able to Anticipate its Future6. Conserve its Past Actions7. all while exhibiting Chronic VigourMostly through the words of ante- and post- Nicene Fathers and the Heresiarchs that challenged them - or provided the grit that produced the pearl of great price, to view them another way - Newman builds a convincing case that the Catholic is indeed the Church Christ founded, and that Protestants have stripped it bare looking for a Church that never existed. I highly recommend this work to all Christians; it will confirm Catholics in their Faith, and raise some serious questions for Protestants and hopefully spur them to further investigation."},{"Title":"An essay on the development of Christian doctrine (The works of Cardinal Newman)","review":"Newman's \\"Essay\\" is an in depth attempt to justify - historically, theologically, and philosophically - his movement to Roman Catholicism. He converted shortly after this volume was published. This is not for easy beach reading - and the Victorian prose can at times be tortured and burdensome - but there's much, much here that warrants the effort. Newman's nutshell is his attempt to provide a rationale for the development of doctrines distinctive of Roman Catholicism that don't seem to have existed explicitly in the Early Church. Newman's thesis is that all doctrines that have developed (e.g. purgatory, the Papacy, a celibate priesthood, etc.) existed in implicit \\"seed\\" form early on as part of the apostolic tradition and only came to fruition in the face of controversy and heresy. (One could perhaps include the doctrines of Christology and the Trinity along with the Canon of Scripture).

It was his intention and wish to have carried this Volume through the Press before deciding finally on this step. But... he recognized in himself a conviction... so clear as to supersede further deliberation...

If ever there were a safe truth, it is this.\\" (Pg. 7) He states that the book is directed towards the difficulty that, \\"from the nature of the human mind, time is necessary for the full comprehension and perfection of great ideas... This may be called the Theory of Development of Doctrine.\\" (Pg. 29-30)He concludes that \\"We have no reason to suppose that there is so great a distinction of dispensation between ourselves and the first generation of Christians, as that they had a living infallible guidance, and we have not.\\" (Pg. 85) Later, he suggests that \\"the notion of development under infallible authority is not a ... less winning hypothesis... then the chance coincidence of events... or the working of Antichrist, to account for the rise of Christiantity and the formation of its theology.\\" (Pg. 92)He admits that in Church history there have been \\"Bishops against Bishops, Fathers against Fathers, Fathers against themselves,\\" but asks instead \\"whether... the Church herself, acting through Pope or Council... has ever contradicted her own enunciations.

This small community seems immune to crime occurring elsewhere in the world, particularly murder. However, when a pregnant 15-year-old girl (Tara Breckenridge) is found dead--stabbed to death, wrapped in a carpet and discarded in a Dumpster--, the entire island is shocked and eager to seek justice.The woman leading the investigation is 28-year-old Detective Ginger Earley. Her partner is 45-year-old Chief of Police Ruben Martinez, who later becomes Ginger's love interest. Their exploration of suspects and clues lasts for nearly five months, resulting in frequent criticism and forewarnings of losing their jobs. With this added pressure and very few leads, they settle on the most likely suspect: Mr. Jerry Frankel, Tara's 35-year-old high school history teacher. As soon as his identity is revealed, Mr. Frankel and his family are constantly harassed. His being Jewish also brings the worst out in people--and, gradually, a common display of racial and religious hatred emerges throughout the town, creating a very shocking and sad ending.I thought \\"An Isolated Incident\\" was a relatively good mystery and social commentary on intolerance. Most of the characters were described well, although occasionally a little too in-depth. The Puget Sound locale was also perfect, but then I'm biased since I live here. :) However, after reading nearly 500 pages, I thought there were too many unresolved issues in the book. I had to re-read the last couple pages to fully understand the how's and why's of Tara Breckenridge's murder. Although I had suspected the killer from the beginning (clue: his reputation was at stake), I expected more to be revealed about the murder than what was shown at the end. It was quite a let down.

Although one of the two or three greatest composers in the history of western music, Mozart was in no way an innovator. He worked entirely within existing forms. Yes, he took those forms to glorious new heights never before achieved, and he pushed at the edges on many occasions, but he never (or at least rarely) went a great distance beyond the boundaries of the forms extant in his day as he created masterpiece after masterpiece.I have limited my reading of fiction for several years to mysteries written by women, with female protagonists. I find such writings (on average) more interesting, less contaminated with testosterone-fed silliness, than the average mystery written by a male. And in Susan Sloan I felt I had found a new, higher standard of writing. An Isolated Incident was the first of her books I happened to pick up. The writing was superb, the characters complex and well-drawn and mostly quite likable, the suspense agonizing. I lost sleep for several nights, staying up much later than I should have stayed up, eager to see what would happen next. She was the best writer I had read in a several years (and I was reading a book every few nights). Finally, I stayed up VERY late in order to finish the book. And I was devastated.When I am looking for a mystery novel, whether at the local library or at a book store, I find it in a special section devoted to mystery novels. These books are NOT in the general fiction category, where one finds more \\"serious fiction.\\" People typically read mysteries for escape. When I want \\"serious fection,\\" I search in a different section of the library or bookstore. Most of us expect writers of mysteries to follow certain conventions, just as people listening to a classical concerto, whether by Mozart or Haydn or anyone else, expect the music to remain within certain boundaries. If a Mozart piano concerto were to have a final rondo that at the end sounded more like Stravinski than like a classical concerto, I would be shocked and outraged (even though I love Stravinski).I hope the parallel is clear. I was shocked and outraged by the \\"last movement\\" of this novel, even though the author signaled the ending (in part!) long before the final pages, and the question of \\"whodunnit\\" in the end was no surprise to me. But the final disposition of characters and of plot were beyond the pale of mystery writing, in my (obviously highly biased) opinion. I'm being vague in order to keep this review from containing a \\"spoiler.\\" But I will say that I was so disillusioned after finishing this book--a book that earlier had excited me because I thought I had found the best mystery writer I had read in ages--that I have essentially lost interest in reading mysteries, after having read hundreds of them over the past ten years or so.Ms. Sloan need not have strayed so far outside the bounds of conventional mysteries. She's such a good writer that she could have written a GREAT mystery with a more conventional ending, just as Mozart wrote great music without ever wandering outside the forms handed to him by his predecessors. I can only hypothesize that she decided to attempt a more \\"literary\\" ending, one more typical of \\"serious fiction,\\" because she felt that a conventional ending was too mundane. I only wish she had the sensibility of a Mozart, realizing that, with her talent, she could have remained firmly within the bounds of conventional endings and still have written a masterpiece of the mystery genre. Unfortunately, she wrote a book that is 90% masterpiece with an ending that is so jarring that I have actually been disillusioned with mysteries altogether. I've for the most part gone back to histories and biographies."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Opening line: Death came without warning.There's more than one kind of prejudice on idyllic Seward Island, just a commute by ferry from Seattle.

Why bring him up at all if he's going to be anonymous?Far more suspenseful to me was a character who didn't put a foot wrong but made me uneasy for some reason. Too perfect, maybe.

Civilized people who think they are doing the right thing, and turn out to be mob justice? Individuals who take the law into their own hands and are happy with the result? Maybe coming from a long line of policemen who believe in obeying the law and following the law no matter what, I found this novel especially disturbing. You cannot judge a person by their color, their creed, their religion, or their belief system. They must be judged by evidence alone. This book will stay with you for a long time. Well worth the read, irregardless of what some other reviewers said. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I just got done reading this book. It was a great suspense/mystery book at first. However, the characters were not well developed and the plots were never finished. The ending leaves the reader wondering \\"Why?\\" and \\"How?\\". I was very disappointed because when you spend your time reading a 470 page book, you expect it to actually be worthwhile at the end and actually come to a closure. Well, this one wasn't and didn't. I have never read any other of Susan Sloan's books, and I doubt I ever will. I am very disappointed to say the least."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"THe only good thing about this book is a little romance by the 2 main characters . The rest of the book is a bore ! Author goes into to much deatil about each persons jobs and at times there lives BORING . Then the ending as to who did the killing is not really clear , A currupt police station sends the wrong man to jail and he ends up getting killed . All in all the whole story is terrible . This is my first book by this author and will be for sure my last . Don't waste you hard earned money on the book ."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I really liked this book. I am an avid reader of mysteries and who-done-its. This book was one I couldn't wait to get to at the end of a long day. It was just downright interesting. Although I had the bad guy correctly pegged in about the middle of the book, it was still a good read. It probably helped that I live in the Great Pacific Northwest, making it all the more interesting. The characters were interesting and human. In one's own mind, the scenery was magnificent. I'm going to read Ms. Sloan's other book very soon."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"The surprise was not the killers's identity - I knew/suspected who the murderer was in this fine story right from the beginning, based on the description of the victim's feelings in the first chapter. (I'm not usually that good at figuring out solutions in mysteries, either).What was surprising was the way the story appeared to be a standard, well-written mystery - very straight-forward... until the last few chapters when the lives of the leading characters unraveled and changed drastically. Even though I was sure I knew who the killer was - the ending was so oblique and so dark that I was taken off-guard. In fact, my initial reaction was - &quot;Huh&quot;? I turned out the light - and started to go to sleep when the meaning hit me! Migod! I did NOT go to sleep right away - and books seldom affect me that way. After the shock wore off, I kept thinking - 'Yeah - but the DNA will tell the truth - won't it'...........?A mystery that makes you think &amp; feel? What's this??Reading this over, it looks like I've written a mystery right here, in my effort to not divulge too much - but hey - aren't reviews supposed to pique your interest?"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I was fortunate to discover this author! This book was a great read providing lots of suspense and a surprising ending that shocked me! Susan Sloan is not your average fiction writer. A must read-great entertainment!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This book is a well-written suspense. I thought I had the mystery figured out in the first two or three chapters and was reading to verify that I was correct. The author never once loses sight of making the reader believe that the police are on the right track, that the real killer has been released on a technicality, that the sniper has a good motive even though he is legally wrong. The identity of the killer is not revealed until the last paragraph -- but when the reader reviews the clues, the solution is airtight. I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I am a librarian in Brooklyn. One of my patrons has been nagging me for months to read this book, claiming that it is terrific. Boy, is she ever wrong! Although the book had possibilities, as it progressed, the writing deteriorated steadily. Sloan makes a mishmash of racism, police procedurals, small town gossip, an ambitious reporter and many other ingredients that are too muddled together. Instead of a crisp resolution, the book falls flat at the end. I knew who the murderer was, so there was little suspense there. Sloan should have fleshed out her characters and constructed a plot that was a little less busy and a little more put-together. The book was too long and it sagged after the middle. Sloan also hits the reader over the head with her message that we must be more tolerant and less small-minded in our relationships with those whom we perceive to be different from us. I do not recommend &quot;An Isolated Incident&quot; to readers who enjoy crisp writing and a sensible plot line. I was quite disappointed."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"A small town on an island off the coast near Seattle is a microcosm of races and religions, but is mainly populated by WASPs. When 15 year old Tara Breckinridge is murdered, the locals are quick to refute the possibility that it could have been done by one of their \\"own\\". The local police chief, Ruben Martinez, is expected to find the culprit without too much difficulty, but when the investigation is under way for 3 months without a result, he and Detective Ginger Earley come under severe criticism from the council and townspeople. The two have recently formed a romantic relationship and are working slowly but steadily through possible clues when Ginger is made aware that Taras' history teacher at the local high school, Jerry Frankel, was released from his prior teaching position after being accused, but not prosecuted, of a relationship with a teenaged girl. When the town learns that Frankel is being questioned, a wave of anti semitism sweeps through the community, with so called devout churchgoers writing hateful letters to the newspaper, and avowed, upright Christians letting their fears blind them to their own bigotry. I found this to be a frightening read as it shows just how quickly the veneer of normalcy can be stripped away, exposing human prejudices to be so near the surface, and how hatreds born out of fear and ignorance can take over a seemingly civilized community."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I have just finished \\"An Isolated Incident\\" and was thoroughly impressed by the author's work until about the last 50 pages...the book had captivated me right up until the end where Ms. Sloan not only did a terrible job of explaining what had happened, but basically just ended the book, there was no sense of completion. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good murder mystery but I would like to tell the next reader to be prepared for a bad ending!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"The author had good intentions, but needed a much lighter touch for this book. The premise of an isolated island community rocked by a shocking murder is very intriguing. Unfortunately, the author didn't bring any new ideas to the mix. The killer is obvious from the first few chapters, and the rest of the book is comprised largely of heavy-handed caricatures and anvil-dropping. I don't like books that talk down or preach to the reader, and this did plenty of both."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I read this book and thought I had an understanding of the characters. Then we get to the last quarter of the book and everything is completely unexpected except for the killer. I had that figured out in the beginning. I don't believe true suspense in mysteries is achieved by having characters in the end doing completely unexpected, out of character things."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"A very interesting story of a murder that happens in a small town and the consequences. The characters seemed very real, as did the community. I had a hunch of who the killer was and had to speed all the way to the last page to see if I was right! Wasn't a nail biter, but good all the same."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Not only a great thriller/mystery, but a chilling look at how insular a small community can become, looking at \\"us\\" and \\"them.\\" People can sneer and say that these sorts of things don't really happen, but I grew up in a town just like this and it is true - if someone with darker skin, or the \\"wrong\\" religion showed up, they were an outsider and not accepted and treated with suspicion. Ms. Sloan showed how difficult it was for the few sympathetic townsfolk to stand up for the \\"outsiders,\\" as well as to stand up against the popular view about whodunit.The book is so cleverly written that it is almost impossible to tell who the culprit is until it is revealed in the last paragraph - then the true depravity of the situation hits home and the book becomes horror, in essence. I loved it. I felt it was well-written, held together nicely and kept all the disparate elements going quite well. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This is another great Susan R. Sloan book! I loved it and the ending was a real shocker! I love twists and this one has a stunning one! Like all her books it is REALLY hard to put down so be sure you carve out the time to read it from cover to cover! GREAT!!!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I have read a lot of murder mysteries and legal thrillers and I really enjoyed this one. Unlike many that I have read,this story did not end with everything fixed and all of the questions answered. The characters were complex and didn't always do the right thing and there was no hero.I wasn't sure who had committed the murder, and the introduction of new characters, (with their own storylines), made it more difficult to figure out. I found it dificult to put the book down and read it in just a couple of days.The latent anti-semitism and the actions of the newspaper helped to create an atmosphere that, I believe, is all too real. The fear that the population of the island experienced reflected what tends to happen in real-life...people jump to conclusions and, when in a group, lose their sense of right and wrong.This book was an excellent read and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the genre."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I have ready many, many mysteries over the years and this novel is one of the best I have ever read! The twists and turns of the suspect, the bigotry that is as chilling to the bone as the murder itself. This book is provocative and stirring. The characters on this island are absolutely hateful! I look forward to reading &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;. Thank you Susan..."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"A first rate novel. The book shares many similarities with the author's first book (Guilt by Association): great literary style, a good, fast paced story, meticulous examination of a contemporary issue, three dimensional characters. Indeed, the book's major fault is that it does not quite live up to the standard set in \\"Guilt by Association,\\" but than no other book that I've read does so either."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"A young, innocent girl is viciously murdered on a small island in Puget Sound. This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism. The trouble is, the author practically gives away the identity of the murderer early on and then has to throw in many red herrings as a distraction. Finally, the conclusion is frustrating and sloppy, leaving this ready mighty disastisfied."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Two days after I finished this I thought -- hey, wait a minute, she never explained just how the anti-semite group just happened to have a knife with Tara's blood on it to conveniently plant in the teacher's car. They supposedly didn't know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon? Did anyone else pick up on that and if so, did she explain it anywhere?"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Having enjoyed the author's lst effort was looking forward to her 2nd book. Unfortunately AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, though it started out well and promised to thrill and mystify, became bogged down with lightweight writing, and slipshod police work. We have a community which is gradually revealed to contain a proportionate amount of bigotry in relation to its population. This could have been used to convey a strong message. The end was telegraphed three quarters of the way into the book. The small police force were impressed with their efforts to uncover the murderer when in fact, the Chief and his Detective were too engrossed in their romance to thoroughly check out their weak evidence. They had no hard evidence, and were unprofessional in their handling of the entire investigation. I became angry at the slurs and was left empty at the end as the incestful father who murdered his pregnant daughter was left free to molest his younger girl with no one to stop him...most of all his weak wife. The small townspeople went on with their shallow lives, with no hope of changing their narrow minds. A waste of time, reading this book, in my opinion."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Having enjoyed the author's lst effort was looking forward to her 2nd book.

It is not &quot;deep&quot; and is good for light reading . The characters are quite intresting although not much emotion is shown . It does give some insight to human behaviour and society's wrongful conduct . However the ending made me wonder if the author wanted to keep the option of a sequal . It could have ended more conclusively . I would recommend anyone intrested in murder mystries to read it ."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I agree with others who felt this book was a disappointment. The characters were shallow, the plot fragmented, the motivations stereotypical."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This book is written in a very captivating style. It kept my interest from the first page to the last. I wasn't exactly sure &quot;who done it&quot; until the last line of the last page. What a shocker! Excellent read."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"For days after finishing this book I found myself thinking about Ginger and hoping she was all right. I actually had to remind myself that she was just a character in a book. Susan R. Sloan is masterful. Her technique of occassional newspaper editorial comments was superb."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This was the first Sloan book I had read and I'm now currently reading &quot;Guilt by Association&quot;. This had to be one of the best books I'd ever layed my eyes on. I loved the way it had a twist of romance wound into the ropes of the story. I don't know how to describe it to you, but all I know is that you have to read it!!!! As well as &quot;Guilt by Association&quot; I'm only 13 and can't read my normal age books as I find them so boring!! I even read John Grisham!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"More than a murder mystery, it is a beautifully written commentary on the below the surface social and racial prejudices that exist in a close-knit community. Despite the gruesome crime, I did not find the novel itself disturbing as much as its ending. It disturbs me very much that there is no closure with regards to Ruben's and Ginger's relationship, the Frankel family, and with Mary Breckenridge. It is almost as if there should be a sequel so that we can know how it all plays out. However, even if there is no sequel, the novel's ending succeeds in shocking us into examing our own thoughts and behaviour, which is, I think, the author's intention all along."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I read &quot;Guilt By Association&quot; by Susan Sloan and loved it. I couldn't wait for her next novel. I was not disappointed in &quot;An Isolated Incident&quot; at all. I couldn't put it down. I loved the way she intertwined the conversations of the townspeople with the newspaper's take on the murder. Then she managed to tell us a little about each character's life. And all the while the reader is suspecting numerous people as the murderer. As with her first novel she managed to shock us even if we're not pleased with the ending. She did what she set out to do and that's to get us to thinking about what's going on in our communities and we don't really know what some of our RESPECTED neighbors are up to. Can't wait for her next novel.."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I thought this book was great. I read it in 2 days. I had a hard time putting it down. She did spend a lot of time going over every character's idenity but it didnt take away from the book. This was the first book I read by this author and I plan to buy her other book 'guilt by association'."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"AN ISOLATED INCIDENT starts with the murder of Tara Breckenridge, a gruesome attack on a young teenage girl who was beloved by all. The story takes place in a small town in the state of Washington, Seward Island. Nothing this horrible has ever happened on the island until now, and fingers are pointing. The townspeople begin to learn what fear is, not knowing anymore who to trust.There are a number of people who are targeted as suspects. Police chief Ruben Martinez is thorough, and with the help of his department, including a young cop named Ginger Earley, they proceed to eliminate the list of suspects.As the story progresses, we learn that there is more to this town than most want to admit. Ruben and Ginger encounter hatred among the towns people,and soon a teacher is accused of being the murderer. Is it all purely circumstantial evidence? Or did he truly kill her? And what were his motives? On the surface it did not even appear he could be the murderer. But even Ruben and Ginger were convinced that he was.The teacher is of jewish descent, and this makes the towns people happy,knowing that it wasn't &quot;one of them&quot; that committed this heinous crime. Racism rears it's ugly head as we see a bad side of the people of Seward Island as they wait eagerly to see the teacher pay for his supposed crime.There is also a romance going between Ruben and Ginger, which I found very sweet. It also showed the underlining hatred of minorities amongst the towns people, including by Ginger's own mother.I found the book fast paced and riveting. The reader may or may not be shocked to find out who the murderer really is. I found myself guessing til the very end."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I just finished Susan Sloan's An Isolated Incident I kept reading trying to find a coherant plot and character. The ending is unsettling, poorly written and unfocused. I will never read another Susan Sloan book. Ms Sloan uses unfair writing techniques to set up an improbable ending, and then she doesn't end it. She leaves too much up in the air. Jerry Frankel is the only sympathetic character in the book. Very unsatisfying read."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"At first I was unable to put this book down. The intriguing beginning piqued my interest, and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened. Sloan's style of writing is very skillful and her artistry is outstanding ... therefore, my question is, how come she began a book with such potential and promise and then proceeded to force on her readers such a disappointing ending? It's a shame, because the book had so much potential. Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness. Her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better. I only recommend this book if the reader stops after the first half; it's better to make up your own ending than accept the author's."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Until the ending of this book, I was sure that it was going to rate a 10. After finishing it, I can say that I do not remember being this disappointed in a books conclusion in my life. This book left me depressed, and wishing that I would have never read it. Certainly one does not have to tidy things up all the time but to purposely have people act out of character is unforgivable sin for an author. I very much cared for the individuals in this book and at the end felt very manipulated by the author. Do not read this book."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This book keeps you guessing until the very last sentence on the last page! However, it seems to jump around quite a bit. It was not as exciting as her first, &quot;Guilt by Association&quot; but as a rule, most books rarely are..."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I thought overall the book was good, and unlike everyone else I didn't have the killer pegged at all! I was actually quite surprised. I thought the book had a lot of loose ends and subplots that just fizzled out. The relationship between Ginger and Ruben was just left hanging, as was the relationship between Stacey and Danny. I thought the teenagers' vocabulary was unrealistic. Dialogue was NOT typical of high school kids; too formal and robotic. Never quite understood the whole Malcolm Purdy deal-- really unnecessary to this story, I think. I hear Ms. Sloan's first book is terrific though... think I'll read that one."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I always thought the idea behind successful fiction was suspension of disbelief, and I'm usually willing to make allowances and accept improbable plots or wooden characters if the writer makes me believe the story he/she is telling. In the case of Sloan's book, however, she has managed to mix an improbable plot and wooden characters together with a prose style that is, frankly, amateurish. I didn't buy it. Furthermore I wonder if she is really at all interested in spinning us a good yarn, or is there some sort of murky political agenda here? I can even accept agendas if they're presented well, I would even be inclined to sympathize with this one, if it's there. But it's all so over the top, and she leaves too many loose ends in the plot: the most glaring is why the teacher's car was seen at the murder site (she's managed to eliminate every similar car on the island, so it must have been his). Maybe Sloan should try another line of work."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I enjoyed this book even though the characters are pretty much idiots -- BUT what in the world was with that ending??? WHAT happens with Ruben and Ginger? WHAT happens to the other Breckenridge daughter? WHAT happens with Stacy and Danny? WHAT happens with the anti-Semite group? Good grief woman! If you are going to have that many sub-plots going on in the book it's gonna have to be a LOT longer. I think the book would have benefitted from having one-half of the characters drawn twice as richly. It's frustrating to read through 470 pages and then be left feeling as if the last 100 pages of your book were ripped out! Will there be a sequel? I sure hope so or else we'll never really find out how the story ended."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Guilt by associaton is my favourite book and I eagerly anticipated Sloan's next book. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. A good read all the same."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"A great read. I'm not big on novels, but found I could not put this book down and was looking forward to my read each day on the way home from work.Only complaints - a few ends not tied up properly, end just ended, Ruben and Ginger's relationship quite weak.A good read, well recommended !"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I agree with others who felt this book was a disappointment. The characters were shallow, the plot fragmented, the motivations stereotypical."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"The book was great, the first I've read by this author. Plot was suspenseful and gripping. One problem. Sloan introduces policewoman Ginger. Describing her in a way we think she's going to play the hero. A smart, quick woman. Not so. Turns out sloan makes her dim-witted. For a policewoman, she jumps to conclusions, fails to follow up, and bases 'facts' upon rumors. It's disappointing to see a woman portrayed this way. Also that Ginger has a gun drawn when making an arrest without any apparent threat. Not realistic. If you can get past the bad character of Ginger ( and the letdown of one of the leading woman characters being an idiot) then the book is very entertaining."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I enjoyed this read a ton, and aside from the ending, I thought the plotlines and characters were very well written. The reader got a feel for the Pacific Northwest. It seems like the kind of book Hollywood would drool for"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This is an TRULY EXCELLENT novel. I literally could not put this book down! Generally, I never read a book that does not have either the Literary Guild or the Book-of-the Month Main Selection designation. I read &quot;An Isolated Incident&quot; because Susan Sloan's 1st novel was so GOOD. Why this second novel did not get the LITERARY GUILD designation is beyond me. This novel should have been on the NATIONAL BESTSELLER LIST for at least 6 months! Perhaps the publishers marketing of this book was at fault. Sometimes the cover itself is the only reason a book doesn't make it to the list. Can't wait for her 3rd novel!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I admit I got this book because of the customer comments made about it. Readers either loved it or hated it, nothing in between, and I wanted to find out for myself. Well, now I have, and it's a superb book, full of rich, wonderful characters, with a story that will keep you involved to the very last page. Does it have a sappy live-happily-ever-after ending? No. It has an all-to-real-life ending, which is much more valid. In fact, now that I reflect, it couldn't have ended any other way. But the best part of the book is its depth, its intricate layer upon layer, that makes you think about what Sloan is really saying. I wish I'd written this. I'm getting her other book today."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"The good parts:1) The first 2/3s of the book keep you turning the pages.2) Sweet romance between two main characters.3) Most of the characters are neither all bad or all good.The bad parts.1) You never have any doubt that the main suspect didn't do it.2) The second suspect seems very unlikely, but at 3/4s of the way thru the book, you know it's too late to introduce a new suspect. The best mysteries are those where the guilty party is right before your eyes the whole time, and at the end you want to slap yourself for not seeing how he or she could really only be \\"the one.\\"3) While the guilty party in this novel is a possible suspect right from the start, you know very very little about him.4) While anti-semitism is a worthy topic to explore, the author paints all the Christians on the island with a very broad brush. There are no sympathetic openly Christian characters. I've lived among Christians all my life and I know most of their genuine faults. With the exception of extremists (and every group has them) the majority of Christians don't tend to have negative feelings about Jews or Israel. If anything, they tend to view Jewish worshipers as allies and they can sometimes be accused of blindly defending everything about the state of Israel. I simply couldn't buy the \\"all Christians are Jew haters\\" theme that filled the last 1/3 of this flawed book.Bottom line. There's better stuff out there. Thumbs down."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I have been a lover of mysteries for a long time and this one is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to favourites! Only a highly skilled author with a keen sense of detail could create a story such as this one. A terrible crime with several suspects and it all weaves together briliantly at the end for not just one, but several stunning surprises. A must read for any suspense lover."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"IT WAS A GREAT BOOK BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT. IS THE FIRST BOOK I READ FOM THIS AUTHOR AND I'M WILLING TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. THE END LEFT ME A SOUR SENSATION OF NOT KNOWING PEOPLE THE WAY THEY REALLY ARE.

IS A TWO THUMPS UP!"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I have read the other reviews and while I see there were loose ends, etc, I do think it was a great vacation book, unexpectedly picked up from the library and enjoyed. I will look for her first book."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Captivating throughout. Though in the end, I wasn't shocked by who did it--I had figured it out almost from the beginning. Good twists and turns. I was made to think twice more than once! The characters were well-developed and &quot;real.&quot; This is movie material to me! Hmmm...Jimmy Smits as the Chief of Police? Kyra Sedgewick as our heroine? I recommend the book. Great beach book."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Though I agree the writing at times was a little elementary, the story was disturbing to me, not just because of the theme of child molestation/murder but also because of the racism aspect. I am a non-white person living in a small community in the Northwest (about 2 hours from Seattle) with very little crime. While I have never experienced blatant racism, I have encountered some innocent/ignorant comments from people who were not hatefull; I'm assuming they were just not very culturally aware, so I can relate to many of the situations/feelings in the book. This is not a story with a happy ending; rather, it was sad (police chief and detective's relationship) as well as disturbing (altering crime evidence, guilt by association, hidden racial and militia agendas). It would seem to be a book to spark discussion groups on these multiple themes. I will read the author's first novel."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I had already read Guilt by Association, but found this much more riveting. Unfortunately, I could well imagine the 'set-up' happening in the type of community described and it held my interest to the very last line."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Susan Sloan has done a great job exploring the impact of a murder on a small, fairly isolated community. She tells her story from several different angles, and explores racism in the process. I was only slightly disappointed in the ending- the read along the way more than made up for a fairly pat solution. I will read her first book."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Sloan is not a lawyer and needs to get her facts straight, starting with real life. This book keeps you guessing until the end which wasn't pleasant."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This is an involving book that kept me guessing up to the last page. Good writing, twisty plot, believable characters, secrets in the past &amp; present and social issues combine to make this an intelligent, well-written mystery."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"This is a nice murder mystrey. Its possible to guess the murderer, maybe at the start, maybe half way. The characters are pretty well developed. But as most of the reviewers have said, a lot of stuff is left hanging. Though I think the Stacy - Leo angle is covered when he asks her dad for permission to continue dating. Ginger - Ruben is left a little hanging. U really feel pity for Mathew Frankel and Deborah. Regarding the suspense, the author should have been a lil more outgoing and explained the whys and hows at the end. Definitely 4 stars untill the end. All in all, i think...an interesting script for Manoj Night Shyamalan....?"},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Is there to be a sequel to this book? It seems to be left unfinished. I would have liked to know if Rubin forgave Ginger and they married. It's hard to believe such a dedicated cop would do wrong. What happened to Rubin's daughter Stacey and Danny the boy she dated? The ending left a lot of unanswered questions."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"While the author has a fine ability to describe the setting and an interesting array of characters, I knew the murderer very early in this book--and I rarely can do that. Also a main character acts out-of-character two-thirds of the way through which distorts the plot. But my biggest disappointment was with the ending. This is not a mystery to solve but a drama of prejudice and racism, and I found the ending left a bitter taste. I live in the Pacific Northwest and to characterize it with such unrelenting--and unresolved--bigotry is unfair and untrue. Such a shame that an author feels readers want that kind of book."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I had guessed who the murderer was after about the first couple chapters but kept reading thinking there had to be a twist - which never came."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"An enjoyable book...The first half is engrossing and suspensful..good character development between Reuben and Ginger...The last 100 pages were a let down...Ending was predictable."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"I feel that its my civil duty to warn people not to waste their hard earned money and precious time reading this book. I bought this book based upon the author's name. I LOVED her first novel, and thought this would be along the mystery, emotion and suspense would be of the same level. Instead, I found myself half-way through the novel wondering if I should discard it, or hope for the best. It takes forever to start, the characters, once developed are so flawed and unlikable that it simply turns to a disappointment. The &quot;good&quot; guys turn into a new form of &quot;bad&quot;. BTW, this is a murder mystery, and when she finally gets to wrapping it up, the ending and the motive for the murder are swept under the carpet. You are more then welcome to try to get through this horrid novel, but again, I highly recommend spending your time and money on either her first novel, or something new altogether."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"Thought I reviewed this a month ago but do not see it. Sloan disappointed me with this effort. I agree with those who criticized An Isolated Incident and wonder about those gave it a rave. There were too many ill-defined characters, too much hatred and angst which was never resolved and a police force which made Barney Fife look like a genius. Don't waste time on this turkey."},{"Title":"An Isolated Incident","review":"WOW! What a follow-up to GUILT BY ASSOCIATION. You won't be able to put this one down. I didn't think Sloan could get any better, but she did. She has an incredible knack of tackling tough social issues and forcing the reader to think about what they really mean, while at the same time weaving compelling, page-turning stories. I can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"I continue to work my way thru the series.... so far they are all very good and I would recommend them.... start at the beginning... it's fun.."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"The sewers of Victorian London hide many secrets. That of a murderer, though, refuses to stay hidden. Inspector Thomas Pitt is called to investigate the death of a young man whose naked body is found beneath the infamous Bluegate Fields district, and the case begins with a prompt identification by the youth's father. It proves puzzling, though; because the victim was drowned in bath water, not in the river. How did that happen to an upper class boy like this one?The investigation soon centers on the young man's tutor, which suits the family by wrapping things up quickly and by making it plain to Society that their son was the innocent target of a pervert. The tutor's conviction brings Pitt no satisfaction, though. The inspector soon realizes that he may have arrested the wrong man; and so does Pitt's wife, Charlotte, who was born into Society and who married far beneath her when she chose Pitt as her husband.As usual, Anne Perry depicts Victorian London with gritty reality and her characters with a fine sense of human nature at both its worst and its best. This absorbing mystery is marred only by a conclusion that left me feeling disappointed because the author told me what happened to the (perhaps) falsely convicted tutor without making me believe that outcome was possible. Otherwise, though, a real page turner.--Reviewed by Nina M.

I really like Anne Perry books BUT the annoying comments by the upper class characters are off-putting. I couldn't finish the book! I got so annoyed at the comments like: \\"I told it to the other policeman.\\" (What is Pitt supposed to do, run down the \\"other policeman\\" and get his comments?The upper class is so full of themselves. Why can't they just answer the questions and let Pitt get on with it? No, they must state (over and over) \\"I can't see how I can possibly help you.\\" or \\"My man servant has told you all he knows.\\" or \\"No, you cannot speak to my wife. She is too delicate.\\"Poppycock! I'd like to see Pitt tell these people: \\"This is a police matter, a murder investigation, and we can talk here or at the station!\\" Just once I'd like to see these upper crust cretins get their comeuppance.At least Pitt won't go to the servant's entrance. I'll give him that."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"This book is one of the best in the Pitt series. It is a page turner and kept me entralled to the very last page. I highly recommend reading this book and the Pitt series. I am reading them in order."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"Good Victorian London atmosphere, and I enjoyed the team of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. But when the boy killed was determined to have come from the upper classes, too have died following an upper class dinner and bath it didn't make sense that they were so eager to pin the murder on a working class tutor and a lower class prostitute. I didn't enjoy the rresolution of the plot."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"Perry approaches an interesting investigation for even todays standards, not to mention how it must of been in the Victorian era. I applaud Perry for addressing the subject and the depraved way people can use other people, and what people will/have to do for money. Perry obviously feels very deeply about the abuse of children. Unfortunaltely this is something that could happen in the Victorian times as well as now.It isn't always hard to figure out \\"whodunit\\" in Perry's mysteries, however she still weaves an intriguing tale.I was confused on whether this was Perry's 5th or 6th novel in the Pitt series, but I read it as the 5th.I appreciate Perry's descriptions of the surroundings of her subjects, I am able to visulize it, feel either the warmth of the fire, or the coldness of the weather."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"Bluegate Fields has an unusual story structure. There are two investigations for one mystery. That device makes what would otherwise be a pretty boring book more interesting.The book's other major attribute is found in its subject, investigating child molestation among the Victorians, something that would have been kept well hidden at the time. Ms. Perry does a nice job of imagining how such an investigation might have proceeded.The book gets off to a fine start with its opening scene, but the action slows down into too many drawing room scenes from there. Pitt seems unusually thick in this novel which causes the story to not work quite as well as it might have.I also don't enjoy reading about people covering up child molestation so part of the subject itself was fairly repulsive to me.But if you have liked the other books in the series before this one, you probably will enjoy this one somewhat. But you can skip it without missing anything important. The choice is yours. I leave your decision up to your good taste."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"This is the second book I have read by Anne Perry, the first was Farrier's Lane. They are both very good! I have only read the first chapter in this book, and already I am engrosed in the book! It is amazing. If you have never read a book by Anne Perry, you have to! The books she writes will leave you on edge until the end, and she still leaves you thinking about it even after the book is finished!"},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"This is the sixth novel in the series and Inspector Pitt has to deal with the naked body of a young gentleman found in the sewers in a very bad part of town. The trail leads him into a web of deceit involving homosexual prostitution -- quite a different matter among Society than the usual sort of prostitution -- and accusations leveled against the tutor of the deceased, who is tried and condemned to hang. With Charlotte's help in the drawing rooms, Pitt must try to sort out who did what to whom and then overcome the protectiveness of the families involved in order to prove it. As with the others in this series, Perry has a good deal to say about life in Victorian London away from the realm of polite society."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"Perry's novel shows her at her best and at her worst. Her strengths are in character development, historical background, and social milieu. Her treatment of the London slum areas and the interface between extreme poverty and extreme wealth are top notch. But for all of her considerable strengths, she displays what I feel may be a characteristic weakness in the novel's ending. The ending -- with its quickness and lack of development and lack of integration into the novel as a whole -- seems tacked on, seems an after thought."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"This is the first Thomas Pitt Novel I've read. The plot outline is covered well in the other reviews. While the story is interesting, I thought it was rather predictable. There was only one twist that caught me by surprise. Compared to the rest of the book the end comes entirely too quick and with little thought. I got the impression the author was tired of writing and just wanted to be done with it. I am by no means a legal expert, especially of the Victorian system, but there are major shortfalls in the legal aspects the book. These oversights make the plot work but would have never happened. Using the \\"real\\" evidence for the first trial as a gauge, by the same measure there was more than enough later evidence to take to a judge and get it overturned. It is just inconsistent. The emotional state of some of the characters is a bit overplayed, sometimes to the point of distraction. If the police chief, Athelstan, was really that excitable, he would have had a heart attack years before attaining that office. On the other hand, it was an excellent portrayal of the young man's (name with held to preserve the mystery) realization of what every one had been talking about, and what he had done. There is no date given for the setting, but there are still a few anachronisms including the lack of use of the terms sodomite and carnal knowledge. I still recommend the book as an easy read, but will not be keeping a copy in my library. Unlike other reviewers I finished the book before writing a review."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much, much higher."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"The darkest of the Pitt mystery series, Bluegate Fields is Anne Perry's sixth mystery in the Thomas Pitt series, and named for one of the worst slums in nineteenth-century London.The naked body of a sixteen year old boy is found in a channel of the sewers, drowned, defiled, and in the first stages of syphilis. Judging by his smooth skin and the contents of his stomach, he is from a moneyed family. Evidence suggests he was drowned elsewhere. When Pitt is called in to solve the crime, the victim's family does not cooperate, but rather sabotages the inspector's initial attempts to investigate. Pitt's wife, Charlotte, turns to her brother-in-law, and, later, to her sister, Emily and Great-Aunt Vespasia Cumming-Gould in order to help with the later stages of Thomas's investigation, which, after twists and turns, and at the last minute discovers the perpetrator. In the process, Ms. Perry gives the reader a dark glimpse of Victorian society, its repressions, its stuffiness, its hypocrisy and the blindness at its heart.The plot is dark, finely wrought, the characters richly drawn and from all classes, the historic detail, meticulously researched. Few readers will wince at the subject matter, but all Perry mystery lovers will find the book very difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"I've been reading the Anne Perry novels of Thomas Pitt from the beginning, and loved them. Ms. Perry has a gift for characterization and cliff-hanging plots, and occasionally a bit of description that has me flagging it as an example of really wonderful writing. This novel is no exception. However, I am rather disappointed in her confusion of homosexuality with pedophelia. The two are quite different, and I find the homophobic attitude quite disturbing. Nevertheless, I will continue with the next in the series, in hopes that she abandons her blatant display of this particular bigotry. I really hope this is the last of it; I really love her stories otherwise."},{"Title":"Bluegate Fields","review":"According to the list in the book, this book (copyright 1984) is the fifth in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. And it's the best so far. BLUEGATE FIELDS is complex in both plot and characterization, with distasteful subjects reminiscent of a \\"Law & Order: SVU\\" episode. Set in Victorian London at the time when telephones were just beginning to show up in some of the \\"better\\" homes, it presents a very strong sense of place and time. The character of Pitt becomes much more filled-out. I liked the way he and Charlotte worked together this time. The plot has tentacles. Hard to put down!

The book tells you when everything was released, what year, who did what, etc. But it lacks any human warmth, and there are really no warm stories of the original creators sitting together and working on GI Joe. Sadly, most of the GI Joe books totally ignore the human factor, aside from giving credit to the names of the people who designed, invented, patented, painted, funded, etc. The book is great for photos, and lots of interesting information.

He is fighting the White Tiger (not putting a collar on him for tracking), exploring the ends of the earth, capturing the Intruders, and generally having a great time being Joe.

From start to finish you'll fall in love with the characters and town...enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Nice book. But in this edition, there is no chapter title on each page, so it's a little difficult to track the chapters."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"There is at least one author who may remind you of Stephen Leacock, namely Garrison Keillor of Lake Wobegon fame, but Leacock should be recognized as the ultimate master of quaint, bucolic humor. Leacock, who died in 1944, became arguably the most prominent Canadian humorist of his day (and probably of all time). What is ironic about that claim is that Leacock worked for most of his life as a professor of economics. We do not usually equate economics with humor, preferring to think of that profession as one of bow ties and supply and demand charts. Throw that presumption out the window and pick up a copy of \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town,\\" Leacock's best known work available through the New Canadian Library series.For me, one of the funniest sections of the book was the introduction written by Leacock, where he gives you some background about himself and his profession. This short piece of writing quickly gives you an idea of the type of humor you will find in the actual sketches: a very sly, very quiet and clever type of humor that often takes a while to sink in. Leacock does not rely on rim shot jokes or manic posturing in his writings. Instead, he creates the fictional Canadian town of Mariposa and populates it with small town archetypes that are wonders to behold.All of the characters are hilarious in their own way: Mr. Smith, the proprietor of the local hotel and bar, full of schemes to earn money while trying to get his liquor license back. Then there is Jefferson Thorpe, the barber involved in financial schemes that may put him on the level of the Morgans and the Rockefellers. The Reverend Mr. Drone presides over the local Church of England in Mariposa, a man who reads Greek as easy as can be but laments his lack of knowledge about logarithms and balancing the financial books of the church. Peter Pupkin, the teller at the local bank, has a secret he wants no one to know about, but which eventually comes out while he is courting the daughter of the town judge. All of these characters, and several others, interact throughout the sketches.Leacock has the ability to turn a story, to make it take a crazy, unexpected twist even when you are looking for such a maneuver. That he accomplishes this in stories that rarely run longer than twenty pages is certainly a sign of great talent. By the time you reach the end of the book, you know these people as though you lived in the town yourself, and you know what makes them tick.Despite all of the crazy antics in Mariposa, Leacock never lets the reader lose sight of the fact that these are basically good people living good lives. There seems to be a lot of feeling for the citizens of Mariposa on the part of Leacock, which comes to a head in the final sketch in the collection, \\"L'Envoi. The Train to Mariposa,\\" where he recounts traveling back to the town after being away for years, with all of the attendant emotions that brings as recognizable landmarks come into view and the traveler realizes that his little town is the same as when he left it years before.I suspect there is a historical importance to \\"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town.\\" These writings first appeared in 1912, a time when many people living in the bigger Canadian cities still remembered life in a small town. In addition to the humorous aspects of the book, the author includes many descriptive passages concerning the atmosphere and layout of Mariposa, something instantly recognizable to anyone who grew up in such a place. Nostalgia for the simpler life of the small town probably played a significant role in the book's success.I look forward to reading more Stephen Leacock. While much of the humor in the book is not belly laugh funny, it does provide one with a deep satisfaction of reading clever humor from an author who knows how to tickle the funny bone. You do not need to be Canadian to enjoy this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Perhaps the finest comment about Stephen Leacock in the last half century is that &quot;he is aWill Rogers for the 90's.&quot;Rogers, of course, is one of the most beloved of American humorists -- he was killed in1935 when his plane crashed near Point Barrow, Alaska. Leacock died on March 28, 1944.Like Rogers, he had been Canada's favorite humorist for decades.Sunshine Sketches is about Orillia, Ontario, Canada, where Leacock had his summer homeon Brewery Bay (he once wrote, &quot;I have known that name, the old Brewery Bay, to makepeople feel thirsty by correspondence as far away as Nevada.&quot;) His home is now maintainedas a historic site by the town of Orillia. I lived there for almost 30 years, and the people of Orillia are still much the same as Leacock portrayed them in 1912.These stories about various personalities in town were printed in the local newspaper in the1910 - 1912 era, before being compiled into this book which established Leacock's literaryfame. The people portrayed really lived, though some are composites; the events are of akindly humorist looking at the foibles of small town life. Once they came out in book formand soared to national popularity, everyone in town figured the rest of the country waslaughing at them because of Leacock's book and he was royally hated in Orillia to the endof his life.Gradually, and this took decades, Orillians came to recognize that genius had walkedamongst them for several decades. (It's hard to recognize genius when your own ego is soinflated.) Orillia now awards the annual &quot;Leacock Medal for Humor&quot; -- Canada's top literaryprize for the best book of humour for the preceding year.Leacock died when I was six, but I did know his son, who still lived in town. I deliveredpapers to the editor of the &quot;Newspacket,&quot; Leacock's name for the Orillia Packet and Times(where I worked) and the rival Newsletter. The Packet had the same editor in the 1940's aswhen Leacock wrote about him in 1910.But the book is more than Orillia; it is a wonderfully kind and humorous description of life inmany small towns. The American artist Norman Rockwell painted the same kinds of scenes;it is the type of idyllic urban life so many of us keep longing to find again in our hecticurban world.Leacock realized the book was universal in its description of small towns, and in the prefacehe wrote &quot;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty ofthem. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same squarestreets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels, and everywhere thesunshine of the land of hope.&quot;True enough, which gives this book continuing appeal nearly a century after it was written.All great writing is about topics you know, and as a longtime resident Leacock knew Orilliawell. As for Leacock himself, he wrote, &quot;I was born at Swanmoor, Hants., England, on Dec.30, 1869. I am not aware that there was any particular conjunction of the planets at thetime, but should think it extremely likely.&quot;He says of his education, &quot;I survived until I took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in1903. The meaning of this degree is that the recipient of instruction is examined for the lasttime in his life, and is pronounced completely full. After this, no new ideas can be impartedto him.&quot;In reviewing Charles Dickens' works in 1934, Leacock wrote what could well be his ownepitaph: &quot;Transitory popularity is not proof of genius. But permanent popularity is.&quot; The facthis writings are still current illustrates the nature of his writing.In contrast to the sometimes sardonic humor of modern times, Sunshine Sketches reflectsLeacock's idea that &quot;the essence of humor is human kindness.&quot; Or, in the same vein, &quot;Humormay be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life, and the artisticexpression thereof.&quot;Granted, this book is not what he recognized to have widespread appeal to modern readers.In his own words, &quot;There are only two subjects that appeal nowadays to the general public,murder and sex; and, for people of culture, sex-murder.&quot; Yet, anyone reading this willremember scenes from it for much longer than anything from a murder mystery.In today's world, where newspapers almost daily track Prime Minister Tony Blair's dash tothe political right, Leacock wrote, &quot;Socialism won't work except in Heaven where they don'tneed it and in Hell where they already have it.&quot;He described his own home as follows, &quot;I have a large country house -- a sort of farmwhich I carry on as a hobby . . . . Ten years ago the deficit on my farm was about ahundred dollars; but by well-designed capital expenditure and by greater attention todetails, I have got it into the thousands.&quot; Sounds familiar to today's farm policies ?It's what I mean by this being a timeless work.Leacock himself noted, when talking about good literature, &quot;Personally, I would sooner havewritten 'Alice in Wonderland' than the whole of the 'Encyclopedia Britannica'.&quot; This is his'Alice' and it well deserves to be favorably compared to Lewis Carroll's work.By all measures, it is still the finest Canadian book ever written."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"no hype. i couldn't stop laughing as i was reading this. and i mean laughing out loud. in a cafe. with everyone staring at me. but i didn't care. and i couldn't help it if i did. it's just too hilarious."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"This 1912 work uses sketches about the residents of a small Ontario lake town. The tone is mock-boosterish, giving rise to some sly comic moments. This is a wonderful parody of that can-do mentality that seems to infect us in North America.

This is a must read."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Leacock's observations about people and community are devastatingly accurate and wonderfully recognizeable. The narrator captures the posturings and cozy delusions of small town life with the deadpan wit and irony of a Will Rogers for the nineties.

Sunshine Sketches easily exceeded such expectations. I was amazed with what skill Stephen Leacock could satirize the yokels & penny-ante frauds of his small, fictitious town, Mariposa - & yet, not generate a backlash, a reader's resentment that here was another cheap-shot artist (i.e., Jon Stewart of the Daily Show), shooting fish in a barrel.How could someone who had to make ends meet studying & teaching the principles of economics - a subject that will almost inevitably ruin any writer's creativity & wit - manage to write such wonderful comedy?A warning to those who haven't read SSLT yet - up until the chapter, \\"The Ministrations of The Rev. Mr. Drone,\\" it's smooth sailing - all low-key fun without the author touching upon the dark side of life's frustrations & tribulations.Rural Dean Drone of the \\"Church of England Church\\" then becomes the focus of the narrative, & it wasn't long before I was apprehensive that this was it - this suddenly gloomy, dour & pessimistic man's story has hijacked the book. \\"How long will this depressing drivel continue?!\\"Not for long. The detour was necessary in order to induce a sense of depression, so to speak, in order for the later renaissance of laughter to have a truer, better foundation. So if you start feeling as if you've unwillingly stumbled into F. Scott Fitzgerald's foreshadowing of eventual, gruesome tragedy, relax. Leacock knew what he was doing. All along."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"Leacock wrote in the introduction that Mariposa represented seventy or eighty different towns throughout Canada. The residents were composite characters of people he knew. Leacock did a great job of making the town seem alive. I wished I were there for the picnics, the cruises on the lake and the poker games. The plots of vignettes were good. The writing was too cute sometimes. His classical references were over my public school education at times. The characters were drawn fairly well. What the author did very well was the throw away descriptions of the characters. He would almost insult the characters he was describing in such endearing terms that I immediately felt drawn to the character.Leacock was amazing talent. The book wasn't deep, but it was a fun, enjoyable ride down memory lane."},{"Title":"Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town","review":"This is funnier when I think back on it than when I was actually reading it.

A slice of history told in the western storytelling way. Great stuff!The part I did not like at all was the forward by Jon T. Coleman. He tries to belittle the author. Why Bison books included this forward is beyond my comprehension. Would Barrack Obama write an autobiography and include a forward by Newt Gingrich?"},{"Title":"One heartbeat away;: Presidential disability and succession,","review":"Few living Americans can claim credit for the Constitution in the way that Birch Bayh can. Bayh, then a first-term senator from Indiana, chaired the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments at the time of President Kennedy's assassination. Vice President Johnson's succession to the Presidency left a vacancy in the vice presidency--a situation that had occurred after the other seven vice-presidential successions, but that was suddenly far less acceptable in the nuclear era, with a Cold War on. The crisis was exacerbated because the next two successors in line for the Presidency were 71-year-old House Speaker John McCormack and 86-year-old Senate President pro tem Carl Hayden, who had been chosen for reasons other than their fitness as Presidential successors.The crisis was solved (up to a point, at least) by the twenty-fifth amendment, which was proposed in 1965 and ratified in 1967. &quot;One Heartbeat Away&quot; tells the story of the amendment's drafting, proposal, and ratification, which Senator Bayh presided over and shepherded. This book offers a rare insight, practically unique in modern times, into successfully resolving a structural dilemma of modern government by means of amending the Constitution. Presidents Eisenhower and Johnson, who were both very engaged in the issues and the process, contributed prefaces.If you are interested in the twenty-fifth amendment and its legislative history, I also recommend &quot;The 25th Amendment&quot; by John D. Feerick. If you are interested in Presidential succession and disability generally, I recommend &quot;Presidential Succession&quot; by Ruth C. Silva and &quot;From Failing Hands&quot; by John D. Feerick."},{"Title":"One heartbeat away;: Presidential disability and succession,","review":"Birch Bayh's account of the 25th amendment offers two valuable civics lessons: 1. The shortcomings of existing presidential succession law. 2. How a bill becomes a law, or in this case, a Constitutional amendment.The nation's presidential succession laws still have plenty of shortcomings, but Senator Birch Bayh helped solve many of them when he shepherded the 25th amendment to passage. The amendment acknowledged modern threats by ensuring a mechanism exists to avoid having a disabled president as commander-in-chief, as existed under Woodrow Wilson and James Garfield. It also lessens the chance that the presidential succession statute ever being needed. The current 1947 law provides for the Speaker of the House, Senate President Pro Tempore, and Cabinet members to succeed to the presidency if there is a dual vacancy (no president or vice president). The 25th amendment's vice presidential succession provisions, twice used already, make that unlikely to occur.The book also tells a lot about how a bill becomes a law. Reading it forty years after its release, I felt a sense of loss. Although not perfect, there was a great degree of deliberation, bipartisanship, and progress associated with this amendment that seems missing from Washington today. It was not all sunshine and roses. Birch Bayh's testimony before a House committee will bring knowing sighs by anyone who has seen that body attempt to legislate. But overall, there was thought, compromise, and ultimate success. Nowadays, it seems like problems are not solved until they are crises. Thankfully, the issues Bayh tackled were not crises when they were solved. One reason my view may be so nice is the complete lack of any lobbyist interest in the issue. The only interested outside party was the American Bar Association, and their input was constructive and not self serving.Overall, a great book on the topic of presidential succession and our legislative process."},{"Title":"Rolling in dough","review":"Rolling In Dough may seem a flippant title for a book about an art as rewarding and historic as bread making. However, this title describes the activity so accurately. It portrays a feeling of great enjoyment, creativity and relaxation.Many books about bread baking have been written. This one is unique because I have compiled and listed the recipes in four distinct categories: Basic, International, United States Regional and Eggless.The Basic breads include those recipes that are more easily prepared. The International breads are a bit more complicated, but I have tried to simplify many of the procedures and techniques. (I have been most fortunate in acquiring several priceless family recipes, and have been given permision to include these.) The search for authentic United States Regional bread recipes was a challenge. These recipes represent untold hours of kitchen testing and comparisions between identically-named breads. I have found just what I wanted and, I hope, what you will enjoy.As I worked with this material, I realized there was a great need to compile a list of \\"eggless\\" bread recipes because many people suffer allergies, or limit their egg consumption. Therefore, I have listed all the eggless recipes included in this book."},{"Title":"McCall's Sewing Book","review":"I have been searching for this book for a while, since the copy I owned in the 60's disappeared.

Some of the 60's styles and social suggestions discussed are entertaining."},{"Title":"Hometown Girl","review":"When successful lawyer Lauren Van Horn returns to her hometown of San Rafael, Utah, passions threaten the peace of the small community. Lauren represents the environmentalists, the tree huggers that save endangered lands and animals. The people of San Rafael resent people like Lauren because their fragile economy depends on its environmental resources. When her environmental comments got in her in trouble with the town folk several months ago, Lauren vows to stay silent this time and attend her family concerns instead. Unfortunately, circumstances take that decision out of her hands.Lauren's sister Becca has asked her to come home to help with a custody issue. Becca's ex-husband Joe threatens to use her romantic interest Gabe Randolph in another man as the means to gain custody of their seven-year-old daughter. When he moved back to town and Becca was single again, they thought they'd see if they pick up where they left off in high school. Unfortunately, small town gossip created jealousy in Joe. Now Becca wants Lauren to become publicly involved with Gabe to take the heat off herself, wisely deciding to try to avoid courts in the custody issue.Gabe is now an oil producer whose company hopes to tap San Rafael's resources. The town wants the jobs and economic boost such a venture provides. Lauren, however, worries for the delicate desert landscape and protests the venture based on environmental issues. With such vast difference of values, maintaining a romantic interest becomes challenging. Her heart knows no barriers, either, making the situation even more volatile. Add protesters who aren't afraid to resort to sabotage to accomplish their ends, a meddling mother, and a demanding boss, and Lauren finds herself confronted with challenges on all fronts.Author Mary Jane Meier's HOMETOWN GIRL is contemporary romance at its finest. With a solid understanding of the dynamics of custody battles and environmental issues, Meier creates a novel rich in nuance and flavor. Not only do the primary characters sparkle, but the supporting cast also comes alive, making the small town of San Rafael a believable, richly diverse background. Indeed, even the simplest characters, such Ezra the retired cook who's blindness doesn't make the picture of his beloved Chloe any less vivid, threaten to bring a tear to the reader's eye. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hometown Girl","review":"I really love the way this author tells a story. She has a deceptively simple style...The plot rolls along easily and it pulls you in, but there is such substance to the relationships that are being formed.

Recommend highly!"},{"Title":"Hometown Girl","review":"The last time Denver-based environmental lawyer Lauren Van Horn came to her hometown San Rafael, Utah, she caused a riot with her protectionism views on the local wilderness. Now her sister Rebecca Hewitt asks her to return to help her with her former husband Joe. He claims Becca is an unfit mother due to her affair with oil magnate Gabe Randolph. Becca denies any relationship beyond friendship with the man, but wants Laura to have a pretend affair with Gabe to fool Joe. Laura's employer, the not-for-profit Colorado Plateau Wilderness Association, also sends her to San Rafael to represent them in a local environmental dispute.Laura feels attracted to Gabe, but he heads the oil company wanting to drill in the canyon, something that she objects to as being destructive. Becca's request that she and Gabe pretend to have a romance makes her feel uneasy, but soon she and Gabe fall in love while seeking a compromise to balance employment and saving the wilderness. However, their respective supporters escalate the argument placing innocent people in danger and their relationship at risk.Though an exhilarating look at the complex environmental vs. industry issue, the story line offers simplified solutions. The plot also uses an illogical assumption to push the intelligent lead pair together. Laura and Gabe are a superb duet, who serves as the microcosm of the bigger issue. The well-written tale is exciting and brings a strong perspective to the prime debate. Mary Jane Meier has written an insightful novel, but HOMETOWN GIRL has several sidebars that take the reader away from the key theme. Breeze through them in order to read a superb novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Revolutionary Guide to Visual Basic 4 Professional","review":"I hadn't realized I forgot to review this book.I teach VB at the university level, and have used this book as well.

By the time he's finished, traditional, speculative philosophies are dead, buried and left without a headstone. (That these &quot;undead&quot; philosophies continue stalk the land, well, that's another story...)According to Reichenbach - and his logic is impeccable - while the rationalist philosophers painted their mystical canvases, the parallel development of science, and scientific method handed the empiricists the tools they needed to produce the first grounded philosophic view. The search for certainty had the classic philosophers barking up the wrong tree. And meanwhile, the exploration of the microscopic world, coupled with the creation of a new mathematical tool - statistics - bootstrapped the scientific community into a model of the universe that was not causal, but probabilistic.And what of ethics? Just as there are no absolute answers to the physical world, Reichenbach leaves the moral bucket empty as well. Your ethics, he argues, are ultimately what you choose to posit for yourself.There is much more, lurking in this dense and difficult book. Published in 1951 - two years prior to his death - this is a tour-de-force of a man who was a contemporary of Einstein, and a participant in the famed &quot;Weiner Kreiss&quot; (Vienna Circle) which included such mighty minds as Kurt Godel. (See my review of D. Hofstadter's &quot;Godel, Escher, Bach...&quot;) Reichenbach was one hot potato, armed with superior weaponry, and ready to take on the world.The tragedy of this pursuit of consistency, which is the trademark of the scientific view, is that it probably will never come to guide society at large. Empty as it is, it is unacceptable to the majorities, whom Reichenbach was certainly not writing to, and who have no working concept of the scientific method. Most people do not want to hear that there are no ultimate answers.One very big problem I see with this philosophy lies not with its truthfulness, but in its usefulness. We humans have a tough situation all around. We have a state of awareness which far exceeds that of our animal brethren, but we are bound with all the other animal traits, including mortality. Therefore, since we became aware of our frailties, we have consistently sought a coping mechanism. The rationalist view offered some hope - be it a blatant lie - but scientific philosophy, alas, does not. In truth, it runs counter to any coping mechanism one might choose to create. It is certainly not a philosophy for the weak and sick. This is the largest difficulty I see with its acceptance. As correct as Reichenbach may be, how can we stomach sending our children into a world where there's no intrinsic good or bad? How can we prepare them? The search for an easy answer may be wrong - but it's easy! And like water, humanity will likely take the easy path. There are many sweeter smelling flowers out there. Why choose this one? The author could have spent some effort making this philosophy more appealing to the masses, but he chose not to.So is it just for scientists after all? The implications of scientists, blindly searching for more empty knowledge, as pawns of the capitalists, guided by a philosophy of blind greed, creating new and better tools and toys for the rest of us, yields a rather uncomfortable image in my mind of the future of the human race. But, after all, it truly doesn't matter what we do. And even though the truth is sometimes a bit scary, I do like the concept of creating my own vision and values.Now it's true that humans created both traditional and scientific philosophy, and however different their origins may have been, they are both here to stay. Are there any implications for the future of society in general? After reading this book, I would have to say: &quot;Probably&quot;.Very interesting book, but not for everyone."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"I am only half way through this AMAZING book, and the revelations are incredible. The first third is a history of philosophy and epistemology up until Kant, and shows you what true science is all about. This is a manifest for clear thought, if I've ever seen one, and I have... Carl Sagan's &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot;. This book explains everything with reason and rationale, he has not yet gone into the metaphysic to explain anything. He doesn't expect the reader to go to another source, he explains it all in the book, says who he got it from, even what book. If you ever wanted to know what the scientific philosophy truly was you have to read this. It is not just about its rise, but explains WHAT it is, with that very important geneological information about how it came about. If you are religious, watch out. It will really shake your world, and you will understand why the highest percentage of agnostics is found in the intellectual, scientific fields that required the intellectual philosophic framework of science in order to be comprehended completely.

He claims that \\"everyone's guy is the best\\". Certainly this can be true for many authors as well.This is not the case here because I am not enamored with his other works. But in the Rise of Scientific Philosophy, Reichenbach brings you through questions and observations which need addressing. He begins his assault on poor Philosophy on page three, and continues through the book. He separates out the poetic philosophers, from the more tough minded philosophers that actually say something.I don't think that I am exaggerating when I write: I don't believe someone can truly say they have some philosophical background without having read and digested the work contained with in Reichenbach's book.But, it is not an easy read, and will take time. But the time taken is very much worth it.Note: I must confess that I bought my copy of the book fully a year before actually reading it."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"I read Reichenbach's Rise of Scientific Philosophy when I was a freshman in college, forty years ago. I have read many books over the years, but to this day I would say that this is the most influential book of my life. I started college as an ordinary Christian protestant. A philosophy course taught me about critical thinking. Then I started reading Reichenbach over Christmas vacation and I found it so fascinating that I couldn't put it down. I underlined a lot of passages. I added lots of exclamation points!!! By the time I was finished I was no longer a Christian. I was an atheist. Reichenbach makes it clear that you don't have to have religion to be a good, moral person. For a while I was a militant atheist, but I soon matured out of that. Still wanting something to belong to, I was a Humanist with a capital H for awhile. Then I joined an ultra-liberal Unitarian church that didn't require people to believe any doctrine, but which discussed all sorts of philosophical and religious views and emphasized the importance of freedom of speech and religion. Now, after much reading in psychology, anthropology and philisophy, I continue to be fascinated by the need for religion as a universal human characteristic. Nobody can deny the power of religious beliefs to affect human emotions and behavior, for both good and evil. But some people are capable of deeper, more critical thinking about religion. Some people have the strength to exist and thrive without a God, but with love for people, for human rights, and for the natural world. This book is for those people. ..."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"It should be pointed out at the outset that while the author of the present classic book was a logical positivist, the author of the present review is not. Indeed, I think that basically all the central claims of the logical positivists were false. However, this important book goes far beyond the central claims of the logical positivist movement and I very much like the spirit in which it was written. Reichenbach tries to show how philosophy can (and ought to) benefit from modern science and, I think, how modern science can benefit from a philosophy that does away with certain outdated ways of thinking. He draws an important distinction between what he calls \\"speculative philosophy\\", on the one hand, and \\"scientific philosophy\\", on the other hand. The former is identified with the old and associated with building philosophical systems, while the latter is concerned with refining the questions (by logical analysis). Also, the speculative philosophy is associated with rationalism, while scientific philosophy is associated with empiricism. The errors of speculative philosophy are traced back to a heavy reliance of analogies and \\"picture language\\" in the place of real explanations and to a misguided search for absolute certainty.Reichenbach is one of those rare individuals that have deep insights into both philosophy and modern science. His insight into mathematics, geometry, logic and physics is impressive. Philosophy cannot remain unchanged after breakthroughs of the Darwinian theory of evolution, Einstein's theory of relativity and the big bang theory, etc. Philosophers need to take note of scientific results that have relevance for philosophic questions and, I believe, scientists need to take note of philosophy. But meeting halfway, as it were, is impossible if the philosopher insists on doing philosophy like Plato and Aristotle did philosophy. One very important thing that Reichenbach takes up is how totally untenable it is to retain a teleological worldview in the face of modern science and how much damage to understanding anthropomorphic ideas has had and sadly continues to have to this day.I think it is fair to say that this book is dated now, but where is a similar book written in this spirit today by someone who is as well read in both philosophy and science as Reichenbach was? Besides, it is very much in line with the attitude of the writer of the book that progress would be made after its publication. He would not consider this book to be a final statement on the topic, but a step in the right direction. I'm certain that progress has been made in almost all the areas on which the book touches, but one area on which I can say with confidence that this is the case is ethics. The chapter on \\"the nature ethics\\" is frustrating for me to read being a moral philosopher myself. Reichenbach thinks that much can be learned by doing a logical analysis of moral language and that if we do so we discover that non-cognitivism is the only way to go. This approach is severely outdated today. He does however discuss the relation of the individual to the group, but without going very deep.In the spirit of the arguments found inside, I think this book should be seen, not as a final statement, but as a statement of the best philosophy at the time of its publication.Fritz- Anton FritzsonLund University,Sweden"},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"A popular positivist classic, Reichenbach's \\"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy\\" is typical in it's simplistic overconfidence shared with an even \\"greater\\" classic, A.J.Ayer's \\"Language Truth and Logic\\". Both are essential reading to help understand the popular science positivism still embraced and promoted by scientists such as Hawking and Dawkins.Positivism, Logical Positivism or otherwise, contends that scientific knowledge is the only 'true' or genuine knowledge. Facts are scientific; values are subjective preferences (e.g.I like justice; I don't like injustice.)But what of these scientific facts?To positivists, common sense facts such as \\"I was born and I shall die\\" are no more than probable hypotheses. Hypotheses are, until confirmed, mere opinions. And the confirmation is merely provisional since science is endlessly progressive, so all confirmed hypotheses remained subject to revision or refutation ad infinitum.Further, \\"probability statements express relative frequencies of repeated events...They are derived from frequencies observed in the past and include the assumption the same frequencies will hold in the future(p.236). \\"But this assumption has no rational basis. It is not based on any evident necessity; it is a mere assumption. (Leo Strauss; The Origins of Political Science, p.134, Interpretation, Winter 1996, Vol.23,No.2)\\"So, the cognitive status of all scientific facts is that of a non-necessary hypothetical assumption.This is not knowledge; this is just opinion."},{"Title":"The Rise of Scientific Philosophy","review":"As a philosophy professor for three decades, I have taught this wretched book several times in survey courses in 20th century philosophy. It has gone through numerous printings, and so has seemed to capture the respect of a good number of Anglo-American professors. However, Reichenbach's reading of the history of philosophy is wrong on every count; it is no wonder that Einstein, whose student he once was, ridicules Reichenbach in \\"Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist.\\" Although I endeavored to keep my view out of lectures, my undergraduates were able to point to Reichenbach's superficiality and his errors at every turn.So, one might ask--what is its attraction? For people who would like to avoid the considerable labor of studying the great thinkers of the past with seriousness, this book gives them an easy excuse not to.

Lewis considered George MacDonald his mentor and inspiration, and one can well see why. MacDonald has the amazing subtle insight into human nature and the relevance of Christ to modern man that made Lewis famous. MacDonald's prose style is often awkward, but it contains such incredible magic and truth that it should not be passed by.It's mostly impossible to find MacDonald's works in their original form, and frankly they are very difficult to read that way. This book contains a selection that I didn't always agree with, but I suppose some cuts need to be made.If you like C.S. Lewis at all, read MacDonald. He's worth it."},{"Title":"The Heart of George Macdonald: A One-Volume Collection of His Most Important Fiction, Essays, Sermons, Drama, and Biographical Information (Wheaton Literary)","review":"George MacDonald is excellent. It is no wonder that CSLewis thought so much of his writings. MacDonald appears fed up with \\"religious people\\" and gives clear arguments for the existence and love of God that are woven into real life circumstances within his novels. I have never read one I didn't like by him. Some of his fantasies were a bit difficult for me though. I would highly recommend any of his writings if you want to become a better person in thought and deed. I look forward to meeting him in person, so to speak, in heaven."},{"Title":"Dining with Pharisees (Interfaces)","review":"In the first part of the book, the author, J. Patrick Mullen, gives us a concise introduction to modern New Testament scholarship, a knowledge which is indispensable to a good understanding of the way we arrived at the actual text (a study of the sources and the way they were integrated.)In the second part, the author analyses every aspect and detail of the text selected to show their significance in terms of the facts that are described, the author's mind frameworks and the audience to whom the final text was addressed.It is a remarkable study, especially for the newcomer to New Testament modern scholarship.Rabbi Leo M. Abrami"},{"Title":"Dining with Pharisees (Interfaces)","review":"The author does a good job of explaining the world of Luke so that this book of the Bible takes on a clearer meaning. He dissects the parable of the Dinner with the Pharisee beautifully, shedding new light upon the meaning that the Lukan Jesus wanted to convey. The book gets a little academic at times, and thus can drag, but overall it is a good exegesis."},{"Title":"Dining with Pharisees (Interfaces)","review":"I haven't finished this book but found it interesting.

The changes in tone from light banter to heavy, brooding drama, to the usual 'steamy' scenes, were pretty much the standard for books like this. Since I'm not a big romance fan anyway, I didn't mind the emphasis on the relationship between Lottie and Allegra, though I felt the last chapter was a bit too predictably melodramatic. Still, the story was at its best when it was just the two of them.Hayden was a bit too wussy to take seriously, and I didn't really mind his occasional absences. All the buildup with his background and his first wife's 'troubles' didn't quite deliver what it promised.Recommended for those who like historical romance novels, but not for those who are really picky about plot development!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This was a very good story.

As many books as I read, there may be a handful of authors that I actually remember. She is one of them. One Night of Scandal is about an adventuress debutante, Carlotta Fairleigh, and it did not disappoint me--passionate scenes that sizzle, with main characters that feel like real people, Ms. Medeiros makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall, watching the story unfold before your eyes.

The characters weren't together enough to fall in Love. Most of the time was with Lottie and Allegra. I also seemed more of a love story between Hayden and Justine. This situation also confused me....did he love her like a wife or child (as Ned indicted). If he loved her like a child, then I can see him not sleeping with her for 6 years, but otherwise don't get that. I am usually turned off by romance novels when the one involved is still in love with someone else. All in all, I hated that everytime Hayden was thinking it was usually about Justine. If he was still so tormented by her and loving her, how could he fall for Lottie. I guess I like to read the books where the hero just can't remember life before the heroine - Fiction I guess :-)"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I don't care for all this authors books, but I have read 2 and is on my 3rd.

Some of the story was mysterious and a little spooky, but this was still definetly a true love story. The passion is very great in this book and it'll keep you wanting to read more and more. THough I loved the first book to this, this one was a different style and from the start I loved it.

Tonight is Lottie Fairleigh's debut into society. She is all dressed up and ready to go but learns that their neighbour is none other than Hayden St Clair, the muderous marquess, who just so happens to be temporarily resident in the house next door. Lottie wants just one last adventure before settling into her life and out of much curiosity for the much talked about Marquess, she decides to climb out of her bedroom window and on to the neighbouring property.Mistaking Lottie for a woman of the night sent by his friend, he pulls Lottie into his house and ravishes her with sensual kisses, only to be witnessed by the people in Lottie's neighbouring house. Thoroughly compromised Lottie has no choice but to marry the murderous Marquess and follow him back to his haunted mansion in windswept Cornwall. Hayden had no intention of ever marrying again after the death of his first wife, of which there is much speculation amongst the ton. However, he needed a governess for his young daughter so he decided to agree to the marriage.As Lottie settles into life on Hayden's Cornish estate, she struggles to tame Allegra, Hayden's 10 year old daughter. As she realises that her marriage is one of convenience, she tries to fight off the ghosts that haunts Hayden's life and which buries his heart. Will her trust and love be strong enough to exorcise the ghosts of yesteryear.This is a delicious book both dark and light at the same time. With gothic hints with things that go bump in the night but also a combination of wit and humour to add a light hearted touch to the book. Teresa Medeiros is truly gifted with spinning yarns of faery tales. You will not be disappointed.Lea Ling Tsang"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"You can rarely go wrong with Teresa Medeiros. Her books are the best of the romantic genre, tending to capture the reader within the first ten pages with a sensational scenario. Her heroines are smart, funny, and vivacious; her heroes are dark, romantic, and soulful; and when they meet, sparks fly!This latest novel, &quot;One Night of Scandal,&quot; seems to be a combination of Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot; and Emily Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot; The heroine, Charlotte, or Lottie, yearns to be a writer but is bound by the time period (1825) to make a respectable marriage. Her curiosity gets the better of her to sneak out of her &quot;coming out party&quot; and spy on her temporary next door neighbor, Hayden Oakleigh, the &quot;Murderous Marquess.&quot; Hayden killed his best friend in a duel, and is rumored to have pushed his wife off of a cliff. He sounds very much a villain, but Lottie finds him to be a wounded man, haunted by ghosts not entirely of his own making.While this story could not quite rival &quot;The Bride and the Best&quot; and &quot;Thief of Hearts,&quot; it still captured me from beginning to end, and I gladly took the journey. I even cried at the end, which really surprised me.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a little romance. It's a quick, easy read, and will leave you with a lovely feeling."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Teresa Medieros is one of my favorite authors--I usually pick up her books just on the basis of her name, knowing I'll find a well-written story laced with humor and romance. But this book was completely disappointing! Compared to her other novels, this one was sorely lacking, in terms of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot twists. It just didn't pull me in; the novel is definitely not up to par. Sorry, Teresa, this one just doesn't cut it. Here's to hoping your next novel maintains your usual excellent standard!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"&quot;One Night of Scandal&quot; turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. When I read the first two chapters, my reaction was &quot;oh wonderful, I've wasted my money on a novel about another immature, hoydenish heroine who manages to snare another unsuspecting hero by embroiling him in a scandal.&quot; But then I found myself spending the next few hours eagerly turning the pages and being really entertained -- &quot;One Night of Scandal&quot; had turned out to be a fortuitous buy.Miss Carlotta (Lottie) Anne Fairleigh is about to attend her debut ball when she learns that the Murderous Marquess -- Hayden St. Clair, the Marquess of Oakleigh -- has been living next door for the past few days. (Oakleigh is supposed to have killed both his wife and his best friend when he found them in bed together). Surely slipping out before her ball starts in order to catch a glimpse of the man shouldn't land her in too much trouble? Except that it does. Before she can fully comprehend how things had gotten so dreadfully beyond her control, Lottie loses her &quot;virginal&quot; reputation when she's spied in the marquess's study and in his arms. Only marriage to Oakleigh can redeem her in Society's eyes, and so Lottie soon finds herself married to Oakleigh and bound for his estate in Cornwall (which is reputed to be haunted by Oakleigh's dead wife's ghost). It doesn't take Lottie very long to realise exactly what her true feelings for her remote and tortured husband are; unfortunately Lottie also realises that Oakleigh is still very much in love with his dead wife. Now Lottie must decide if she can compete with the memories of dead woman and get her husband to see her as a fully grown woman, eager for her husband's love and attention?This is what I liked about &quot;One Night of Scandal&quot; -- Teresa Medeiros saves the novel from the usual fare about a feisty and somewhat immature heroine who finally wins her dour husband's love and devotion, by allowing Lottie to mature by increments (the Lottie at the beginning of the novel and the Lottie at the end of the novel are almost two different people); and by allowing for Lottie's hoydenish ways and her free and easy manners to actually help her overcome some of the problems she faces at her new home (as when she has to deal with her stepdaughter, Allegra). Something else I liked about this novel was the manner in which she portrayed Oakleigh by not making him into the usual dour, bad tempered autocratic male, but by literally portraying him as a man who is somewhat out of his depth, and who doesn't quite know how to handle his attention starved daughter, his new young wife, or his tortured memories of his dead wife.Overall, the story was a rather good one that seemed at first to be part gothic novel, part ghost story, but which actually proved to be a slightly humourous and entertaining tale about a young woman who manages to heal the emotional wounds that her new family is suffering from, and who manages, ultimately, to find the love of a lifetime where she least expected to. All in all, &quot;One Night of Scandal&quot; proved to be a good 4 star read."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I have many \\"favourite\\" authors in Romance. For intense, dark and deadly males, I go to Anne Stuart. If I want giggles till I hurt, I choose Lynsay Sands and Katie Macalister. If I hunger for Off-World adventures, I got Robin D. Owens and C.J. Barry, hot sexy vampires or futuristic drama look to a new voice Angela Knight. But if I want a near poetic faerytale that evokes the style of Victoria Holt, you can do no better than Teresa Medeiros. Ever since I read her Whisper of Roses, I have been a big fan.One Night of Scandal is not really a Romance in today's mold. It's more of the old style gothic. The isolated manor in Cornwall, the brooding, too contained hero, the full of life wife he was forced to marry, hovering over them all is the ghost of the previous wife and the tile the hero now carries - the Murderous Marquee.31-year-old Hayden St. Clair is content in his dark hell of memories, content to live away from the Ton and this narrow minds and vicious gossip, but he needs a governess for his 10-year-old daughter, so he is forced to go to London to seek one. Finding one is proving impossible, since the Ton feeds on the facts he was forced to kill his best friend in a duel, and later his wife took her own life by jumping off a cliff. Naturally, it's wondered if the Murderous Marquee did not lend his wife a helping hand.Lotte Fairleigh, 21-year-old ward of a Duke, is facing her coming out party, but she cannot resist one last adventure until she is firmly planted on the marriage mart. The adventure is sneaking out a second-story window to dash across the lawn to the house next door. The Murderous Marquee is in residence there and it's said he will be leaving in the morning. This is her last chance for a peek of the man who has captured her imagination.Hayden has just seen a good friend off, the friend hinting he was going to send a woman to him to break his boredom. When Lotte turns up peeking in his window, he mistakenly believes she is the woman. Their embrace is broken up by her guardian. The Duke is enraged and demands Hayden marry Lotte to save her reputation. Hayden assures him nothing happened between them but a kiss, and says he will never marry again, leaving the Duke to challenge him to a duel.Lotte cannot permit her brother-in-law to risk his life, so she goes to Hayden and begs him to marry her. Hayden does, but not for the reasons Lotte believes. She is startled when she arrives at her new home to find Hayden has a 10-year-old daughter, a wild hellion who enjoys vexing her father. Lotte is hurt to learn Hayden married her only to have a suitable governess for his daughter, crushing the young woman's hope of making a good marriage.The situation goes from bad to worse, as the child sets out to drive Lotte nuts. Only, Lotte, a hellion in her own right, knows all the tricks of the trade and pushes the girl to finally call a truce. Lotte makes strides with her stepdaughter, but her marriage only grows more distant.No one can cover the fact there are screams in the night or that someone plays music in the music room when the door is locked. Lotte must unriddle the ghost stalking Hayden's hall and find happiness in the life she has made.Medeiros beautiful proses are writing as you don't often see it these days. They are evocative and carry the reader along with humor and emotion. She is at peak form with One Night of Scandal. And being a cat lover, I adores the herd of kitty's that Lotte collects. Medeiros gives you super read with this heart warming tale."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This book was funny, laced with sexual tension and a definate page-turner. Carlotta (Lottie) is known as a hellion until a final stunt gets her a reluctant husband. Now she is determined to be the perfect wife. Meanwhile, Hayden, her husband, is doing his best to ignore her and his building attraction for his new bride. He is tortured by his first wife and the life they led before she her mental disorder destroyed their family. Medeiros paints a picture of a family torn apart by bipolar disorder - undiagnosed and feared in this 19th century setting. With her usual talent Medeiros shows us the pain and suffering for all those affected by the disease. When Lottie is able to help Hayden and his daughter deal with the loss of their loved one, they are able to let her into their hearts. Which is good because Lottie has loved them since the beginning.Overall, this was an excellent story, well written with great characters. I now have to go back and read all of Medeiros' books! You won't be disappointed with this one - pick it up!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I would actually give this a book a 3.5 because I read it in one day, so it held my interest, but there were several things which did ultimately detract from my overal enjoyment of the book. Also, I'm comparing it to the standard that Ms. Medeiros has shown herself capable of in earlier works. I did like the hero and the heroine. Their interactions were fun, flirty, and laced with sexual tension. I felt that Lottie stayed true to her character as she was initially portrayed in A Kiss to Remember. When Hayden wasn't busy being dark and tortured and staying away from anyhing that could ever bring him happiness, he seemed like someone that would attract Lottie. I just felt they didn't spend enough time with each other, particularly in that they were living in the same house for most of the book. I prefer romances built on the interaction between the hero and the heroine, where as in this case it seemed Lottie had to overcome a lot of other exterior obstacles which did not require her personal involvement with Hayden. I also felt that Ms. Medeiros borrowed from some of her other works to pull this book together, notably The Fairest of Them All (ghost haunting the relationship) and Charming the Prince (winning over the daughter.) While I enjoyed this book, I just feel it fell short of the kind of writing seen in Heather and Velvet or A Whisper of Roses. I think I'm going to reread one of those to remind myself of the greatness Ms. Medeiros has shown in the past."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Teresa Medeiros never fails to deliver! She is only one of a very few authors who never fails to make me chuckle out loud and when I come to the end of her stories, I'm grinning like a loon. This was such an enjoyable and entertaining read, with such lovable characters. Hayden is one of those tortured heroes that you can't help but fall madly in love with and Lottie is so deft at healing his and his daughter, Allegra's, broken heart and tattered soul. They will stick with me for a long time afterward."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I was so incredibly excited to get my hands on One Night of Scandal after having read A Kiss to Remember--which is, by the way, one of my favorite romance novels of all time. The novel (which, like one reviewer has already stated, is more of a companion than a sequel to the first) started out brilliantly. Lottie's fall from grace and the disastrous results that ensue, as well as the reintroduction of familiar, loveable characters seemed too delicious to be true, but I must say, once she is borne off to the \\"end of creation\\" (Cornwall), the story's pacing seriously slows. Allegra and the whole ghost-story-dead-wife-gone-insane intrigue is tolerable, but there isn't any excuse for the lack of romance and character development between Hayden and Lottie. I mean, if you really think about it, the novel was mostly from Lottie's point of view, and even when you've reached the end of the story, you still feel as if Hayden is a perfect stranger. You don't quite sympathize with him like you did for Sterling in AKtR; you don't indentify with his mysteriousness and brooding; the sporatic conversations between him and Lottie are strangely empty and out of place, and the passionate groping somehow sprung up out of nowhere. In AKtR, there was no way in avoiding the sex that occured between two characters who were perfectly obsessed with each other, whereas, the sex in ONoS could almost have been deemed unnecessary. However, I found many positive things in this novel, such as the sweet mother-daughter relationship between Lottie and Allegra, even if it did take away a little (okay, alot) of the romance, as well as other heartfelt, humorous moments. I also thought it had a powerful ending that struck a chord, so I suppose you could say it was the beginning and ending that mostly made this book for me. I finished it with a smile on my face. Though the steaminess doesn't come even close to the first book, and the story lags in places when it easily couldn't have, I recommend this to any fan of Teresa Medeiros (God bless this woman), especially if you enjoyed reading AKtR.BTW, did anyone else catch the historical inaccuracy in which Beethoven is made out to already have died? The story takes place in 1825; Beethoven didn't die until 1827. ^_^"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"As an avid fan of Teresa Medeiros's work, I was eagerly anticipating her latest release. When I finally managed to pick it up, I was very surprised to realize that it was, not a sequel exactly, but more of a companion to another one of her books -- as a matter of fact, my favorite book she's ever written, &quot;A Kiss To Remember.&quot;While &quot;A Kiss To Remember&quot; told the exquisite story of Laura Fairleigh and Sterling, the Devil of Devonbrooke, this story stars Laura's rambunctious and mischievously insatiable little sister, Lottie. Having never seen her write any kind of a sequel before, this intrigued me.It was as charming a novel as I have come to expect from Teresa Medeiros. Perhaps not quite as fabulous as the original story, but certainly worth the read. I can't wait to read Medeiros's NEXT book!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Remember mischievious Lottie from A KISS TO REMEMBER? Well, Teresa Medeiros made her the heroine of ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL, and I'm so thrilled she did! Hayden is a great hero for her, and Teresa works her special magic on their love story.

Minutes before the first guest would be arriving she and her best friend Harriett, are lamenting the fact that her hoyden days where she was well known as the \\"Hertforshire Hellion\\" were fast coming to an end. Innocently, Harriet had just given her incentive for one last adventure before having to behave and act like a lady for the rest of her days. Right next door,and over the garden wall sat the rented home of Hayden St. Clair, scandalously dubbed the \\"Murderous Marquess\\". Dreaming of one day becoming a famous author, she couldn't possibly miss her one chance to see, such a scandalous man, and give her ideas for a future villain in her fiction. After all he'd killed his best friend in a duel and then he wife had such an unfortunate and fatal \`accident'.Hayden had vowed to never marry again, had come to London for only one reason, to find a woman. What he was not looking for was to have himself and the little blonde trespasser compromised. In spite of Hayden's refusal to wed her, Lottie, realizing that her latest escapade had ruined her, and not wanting to see harm come to her brother-in-law who would be honor bound to fight a duel, snuck off and managed to convince Hayden to save her from ruin. Reluctantly, Hayden agrees to marry her then whisks her off to his remote Cornwell estate where ghostly apparitions, purported to be of his first wife, haunt the halls and himself.Settling in and doing her best to keep up her own spirits from the disregard Hayden shows her, Lottie, in her own indubitable way, wins the favor, and acceptance of the daughter he neglected to tell her about and his staff. However, what Lottie most wanted was to win both his regard and his love, as she came to realize that the tortured man who was now her husband was also the man she was falling in love with.This engaging novel has humor, mystery, tenderness and a bit of a gothic-underlying theme. Lottie, is an extremely likeable and very courageous heroine. She has her work cut out for her as she battles to break through her husbands reserve to find the open and friendly man his best friend described to her as the man he once was. I found it to be a very fast read with twists and turns that had me hating to put the book down. Most of all, and contrary to other reviewers comments, I found the ghost theme central and key in this story which rather than turn me off thoroughly enchanted me. Teresa Medeiros has again provided a thoroughly enjoyable, tender, and fun tale that will give pleasure to a multitude of her fans."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I am a big fan of Teresa Medeiros' books and when I heard of a sequel to &quot;A Kiss to Remember&quot;, I had to go out and buy it when it hit the stores. Although I read it in a few hours, I thought it would have had a different plot and ending, but I still love it like I do all of her other books. The main thing that annoyed me about the book was that Hayden was still kinda stuck on his dead wife while Lottie was trying so hard to make him love her. She even made his daughter like her. I loved that Lottie's personality hadn't changed from &quot;A Kiss to Remember&quot; because if it had, the book would have turned out dull.

Definitely a good read especially on a rainy day."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I'm a big Teresa Medeiros fan, but this is not one of her best books. The two protagonists barely talk for 3/4s of the book, but they manage to fall in love...? I read to the end, but I wasn't enjoying this read as much I did Yours Until Dawn or the Devil Wears Plaid."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This novel started off with so much promise. Lottie, on the night of her debut in society, climbs out of her window to steal a peek at a scandalous neighbor. Hayden, the neighbor, mistakes Lottie for a courtesan that his friend sent him and steals her into his home for some action. Ultimately, the two end up compromised and soon are married.I giggled quite a bit at Lottie's antics and the banter the two exchanged. I rather liked how smitten Hayden seemed with his young, mischievous wife. Obviously I understood he had a \\"tortured soul\\" as we're filled in that he's been involved with scandal... he's previous wife had supposedly had an affair, the lover murdered in a duel, and she ended up dead as well. I was curious about his past and hopeful to read the coming story where I expected Lottie to heal the wounded hero.Once Lottie and Hayden make their way to his family home in the country, the novel took a sharp dip down. A bratty child is introduced into the story and the entire story seems to revolve around her. Lottie and Hayden don't speak to each other much, interact much... and when they do, he's such a stick in the mud that I found myself getting frustrated with page after page of Lottie and the kid doing lessons and grumpy Hayden lurching around in the background.When I started to get bored my mind wandered to the beginning that I had liked so much and started to pick it apart. Like wondering how believable it was that a twenty-one year old woman would climb out of her window and go exploring on the night of her debut. And then her other antics seemed silly and immature as well. She was written like a teenage girl. Bah. Just not for me.As the book progressed to the end and the pages on the right grew sparse and the couple STILL had not become intimate I just got tired of it all. Overall, just an OK historic romance.Plot themes: tortured hero, forced/arranged marriage, hidden child, scandalLove scenes: 2 - steam rating fair to low"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"A perfectly wonderful book. This book may contain a \\"formula\\" storyline, but this author makes it all new. The formula ......a very dark, handsome hero has long been thought to have murdered his wife. That is the end of the formula. This H/H make it all new again as they meet, marry in haste, and turn a marriage of convenience into a story of redemption, and love. Some scenes brought tears to my eyes. The author brings this story to life on the pages and you fall in love with both of the main characters. Oh, and don't let me forget the ghost, or is there a ghost? I will let you find out, for if you love historical romance this is a must read."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I read this years ago in paperback. I've slowly been replacing my favorites on the Kindle. It's nice to re-read those books that I got rid of years ago at yard sales!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This book had all the items needed. A quirky heroine, a strong tall dark and handsome hero, undying love (literally), and a somewhat plausible reason for getting married. If you are someone that wants lots of steamy sex scenes then this is not it. There are a few tantalizing and one or two steamy scenes. This is a story about two people who meet and eventually find love. I almost didn't read it because of some of the reviews, but now am glad I did. This book has more depth then alot of the books I have come across lately. The heroine helps the hero and his daughter get over the loss of his first wife so he can eventually find true love with her. For all the people who didn't like this part or that part of the book you are always welcome to write your own that suits your own tastes. I enjoyed this book for what it is, a nice diversion of time."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Medeiros always incorporates an enticing darkness that makes her novels more heartfelt and realistic. The problem with this novel for me was the lack of deep love and devotion between the two protagonists. I wouldn't have noticed this if it weren't for clear undying link we witnessed between the marquiss and his dead wife. Even after he proclaimed his love to Carlotta, it was still understood that he retained love for his first wife. Although his undying love for his first wife is admirable, I was hoping that the love for his second wife would have surpassed that of his first. The novel was about the love between Lottie and Hayden not the love of Hayden and Justine. Justine's presence in the novel was obviously important in regard to the slaying of Hayden's as well as Allegra's personal demons, but it should have been second to the growing love between Hayden and Carlotta."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This story was lovely. I liked both the heroine and the hero--I liked how the author wove a very special storyline in this book--it was different then most historical romance stories I have read.This is not my favorite Teresa Medieros book but it is well worth the readers time to read.

I thought Hayden and Lottie were a perfect match and it was so much fun seeing her bring some light into his life. I always expect humor when I read one of Theresa's books, but this one had unexpected depths of emotion. I laughed and I cried. Definitely one of the best of the year!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I just don't understand all of these positive reviews. This book is way below average - definately NOT a keeper. I've enjoyed many of Ms. Medeiro's books but this one is so poorly written that I could barely finish it. Hayden St. Clair is supposed to be a lonely, brooding, dark character but the book is so flip that it destroys any intensity he might generate. As a result, the chemistry between Hayden and Carlotta doesn't work and the plot just doesn't make sense. At one point - when Carlotta feels she's betrayed Hayden - she flees to London for four months! Why? Then she supposedly redeems herself by publishing a sordid novel about their life story - one that puts her in a bad light. However, we're never told exactly what she has written about herself. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I'm not aware at first that &quot;One Night of Scandal&quot; is a sequel to &quot;A Kiss to Remember&quot;, the story about Lottie's sister Laura &amp; Sterling Harlow. After finishing &quot;ONoS&quot;, I cannot help myself from revisiting Laura &amp; Sterling's story and reread &quot;AKtR&quot;, Wow, Teresa Medeiros is just superb. I give 4 stars for &quot;ONoS&quot; because though it is quite good, it is not as poignant as &quot;AKtR&quot;, which I give 5 stars. If you like &quot;ONoS&quot; make sure that you also read &quot;AKtR&quot;."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"While reading this book I continuously kept thinking I must have picked it up in the tween section of the library. Pretty much everything about this book is foolishly unrealistic and completely childish. I actually had a bigger problem with Lottie than I did w/ Hayden. No 20 year old woman living in that time period would have behaved in the way she did. She was idiotic. So was her friend, Harriet, who chased her to Cornwall and became a servant in her home instead of asking to see her and ask to stay there. Even the way they collected cats was weird. This book is just plain dumb. Everything is cliche, drawn out, boring and while I did enjoy the 2 love scenes in the book, they are near the end and it's just not nearly enough to save this mess of a story. I whole heartedly recommend skipping \\"One Night of Scandal\\"."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"There are so many things that are wrong with this book that I don't know how I am the first one to give it a bad review.First: I have trouble believing that a young lady in the night of her debut, with only minutes before the party starts, dressed in her finest, would go climbing out of her bedroom window and trespass into another property just to get a peek at a man that all society comments is a murderer. If by a stretch of the imagination I believe it, there are only two words I can think of to describe such female: foolish and childish. Not a good start.Second: A Ghost...?! No comments necessary here.Third: The fact that Hayden would stop having relations with his first wife because he didn't want to get her with child again, and, more astonishing, that he would not get a mistress in all that time is very hard to believe. I have read other books that take place in the same time period or even before, and there seemed to be knowledge of some methods to control pregnancy, other than abstinence. Furthermore, did he plan to go on like this his whole life? What if Justine had not died? Do the author really expects us to believe that a man in his twenties, suposedly passionate and in love with his wife would stand this situation for 6 years, and then 4 more after she died? He must have a very strong will or a very weak sexual drive.Fourth: I'm really no a stickler for proper forms of address, but the way Allegra was referred to in the Epilogue is wrong. She would be Lady Allegra St.Clair not Lady Allegra Oakleigh.Fifth: Most of the problems that the lead characters have in this book, could have been solved just by talking to each other openly. No need to overdramatize and complicate everything. For example, if Lottie wanted to get Hayden's attention why didn't she simply sought him out more and tried to get to know him better? The way he ignores her and she does nothing about it gets really old. What did she expect anyway? His undying devotion from the start? They barely knew each other! On the other hand, why Hayden didn't simply explain to her that he had not murdered his first wife? Why would he expect her to belive in his innocence when he had done nothing to defend himself and moreover tries to scare her into thinking him guilty? Again, they were extrangers! To expect such faith from a person that barely knows you is foolish. You can believe in your heart in a person's innocence, but appearances can be deceiving. This is a serious matter, that needed to be addressed openly not something that can be swept under the rug.Sixth: Why did she left when he told her to if she didn't want to leave? The only reason for her to leave in those circumstances is if she were scared of him, which she wasn't. The sensible thing to do was to stay and try to work things out. They talk so little during the book that at the end I don't feel they know each other much better than they did at the beginning. They seem to go from ignoring each other, to making passionate love, to being separated for months, to making love again.The only thing good about this book are the love scenes. Those are really hot. But they don't occur until almost the end of the book and there is only a couple of them and on top of that, the second one is concluded by a most ridiculous scream that had me rolling my eyes in exasperation.I can only assume from the other reviews that Teresa Medeiros has very loyal fans that enjoy this kind of writting, but it is really not my style. I have been wanting to read \\"A Kiss to Remember\\" but if this is the kind of stuff I can expect, I'm not sure I'm going to. Specially since I can't trust the reviews."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I usually read a historical romance novel in 2 days. Long, boring and drawn out!!!!! This is the first of Medeiros books for me and the last!!!!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This book was, in a word, ok. That's not usually an adjective I would associate with Teresa Medeiros' writing- usually words like excellent, superb, and gripping apply to her writing. Lately, I've noticed that this author's work has been going slowly downhill. I loved some of her earlier work- like Once An Angel, Thief of Hearts, and Nobody's Darling. However, this book, as well as the Bride and the Beast were so bland that I thought I was reading work by another author. I suppose that if you like really character-oriented stories, without so much situational stuff, you would like this book. Though I'm telling you, it's boring. One of the bigger issues of the story was the conflict between Lottie, Hayden, and Allegra. Just your typical evil stepmother plot, and I hear about these things every day. All the characters were cliched- in fact, the entire plotline had been used before. I took off a star because One Night Of Scandal is almost exactly like Rebecca, by Daphne Du Maurier. I won't waste time retelling the story of Rebecca, but if anyone has read it or seen the movie, you'll understand what I mean. If not, just trust that it's safe to say that this book was boring, cliched, and overall NOT what I would expect from a normally fabulous writer."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Though this book wasn't exactly a page turner, it did keep my interest throughout the entire book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the ghost plotline. Without that, it would have been a much better read. I enjoyed Hayden and his wit though I had trouble with the characters and their chemistry toward each other. It wasn't a disappointing book by any means, but the whole ghost scenario had me a bit put off. However, I think Medeiros is a wonderful author and really enjoyed reading her style of writing. She is very talented and I will read her other books."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"The beginning the book was superb. Hayden was smitten to say the least...Lottie was also intrigued and curious about this dashing, murderering marquess. The characters were instantly likeable that I was sure that the rest of the book would be equally so. That is until he marries her and takes her home and things turn really bad. His kid made me nuts, his emotional scars was so convoluted it was ridiculous. I was so sick of this guy and his problems by the end of the story I was hoping she would high-tail it out of there. Grrr...this could have been a great book ...man was I disappointed."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"One Night of Scandal I enjoyed this story and the main characters. I consider this type of book a \\"very light reading romance.\\" Carlotta on the evening she is to make her debut decides to take a quick peek into her mysterious next door neighbor's house. Her neighbor mistaking her for a \\"lady of the night\\" pulls her into his home and ends up giving her a kiss. Unfortunately this kiss is seen by various members of Carlotta's family, and Carlotta is disgraced and forced into marriage with Marquis Hayden St. Clare. Hayden is a recluse distancing himself from society after his wife's death. In fact, many in society believe he has murdered his wife and have nicknamed him \\"The Murderous Marquis, \\" and are soon predicting that Carlotta will come to a dreadful end.Very predictable but cute and enjoyable novel, I would recommend."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I enjoyed this book so much! It made me grin and it brought tears to my eyes. I like that Theresa Medieros has both laughter and tears in her books because real life is like that too. It's what makes her stories so real and so unforgettable. I wanted to be like Lottie and I sure wanted Hayden to be my man! And the ghost made a great story even better! This story is one I will always cherish. I'll be first in line for her next wonderful love story!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"As if &quot;A Kiss to Remember&quot; could ever be exceeded by a sequel novel (anyone who has read it will tell you just how simply wonderful this novel is).... but what do you know, TM has managed to out do herself!!Lottie and &quot;proper&quot; would not normally be something you would put in the same sentence .... however, to make her brother in law &quot;Sterling&quot; proud, Lottie attempts to make her debut (well ... it may actually be her second or third attempt to do so) without a hint of scandal ... hmm, well the attempt to do so doesn't quite end up the way Lottie plans and she meets Hayden St Clair ... the murderous marquess .... in what ends up been a more than interesting night!What ensues is a vastly entertaining tale of laughter, happiness, and the mending of old-wounds (so to speak). A thoroughly enjoyable, emotionally uplifting novel that is well worth the read.If you like something with a little spunk and a storyline that's a little different, give this one a try.Good reading, Kristina"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I'm not going to write a synopsis, since that can be found elsewhere. I have to say that Teresa Medeiros never disappoints, and this latest novel of hers proves to be just as worthy as her others. I'll admit that I have my favorites among Medeiros' work- Thief of Hearts, Once an Angel, and Nobody's Darling being, I think, the best. This novel encompasses Medeiros' notorious beautiful writing, yet it isn't one of my favorites. I'd place it on a par one down from some of her best, along with Lady of Conquest and A Whisper of Roses. However, if you liked either of these two above mentioned books, perhaps One Night of Scandal will tickle your fancy. However, anyone who loves Medeiros' work and appreciates truely beautiful historical romance will cherish this novel along with her rest. It will be a nice addition to any collection of historical romance."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Having read all but one of her books this one is one of the better ones. It's very funny and it has a nice pace to it. I love how she has most of the old characters in it and I just think the cover is so pretty. This book holds a nice tale of love and I was very upset when I was done with it."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"What I love of Medeiros is her humor and sarcasm slips in her books. But she also has many touching moments that will have a tear creeping out of your tear duct! This is a sequel to \\"a kiss to remember\\", though I thought \\"kiss\\" was more fun, this is just as good, with funny characters,some heartbreaking moments and very sexy scenes. I could not put the book down until the very end. I also loved the \\"Fairleigh\\" family saga continued, hysterical at times. I hope there will be a continuation, the ending surely ended perfectly for another book!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"This story is romance and fairy-tale rolled into one. The characters are real, witty and enjoyable. Her sense of humor sprinkled throughout the book helps to balance the serious undertone. I also enjoyed the way she drew me into the past. You can see, feel and understand how people lived in the nineteenth century. Her writing reminds me of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss. (My all time favorite author.) I would strongly suggest this story for anyone wanting to get lost in a good romance."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I expected a little more based upon the reviews, but overall this book was an average read. I thought the premise of the forced marriage to be a little bit of a leap simply because I couldn't see the logic in Lottie's family insisting that a supposed murderer, Hayden, marry Lottie in order to save her image among the ton. Maybe it's just me, but I would think that having men with ill intentions try to win Lottie a considerable step above marrying someone who reportedly murdered his wife. If it were my family I would hope that they would rather see me alive.Nevertheless, I was able to suspend reality somewhat because it often makes for a great read. I loved Lottie's spirit and curious nature in the beginning. I thought some of her spirit went out of her as the book moved on, probably because she was no longer being supported by a loving family and instead had to be the support of a very doom and gloom household. Despite the somewhat somber setting of the book, the author maintains a light tone throughout the book which was a welcome relief.I really didn't care for the paranormal activity. Ghosts wandering in rooms, cloying scents from dead ones, and a sense that closure is complete only when the ghost leaves, really goes against the grain for me. I also didn't care for the minimal interactions between Lottie and Hayden. A good portion of the book was spent on Hayden's daughter, Allegra, and the mystery of Justine, Hayden's first wife. So, I was left with a little less romance than I would like, although I did like the one love scene. However, the romance didn't last long and the two had to overcome her novel-writing. I, personally, thought this a rather unnecessary problem between the two since the reader is very aware that Lottie does not think of Hayden as a murderer, and instead is simply writing a fiction novel. I would have much rather seen the pages put towards the two falling in love. I never got the Aha! moment where I felt that the two fell in love or were falling in love. It was extremely difficult as their interactions with each other largely centered around the child rather than one another.Given all this, the book still managed to keep my attention throughout. So, while I don't think the book was that great, if you're a Medeiros fan then maybe it's worth it to pick up a copy. If not, then I would pick it up at the library or skip it altogether."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I have read all Medeiros books now. I became a fan after Fairest of Them All (she named Holly after my coworker Lisa's daughter and is from my area). This book is good but it is not phenomenal like I was hoping.Medeiros seems to recycle the same devices in her stories in every book. There is always a strong-bodied, tortured man with a title and a scar on him that is dangerous and provocative and makes him more handsome than boyish (he never has a good relationship with his father). The heroine is always a rebellious and witty virgin with big dreams who is trying to discover her sensuality. There is always a sham marriage that comes from some scandal or rebellion. Every single time. The heroine is always warned to stay away from her \\"husband\\", as he tends to be disreputable in some way or the other but she always melts his heart. There are always precocious children and acting pets (usually cats). There is always a motherly head maid in the castle of the tortured man. There is always a weary castle that the heroine takes responsibility over and transforms into its former glory. She is never raised by her actual parents, there is always some tragic story of their deaths or disappearance. Magical realism (like the ghost of the previous wife in the end) is always included.My point is, if I had not read ANY other Medeiros novels (my two favorites being Yours Until Dawn and Fairest of Them All), then I would give this a 5 star rating. But I cannot give it anymore than 3 because I've seen it before. I do love the sequel concept. She is also using this device again with the two latest books Some Like it Wicked and Some Like it Wild. But now she is trending towards Scottish pride and Highlander rogues. I'm just giving an honest opinion. I love Medeiros, I LOVE ALL OF HER WORK, but I need to see more than this as a follower. I've seen this before. A LOT now.It is worth the read to any new Medeiros fans though. Just makes sure you read A Kiss to Remember first. It will help out a lot, even though you don't really NEED to. This story holds its own and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"As a child Carlotta Fairleigh had earned the title \\"The Hertfordshire Hellion\\" for her madcap adventures. Now grown up, some things haven't changed. On the very night of her come out ball, Lottie discovers that the infamous Hayden St. Clair is residing in the house next door, but only for that night. Already wearing her ball gown and with guests due to arrive at any moment, Lottie is determined to get a glimpse of him. After all, what better inspiration could there be for an ardent reader and would-be author of gothic novels than to look upon the man whose wife had mysteriously died just months after he had killed one of his best friends in a duel defending her honor. Going out on a limb (literally), Lottie sneaks into his backyard and soon finds herself in the arms of the man known far and wide as the \\"Murderous Marquess.\\"Hayden St. Clair, Marquess of Oakleigh, is a man accustomed to being alone. For four and a half years he's been the subject of rumors and gossip and, on his last night in London, the last thing Hayden wants is company, even if it comes in a beautiful package. At first he assumes Lottie is a courtesan sent by his friend Ned, and is even tempted to sample the goods. By the time the truth comes out, however, the alarm has been raised for the missing Lottie, and the pair must face even more scandal or marriage. Desperate to keep her beloved guardian from facing the marquess in a duel, Lottie convinces Hayden that marriage is their only option. The newly married but not at all blissful couple head off to Oakwylde, his estate in Cornwall, for a head-on collision with the ghosts of Hayden's past and his willful ten-year old daughter.ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL is everything a reader wants a historical romance to be. It's poignant and tender with sparks of passion and humor. First introduced in A KISS TO REMEMBER, Lottie is all grown up and fulfills the promise she showed as a child. Her joie de vivre is exactly what Hayden needs to bring him out of the darkness his guilt and sorrow have sunk him in. One can empathize with Lottie in her determination to reach out to her stepdaughter Allegra, and to end the years of sadness that have shrouded Oakwylde. Given the wealth of characters in this blossoming series, readers can only hope that Teresa Medeiros will return over and over to this fascinating family and their friends. Be warned! Starting this book will most likely cause you to have a sleepless night, as it is almost impossible to put down.TheSchemer"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"The night of her debutant ball finds Carlotta (Lottie) Fairleigh trying to sneak a peek in the window of the house next-door in hopes to see Hayden St Clair who called out and shot his friend for sleeping with his wife, then killed her as well.For Hayden, the last night in London before he can return to Cornwall proves disastrous. When his friend Ned sends a &quot;little present&quot; he only assumes the lovely beauty peering in his window is &quot;the present&quot;.Faced with ruining her family, Lottie convinces Hayden they must marry and then the couple heads to his estate in Cornwall. Once there, Lottie discovers that her husband has more secrets than even the ton could imagine and determines to clear his name of the title &quot;Murderous Marquees&quot;.Ms Mederious has woven together another excellent novel. ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL, while I guess is technically a historical has a touch of gothic influence that surrounds Haden. But before events can become stressful to the reader, our characters allow their lighter sides to show. For an additional treat, Lottie has several pet cats that are enjoyable &quot;extras&quot;.The relationship that Lottie and Allegra, Hayden's estranged daughter develop is interesting and comical to watch as the little girl has no desire to have a new mother. The antics she puts Lottie though lead to a screaming match that servers to finally unite the two in a common purpose - bring Hayden back from the overwhelming guilt he feels over the death of his wife.While Hayden and Lottie have a marriage in name only, (and more so than other romances I've read), I did find how the two fell in love a little confusing. To me, it seemed like they hardly spent any time together to be able to get to know one another as people. However, the passion between the two is masterfully written. Despite this, ONE NIGHT OF SCANDAL is a novel that was hard to put down and I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"loved this book, couldn't put it down till I finished it! Got sucked into the story finishing it with a smile left on my face! Can't go wrong with this author! what an awesome love story!"},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I loved A kiss to remember, and waited for One night of Scandal, but was a little dissapointed. Yes it had it's funny moments, thouching moments, but overall, I'd say that it's biggest flaw was that Lottie and Hayden weren't together enough of the time to actually fall in love with each other. Most of the time Hayden was off brooding, and Lottie was with Allegra, Hayden's daughter from his first wife.Other then that it was a good book. If your a fan of Teresa Mederos, you'll be pleased that she sticks with her usual style of writting. You might be a little dissapointed over the lack of actual togetherness of the couple have, but no book is perfect. If you nver read anything by by her before I suggest you start with A kiss to remember or even Beauty and the beast."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I love this book. It flowed easy and Ms. Mederiuos knows exactly who her audience is. The hero and heroine (Hayden and Lottie) are funny and geniue charters. I loved Hayden and all of his moods. It had just the right blend of sexual tension to make it an enjoyable read. I would prefer it if he had spent more time with Lottie but that still didn't take away from the story line. I loved the ghost aspect of the story as well. Some times a light romance is just what one needs to finish off the night and I think Ms. Mederious has captured that in her lastes book."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Carlotta \\"Hertforshire Hellion\\" Fairleigh has earned her reputation with only her family prestige keeping her from being banned from polite society.

I think it's one of the best Ms. Mederos has ever written."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"I loved the story of \\"Lottie\\" and Hayden. It read differently than most of the romances out today, as it had a bit of a twist to the story with a surprise ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and read it too quickly, because I was sad when it was over. It didn't take forever for this couple to realize they were in love but there was a huge obstacle in the way that held them back. The book involves children and the author did an excellent job with their personalities. So many books have children four years old talking like a high school student. The dialog that came from the children fit their ages. I'm off to find another Medeiros book."},{"Title":"One Night of Scandal","review":"Lottie Fairleigh is overindulged and not quite ready to grow up, in spite of the fact that her coming out party is tonight, delayed due to her antics in the past.The last thing the Murderous Marquess wants is another woman in his life. Hounded by enough scandal, he wants nothing to do with society. So when he catches Lottie peering in his window, he isn't quite sure what to do with her.This book is a fun look at a strong-willed, childish woman who is forced to grow up literally overnight. I cried through her trials and laughed at her blunders. In reading another review, I'm not sure I'd argue that Hayden did lack some redeeming qualities, but I could still understand the betrayal he felt, the brooding and the pain. He had moments of &#34;humanness&#34; that worked for me, and Lottie's effervescent personality more than compensated, as it was intended to.Reading Teresa Medeiros is like reading Victoria Holt for me. I know what to expect from her books, and she has yet to leave me disappointed."},{"Title":"Oprah Winfrey: Talk Show Host and Actress (Contemporary Women Series)","review":"This concise (128 pages) biography could be an inspiring read for teen age and older young women. Indicating that from humble beginnings and trying early circumstances, it is possible to dream a dream and achieve hearts' desire by engaging seriously, having enthusiasm and courage, and of course - always an element of luck!Raised by Grandmother Hattie Mae on a rural farm in the deep south, she was dearly loved though she was sometimes whipped with a switch so discipline could be maintained. Oprah says she could trace many of her solid character traits to formative years on the Mississippi farm. She reflects, I am what I am today because of my grandmother- my strength, my sense of reasoning, everything, all of that, was set by the time I was six years old.&quot;In her earliest years there was a serious lack of money and only necessities which could be grown on the farm or made at home were available. Even so, she started learning to read by age three and this desire to learn through reading is with Oprah all her life and provides the rungs upon which she climbs the ladder to fulfill her desire for success.When Oprah was eight, her father Vernon took her to live in Tennessee and helped guide her through her teen years. He helped channel her talents and boundless creative energies with reasonable discipline, consistency, structure, unwavering standards and love. A most important message in this background material is that these standards insisted upon by grandmother and father were the factors which enabled Oprah to lead such a meaningful life. All our children would greatly benefit from such attention by their caregivers, to these behavioral qualities which would enhance their lives.Oprah grew up performing at home, school and church, ever willing and creative. Her energy, fun and naturalness gave her the possibilities to win pageants - be hired as a radio announcer while still attending high school. Upward and onward to Television co-anchor, then her own show, film performances of exceptional quality, and no end in sight as one of Americas most successful and highly regarded entrepreneurs.I recommend this easy to read little book as an antidote to the influences of those of today's' &quot;idols&quot; who engage in flamboyantly detrimental activities, and are set up as role models by our impressionable youth.Let our young women read about and emulate a more positive ideal!"},{"Title":"100 Inspirational Favorites","review":"I love this book...many of the songs are unfamiliar to me and i have had a great time learning new music...i am a mediocre piano player and most of the music is a challenge for me...and i do love challenges, so , i have learned lots of new songs...the music is great for playing for offertories, preludes and postludes too."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Interlude (Zion Covenant, Book 4)","review":"This is the best book in the series by far! I say that partly because I love Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the musical West Side Story. Elements from both works are present here. Victoria's warning to Eli \\"Do not swear by the stars\\" brings to mind Juliet's \\"Swear not by the moon/The inconstant moon.\\" Eli cries out his beloved's name when a death occurs just as Tony cries out \\"Maria!\\" after the rumble. Also I like the change of scene. Elisa and Murphy are still present but the focus here is more on Shimon and Leah Feldstein, two of my favorite characters from A Daughter of Zion. Readers who have read the Zion Chronicles before this series will recognize Moshe Sachar and Rachel Lubetkin, principal characters in that series, and may be slighly surprised at the ending ofthis book. (Hint: Read over Gates of Zion first.)I hope that the fellow reviewer who wants to make movies makes a movie out of this some day!"},{"Title":"Jerusalem Interlude (Zion Covenant, Book 4)","review":"This book leaves Romeo and Juliet in the dust! If I were a movie director,(which I very well may end up being) I would definitely make a movie out of it!

In London, violinist Elisa Murphy finds a new orchestra position and awaits the birth of her first child. Elisa's father, former department store entrepreneur and former concentration camp inmate Theo Lindheim, finds himself facing a moral choice that could take him back inside Hitler's Germany. Leah and Shimon Feldstein, Elisa's dear friends from her Vienna Symphony days, arrive at last in British-occupied Palestine. And as German agents work to stir up the ancient hatred between Palestine's Arab citizens and the returning Jews who hope Britain will decide to partition the Holy Land and provide them with their own reborn country, rabbi-in-training Eli Sacher dreams about marrying his childhood friend Victoria Hassan - daughter of an Arab rug merchant, whose Western dress and job with the British occupiers gall her family.The Thoenes do a good job of writing Christians facing moral dilemmas, and of writing non-Christians journeying toward faith. There's little preaching here, and that makes this book far stronger than it would be otherwise. It's also an effectively told tale of international intrigue, and of human beings struggling with a world that is going mad all around them. The best of the series so far!

How a person can have \\"peace\\" in the midst of tribulation is a topic well explored in the tale told by the author. Can there be peace in the midst of a howling storm? I recommend this book to anyone really interested in pre-World War II history. One might first read the first three books in the ZION COVENANT series."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Interlude (Zion Covenant, Book 4)","review":"I have enjoyed this entire Series by Brock and Brodie Thoene. The history remains true while fictional characters are woven into it to create a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Interlude (Zion Covenant, Book 4)","review":"Jerusalem Interlude continues the sad history set to fiction. It captivates you as always, as the previous books did from the very beginning. Characters that have been with us since the first book like Elise and Murphey, Leah and Shimon, Anna and Theo continue to brave this dark world Hitler brought. New characters are introduced that are vital and show the schemes that Hitler put into play to reach his dark agenda. My favorite characters in this book are Eli Sachar and Victoria Hassan. They are from two different worlds, Eli a Jew studying to be a Rabbi and Victoria a Muslim promised in marrige to Ram Kadar in service to the Grand Mufti Haj Amin...but she is in love with Eli. She battles internaly with the violence of her people, even her own brothers against the Jews, and she must make a decision. In this book we are introduced also to how Poland enters this story and how the riots started there. We see historical figures that we will never forget also, Winston Churchill, Goebbles, British Ambassador Neville Henderson and many more. Each are given a unique voice. We grow to love or deeply hate each one. But most importantly we see history, we see how it unfolded. We often wonder how it could have all happened. Brock and Bodie Thoene show us from the very first book the subtility with which it first began, and then we see how the fires of hatred grew and grew. We often wonder why no one did anything... these books show the twisted and sometimes well intentioned reasons why (though unexcusable). It took me a while to read this one just because it is packed with very heavy, very real emotions that make you think: What if this happened to me? Or if I had to stand up in such a time would I have the courage? Would I have acted differently then these people? But overall I loved this book, and I look forward to continuing this journey in the next one."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Interlude (Zion Covenant, Book 4)","review":"If you like History you will love this book it is a historical noval about the Nazi and how Hitler came to power and the brutality of his regime.

First of all, the terms used were clearly defined. I didn't have to wade through pages trying to find definitions. Secondly, the arguments presented were not only understandable, but usable. I felt I gained enough information about both sides to defend my position if I were involved in a discussion of this issue. Finally, the authors provided several questions at the end of each chapter that helped me think about what I'd read and gain a better understanding of the material.All in all, Evolution Shot Full of Holes is a book that I will refer back to and recommend to others."},{"Title":"Evolution Shot Full of Holes","review":"This book's introduction sums it up quite well: \\"The subject matter in this text is not comprehensive; rather, it was designed to be easily understood and persuasive\\" (p. 14). This book begins with a list of definitions that are unusually clear, alowing readers new to the topic to build a strong foundation. The training wheels come off after the introduction, however, and, to the credit of the author, the boxing gloves come out. In a most clear fashion, this book leaves the starting blocks of the introduction with a vengence and respectfully blows holes in a theory we were all taught to be concrete fact. Referring back to the quote in the introduction, I found this book to be both \\"easily understood and persuasive\\" - a definite gem in my referral catalog."},{"Title":"Evolution Shot Full of Holes","review":"Upon reading this book you will dicover that there are no arguments that can disprove evolution.

People who do not believe in evolution believe that god created the earth within the last 10,000 years, despite a fossil record that goes back hundreds of millions of years.You can pretend there is no evolution if you want to look like a childish fool.

It was also a good guideline for those of us who don't understand taxes very well and are more familiar with the EZ-forms. This was my second year doing the long form with all the attached schedules and the book helped me develop an understanding of what the majority of the terms and references mean. However, since the level of information was BASIC, some of my questions were not addressed and I did not like how the book stated, &quot;...see your tax advisor...&quot;. The whole reason I bought the book was so that I wouldn't have to have someone else do my taxes. Although there are only a few unanswered questions for my case, this still prevented me from completing them on my own. Some topics that should be addressed more thoroughly are Capital Gains, Corporate Relocations, and Itemized Deductions. At a minimum, this book should provide a complete listing of topics not covered thoroughly enough to complete the tax forms, and refer you to another book (For Dummies)instead of a legal IRS publication (or tax advisor)."},{"Title":"Taxes For Dummies 2005","review":"Taxes for Dummies made me so much more knowledgeable about the basics about taxes. It explains the basic items in simple terms, and even expands on items if you dare to want to know more. The tips were a great help as well. I now know the difference among the 1040EZ, 1040A, and 1040. I know when I can itemize and when I shouldn't. It also gave great tips on what I can deduct. If I had not read this book, I would not have known to deduct the interest paid on my student loan (and I didn't even have to use Form 1040!) It is also worth mentioning that I finished the book in one day! I highly recommend this book to people with beginner and intermediate knowledge of taxes."},{"Title":"Taxes For Dummies 2005","review":"This book tries it's hardest to explain taxes in an easy to understand fashion for us normal people who don't have time to look through those extremely complex IRS instructions and other gibberish they give us taxpayers. The book does a pretty decent job of it too (however to accomplish that flawlessly, in my humble opinion, is impossible). Overall, any individual or small business that needs a few clues on how to do your taxes can benefit from this book. I can't wait for the 2001 edition to come out!"},{"Title":"Taxes For Dummies 2005","review":"I like this book a lot, because it gave me great ideas about how to structure my finances to take advantage of the tax deductions the government provides.While the book makes it easy to read and understand your tax return, it fails in its efforts to make complicated tax issues simple. In many cases, I found more questions than answers, particularly in the parts that talk about the section 179 deduction and the modifications made after September 11, 2001.If you are looking to be able to read and understand your tax return and to identify the tax deductions that are available, this is a great book.

The writers have done an excellent job of turning IRS technical jargon into something we can actually understand.The only book that guides you step by step to dealing with the IRS.

Silverman, authors) continues in the vein of previous editions. It attempts to explain all issues regarding personal income taxes in the most light hearted manner possible, and whenever possible to avoid the more technical prose of IRS manuals and other similarly inclined tax books. The 1997 tax law changes are presented in a clear, and whenever possible, humorous manner. TAXES FOR DUMMIES, as its name implies, is aimed at novice taxpayers and preparers. As such, it does not cover everything its competitors do, but for most should get the job done. Even with the most complex of tax subject matter, it never fails to be entertaining, and is often hilarious."},{"Title":"Taxes For Dummies 2005","review":"This is not &quot;For Dummies.&quot; This is for experts. Too long; too hard; written for &quot;one guy in Western Iowa with a weird problem.&quot;Tax Survival Kit (only $5+; not $11+ too) is a real &quot;For Dummies&quot; book. 100 odd pages; neat, clean, and a Teamster like me can make cents out of it.If the book had a title such as &quot;Taxes for Accountants&quot; I would say great. But, it is false advertising to say it is &quot;For Dummies.&quot;The authors did great work, I think (to the extent I can tell). Just flying under the wrong colors as we used to say in the Army.Don't blame the authors; talk to the publisher."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"As I began to read this book, and the insightful remark that people tend to find the past grander than the present was made, I thought I was reading an introduction by a modern author. Thucydides is not only a good author, but an admirably resourceful and analytical philosopher. For instance, when tidal waves were destroying towns, he was keen enough to realize that they were the result of earthquakes, instead of mindlessly writng it off to the wrath of the gods. But this history is by know means dry. His account of the plague in Athens, and the speeches and battles he recorded were all very interesting and at times extroardinarily dramatic. I think this book is the lost treasure of the library, exiled to some remote shelf, not having been checked out since 1985, binding shredded and falling off, but as they say, never judge a book by it's cover.P.S. I'm not flaming any one, but when I read the top review on this page, I was offended. The fact that they (he, she, it)condemned this book without basis, and most likely, without reading it, probably made someone decide not to read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Other reviewers have commented extensively on the significance of Thucydides' History and its place in the pantheon of historical literature. Given a choice of translators and publishers, my focus is on some of the characteristics of this particular edition to aid in making a purchasing decision.This version of the History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides appears to be a reprint excerpted from an older work -- \\"Thucydides, translated into English, to which is prefixed an essay on inscriptions and a note on the geography of Thucydides\\", by Benjamin Jowett. Second edition. Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1900. Jowett was a prolific translator of Greek texts. A search on his name on the Amazon site will yield a huge number of hits. The 1960 Bantam Classics edition of the History claimed Jowett's translation as definitive.The key point I want to make is that there are neither translator notes nor historical commentary in this reprint. There is also no publisher information anywhere in this book, making it difficult to track down the sources for this edition. Furthermore, all of the editorial comments on the Amazon page for this book refer to **other** editions, not the one you are purchasing from this page, and which might erroneously lead one to believe that there is historical background included in this particular book.Finally, this book is available as an e-book for free under Creative Commons License, according to the terms of which, I believe, this reprint should have included the original attribution that I've given here.In summary, this book is a complete translation of Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War by a well-regarded translator. It is however, a bare-bones edition without additional historical background on either the author or the content of this work."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"This is the most objective and readable contemporary history ever written. Only in classical Greece could a work at once so sympathetic and objective be created. Thucydides was an Athenian and served as a general in their army, but first and foremost he was a Greek. Because of this he did not slander Athens' enemies or feel the need cast the Athenians' actions in a glorious, righteous light. Every chapter shines with brilliance and humanity, particularly the section on the plague which hit Athens when it was already in a crisis. I'm actually tempted to call this 2,000 year old history a page-turner."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Thucydides earned an honored spot among ancient writers by being one of the first to break with the old ways. Up to his time natural disasters, national defeat and personal tragedies were blamed on the &quot;gods&quot;. This remained true even when the writers themselves doubted the existence of those beings.Thucydides took part in the famous war between Athens and Sparta and somehow made the decision to - for the first time - write a factual historical record of the events instead of using legends and tales. He conducted interviews, traveled for first-hand investigation and laid out not only the war but the political and social conditions that surrounded the event.If one were to judge the work based on the literary quality of the content it would be difficult to award the five stars. But the translator has made the best of an old style of writing that is detailed, pedantic and remorseless with the facts and consequences of mistakes. It is a miracle - and a blessing - that some anonymous scribe in a small room with candle and quill undertook the task of replicating his words for us almost 2,500 years later."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"The reason books become classics is they convey wisdom pertanent to all ages. This history is one such classic example of Rhetoric, RealPolitik, Politics of Personality, as well as the higher themes of Honor, Loyalty, Duty, Courage. etc.I'd give the book five stars but this translation is only adequate. I loved having the greek on the page opposite the english translation, as well as the convenient, carry-anywhere size of the text.A must read if you wish to be considered truely educated."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Thucydides (about 460-395 BCE) was a Greek historian who is considered the first \\"scientific\\" historian, because of his lack of reference to the gods, as well as his strict standards for gathering evidence. This book tells the story of the war between Sparta and Athens, up to the year 411.He admits in his Introduction, \\"In this history I have made use of set speeches some of which were delivered just before and others during the war. I have found it difficult to remember the precise words used in the speeches which I listened to myself and my various informants have experienced the same difficulty; so my method has been, while keeping as closely as possible to the general sense of the words that were actually used, to make the speakers say what, in my opinion, was called for by each situation.\\" (Pg. 47) He adds, \\"My work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever.\\" (Pg. 48)Pericles laments, \\"There is often no more logic in the course of events than there is in the plans of men, and this is why we usually blame our luck when things happen in ways that we did not expect.\\" (Pg. 119) Cleon suggests, \\"a city is better off with bad laws, so long as they remain fixed, than with good laws that are constantly being altered.\\" (Pg. 213)Brasidas (who \\"was not at all a bad speaker, for a Spartan\\"; pg. 315) said, \\"For it is more disgraceful, at least for those who have a name to lose, to gain one's ends by deceit which pretends to be morality than by open violence.\\" (Pg. 317) Some Athenians asserted that \\"One is not so much frightened of being conquered by a power which rules over others... as of what would happen if a ruling power is attacked and defeated by its own subjects.\\" (Pg. 402)Any library of ancient history would benefit from this excellent edition of Thucydides' epic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The history of the Peloponnesian War","review":"Athens has Sparta by the throat, suing for peace.

However, this book gave me other ideas and choices I hadn't considered; some of which would work pretty well for my situation. I don't necessarily enjoy reading business or tax books, but this one was surprisingly easy to read and understand.

The sections on CRUTs, Installment Sales, and 1031 Tax Free Exchanges were very helpful and thorough. It is somewhat technical information, but written in a manner that a layman (non-CPA) can understand. My only complaint is that he doesn't address the implications of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) anywhere in the book, and it has become a VERY significant consideration for selling highly appreciated property. The other thing I noticed is that his evaluation of TIC 1031 Exchanges covers some of the risks, but neglects to mention that the vast majority of 1031 TICs include HUGE fees or loads. One I examined had a 20% profit to the sales company when the property was flipped to the 1031 investors. Most have 8% - 12% commissions to the salesman.

I remember seeing a segment of this on HBO's Real Sex and did not remember hearing about the roots of this erotic poetry, which involved coming to fruition as an educational as well as erotic tool to teach about AIDS awareness as a result of the death of rapper, Easy E; so I was really surprised while reading through this book.Usually when I think Erotica--I am not thinking sex education.The informational facts laced in between the erotic poetry and short stories is done in very tasteful fashion. I found myself taken on the highs of the erotic words that leapt from the pages--even reading them aloud at times, but then felt grounded again and given a reality check and a dose of reality on the pages that have the informational sexual health facts that are printed in bold. These words were typed in stark contrast from the poetry and story writing and it literally leapt off of the pages to grab my attention and definitely educated me. I say job well done.I am really glad to have this as an addition to my library and highly recommend it to others. Sex education, in my opinion, is key and what a way to combine it with erotica. It gets kudos from me.Reviewed by Coulee EidosAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","review":"the title is verbal penetration if your interested get it you wont be disappointed and for whoever knows of the poets you should already know xo"},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","review":"I was up at all hours of the night reading this book!

The poem that I enjoyed the most was \\"Casting Satan\\". It was so short yet said so much. \\"Before you command Satan to get thee behind you... make sure that God has your back. Otherwise keep that demon where you can see him.\\" Jessica Holter has alot on her mind in this book, and I for one am glad that she was blessed with the opportunity to let us hear what she had to say."},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","review":"This book was everything I expected and more.

Interspersed between the pages of poetry and short stories, are jolting black pages that contain serious sex education and social commentary.This unique compilation is included in the Zane Presents series and rightly so. While I enjoyed every single poem, some were so profound, I had to close the book to take a few moments to absorb the full meaning of the words penned by the incredibly brilliant, Ms. Holter.Lady's Room is one of the many thought-provokng pieces, Pussy Talk is both, whimsical and sensual.I didn't read Verbal Penetration in any specific order, I opened the book at random places and was always rewarded with juicy material. I highly recommend Verbal Penetration; it's a must have, so make sure you get some punany right away!"},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","review":"Those familiar with the Real Sex series on HBO, will remember the airing of The Punany Poets, which gave a glimpse into the creativity behind a group of African-American poets who perform erotic poetry with a safe-sex message. VERBAL PENETRATION is the offering of over 90 poems extolling messages of eroticism, safety, pain, hurt and much more.The Punany Poets offer poetry of varying styles, but all are understandable. With such a voluminous presentation, it was hard to choose the poems I liked most. A few stood out because their stories were filled with emotional depth such as \\"Daddy Sam\\", \\"Hood Wife\\" and \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\". \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" was one of my absolute favorites because it shares how a father wants forgiveness from a daughter he hurt, and how she invites him to seek salvation elsewhere. A few other poems were stand outs but due to their racy titles I will not mention them, but know VERBAL PENETRATION covers sexuality and all the ranges, from abuse to the beauty of eroticism. Also, juxtaposed are pages similar to public service announcements about safe-sex, statistics, HIV/AIDS and even definitions for sexual terms.VERBAL PENETRATION is to be read with a slow, steady pace to insure readers will garner the message the poet is trying to convey. Besides the sexy poetry there is an educational factor which enhances the collection. With such a large number of poems there will be poems you like and some you won't, but the overall message will grab your attention as you leisurely read this compilation.Reviewed by Cashana Sealsof The RAWSISTAZ(tm) Reviewers"},{"Title":"Verbal Penetration","review":"I have not yet purchased this book. but if you have ever watched real sex hbo, you know that jessica holter is a talented, beautiful poet and so is her people. her poems are thoughtful and stimulating. perfect to read with a partner or someone you want to be a partner"},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"Out of all the Silverberg books (or the classic ones at least) this has to be the most direct and least complex out of all of them. The plot is fairly simple, a rigid Earth government sentenced all its dissidents to a station billions of years in the past and with the way technolongy is, they can only move time in one direction, that being back. So they're all stuck there. The leader of the camp, Barrett, isn't the first one there but has been there the longest but recently was crippled, making him doubt his continued usefulness. The character of Barrett is fleshed out remarkably well, showing both how such a man became a political activist and how he holds up against the pressure of being stranded forever. Silverberg also showz us everyone else in the camp, and shows how they didn't take the pressure so well. If Silverberg had just stuck with the stories on Hawksbill Station then the book would be little more than highly entertaining genre SF but because of his deep delving into the characters he manages to make several pointed political comments in general that aren't the least bit dated, which is the point. Definitely lacks some of the intensity of his later works, as well as some emotional involvement but still stands head and shoulders above a lot of what is out there today."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"This book is about political prisoners who are exiled back in time a billion years to the cambrian period in a place called Hawksbill Station. There is nothing but solid rock, no plants or animals on land, only in the sea. The story alternates between the cambrian and the present. Most of the men at Hawksbill are losing their minds because of the deprevation. I found those chapters interesting. The chapters from the present time focused on what landed the main character in Hawksbill. They aren't all that interesting, unless you like reading ca. 1960's political subversion. The writing is great, typical Silverberg, and a well told story. But I didn't like it enough to give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"One of the more &quot;conventional&quot; science fiction novels that came out of Silverberg's most fruitful period, Hawksbill Station is still pretty much a classic, mostly for his vivid imagination and deep streak of humanity that colors all of his best work. In this novel, a brutal yet humane US government has taken any dissidents they find too dangerous to be left around and sent them back to Hawksbill Station, a billion years in the past, and unable to get back to the future because time travel apparently works only one way. The prisoners are led by Barrett, who has been there the longest (though he's not the first, the others have all since died from old age) and he presides over a lot of men who are without hope, without women (that seems to bother them a lot) and for the most part going absolutely crazy trying to deal with the fact that everything they have ever known is forever lost to them, friends, family, everything. To add to this, Barrett has recently had his foot crushed in a rockslide and this once proud strong man is forced to hobble around like the weakest cripple. Into all of this comes a new stranger, one who seems to hide a secret that could change them all. Meaty stuff and Silverberg tells it with such ease that the plot seems effortless and ends after the perfect length of time, nothing feels rushed or slowed and the pace never slackens. Along the way Silverberg fills in the life of Barrett with numerous flashbacks and the cutting between his past life and his current life create a great if artificial kind of suspense even if you do know what's going to happen, it still makes your heart quiver. And through these, as with all Silverberg's best work, we learn about what makes Barrett the man tick, what made him join the revolutionaries, what made him think he could change the world and how it helps him cope a billion years before everything. Unfortunately totally out of print these days, it's a book well worth trying to find in a used book store, along with all of his books from this period, not a sequel in the lot and they're all finely honed exmainations of science fiction. If any of this plot sounds familar to you it's probably because they've all become staples of science fiction plots, imitated by hundred of writers in an attempt to better the master, while some are inspired to seek out new pathways to explore. And that's probably the best praise a writer can get."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"Robert Silverberg strikes gold with Hawksbill Station (1968), a dark, restrained, and powerful rumination. Hawksbill Station\`s setting, Earth's Cambrian era, provides the perfect backdrop for the all-too human dramas that unfold. Jim Barrett's flashbacks enhance the poignant loneliness and sense of missed opportunity that pervades every page. The pangs of old age, responsibility, and disability that afflict the elderly Barrett are convincingly portrayed. Silverberg's use of time travel is limited, simplistic, and solely to facilitate the novel's basic premise. Thankfully it's not a cool gadget to expound endlessly on, to construct bizarre paradoxes, to kill world leaders and accidentally meet ones own parents i.e. the gaudy/silly type of time travel I despise (well, most of the time).Hawksbill Station should be high on any sci-fi fan's MUST be read soon pile.Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)Hawksbill Station is a penal colony in the Cambrian era for political dissidents of an oppressive but humane future Earth. The penal colony is only for men for fear that if there were women they might reproduce causing drastic consequences for Earth's timeline.The most disturbing aspect of the novel is the fact that time travel is a oneway process. The dissidents which are sent back are unable to ever return to their time. The prisoners occasionally receive supplies, games, and tools through the time machine (called the Anvil) but are unable to communicate their needs to the \\"present.\\" These factors create intense isolation and claustrophobia.The landscape of Cambrian Earth adds to the claustrophobia. The land is barren rock. The colony, consisting of prefabricated plastic huts, is perched high above the ocean. The ocean is teaming with trilobites and other animals. The inhabitants of the station supplement their diet with trilobites and one prisoner even starts a scientific study of trilobites despite the fact that he'll never be able to communicate his knowledge to Earth's present.The barren landscape, the disconnect from the present, the absence of activities to occupy oneself, the absence of women/family/lovers drives many of the inhabitants into despair. A large percentage of the population are considered insane and have to be cared for by the rest.One of the few remaining sane men is the one-time revolutionary Jim Barrett, the crippled 60-year old leader of the colony. It is from his perspective and flashbacks that the novel unfolds. We learn how Barrett became the leader of a revolutionary movement on Earth that never \\"did\\" anything but instead devolved into sessions of endless arguments over ideology. We learn about Hawksbill, the corpulent inventor of the time machine and his one-time role in the revolutionary movement. We learn about Barrett's intelligent lover, Barrett's rivalries, his eventual imprisonment. Even Barrett's depressing flashbacks provide relief from the claustrophobia of life in Hawksbill Station and Barrett's daily routine of caring for the disillusioned and insane.The Hawksbill Station portion of the \\"plot\\" concerns the arrival of the mysterious Law Hahn who lacks any firm political beliefs (unlike the other prisoners who were sent to the colony because of their radical stances).I won't spoil any of the the mystery but the end is spot on and unforced.Final ThoughtsJim Barrett is one of best realized characters I've ever come across in science fiction. He's old enough that he can reminisce about his youth. Likewise, he derives his will to live from caring for the others in the colony, a role that is challenged by his recent crippling foot injury. Barrett's flashbacks to his revolutionary past reveal the emptiness and aimlessness of his previous life and despite being severed from the world he was born in he is able to find purpose, however hollow it might seem, in his position as leader of the penal colony.The tone of the novel is one of intense isolation and claustrophobia. The characters struggle to find meaning and purpose in their world and many completely are unable to do so. One writes a book on trilobites, another (verging on insane) attempts to construct a portal with his mind to the \\"present\\", others cry endlessly in bed, another (Barrett's old friend) lies drugged by the doctor all day in his hammock.In my top five favorite science fiction novels. Silverberg at his best. I highly recommend Hawksbill Station to all sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"The authorities have come up with an unconventional but effective way of controlling dissidents. Send them back a billion or so years into the past. A bit hard to escape from there, really.When a new prisoner is sent back, the current top dog, an aging main with a recent serious injury has to try and hang onto his life, and work out what is up with the new guy."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"I find it fascinating that so many SF novels that are considered classics are out of print. This one currently is not available (though used copies are always available in large quantities), but it has been printed and reprinted so often in the past that I'm sure it is just a matter of time before a new edition appears. Certainly it has more relevance at the present than at times in the past, when we have seen our political leaders more willing than ever to squelch political dissent and label those not agreeing with administration policy as unpatriotic and even un-American (ignoring Teddy Roosevelt's insistence that dissenting from public policies that one disagrees with is the essence of patriotism).I am currently in the middle of a reading project in which I'm working my way through a number of dystopian novels. These present a number of ways in which society could go wrong, whether through ecological disaster (as in the novels of Kim Stanley Robinson) or economic and societal collapse (Octavia Butler's Earthseed novels), or political repression, as in George Orwell's 1984 or in this novel. What is remarkable about the best of these novels are the ways they highlight real possibilities within our own society. The most encouraging thing about America -- at least to date -- has been that we have remained remarkably tolerant of dissent. Even in the fifties and during the Bush years it has been possible to dissent with prevailing political policies. I see this -- though perhaps I'm being an optimist -- as the furthest swing toward intolerance of which we seem to be capable. But there have been times when we've branded as un-American those who don't agree with majority or dominant opinion (they are not the same thing).I found the structure of this novel to be fascinating. The plot is simple: a totalitarian rightist regime is so intolerant of political dissent that it sends all major political prisoners back in time a billion years, well before the evolution of the dinosaurs. The principles of travel backwards in time were developed by a mathematician named Hawksbill (something that I found interesting, since even our greatest physicists are always great at math), hence the name of the station to which political dissidents are sent. The novel is told in both present narrative time and in flashbacks. What is interesting about this is that usually in novels the flashback is to an earlier date. Here the flashbacks are to the distant future, while the \\"present\\" exists in the late Cambrian period.I found both central narratives to be very interesting and a lot of fun. The very end I found somewhat contrived, as if merely a way to wrap things up, rather than an end toward which the two narratives were leading. Still, this was one of those occasions when a classic SF novel fully lived up to its reputation. Hopefully it will be back in print sometime soon."},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"Political prisoners are sentenced to exile one billion years in the past, before the appearance of the first land-dwelling lifeforms. The story alternates between the exiles in the past, ageing and battling mental illness brought on by their isolation, and the activities that resulted in their sentences. The primary character, Jim Barrett, struggles to maintain his deteriorating community while investigating the puzzle of a new prisoner who is unlike any of the others. The end is a bit unsatisfying--merely a conversation that wraps up the various plot points. Published in 1967, this novel nevertheless includes some startling predictions of later political developments, including an inconclusive presedential election that had very unfortunate results!"},{"Title":"Hawksbill Station","review":"Jim Barret is an old and crippled man, but he is the leader of a group of political exiles, exiled 1 billion years in the past.

I think the author Karl Thelen, showed a lot of points that most people do not think about everyday. Schools have changed, and Karl was not afraid to point out the reasons and faults.As I was reading, I thought a lot about what I see with my children currently attending school, and the relevation was a scary one. As far as the \\"teacher types\\" I was able to identify the types with teachers I have come across. I was in school 15+ years ago, and the way that education has changed is a discrace to the public education system. Karl pointed a lot of the aspects out. And I firmly believe someone needs to take a long hard look at the teachers, administraters, and all other aspects of the public education system, a change needs made.I bought thios book to read due to problems with my step-daughters education (she has a learning disability due to premature birth) and what could be done. After reading this book I feel very confident that I am armed with the knowledge to better deal with the persons involved to get done what I feel needs to be done.On a personal note about Karl, who is a teacher himself, he is great. I am attending college classes and Karl is my professor. He is very interactive in class, responding to our questions and offering tips and suggestions to help. Karl is the type of teacher that every styudent needs to succeed in education.

The Jewish ethical work called Ethics of the Fathers 1:2 reports that Simon the Just said that the earth endures because of three things, two of which are religious: \\"Torah, divine worship, and acts of loving-kindness.\\" However, in 1:18 of the same volume, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel offers a practical idea, \\"the world rests on three things: truth, justice, and peace.\\" Henrik Ibsen has a similar view.The protagonist in this excellent play is Bernick, is a highly respected owner of a ship building business. Bernick lives in a society that he controls because of his wealth and the prestige that wealth produces. He donated many items to his community and placed his name on them. At one point in the play there is a mass demonstration of citizens praising him.But Ibsen shows us why we should despise him. Bernick insists that his community follow the traditional ways, meaning the behavior that the masses sanctioned for some generations, notions that they read into the Bible although a fair reading would not find them, ideas that stagnate human development and societal advancement, thoughts that enlightened people reject. He views women as inferior to men, childlike, foolish, unable to understand, beings that should be subservient to men. He talks down to his wife during the few times that he talks to her. Outrageously, he says to her at one point, as if he were speaking to a wall, I have no one to talk to. Dina, a young woman who he squashes because of his view of women, says that her life in this city is \\"so proper and so moral\\" that it is impossible to live with these people. Lona, another character, comes to Bernick's house, to \\"let in fresh air.\\"Ibsen shows that Bernick is a hypocrite, a liar, a crook, a man who intends, in a Bernie Madoff fashion, to steal from people who trust him, a man who could care less about seeing people die if he can make money. He persuaded a close relative into taking the blame for one of his crimes, and this individual suffered for more than a decade because of it.Ibsen ends his book by saying that the true builders of society are not people, but \\"the spirit of truth and the spirit of freedom,\\" the very things that Bernick squashed."},{"Title":"The Face of Time","review":"FACE OF EVIL tells a story of horror and suspense that builds steadily to its terrifying end.

To make matters worse, the townspeople are less than cooperative. This problem, they say, requires a magical solution from practitioners of the &quot;Old Religion.&quot; FACE OF EVIL is some of Bacon-Smith's very best writing. Readers of her &quot;Deamon&quot; novels should be aware that this novel does not take place in the same setting, and does not have the light humorous touch of EYES OF THE EMPRESS.

Zoroaster) and an incarnation of the entity who at one time would incarnate as Jesus the Nazarene.].Recorded are explanation of heridity - and how heridity is the only way to develop (organs of) the physical body... developing the organ for understanding the divine (brains) for example.This led to (eventually) the possibility of the \\"perfect\\" (enough) body for Jesus... as recorded in Matthew 1:17.Recorded is - at length - about bloodline, heridity and how it started with wisdom of Zarathustra.[Add 3: In his version of the Gospel, Matthew put emphasis on historical facts - both physically, mentally and spiritually - placing more emphasis on one or the other during description of an event (while at the same time recognizing all three layers are sometimes intermixed), some easier to detect than others.With the intent to record historical information, not to be lost, Matthew has recorded relative many details of the events that had taken place (more detailed description than recording by Mark e.g.).]Recorded is how is communicated about 4th cultural epoch (Roman-Greco) and about that people are going into the 5th cultural epoch (European-American).Recorded is about the twelve signs of the Zodiac - and all needs to be seen from each one of those perspectives (so: 12 perspectives... and do this 7 times for each perpective -- as the spirals / chakra's in Eastern philosphy).[These 12 perspectives are recorded in the book of Joshua and termed \\"tribes\\"... each tribe represents one perspective, one of the Zodiac signs...].In in are recorded the Nazarene movement (having existed before the emergence of the Essenes and Therapeutae), and that in the Bible this movement was termed \\"Nazareth\\", which taught about avoiding meat and alcohol to allow the human soul to overcome obstacles (for spiritual development / enlightment) in the physical- and ether body more easily.In relationship to this is communicated about Jeshu ben Pandira.One of his disciples - Nezer - is the one who cultivated the wisdom of the Nazarene movemement and established a colony: Nazareth. So Nazareth was the name of the Essene colony who perserved the wisdom of the Nazarene wisdom. Jesus was intended to grow up in that community... \\"He shall be called a Nazarene\\" (Matthew 2:23).The numbers used: any large group of people were described as \\"thousand\\" with a specific number added to it relating to the most characteristic features / elements of that group of people. (Read \\"Numbers\\" in the Bible).So much is recorded about how past led to what is in the present (= present in Moses' time)... a historical book... a book of the times from the first forming of the bodies that would eventually allow the incarnation of that entity named as Jesus to become Christ.PSTexts between [] are not from recordings in the book, but added to help make the rest of text more understandable."},{"Title":"The Stars Around Us: A Science Fiction Anthology","review":"10 stories by: Jack Williamson- The Peddler's Nose, James Gunn - The Listeners, Christopher Anvil- Ghost Fleet, Alfred Bester - Fondly Fahrenheit, Frederik Pohl- With Redfern on Capella Xii, John Jakes - Underfollow, Isaac Asimov - The Feeling of Power, Poul Anderson- The Helping Hand, James Blish - A Work of Art & Robert Zelazny - The great Slow Kings"},{"Title":"Passion D'Amour","review":"Anne-Marie Villefranche's books have been published and re-published as stand alone novels, and, most vexingly as mutliple book novels such as this book Passion D'Amour, with, a new title that has a tendency to obscure the original titles. So, if your are like moi, an afficionado of erotica the chances are excellent that you will have multiple copies of this authors' book ..... that may be the bad news, but, the good news is that her books are fabulous enough that you'll always have a copy nearby to read when you want to while away solitary moments.This book has two full novels....1) Palisir d'Amour 2) Joi d'AmourIn Plaisir the author takes us on a rollercoaster ride of 10 short stories with different characters, plots and settings. Each story of approximately 20 to 30 pages is so well written and so well developed that the reader does not feel cheated after finishing the story and demnding more. Each story has its own climax (so to say) and the characters are so well developed to make the tale viable.The author very masterfully is able to tell a story without having to get into lengthly set-up before the story even begins. She does this by very deftly tying all the characters together as the sons, daughters, wives etc of a large well known and libidinous Parisienne family in the 1920's .... absolutely marvellous ....To give you a flavour of the book, in the first story, Jeanne Takes A Lover' we find the young Christophe Brissard (some think this is the author's family) meeting the very married Jeanne Vernay (another well known Parisienne family) at a family dinner. Jeanne visits Christophe in his bedroom, after everyone went to bed, and our two lovers waste little time in tasting the fruits of the flesh. Jeanne however keeps warning Christophe that during his lovemaking he takes her to heights she has never been before and she is very scared. Their secret encounters continue while Christphe and jeanne slowly teach each other to let loose their inhibitions.In Joie d'Amour we find a similar number of scrumptios short stories. In 'A Lesson for Bernard' a young Bernard Gaillard meets a married Simone Lebrun at a Brissard family dinner. Since taking a lover is such a very very French thing to do Simone and Bernard eventually find themselves together in bed whereSimone is more intersted in using her hands to make love to Bernard than other parts of her body. Although she gives in to Bernards requirment to complete the sex act, Simone simply explains to him that this does not give her the ultimatepleasure she yearns for, but, she would just rather play with him using her hands. The young Bernard is so disconcerted he seeks the advice of more learned friends to be able to reconcile Simones wants and wishes to his desire to continue the clandestine affair....Wonderfull works of erotic literature I recommend any of Veillefranches book highly ...."},{"Title":"Passion D'Amour","review":"Anne Marie Villefranche's erotica is a cut above. Set among the Paris wealthy with whom she lived in the 1920s, she writes about the sex game as they played it, with a certain universality that transcends the place and the era. Not only is she inventive in her situations, she creates real characters. She has the ability to see the world through the eyes of each of her characters. She gets the different reasons a wealthy woman might have an affair - because she's bored, because her husband's lovemaking efforts are perfunctory, because he no longer pays amorous attention to her, because she's angry at him for having an affair of his own, or just because. She understands why a wealthy man might do same - because it's Paris and that's what you do!She weaves the social cross-currents that affect such considerations into it - how people's own status, and their consideration of that of others, affects the romantic and erotic choices they make. She is delightfully free of postmodern ranting about sexuality, allowing her characters to love where desire and circumstance take them. She does not begrudge her male characters their lusts while celebrating those of women, a common hypocrisy today.Villefranche's women characters, though, often assert their powers by playing games so subtle their male counterparts can't detect or comprehend them - the man who thinks he is seducing when in fact he is being seduced, or who does not see that he himself is the sex toy, when he thought it was the other way around. She makes men and women equal players, and gets convincingly into the heads of each side.Her work is mostly short stories, enabling her to create a situation and work characeters through it without belaboring it. Her writing and sensibilities are delicate without being tedious, and humorous without being slapstick. She attains a vivid realism. In one story several brothers all vie to seduce the visiting Italian wife of a cousin - and they all do, without a single one detecting her ulterior motive. This is enjoyable and intelligent fiction about sex."},{"Title":"Passion D'Amour","review":"Was this collection of stories actually written by Anne-Marie Villefranche, or is it the creation of her modern-day granddaughter? I'm not sure, but it probably doesn't matter.Usually, erotic short stories are dissatisfying because they don't allow for much character development. Not true, however, in this case. Most of these are long enough for the author to weave a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the characters, and most of the stories are very titillating, as well.Were French women of the early 1900s really so sophisticated and also sufficiently liberated to have (and lustfully enjoy) all of these sexual adventures? In every encounter they climax easily and usually more than once. Not a single one of these leisure-class ladies gives a second thought to engaging in casual adultery, and most don't seem to resent their husband's sexual adventures with other ladies.The author is not quite as explicit as female authors of today's erotica-for-women or (HEA \\"romantica\\"). But the sex scenes are sufficiently explicit to arouse the reader's libido. And that's really the point, isn't it?"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I have always been interested in the advanced Native American tribes.

The results were indeed devastating to the 'Indians' throughout North, Central and South America, but what is much less known were the ecological effects that occured in the decades after contact, once 95% of the PEOPLE living in 'the New World' were wiped out by diseases. The huge herds of bison seen by Europeans once they pushed into the West, the enormous flocks of passenger pigeons and much, much more, ALL were the result of that loss of humanity, leading to a very false European/American interpretation of what 'the American wilderness' was like, not realising that in fact, virtally NONE of it was 'wilderness,' but a landscape that had been essentially CREATED by th previous inhabitants."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is a delightful read.

It is a wonderful lesson to \\"deep ecology\\" ideologues, all of them devoid of real knowledge and at best armchair romantics.

Large population centers existed not only in South American but also in North America. There is much to learn and much to mourn. Within 150 plus years the Europeans managed inadvertently and/or on purpose to wipe out 90% of the population, hence their thinking that North America was a land empty of people. Smallpox, measles, Hepatitis, ignorance and greed caused this devastation. The triple alliance of Central America had the &#34;zero&#34; before the Arabs and tribes in South America terrace farmed before the Chinese. Large population centers existed along the Amazon and the jungle was tamed. This is just three of the nuggets learned. Archeologist and Anthropologists are still uncovering and documenting what existed and lost.These conquered people were not the &#34;savages&#34; that discoverers would have had us believe.

It seemed so dry and boring, BUT, I started to read a little more and started to get more interested in the book. The more I read, the more I kept going. It isn't the easiest read, sometimes I felt that it was like reading a school history text book from cover to cover. Very dry reading, BUT, I kept at it. After completing the book (very glad I did), I learned so much about Indian life before and after Columbus. It is very informative about Indian life in the Americas and how it changed after it was colonized by Europeans. The Europeans' progress in the Americas pretty much destroyed the native Indian way of life in the Americas. This book is very informative on the subject.

It turns out that yesterday's historians, anthropologists, paleontologists, and ecologists got it pretty much all wrong.As Charles C. Mann explains, in this recently revised edition of his 2006 bestseller, latter-day investigations in all these fields have turned up persuasive evidence that the Americas before Columbus were far more heavily populated, the leading civilizations far more sophisticated, and their origins far further back in time than earlier generations of scholars had suspected.'\\"In 1491 the Inka ruled the greatest empire on earth. Bigger than Ming Dynasty China, bigger than Ivan the Great's expanding Russia, bigger than Songhay in the Sahel or powerful Great Zimbabwe in the West Africa tablelands, bigger than the cresting Ottoman Empire.\\" And population density both in the Andes and in Mesoamerica was the highest in the world: \\"the central Mexican plateau alone had a population of 25.2 million. By contrast, Spain and Portugal together had fewer than ten million inhabitants.\\" Central Mexico housed more than twice as many people per square mile as China or India.'The deciding factors in the Europeans' legendary ease of conquest were disease (smallpox above all) and political infighting within native communities. Compiling recent studies, Mann estimates that \\"In the first 130 years of contact about 95 percent of the people in the Americas died\\" -- and, more to the point, smallpox and other virulent diseases sped through both North and South America far more quickly than the conquerors. \\"Smallpox visited before anyone in South America had even seen Europeans . . . The first whites to explore many parts of the Americas therefore would have encountered places that were already depopulated.\\"'The legendary bloodthirstiness of the Aztec (more properly called the Triple Alliance) needs to be seen in context. \\"If England had been the size of the Triple Alliance, it would have executed on average, about 7,500 people per year, roughly twice the number Cortes estimated for the (Aztec) empire. France and Spain were still more bloodthirsty than England.\\"'\\"The corpus of writings in classical Nahuatl, the language of the Alliance, is even larger than the corpus of texts in Classical Greek.\\"'Recent archaeological excavations have pushed back the date of arrival of homo sapiens in the Western Hemisphere from around 9000 B.C.E. to as much as 30,000 or 40,000 BCE. One site on the Peruvian coast, Aspero, \\"might win the title of the world's oldest city -- the place where human civilization began.\\" And \\"people were thriving from Alaska to Chile while much of Europe was still empty of mankind and its works.\\"'The landscape encountered, first by the Pilgrims and later by American settlers pushing ever further West, was anything but the virgin forest and prairie they thought it was. \\"Native Americans burned the Great Plains and Midwest prairies so much and so often that they increased their extent; in all probability, a substantial portion of the giant grassland celebrated by cowbooys was established and maintained by the people who arrived there first.\\" On the Eastern seaboard, too, Indians extensively used fire, clearing tracts for farming and completely transforming the land before Europeans ever set sight on the coast.'Even the Amazon basin, long thought to be pristine territory, was home to millions of Indians long before disease introduced by the Spaniards decimated them and left their extensive works throughout the region to the ravages of rain and the forest. Mann notes that \\"the Amazon's wealth of fruits, nuts, abnd palms is justly celebrated\\" and adds a comment from one of his innumerable interviews with scholars: \\"\`Visitors are always amazed that you can walk in the forest there and constantly pick fruit from trees. That's because people planted them. They're walking through old orchards.\\"As Mann makes clear throughout 1491, practically all these findings have their detractors. Some cling to old findings (often their own) and simply refuse to accept changed views. Others criticize the methodology (or the investigator). But that's to be expected. In fact, a collection of scientists in just about any field will behave like the Israeli Knesset, divided into nearly as many factions as there are scientists. But the case Mann sets forth is compelling, controversy notwithstanding. And for anyone with even a smidgen of interest in history, anthropology, paleontology, or ecology, these revelations must be surprising. For a history buff like me, they're mind-bending.Mann is a science journalist who serves as a contributing editor to Science and The Atlantic Monthly.

It is oddly organized, but not disorganized, which can cause a loss of focus as one plows through the massive detail. There is an uneven density of detail across the span of the book. The Appendixes are deftly done and quite fascinating."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"While some of the ideas and theories in the book are controversial, Mann has done a good job of supporting and explaining the ideas. The idea that the Amazon was basically planted and cultivated is interesting and hard to believe, but it may be the only explanation for how things are. The dramatic rise in animals after the destruction of much of the Indian population is another interesting idea. One of the issues is that there are almost no written records of anything that happened before Columbus complicates things. As with numbers, you can do almost anything with archaeological data.Good read.

But the reviewer above was unfair. First, though he cites Churchill's academic credentials, it's in the context of a passage about \\"activists.\\"Second, there's how he treats it. Mann cites Churchill, who charges that Europeans fully understood that they were spreading devestating diseases and eagerly did so, after which Mann writes:\\"But this, too, overstates the case. Neither European nor Indian had a secular understanding of disease. 'Sickness was the physical manifestation of the will of God,' Robert Crease, a philosopher of science at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, told me. 'You could pass it on to someone, but doing that was like passing on an evil, or bad luck, or a bad spirit -- the transmission also reflected God's will.' The conquistadors knew the potential impact of disease, but its actual impact, which they could not control, was in the hands of God.\\"p. 131I imagine this book was at the printer long before Churchill was exposed as a fraud.

Already being called \\"revisionist\\" by some and \\"revolutionary\\" by others, it certainly is not \\"your father's history of Native Americans\\" (who were called \\"Indians\\" by your father's generation, anyway).Those who complain of scant primary support don't understand historiography of pre-historic history. By it's very nature and name, the historian of such societies much rely on more ancillary research and documentation. Mann does so by culling the results from diverse fields such as archaeology, anthropology, sociology, and paleolinguistics.His most fascinating and likely most provable hypothesis results from first-hand accounts from the first Europeans of their first encounters--encounters with people they considered their equals. From this information and copious additional research, Mann hypothesizes that the \\"American\\" continents were richly populated with culturally enriched societies that were killed off by diseases before later Europeans could document their existence.Reviewer: Robert W. Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of \\"Soul Physicians\\" and \\"Spiritual Friends,\\" and of the forthcoming \\"Beyond the Suffering: The Story of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction.\\""},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann's excellent \\"1491\\" is a survey of the Americas before the arrival of Columbus, based on the most recent historical, anthropological, and archeological thinking. Much of this thinking is necessarily tentative, speculative, and controversial; Mann does a marvellous job of providing a balanced presentation in layman's terms.The history of Pre-Columbian America as traditionally taught was the indifferent product of misunderstandings, prejudice, and incomplete study. Mann's intent is to provide the reader with a sense of just how complex human culture, and its interaction with the natural environment, really was prior to the large scale arrival of Europeans. The evidence surveyed by Mann indicates that human presence in the Americas goes back much further than previously supposed. Far from being a pristine wilderness inhabited by small bands of \\"Indians\\" who lived in harmony with nature, the Americas were likely heavily populated by tens of millions of people, many of whom were organized into complex civilizations with the ability to manipulate their local environments. Success in agriculture supported urban centers as large or larger than their European counterparts at the time. One very noteworthy aspect of the story is the likely devastating impact that first contact with European diseases had on a previously isolated American population. If the material presented is accurate, smallpox, influenza, and other diseases killed off a significant portion of the native population in the years following 1491.Mann, a journalist by trade, notes the continuing controversies about many aspects of the history of the Americas. The inherent challenge of interpreting the limited surviving physical evidence is made more difficult by present day disputes over environmental policy, native rights, and favored versions of various group histories. For example, the indications that the residents of the Americas were successfully manipulating their environment to favor preferred plants or animals on a very large scale tends to undercut the notion that the Americas were an unspoiled wilderness.Mann manages to mingle scientific data with travelogue commentary and personal interviews in a very readable style. This book is highly recommended to the student of history and to the casual reader looking for a better understanding of Pre-Columbian America."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"1491\\" is anchored by that penultimate year, the last one before the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but of course, not limited to it. Mann explores the archaeology, anthropology (and probably several other ologies) of the Americas in the time before Columbus and a century or so thereafter. His intent is to debunk many of the popularly held views of life in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans--primarily the view of \\"Native Americans\\" as noble, but backward savages living in harmony with nature. According to Mann, and the many researchers that he cites, the Americas, both North and South, included many well-developed urban societies, most of whom knew well how to exploit nature to their own benefit--including the earliest genetic engineering that took place in the development of maize.The non-chronological approach to the vast scope of material (I also had trouble discerning an alternate structure to the book), and the lack of pictorial guides to help the reader envision and sort out all the information presented (I found myself wishing that Michener's editor had presided over the book--then I would have surely had at least a timeline, and perhaps much more to help me) are my main quibbles with \\"1491\\". Still it was an engaging read and a fine \\"blind\\" choice of reading material from an airport bookshop."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I read Mr. Mann magazine article \\"1491\\" in Atlantic Monthly when it came out and was thrilled when I read that a book length version of the article was forthcoming. I have read the book several times since it came out in August and have tried to acquaint myself further with some of the areas he touches upon. In addition, I had previously read all of Alfred Crosby's books on the interactions between the Old and New Worlds. So I was certainly primed to accept the concepts that Mr. Mann presented.While I am not a great fan of \\"Guns Germs and Steel\\", I do think that Dr. Diamond hit upon a central question that faces all historians and anthropologists, i.e., what allowed European based societies to so dominate the world for the last 500 years. Personally, I find Alfred Crosby's \\"The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe,1250-1600\\" to be a more persuasive and predictive answer to this question than \\"Guns Germs and Steel.\\"But regardless of the exact mechanism for how it played out over the world, \\"1491\\" certainly provides a riveting case study of how it played out in the Western Hemisphere. The whole notion of the Conquest of the Americas being something of a reversal of \\"War of the World\\" (with the invaders being aided, rather than struck down, by germs) is very interesting. And the death rates cited by Mann in the book are distrubingly similar to death rates that were observed over and over when Europeans colonized Oceania. Time and again, islands would be revisited only to discover that population had been reduced by 95% due to inadvertant introduction of a European disease. Certainly, the dynamics of a disease on a small island are different from what two entire continents would experience, but immunologically naive populations of North and South America had to endure wave after wave of different diseases.And in keeping with the analogy to popular movies, the comparison of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" keeps coming back to me. In the waning days of the USSR, the Soviets had come to realize they could never maintain nuclear parity with the United States and some have alleged the Soviets hoped maintain the Mutually Assured Destruction balance with biological weapons, specifically, genetically engineered super-viruses. And there are further allegations that Russians in the post-Soviet era have continued that research. Robert Preston's book \\"Demon in the Freezer\\" paints a particularly bleak picture of the lethality of these super-viruses and what would happen should any of them be loosed on what in effect would be an immunologically naive world population.We can only hope and pray that these Soviet \\"Doomsday\\" weapons (as that phrase was used in \\"Dr. Strangelove\\") do not somehow fall into the hands of Islamic terrorists who decide to use them in an ultimate suicide bombing. Should it come to that, one of the central theses of \\"1491\\", that any society, regardless of its culture or sophistication, can be laid low by diseases to which it has no immunity, could be proven tragically true.The only real complaint I have with \\"1491\\" is that I think the photograph that Mr. Mann chose for Dr. Meggars was a bit unfair, especially when compared to the one he chose for Dr. Roosevelt."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a book dense with facts and theories. Since most of the facts and theories are new - within the last decade or two - most readers (such as I) will not have known of them. As the author points out, most high school textbooks are woefully behind on pre-Columbus Americas. To put it very briefly, there was much more in this hemisphere before Columbus' arrival than was thought and taught.Although the author points to some of the European biases that have underestimated the Indians' cultures before Europeans came here, the knowledge this book unearths makes a citizen of the western hemisphere puff out his chest: That's right, \\"we\\" had an alphabet just as early as you and we had a zero long before Europe!The best part of the presentation of all this new knowledge and accompanying theories is that Mr. Mann never takes sides (occasionally you can get a glimmer of which side he thinks is correct) in the arguments. As he points out, some of the arguments get overly personal. His journalistic background is probably what makes this possible.Many people approach a history book such as this and assume that all it is is a rendition of things past. 1491 rises above this with a chapter on the rain forest and its past civilizations that has amazing relevance to today's ecology and politics.It is always difficult to put the amount of information this book has in a coherent and orderly fashion. At times, it was difficult to keep up with the progression of dates and civilizations - comparing a city in Mexico, for instance with one Mr. Mann had described in Peru. That was the book's only short-coming.There is a tremendous amount of information here that not only will be new to most readers, but it will make the reader shake his head at the amount of information we have not had until recently. This is certainly well worth the read and a valuable addition to any American history library."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles C. Mann does a masterful job of pulling together contemporary theories of the Americas before Columbus. He does it in an accessible style so even the unsophisticated layperson can enjoy this wonderful exposition.Much to his credit, Mann does not indulge (at least not to a significant extent) in the current fancy for political correctness. The Americas were not an Eden before the arrival of the Europeans, a fact well-known before revisionism swept academia. Life was nasty, brutish and short; violence endemic and the natives were not idyllic sorts living in total harmony with the land. Good for Mr. Mann.In eleven sections, Mann covers the history of the Americas in sometimes astonishing detail. Did you know that nine out of ten Native Americans have Type O blood instead of the split between Type A and O found in Europe? Mann links this to the question of the decimation of the Native Americans by disease.In North America the natives had converted the Mexican basin and Yucatan into aritificial environments suitable for farming as well as a quarter of the Amazon forest. Hardly the picture environmentalists paint.\\"1491\\" is exceedingly rich in such detail and is a very worthwhile addition to the knowledge of anyone even vaguely interested in the history of the Americas before Columbus. Quite a fascinating read.Jerry"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good, and so it is with the renewal of war between the West and the Middle East. This clash of cultures is spurring renewed interest in discovering just what happens when differing ways of life encounter each other. American schoolchildren are taught that 1492 was the year Christopher Columbus \\"discovered\\" America. It was a vast wilderness, a largely empty continent peopled by nomadic bands and subsistence farmers. As if to fulfill this vision, disease brought by Europeans swept through the native populations before the visitors could chronicle the cultures they encountered. The result continues to be politically useful, for it justifies European hegemony over the continent. It is a source of spiritual poverty, though, because it overlooks the richness and vastness of the civilizations which existed here for thousands of years before the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria appeared off Hispaniola. The title 1491, then, signals that the reader will visit a world considerably different from the one that is usually presented. It is, even though Mann freely admits to speculation in many matters. Sifting through reams of research, and navigating the minefields of contrasting agendas and opinions, Mann arrives at several conclusions. First, the Americas have likely been populated far longer than conventional wisdom suggests. Second, they have hosted civilizations of considerable sophistication, political organization, and spiritual depth. Third, far from being a pristine wilderness, the land the Europeans found was the result of centuries of human manipulation. If Mann is even mostly right, it calls those of us who currently inhabit and manipulate this continent to a greater humility than we have heretofore exhibited regarding our place in the world. 1491 also begs for a sequel along the lines of \\"what if....\\" What if Mann's conclusions are correct? What, then, are the implications of this new historical awareness for America's role in the world? Certainly our claim to be the epitome of human political and spiritual development is shown to be bogus. We are but one more page in a millenia-old story of human life. What, also, are the implications for the future of archaeology and its related sciences? Archaeology emerged as a serious undertaking during the heyday of European colonial expansion into Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. For years, we their children were taught that the origins of civilization are to be found along the Nile and in the Fertile Crescent. There originated writing, mathematics, astronomy, and other mainstays of culture. What if the civilizations of the Americans developed their own versions of these things even earlier (Mann's appendix on the calendar is fascinating)?"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book accomplishes the admirable feat of synthesizing for the general reader the monumental amounts of research to date on the subject of American Indian civilization before the arrival of Europeans. In so doing it explodes the conventional teaching that most of us received in school. Mann is impressively comprehensive in his scope, not only in covering North, Central and South America, but also going beyond revisionist archeology into why the advanced state of native civilization before European contact has been underestimated, including its management of the environment. The latter was the most astounding for me - the whole idea that \\"modern\\" man is not the first to reshape his landscape is one of several iconoclastic themes he develops. Another is the true scope of, and reasons behind, the destruction of these cultures post-contact.My only reservations were a tendency to repetition between different sections, and the author's use of thesaurus vocabulary when plain language would do (pullulating? ramose?). These are but minor quibbles about what is otherwise impressive scholarship - with meticulous annotations at the end of the text referenced by page number instead of with intrusive footnotes.If you are interested in the controversies over how the natives themselves colonized the Americas, which is covered in passing here, see Tom Koppel's \\"Lost World\\" or Tom Dillehay's \\"Settlement of the Americas\\". Both are meant for general readers, although the latter is somewhat dryly written.For offering insight into what Native American civilization achieved before being invaded, and challenging persistent stereotypes, 1491 deserves five stars."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I mistakenly put off reading this book because I was unsure whether it was properly researched and supported, or more of a speculative work like the Menzies book about the Chinese 'discovering' America. In fact, Mann is a respected writer for Science, National Geographic and other journals of record, and the book contains lengthy bibliographical notes. Mann does occasionally argue for a particular, controversial interpretation, but he balances each discussion with other views.The other reviews here do a good job of summarizing, so I'll be more subjective. I think this is an important book. Over time it seems bound to cause people to reassess a range of issues around aboriginal rights andd the environment. At least one reviewer has already decried this book as propoganda for the anti-environmental right. I think this is a shallow interpretation. Mann's point is that the pre-Columbian people were more populous and had greater impact (much greater) on the landscape than previously recognized. However, that this would justify modern environmental atrocities is as absurd as saying Aztec practices justify modern human sacrifice, or 16th century Spanish colonial policy justifies slavery and religious crusade. Instead \\"1491\\" could provide context for modern debate as well as some possibly very interesting opportunities to apply pre-Columbian agricultural techniques (heterogenous Maize cultivation and charcoal enrichment of Amazonian soil for example) to current environment policy.But the book was not written as a policy guide, and is easy to read as just a rich historical tapestry. The story contains triumphs such as the rise of mesoamerican and peruvian cultures, and a wide range of horrible tragedies...primarily the recurrent plagues that swept the continent after the Europeans arrived.I have lived in the western US my entire life, and reading this book has changed my perception of the land around me. It is easy to think all the history is back in the eastern part of the country, or Europe or Asia. After reading this book and \\"One Vast Winter Count\\" (a history of the American West before Lewis and Clark, recommended by Mann as a supplement to his book), the history of my part of the world is suddenly alive and the landscape itself feels richer.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"In what we have hitherto called \\"American history\\", the millenia between the beginning and European contact is usually summarized in a few paragraphs, before moving on to the more familiar material. Here, at last, is a volume which attempts to do justice to the rest of the story--and what a surprising story it turns out to be. According to Mann, much of what we have been told about precontact America is confused, incomplete, and often flat-out wrong. Here the reader encounters stories such as:-Who \\"Squanto\\" really was and why the natives helped the Pilgrims (it isn't for the reasons we are usually told;)-Why America appeared as an empty, pristine wilderness to early settlers (there is a reason for this you probably don't know;)-Why there were huge herds of bison roaming the Great Plains and titanic flocks of passenger pigeons in the 19th century (it probably wasn't always true;)-What the Amazon rain forest may really be (not what you have been told;)and many other fascinating tales. Admittedly, not every hypothesis put forth here is provable beyond doubt, and I wonder if the role of early Viking contact is given short shrift; but Mann has marshalled an impressive body of evidence from anthropology, palaeoclimatology, palaeontology, anthropology, and archaeology, and any serious scholar of American history will have to come to terms with this book. It is also an interesting complement to Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel.

The book isn't a scholarly work, but is very accessible and enjoyable for laymen and amateurs with an interest in pre-Columbian America. The pages of source material in the appendix should provide excellent direction for those wishing to delve even deeper into the science behind the book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"There has been much scholarly discussion over the years about pre-Columbian societies in the Americas. How many were there? What technologies did they develop? Did they have writing? What destroyed them? Where is the evidence?In this book, Charles Mann brought together much of the recent scholarly knowledge, piecing together evidence from across North, Central and South America, to come up with a cohesive image of what the Americas looked like in terms of human occupation before Columbus.The book's main arguemnt is that the Americas were already heavily populated with as many as 20 million people when Columbus arrived. These people possessed technology very advanced that was not, as much of history tells, puny and weak compared to what Europeans had developed. Agricultural methods were advanced and very productive, providing the basis for the establishment of large sedentary populations, much larger than previously thought. These large populations were mainly destroyed by disease. What we see today are in fact the remaining population after the equivalent of a holocaust, which is hardly a good basis to judge their capabilities and one time glory.To demonstrate this theory, evidence is gathered from archeology and ancient reports from travellers. From most 16th century explorers, we get a picture of a heavily populated landscape, both in the southeastern US and in the Amazon. However, explorers through the same regions roughtly a century later describe a landscape of peaceful nature without large human interventions. The archeological evidence, as more is discovered, points in the direction of large populations and many characteristics (such as religion and art) of sedentary populations.Particularly interesting is the section on the Amazon forest, in which the author describes the Amazon not as virginal forest but rather an a human construct, a large garden manipulated by ancient inhabitants, now abandoned. Evidence of these people's technology can be found in unlikely places, such as in the formation of terra preta, a highly fertile soil in a land well known for poor soils for agriculture. Additionally, the raised fields of the Bolivian Amazon also point to a highly sophisticated and organized society that would need to be surplus producing in order to spare the manpower for such great public works.An interesting addendum to his argument is about the freedom enjoyed by antive americans, which is much more similar to the freedom we enjoy today and seek to expand, than the Europeans at the time enjoyed. The author does a superb job of piecing together evidence from across the continent to come to interesting conclusions about our ancestors.I highly recommend this book not only to anyone interested in the history of the Americas before Columbus, but to anyone looking for an interesting read about our history as humans."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book does a good job of discrediting several myths about the nature New World civilizations before Europeans arrived. It implies that significant parts of the book Guns, Germs, and Steel are wrong (in ways that Diamond should have avoided by consulting experts) - Indians were quite capable of repelling Europeans when their advantage consisted of guns and steel. After smallpox spread across the Americas (faster than Europeans), guns and steel were largely superfluous advantages.The book presents evidence (alas, not enough to be conclusive) that most of the land in the Americas had been altered by civilizations that were much more sophisticated and varied than is commonly realized, and the myth that Indians were primitive savages is largely due to people mistaking the disease-ravaged remnants that the typical European colonist encountered for the pre-European norm.The book also provides a few bits of evidence against historical determinism by pointing out how differently some aspects of civilization developed in the two worlds. For instance, the New World seems to have been first to get the concept of zero, but only used wheels for toys, and valued metals for their malleability rather than strength.One very intriguing report is that the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederation society was freer and more egalitarian than European society, and that this caused a number of Europeans to prefer Haudenosaunee society, but no Indians in that region preferred European society. It's unclear how strong the evidence is for these somewhat controversial claims. I guess I ought to track down the books he references for this subject.The book also describes the Inka empire as socialist, without any markets, but I'm disappointed at how little the books says about that (e.g. how broad a definition of market is he using?).The main shortcomings of this book are the numerous anecdotes that add little to our understanding of Indian civilizations."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"1491\\" is a journalist's look at pre-Columbian America. It is an overly ambitious, oftentimes confusing assortment of fact, theory, archaeology, geography, genetics, anthropology, ethnography and almost every other science and pseudoscience that can be applied to the study of ancient and recent native Americans.In my opinion, the author would have been far better off to have thoroughly expored a couple of themes rather than to have hop-scotched over the Americas both temporally and geographically. Even the title--1491--is misleading because the author spends much time discussing European contacts with the natives. He also wastes time highlighting the personal disputes between various scholars.I would have much preferred an in-depth discussion of 1491 populations in various parts of the continents with evidence of the impact of European diseases. To be sure, the author discusses this subject but, bored or running out of material, he quickly skips to other, only tangentially related matters.This is really too bad because the author has gone to a great deal of work and study to prepare his work.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of America"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a fascinating book.

To put it bluntly, Everything you know is wrong.Over and over again, Mann shows how the Indians were something other than savage barbarians or tree-hugging hippies. They manipulated their environments in North, South and Central America to produce large, complex civilizations. He also spells out how a handful of Europeans were able to take over the two continents (in brief, it was due to unwitting germ warfare).This book is an excellent antidote to the idea that the world's civilizations were the fated consequence of the landscape that they inhabited (Jared Diamond is one popular supporter of this philosophy, his disclaimers notwithstanding). The Indians, no less than other human beings, shaped their environments through hard work and intelligence.This is a great book, though overall it's hard not to be depressed at the loss of such amazing peoples. In many cases, we don't even know the real names of the lost civilizations."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann does offer some good information and ideas, and I would certainly encourage everyone to read his book. You'll be glad you did. But it's not a 5-star book.It's not history. It's not even pop-history, but rather a collection of disorganized articles.The author, a writer for The Atlantic, is obviously intrigued by the subject and has compiled lots of information, interviewed experts, and offers solid facts mixed with good guesses, but after reading it you still won't know very much about the Americas in 1491.That's not the author's fault, since the destruction was so ruthless, so complete, most of that knowledge probably has been lost forever. Just don't buy the book expecting more than the title can deliver. The subtitle does clarify this, and promises not a comprehensive account, but only \\"new\\" revelations. Okay, some of these are 20 or more years old, but if you don't know about them, then fair enough, they count as new.The style is that of James Fallows, the author's boss, and I found it easy to read. On the other hand, two of my friends (and some reviewers) found it difficult to get through because of the disorganization.The index is worthless. This isn't the author's fault either, but it shows the publisher never meant for the book to be taken as a legitimate history. Many Chinchorro mummies, we learn, show they lived on seafood, and paleoparasitologists have found eggs in the cadavers from Diphyllobothrium pacificum, a tape worm that comes from eating raw seafood. (No more sushi.) The worm leeches Vitamin B-12 out of the system and can cause fatal anemia. See how long it takes you to find that passage using the index. Most of the key words aren't listed. (It's on pp. 180-181, in my copy.) I could give lots more examples."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"In describing the inhabitants of North and South America, Charles Mann uses the term \\"Indian,\\" because, he claims, it is what they call themselves. So then, I will do as the Indians do and avoid the term \\"Native American.\\"The main thesis of this book is that the population of the Indians was much larger and their societies much more sophisticated than previously believed. According to Mann, more than 100 million people lived in the Western Hemisphere in 1491. He also estimates that two-thirds of the continental United States was being farmed at the time. In Mexico, the Indians cultivated corn, tomatoes, beans, and a host of other crops. In addition, their math and writing systems rivalled those of Sumaria and Ancient Egypt. Mann goes even further and speculates that the Indian social and political traditions in the New England area were influential in the establishment of the American republic.The evidence to support these claims comes from a growing body of archaeological, anthropological and historical research that suggests that when the first European explorers arrived the Western Hemisphere was anything but virgin wilderness. In 1539, when Hernando De Soto took a four-year trek through the American South from what is now Florida to Texas, he wrote that the area was thick with Indians ; Giovanni da Verrazzano, another explorer, wrote that the American seabord was densely populated with Indian villages; Bartolome de las Casas encountered many townships along the southern route; and South American explorer Gaspar de Carvajal noted many Indian townships up and down the Amazon.However, when the European settlers arrived 150 to 200 hundered years later they found that these areas were virtually empty. Reasoning along the same lines as Jared Diamond in \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\\" Mann claims that not only did Pizarro and his men defeat the Incas, as did Cortes the Aztecs, with guns and horses, they also brought with them deadly diseases. As Diamond pointed out, the Europeans had built up immunities to many common diseases from living in close quarters with domesticated animals over the course of centuries. When De Soto explored the American South he brought with him swine and cattle that carried with them smallpox and other viruses. As he traded with the Indians along the way he unwittingly sowed the seeds of their destruction.Mann is an excellent writer and his research has been extensive, but he seems to have nothing but praise for his conjectured civilizations of the New World and nothing but scorn for the achievements of the Europeans. For example, he writes that when Cortes and his men reached Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), they were dazzled by a city bigger and more splendid than Paris. Perhaps. Or when he claims that the Indians bathed regularly and that the Europeans where merely soiled stragglers (my characterization). More daringly, Mann goes further to say that the Indians were more environmentally conscious and that their social and political system was more advanced. It seems that the inhabitants of the New World could do no wrong, they only had the misfortune of being decimated by European diseases.Based on the evidence that Mann uses there is much room for debate. He has written a very engaging and provocative scientific travelogue, yet it is hard to believe the Indians were as advanced and sophisticated as he portrays them."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I have been a volunteer at Cahokia Mounds for about three years, leading guided tours of the Historic site. I have read extensively about Cahokia's history, attended a few conferences and had access to several of the principal archeologists at the site. I consider myself fairly well informed.Several visitors at Cahokia, and a few of my friends, recommended that I read 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, written in 2005, by Charles C. Mann.Mr. Mann relies heavily on the work of Dr William I. Woods, a geography professor at University of Kansas. I have found a book Envisioning Cahokia: a Landscape Perspective, co-authored by Dr. Woods. Not an easy read, but I am currently tackling it to see if I can learn more.I have recently finished 1491 (Vintage Books, second edition, July 2011) and I have a few observations. Some of the things the author states as \\"facts\\" about Cahokia are speculation. Some of the things he says are clearly incorrect.This makes me question the rest of the book.The best known landmark at Cahokia is Monks Mound. Standing 100 feet high, with four terraces and a base of 14 acres, Monks Mound is the largest earthen structure in the Americas.Mr. Mann tells us that \\"the elite revamped Monks Mound. By extending a low platform from one side, they created a stage for priests to perform ceremonies in full view of the public.\\" (pg303)The first terrace of Monks Mound is a late addition and it very well may have been used as a stage to address large gatherings in the forty acre Grand Plaza. I mention this in my tours, but point out that it is speculation. Beyond the apparent acoustics in the Grand Plaza (some archeologist have noted that, in the early mornings, it is sometimes possible to clearly hear the voices of people ascending the mound) there isn't a whole lot of evidence to support the theory.The author tells us that one of the contributing factors to the demise of Cahokia was the diversion of Cahokia Creek. This provided additional water to the city and allowed logs to be floated downstream, but also caused flooding which destroyed the maize crop. This may well be true, but I have found no other sources that mention this diversion of Cahokia Creek. Most accounts of Cahokia's demise cite an extended drought and, perhaps, a shortened growing season.Mound 72, in my opinion, is the most interesting mound at Cahokia. Excavations in the late 1960s by Dr. Melvin Fowler revealed about 300 burials. The most spectacular was \\"the beaded burial\\" an early chief buried on a falcon shaped blanket of 20,000 sea shell beads from the gulf of Mexico. Archeologists estimate that 60% of the burials at mound 72 were ritual killings.Speaking of these Mr. Mann says \\"Among them were fifty young women who had been buried alive.\\" (pg 298)He may be confusing two or more separate burials.There were about 100 young women who were likely garroted before their bodies were laid out in trenches in neat rows. I am not aware of any evidence that these victims were buried alive.On another occasion, 50 individuals, men and women, were executed, mainly clubbed to death, and haphazardly thrown into a pit. There is evidence that some of these people were still alive when the pit was filled.Sometime around 1150, the people at Cahokia constructed a palisade. Clearly a defensive structure, we do not know who the two mile long fence was intended to keep out.Mr. Mann tells us that the palisade \\"was also intended to welcome the citizenry - anyone could freely pass through its dozen or so wide gates.\\" (pg 303)Actually, the \\"gates\\" into the palisade were narrow, L shaped entryways, situated between bastions, where archers easily could hold off unwanted intruders.We are told \\"A catastrophic earthquake razed Cahokia in the beginning of the thirteenth century, knocking down the entire western side of Monks Mound.\\" (pg 303)I have a couple of problems with this statement.The first relates to the second terrace of Monks Mound. The official literature at the Interpretative Center states that Monks Mound had four terraces. Some researchers, including Dr. Woods believes that what we now call the second terrace was the result of a massive slumpage along the western side of the mound. They may be correct, but this is still open to debate.If Dr. Woods is correct, might the second terrace of Monks Mound be the result of an earthquake? Perhaps.In 1811/1812, quakes along the New Madrid fault in southern Missouri caused the Mississippi River to run backwards and rang church bells in New York and Boston. Archeologists do speculate whether earthquakes had anything to do with the abandonment of Cahokia. The problem has to do with timing.This summer I attended a Mississippian conference at Cahokia. One of the presentations dealt with this topic. There is evidence that there was a major quake along the New Madrid fault around 1450. Unfortunately this is at least 200 years too late to fit into Mr. Mann's narrative.\\"The Cahokia earthquake .. must have splintered many of the city's wood-and plaster buildings; fallen torches and scattered cooking fires would have ignited the debris, burning down most surviving structures. Water from the rivers, shaken by the quake, would have sloshed into the land in a mini-tsunami. ... Meanwhile the social unrest turned violent; many houses went up in flames. There was civil war, ... fighting in the streets. The whole polity turned in on itself and tore itself apart.\\" (pg 304)If this scenario played out, one would expect ample archeological evidence. If it exists, I have missed it.Finally, there are two statements in 1491 I find particularly strange.\\"Monks Mound opens into a plaza a thousand feet long. In it southwest corner is a pair of mounds, one conical, one square. One day I climbed up their grassy sides at sunset.\\" (pg 289)You are not allowed to climb on any of the mounds except Monks Mound. There are signs posted throughout the site. Perhaps the author had special.\\"A friend and I first visited Cahokia in 2002 ... The site is now a state park with a small museum.\\" (pg 302)Has Mr. Mann ever actually been to Cahokia? The Historic Site ceased being a state park in 1977. The \\"small museum\\" was replaced in 1989 by a 33,000 ft interpretative center that receives hundreds of thousands of visitors each year."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"As previous reviewers have mentioned, this book is organized poorly (although the author notes this in the preface) but in the end it works (kind of). The book details how great civilizations existed in the Americas (focusing on South America, Central America, and the East Cost of the U.S.) prior to their \\"discovery.\\" The book became frustrating simply due to the amount of material presented (numerous facts began to become blurred). The biggest disappointment of the book is the last chapter. The whole book details how these hierarchical civilizations existed in the Americas with Kings ruling over the people and then the last chapter states that Indians saw themselves equal with any other person. Mann goes on to state how Whites admired this equality and in fact had to make laws keeping Whites from fraternizing with Indians for fear that they would go live with the \\"heathens.\\" I just don't get it. Mann spends this whole book dispelling all these myths about how Indians were really not sustainable and manipulated their environments (e.g., repeatedly burning the plains in the U.S.) and then concludes with a short chapter saying that Indians were to be admired. In the end, I found this long interesting dense book INCOMPLETE and frustrating. I gathered from the last chapter that the \\"myths\\" of Indians were true. Something that Mann does not mention which would provide a connection to his last chapter is this: Disease killed off these great civilizations and while Indians at first were blood-thirsty and greedy for land, once their numbers were reduced and they were subjected to second-class status by the Whites, they became sustainable and kind humans. Of course, this is B.S. but hey, at least I am attempting to explain the gap that Mann determined wasn't worth explaining.

I wish it had been more cogently presented. At this point in time, I would say Jared Diamond is still the author to read if you are interested in this field.

Una aclaracion importante que sostiene \\"1491\\" es que esta devastacion NO se debio a que los americanos fueran inherentemente menos resistentes ni menos evolucionados que los europeos, sino a la UNIFORMIDAD genetica de los americanos.Segun 1491, las civilizaciones y culturas en America antes de la llegada de los europeos eran mucho mas complejas, grandiosas y avanzadas de lo que generalmente se reconoce.Independientemente de las premisas fundamentales del libro, uno tambien sale con la fuerte impresion de que aun entre los cientificos la busqueda de la verdad es muy secundaria a el tratar de demostrar que sus teorias son las correctas. Esto llega a ocasionar no solo acaloradas discusiones sino odio y burlas a los cientificos que opinan algo diferente. No cabe duda que los cientificos tambien son plenamente humanos y sus ideas pre-concebidas no les permiten ver la realidad. Cada descubrimiento que se hace lo tratan de ajustar a \\"su\\" vision del mundo y es por esto que la arqueologia avanza muy lentamente.Por ejemplo, existen dos \\"bandos\\" en cuanto a la historia humana en el Amazonas. Uno dice que el Amazonas era un lugar donde la humanidad practicamente no habia tenido ninguna influencia y que por lo tanto todo en ese lugar era primigenio y virgen. El otro bando llega al extremo de decir que la selva del Amazonas es creacion humana. Lo preocupante es que cada bando defiende su posicion a muerte demostrando que su objetivo no es la busqueda de la verdad sino imponer su vision del mundo, aunque esta este equivocada.Obviamente, el tema del libro es tan amplio que se necesitarian 10 libros o mas para cubrirlo con cierta profundidad, pero aun asi, 1491 es una introduccion que bien vale la pena a una vision alterna de la America pre-colombina que bien puede ser mas cierta que la que nos han querido imponer hasta ahora."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I wanted to like this book and believe in the arguments that the author was making, but in the end I simply could not do it.There was too much anecdote and speculation used to support the author's ideas about the size and sophistication of pre-Columbus populations in the Americas.

I repeatedly found myself thinking, \\"No, Y does not follow from X in this case!\\"Like other readers, I also found this book extremely disorganized in its presentation. One chapter we're following the Inca Empire in Peru, the next it's off to Plymouth, Massachussetts, then a quick stop at Clovis, and then we doddle off to the Yucatan to hang out with the Maya.There also seems to be a larger agenda behind Mann's arguments in this book. This is especially apparent when he is discussing the potential pre-1492 human impact on the Amazon basin. He consistently pursues a line of argument best paraphrased as, \\"Hey, the Indians were constantly slashing and burning parts of the forest to create arable land, so what's the big deal if we do it nowadays?\\"Great, except that the ability of small tribes with stone axes to clear rainforest isn't within ten orders of magnitude of what modern man and a few diesel bulldozers can achieve.Fascinating speculation, recommended only if you have a lot of spare time to go on a summer flight of fancy."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If you have any interest or even just curiosity about the Americas before Columbus landed here, then this book it definitely one well worth reading.

The book expands massively on the essay, as it should, but the basic thesis is there.1491 falls into the genre of authors telling us what we know is wrong, which is interesting but makes a skeptical reader ask if the claims are overblown or even true. (Cf. Gavin Menzies's _1421_, which does not seem to hold up.) Charles Mann provides so many references that his books turn out to be rather shorter than they first appear, but it's comforting that his claims are also consistent with various news articles and other facts.

I'm sure there are plenty of factual errors in the book - nobody could write a book of this scope without quite a few, but the basic premise is sound:The European conquistadors were solely responsible for the erroneous notion that Native Americans were primitive, God-less savages. Sure there were gangs of thugs here and there, just like we have gangs of thugs in every major US city today, but the idea that ALL Native Americans were like that is thoroughly and entertainingly debunked by this book.Not many people today would dispute that Central and South America had very sophisticated civilizations living there for thousands of years, but not many are aware that they also lived in North America. That's what fascinated me about this book. The place I grew up, Illinois, had sophisticated settlements. The Mississippi river mounds, the cliff dwellings, and other well-known but under appreciated archeological remains were not aberrations, but in fact were just a small part of a rich but pulverized history, the loss of which is hard to overstate.Just think how much richer our understanding of the ancient Americas would be if the conquistadors had not burnt most of the Mayan books. Maybe a treasure trove of Mayan books exist hidden somewhere like the Dead Sea scrolls. One can only hope. The fact that the last (previously) known occupied city was quickly evacuated (perhaps because of a volcano) and the dwellers were able to relocate with apparently little difficulty to the state of Georgia is impressive proof indeed that we have vastly underestimated the civilizations that were destroyed by war and disease by the European post-Columbian infestation."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book puts aside everything one has been told about the Americas before Columbus.

I felt as if the author bounced around from here to there with no good reason (was the author bored?). I think the author got hung up on the theories/suppositions that populations were much greater and that more died of disease than history books admit to. The points made are fine, mostly believable, probably true to some extent, but once the point is made, redundant.I did learn some things that were new to me.

He suggests that the view of people who did not affect the land they lived on is likely dead wrong, and after reading the book, I tend to agree with him, though this certainly isn't to the detriment of those pre-Columbian people groups.I would recommend this book to anyone with even a passing interest in what life may have been like before Europe settled North and South America.

After getting past this author's distracting writing style, the reader must tread carefully to separate fact from speculation, realism from romanticism. But most readers are neither archaeologist nor historian and must therefore be wary of being led too far afield by some of the romantic notions presented here, such as the Indian (or Native American) influence on the US Constitution and their wholesale revamping of the Amazon ecosystem. The book is captivating as long as the author is discussing historical and archaeological aspects of particular civilizations. But these peter out about 3/4 way thru the book and give way to ecological speculations. This is fine as long as the reader has some kind of background to deal with this material. Many do not. Therefore there is a misleading element in this book that could benefit from editing in future editions. And of course, there is not a lot of pre-1491 history presented here, as the author admits. Most such \\"history\\" is derived from archaeology.

Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. The title leads the reader to believe that Mann has opened up the pre-Columbian west to us and provided a much needed missing link to the history of the Americas. This he does, but only sparingly and not until over half way through the book. He instead flashes forward to post rediscovery and spends most of the time explaining what the Spanish encountered. It is only then that Mann briefly goes back in time to describe how native societies developed and spread through the Americas. Based on his lack of support and his own admissions through out the book, Mann did not have much primary source documents with to write a proper paper. He must not have figured this out until he was committed and decided to fill it in with post-Columbian comparisons.Despite the lack of continuity, the information Mann presents is interesting and useful for understanding 15th and 16th century America and hypothesize on Native Americans at the time and shortly before.

Mega-surprises? No. But the broad picture was well-painted that the North-South Western Hemisphere of the \\"Americas\\" was a far different place than we thought even when I was in grad school not so many (20+) years ago. Charles Mann, as a journalist, did a fantastic job of pulling together the most recent data, histories, projections, and arguments, concerning Early Man in the Americas. I especially enjoyed the revelations about land-forming capabilities of the Natives; a subject that has been glossed-over and really not recognized, even by the professionals. I have seen evidence of this again and again in Florida, and we archaeologists discuss it, but again, it's really not recognized on the scale that Mann presents rather well in this volume.Telling it from a first-person investigative perspective lent it that personal, humorous, and surprising aspect, and the research was superlative -- he could have gone on another 500 pages, and I'm sure the followup, if there is one (and there ought to be -- even if it's to hash out the controversies), will be great as well. Couple of questions still went unanswered, but that just made it more tantalizing... so, what did kill off the mega-fauna, if the Indians didn't eat them all? And I also noted the recurrence of \\"something\\" happening around 800 A.D., but not explained.What WAS well-explained was the massive overkill of the Native population, but at least it was explained without the hyperbole that normally accompanies this natural(?) phenomenon. Yes, it was horrible, no doubt about it. But intentional? No. Unlike slavery, war, and greedy conquest, for which a great karmic debt is being paid as we speak, and further looms on the horizon."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I found 1491 to be a fascinating eye-opener.

It is detailed and complete in many ways and yet, makes a good foundation for further discussion about the history of the settlement of the new world.1491 is a well-referenced source of historical information.The author has taken a potentially dry academic subject and successfully woven an interesting account of the little known world of Native American achievement and sophistication, that existed before Columbus' arrival."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book covers a topic that is either not covered well by our educational system or is misrepresented. For those of you that want to understand what life in the Americas was like before Europeans, you will find this book an eye opener."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The most telling statement in Charles Mann's \\"1491\\" is an Indian cynically saying that \\"the objective of archaeologists is to make white people feel good about themselves.\\" Those of us with gray in our hair recall when ancient history and archaeology consisted of \\"the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome.\\" We learned that the rest of the world was grubby and insignificant. The Egyptians worshiped cats, the Chinese bound women's feet; the Mayas didn't even have a written language; the Aztec sacrificed people.New findings have gradually moderated the archaic notions that all that is good about mankind came from Europe. Mann makes the case that the Americas were hardly the howling wilderness of legend at time of first contact. The Indians were numerous, but their complex and advanced societies disappeared quickly because of European diseases. The Mayas in fact had a written language -- and probably so did the Incas, except that it wasn't written but was woven in the form of knotted textiles called Quipus that still haven't been decoded.Mann presents evidence that 100,000 people lived along the seacoast of New England only a few years before the Pilgrims arrived -- but they were reduced to a remnant by disease. Mexico City may have been the biggest city in the world in 1491 and the Mexican highlands may have been the most heavily populated region of the world. The Incas controlled the world's largest empire. Amazonia had a flourishing agricultural economy -- which it doesn't have today.That all sounds fishy to those who get their backs up when Eurocentric notions are challenged but Mann backs up his assertions with solid scholarship, a huge bibliography, and well-informed speculation. \\"1491\\" is not a fantasy like \\"Chariot of the Gods\\" or the more recent \\"1421.\\" \\"1491\\" is wide ranging, persuasive, well-argued, and full of things I didn't know about Quipus and Amazonian agriculture and Aztec sacrifices. Its characterization of Europeans as hairy and dirty and its glorification of Indian cultures may be slightly overdone -- but \\"1491\\" surely illuminates more than it irritates. This is an important book that bears comparison with \\"Gods, Germs, and Steel\\" and \\"Black Athena.\\"Smallchief"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The book told me more than I expected. Now I need to do more research and read more about things I read. I only wish I had this 40 years ago when I was still in school. But never to old to learn. Read and learn."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book aims for a broad, deep, and profound picture of what the Americas looked like before the arrival of the Europeans. Its conclusions are surprising and shocking to anyone who was brought up learning either of the twin myths about American Indians (henceforth referred to as Indians): They were backward people with hardly any technology or they were noble savages living in harmony with nature.This book thoroughly demolishes both myths. Instead Charles Mann shows the pre-Columbus Americas as a complex, populous, rich, advanced, mosaic of empires, states and nations. The author accomplishes this by concentrating on three large themes: Indian demography, Indian origins and Indian ecology. Mann theorizes that it would be nearly impossible to create an encyclopedic history of every Indian nation. Since by the time such a book could be published, new insights would undermine much of the current knowledge.One of the many joys of reading this book is that it provides so many recent, cutting edge findings. The problem for the reader in this approach is twofold: First, there are so many threads to follow it is hard for the reader to keep track of them. Second, one has the unsettling feeling that much of what Mann writes about now may itself be undermined by new insights in the coming years. Given that most of what we were taught in school was wrong and Mann's findings are not the final word, what can we learn? Quite a lot.The picture Mann creates of the pre-Columbus civilizations is fascinating and backed up by a host of evidence from different sources (in archaeology, anthropology, linguists, and epidemiology). First, the Americas were heavily populated. Mann quotes Anthropologist Henry F Dobyns \\"The Indian population in 1491 was between 90 and 112 million people\\" (p. 94). This startling number comes in the middle of a long discussion about the controversies these big estimates have generated. Many skeptics claim there is no way we will ever know even approximate population figures for 1491. The evidence, however, from archaeological digs, to epidemiology, to primary source accounts clearly shows that most American history textbooks greatly understate the 1491 population.The textbooks also fail to accurately explain where the Indians came from. Most of us are familiar with the story that the Indians crossed a land bridge formed during the last ice age some 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. This theory is no longer consistent with the most on scholarship in the last decade. For example, Mann writes \\"In the 1990s geologists laid out data indicating that the ice sheets were much bigger and longer lasting than previously thought, and that even when the ice free corridor existed it was utterly inhospitable\\" (p. 169). In other words, the idea that all Indians are descended from groups who crossed a nearly impassable land bridge 10,000 years ago is highly implausible. If what we learned in school is wrong once again, then how did the Indians come to America?Unfortunately, the historical record is unclear. At this point the most accurate answer is that we don't know. This answer, however, is so unsatisfying that Mann does introduce the beginnings of a new theory. An Anthropologist Knut Fladmark, has theorized that the Indians came to the Americas by using small boats. They may have traveled from one island to the next in warmer southern ocean currents. Again we don't know. Mann does comment, \\"What seems unlikely to be undone is the theory that Native Americans may have been in America for twenty thousand or even thirty thousand years\\" (p. 172). I think it is also important to state that these times there was no one living in Europe because it was covered by glaciers until a little more 10,000 years ago.For the same reasons the textbooks get the population of Indians wrong and their origins wrong, they also greatly understate the tragedies of the Indians encounters with the Europeans. Although it has become fashionable to excoriate Europeans for their treatment of the Indians (often justifiably), it was not Europeans guns and steel that led to the largest tragedy. It was European germs. Readers of Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" will be familiar with this shocking story. As archaeologists and epidemiologists, have tried to piece this story together it becomes clear we are witnessing one of the world's worst plagues. According to the work of William Denevan, Henry Dobyns, and William McNeil, approximately 80 million people or 1/5 of the world's population died after the arrival of these germs. The resulting devastation and depopulation of the Indian civilizations led to two misplaced European assumptions about the Indians. These were the assumption that the Indians were either culturally backward or noble savages. Both assumptions begin with the idea that the Indians were powerless victims of nature and the Europeans. Mann's third theme shows just how wrong these assumptions are.The Indians, whether in Amazon basin, Central America, or the Great plains utterly transformed their environments. In the Amazon perhaps 200,000-400,000 people were living in a rain forest which was rich with trees that bore edible fruit. One biologist who has studied the region has suggested that up to 80% of the rain forest was made up of trees planted by the Indians. Far from being backwards, the Indians used methods of cultivating the often toxic soils of the rain forest that scientists are only beginning to understand today. In the Great Plains, the mounds of the Cahokia are still very much visible today. It was a society built on the harvesting of crops, but was also the largest collection of people in the present day United States. Finally the Maya, had an incredibly complex civilization which consisted of more than 25 million people. It would be simply impossible for this many people to subsist in a hunter-gather society in such a small area. The rise and fall of their society depended upon maintaining and transforming their environment. From this world of little known advanced societies and startling new theories about Indians their origin and decline, Mann links part of the culture of 1491 to the ideas of 1776. How does he do it?Mann describes in detail the Indian alliance known as the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois). Today, reading about the ideas of the Haudenosaunee are shocking not because they are so different from present day America, but because they are so similar. The believed in limited government, checks and balances, personal liberty, and equal but distinct role for women. In addition, Indian societies challenged colonial societies to practice freedom or risk losing their members through desertion. How much of the legacy impacted the early colonists will continue to be argued about, but it certainly contributed to the evolution and revolution of American democracy.Kip Malinosky"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 is a revelation; where was this information in our history classes in school??

Mann provides for us a thorough and enlightening look at the Americas before Columbus in 1491.In the past, historians wrote their history with a European slant. Most accounts show how when Europeans came to the New World, it was sparsely inhabited by Native Americans. According to traditional history, Europeans brought \\"civilization\\" to these savages. What Mann relates to us is how these \\"savages\\" actually lived in very populated, thriving and sophisticated societies. The author tries \\"to fill in one of the biggest blanks in history: the Western Hemisphere before 1492.\\" His investigation covers the various Indian tribes from both North and South America and includes the Inka, Maya, Arawak, Aztec, Wampanoag, as well as other smaller societies and sub-groups. He also includes research into their DNA, their environments, architecture, agriculture, food sources, textiles, weaponry, language and religion. In many respects, they were far ahead of their European counterparts.The city of \\"Tenochtitlan dazzled its invaders--it was bigger than Paris, Europe's greatest metropolis.\\" It consisted of wide, clean streets, ornate buildings, markets selling goods from miles away, grand causeways, botanical gardens and aqueducts that brought water from distant mountains. In addition to their remarkable cities, Indians also turned to intellectual pursuits. In a short time, Mesoamericans \\"invented their own writing, astronomy, and mathematics, including zero.\\" Mann also claims that the development of maize was \\"arguably man's first, and perhaps greatest, feat of genetic engineering.\\" What is especially comical is the Indians perception of the Europeans, whom they considered to be unintelligent, \\"weak, sexually untrustworthy, atrociously ugly, and just plain smelly.\\" They couldn't understand the Indians great interest in personal cleanliness.Unfortunately, a combination of catastrophic diseases and invaders wiped away most of these Indian societies. In some cases, over 90% of their numbers were erased--and their history and accomplishments as well. Mann provides theories on how and why this occurred. While I found 1491 fascinating, I thought that some sections were a bit dry and too detailed. Still, Mann sets the record straight about this period of time better than any other modern source. In fact, he does much to rectify revisionist history."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is one of the best books I can remember ever reading! A history of the Americas at the time when Europeans began to arrive (including the author's ancestors).

The history he reveals is not only incredible, it is (was) almost entirely new to me!It is a scholarly work though, and he looses my interest when he gets into lengthy discussions of various versions of pre-European population counts. (a small price to pay for the richness of the overall experience this book provides). One way or another though, the populations were staggeringly large compared to what we may have been led to believe.For anyone even slightly curious about this era, I can't recommend the book too highly.

The scale of civilization on these continent, the enormous number of denizens, the holocaust visited on the people by contact with European greed and disease, are only vaguely considered, if at all. If Mann has tilted too far toward the challengers of old histories, he has yet done a service in prying open the minds of readers. In conjunction with other recent books, including Jared Diamond's GUNS, GERMS AND STEEL (W.W. Norton, 1995) and COLLAPSE (W.W.

Mann's work has some interesting segments, and presents a variety of research that updated my knowledge about pre-Columbian America. On the downside I felt, overall, the work lacked clarity and cohesiveness as a book.There is much ebullient praise and vitriolic criticism of 1491 on this site. In my opinion, neither is warranted. In particular, I'd remind critics who feel he comes down in the middle of controversial topics that Mann is a journalist attempting to present multiple perspectives as reflected in the body of research. I did not get the sense he tried to present one argument as the truth vs another. Here, though, is where my own criticism kicks in.I enjoyed the book as a series of soundbites rather than as \\"a book\\". I felt this work rambled all over the place, and lacked a central theme. Now, I know the central theme is that pre-Columbian America was more populated and advanced than we may have been taught: home to complex societies, that the inhabitants shaped their environment, etc. That said, the wandering from location to location and time period to time period was distracting to me, forcing me to take the narrative in as a series of short stories rather than as many paths to a cohesive whole.As a result, 1491 is neither a scientific nor a taut journalistic piece of work. Mann is not a scientist, so I didn't expect depth of analysis. He is a journalist, though."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Most of what the public is taught in schools about Indians (or Native Americans) is wrong. In _1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus_ author Charles C. Mann sought to dispel many of the myths, cherished and otherwise, about what the inhabitants and their civilizations were like before the Europeans arrived. Though some of these revelations he admits aren't \\"new\\" (some of the older findings date back to the 1940s), nevertheless public perception, media portrayal, and public education has not caught up with the latest research. Even some academic positions suffer from a lack of balance and are at their heart flawed, as they view Indians only as either \\"poster children for eco-catastrophe\\" or as \\"green role models.\\"If I had to sum up this wonderful book in a sentence or two, it would be that the Indians of the Americas were immensely more diverse and populous than is generally thought. As the author put it, time and again \\"Indian societies have been revealed to be older, grander, and more complex than thought possible even twenty years ago.\\"The author roughly divided the book into three sections to tackle what he called Holmberg's Mistake (deriving from anthropologist Allan R. Holmberg and his studies of the Siriono of South America), the \\"idea that Indians were suspended in time, touching nothing and untouched themselves, like ghostly presences on the landscape.\\" Geographer William Denevan called this \\"the pristine myth,\\" the notion the Americas were somehow largely an Eden, untouched by human hands.The first section dealt with why and how estimates of pre-1492 indigenous populations have been radically revised upwards. Many researchers now believe that there were more people living in the Americas than in Europe in 1491 and that one area, Central Mexico, was at the time the most densely populated place on Earth, with a population of 25.2 million - many scientists once thought the entire Americas boasted a population of under 9 million - and with twice as many people per square mile as either India or China (Spain and Portugal only boasted about 10 million inhabitants).The second section tackled the peopling of the Americas and the advent of complex Indian societies, Mann showing why scientists now feel that not only were the Americas settled considerably earlier than once thought but that they achieved urban civilizations quite a bit earlier than had been previously imagined. Indeed, one civilization, that of the people of Norte Chico on the Peruvian coast, were building cities when only one other urban complex on Earth existed; Sumer. The on-going research into Norte Chico has caused considerable waves in archaeological circles due to what has been called the MFAC hypothesis, the maritime foundations of Andean civilization. All later Andean cultures, be they the Wari, the Tiwanaku, or the Inka, owe their origins to ancient coastal cities that drew their sustenance from the sea, not originally from agriculture. While the other Old World \\"wellsprings of human civilization\\" (such as Mesopotamia or China) were all based on growing crops, the people of Norte Chico grew to prominence thanks to the great fishery of the Humboldt Current.The complexity of Indian culture was fascinating, whether it was the engineering of mound construction, Maya mathematics, or the khipu (or quipu) of the Inka, knotted strings that researchers now believe may in fact be a kind of three-dimensional binary code, a form of writing unlike anything on Earth.The third section dealt with the fallacy that Indian cultures did not or could not control their environment, that most were simple hunter-gatherers. Mann provided examples throughout the book of how thoroughly and completely native cultures altered the landscape. Examples included the extensive terracing of mountainsides and building of canals for agriculture by Andean cultures, the rerouting of an entire river by Cahokia (a mound-building culture near modern St. Louis that at five square miles and 15,000+ people was the largest city north of the Rio Grande until the 18th century), the open, park-like woodlands relatively free of undergrowth found in eastern North America that amazed Europeans (the result of careful use of fire by the Indians, who also used fire to keep prairie and savanna from returning to forest in places like Illinois, Nebraska, and the Texas hill country, areas that started to revert to woodland after the decline of native culture), and the still amazing feat of actually improving the impoverished soil of sections of the Amazon rain forest by ancient cultures just now being discovered and studied, a people who were able to create a dark soil known as terra preta that was immensely fertile for centuries and even to the present by a process of expertly creating charcoal in cool, slow-burning fires and mixing it in with the soil.Even when the Indians largely vanished before the settlers arrived, felled by waves of disease that preceded colonization, what the settlers encountered was also a cultural artifact. The vast herds of bison and the sky-blackening flocks of passenger pigeons that so amazed Europeans were the direct result of the decline of natives; they were examples of \\"outbreak populations\\" resulting from a severely disrupted ecosystem, namely, the removal of a keystone species, the Indian, who had previously kept such species in check through land and game management. The Yanomamo of the Orinoco river basin rain forest, who captured European imagination as a Stone Age people who lived lightly on the land as hunter-gatherers deep in the jungle, are a cultural artifact because disease and slave trading in the 17th and 18th centuries drove them from their farm villages to live in the forest, a forest that they in large part originally had created due to the careful planting of such valuable food-bearing trees as the peach palm; what many had classified as natural, pristine, climax forest were in essence vast orchards, remnants of a still little understood form of Amazonian agro-forestry, inhabited by the descendents of refugees, their \\"idyllic\\" and \\"natural\\" existence \\"in fact a life in poor exile.\\""},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"We were told about the Vikings and the Indians in elementary school history classes, but for all intents and purposes, the perception was that life didn't begin in the New World before Columbus arrived. Science writer Charles C. Mann challenges this widely held notion with his fascinating if a bit scattershot chronicle of what life was like in the Western Hemisphere before Columbus's arrival. Mann's purpose with this book is to deconstruct the belief that pre-Columbus America was a howling wilderness thinly populated by small congregations of savages in pure survival mode. On the contrary, what he finds through his research is an America hosted by a good number of highly advanced civilizations. In fact, so successful were these mini-societies that the population of what is now North and South America was equal to or greater than that of the Europe in Columbus's time.Mann discloses that many scholars now insist that native settlement began at least 20,000 years ago, when fishing peoples arrived in small, open boats from coastal Siberia. Their descendants developed especially productive modes of horticulture which sustained a population explosion. He meticulously lists the mathematical and scientific accomplishments of peoples such as the Mayans, Incas, and Aztecs, and shows how the Indian tribes of North America were populous and had already removed much of the wilderness to suit their own needs. It is his gathered conclusion that by 1492, Indians in the two American continents numbered about 100 million, or roughly ten times previous estimates. The book is fertile with such revelations, and the resulting tome provides a wide-ranging scope in terms of the different civilizations he uncovers. They range from the Illinois plain and the Massachusetts coast to the Andes and the Amazon rainforest.There is a rich mixture of history, legend and scholarship in Mann's writing but not a real attempt to explain more cohesively how these civilizations thrived. As we discover, the natives sometimes overcrowded the land and strained local supplies of water, wood and game animals. More often, however, they managed their local nature ably, sustaining large populations for centuries. The author documents a multitude of scientific theories, and he questions their accuracy with acuity but with a surprising lack of focus. Yet, even with these cautions, the book is chockfull of interesting tales of places like the great Inca city of Tenochtitlan. At its height, it was more populous than present-day Paris. He also describes Tawantinsuyu on Lake Titicaca, a marvel of architecture and economic prosperity none of which remains today. The most intriguing story is the city that used to exist across the Mississippi from modern-day St. Louis, apparently the largest settlement north of the Rio Grande.As a turning point, 1492 has always been presented as the introduction of sustainable civilization to the New World, but Mann pierces this myth by painting a vivid picture of colonizers swarming over the land and determined to subjugate the natives. With their weaponry of gunpowder and steel, the Europeans also introduced voracious livestock which invaded and consumed native crops. The biggest eye-opener is the fact that the foreign-bred cows, chickens and pigs carried diseases previously unknown to the natives. In fact, the greatest demographic catastrophe in global history occurred when lacking immunity, the Indians died by the millions, reducing their numbers to a tenth of their previous population by 1800.Mann's prose is lively enough, but sometimes he gets highly technical with a lack of dexterity to translate his findings. His tendency to get bogged down in the minutiae leads to some confusing debates between older and newer scholars. I was hoping for a greater sense of viewpoint among the various theories since some strike me as far weaker than others. For example, he concludes rather simplistically that Indian precedents link directly to American democracy, which supposedly caused the dissolution of European hierarchies of command and control. The lack of perspective probably has to do with the author's journalistic background, which puts more focus on fact presentation than on an organized narrative. Without greater structure and perhaps due to the lack of an anthropologist's instincts, the book tends to bounce between centuries and across vast continents in a repetitive and at times, contradictory fashion.Regardless, Mann's book is a triumph of fresh material on a timeworn subject in allowing us to re-examine how we teach the ancient history of the Americas and how we live with the environmental consequences of colonization. In the final chapters, the author confronts the clash between environmentalists and developers and the inevitable ramifications. This is a fascinating read for even non-anthropologists."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a fascinating book about an amazing subject of such breadth and diversity to startle the imagination. The subject is the Americas in the period before Columbus and the ravages of western diseases. The claims are deeply speculative and some will say revisionist. They are basically trying to get at three perplexing questions. 1) What was the population of the Americas before Columbus and what was its economic development? 2) When did Americans first arrive and from where and by what? 3) What happened to this civilization.We are told by new scholarship that perhaps Americans immigrated from Siberia or across the pacific not 11,000 years ago but 20,000 years ago. We are also now finding that population densities were much higher then previously thought, not only among the Aztecs and Incas but in the Mississippi valley and elsewhere. At the same time we learn that technology of the Native Americans was higher and more progressed then previously thought. Lastly we are told the claim that diseases whipped out between 90-98% of the people living in America at this time.These are radical new claims, especially the claims regarding Native American tampering with the environment. These are interesting claims and perhaps some of them are true. There are however several reservations. Evidence for the arrival of Americans 20,000 years ago is scant and based on only a few sites where carbon dating may have been wrongly applied. Secondly, the population densities of the Americas have been widely claimed as larger, especially in Diamonds well received book \`Guns, Germs and Steel'. The idea that diseases brought by Europeans lead to one of the worst epidemics in world history, ten times worse then the great plague, is also rehashed from previous studies. The wonderful thing about this book is it presents the new ideas in a clear and convincing format, easily digestible and a fascinating read.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is it. A tour de force, referencing all of the specialized works which the media and other writers have brought to the attention of us non-specialists, and introducing much significant work that hadn't previously been widely reviewed.Every author has his quirks. Mann sees anthropologists especially, but also the archaeologists, linguists and other specialists with whom they interact, as being constantly engaged in pitched battles defending their various pet theories, to such an extent that they abandon civil behavior towards one another. It's a bit of a bad rap. The anthropologists I've know, from Theodora Kroeber on down, have generally been a more agreeable lot.Another quirk, not terribly surprising given his topic, is to inflate the significance of the accomplishments of American civilizations beyond even what his surprising findings might support. Yes, they did have fantastic architecture, well-developed and ecologically sensible architecture, elaborate social structures, writing, advanced arithmetic and vast cities and monuments. Even given all that, to suggest that they were on a par with or ahead of contemporaneous European or Chinese civilization seems to be a bit of a stretch.Mann is very good on the subject of agriculture: the domestication of food crops. The story of maize/corn is especially interesting. It has been cultivated so long that it is the only grain the wild ancestors of which remain a mystery. His description of today's Amazon, Peru and Mexico are so accurate as to give great credence to his accounts of how they got the way they are.His account of how and when the Americas were populated is likewise very thorough and balanced, giving thorough descriptions of the various schools of thought and well drawn support for his preference of one theory over another. His bottom line is that the continent was peopled well before the previous estimate of 12,000 years ago. He offers support for several novel ideas. The settlers may have traveled south by boat. The original Peruvian agriculture may have been to grow cotton for fishnets rather than food. Peruvian civilization started on the coast rather than in the Andes.A question Mann chooses not to address is why these descendents of such grand civilizations have fared so poorly in modern times. Even granted their near extinction from European diseases, and their second-class status under the Spanish (the Portuguese, French and British are benignly overlooked), why is it that the native peoples of Bolivia have not adapted well to Western culture, and why does resentment run so high that the nativist politics of Evo Morales, Hugo Chavez, Ollanta Humala and others succeed as they do? Mann remarks several times on the minimal importance of marketplaces among the American civilizations. There was extensive trade, but it seems to have been on a tribe-to-tribe basis rather than person-to-person. Individual needs were satisfied by allocations from community stores. This highly communitarian description ties very well to what one observes in native American ruins and among contemporary native Americans. Is there something in the Indian history and temperament that handicaps their progress in societies that are now patterned according to the European model?In summary, this book does a wonderful job of filling the huge void in most of our knowledge of the native peoples of the Americas. One can hope that its success inspires imitation; it is a huge topic, with much left to be written."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"(...)which cited its description of the development of maize as one of the great feats of genetic manipulation. Mann's main purpose in writing 1491 is the advancement of two theories: (a) that the Americas were far more thickly populated than popularly supposed and (b) that the Indian cultures were fairly sophisticated. After reading the book, I am not convinced that either theory is true, simply because I don't think Mann has provided sufficient evidence to make his case.Mann relies on too many anecdotal accounts and has a habit of subtly shifting his argument from the facts (as much as they are known) to speculation. I think the emphasis on a select few scientists and the personal dimensions of their disputes is distracting. I enjoyed his writing at first but soon began to tire of it - his metaphorical style struck me as quirky and apt early in the book, but became annoying.I thought the book was not well organized. He jumps from region to region, culture to culture and time period to time period. I found it difficult to make an overall assessment of his argument and that left me unpersuaded.This book did not convince me that the Indians were quite as advanced as Mann thinks they were, but it did open my eyes to a world of which I was had previously been ignorant. I would like to read more about the Indian cultures, particularly of North America."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann has done a great service to all peoples of the Americas with this fine book.He culls the reasearch of countless archeaologists, anthropologists and other scientists from the past two decades to reveal a history that has been waiting too long for a voice.The text is very reader friendly and allows even the most scientifically uninitiated to understand complex ideas. In addition to making dense scholarly material accessible to the average reader he does so in a well rounded way that makes note of criticisms of varying theories, allowing for the those interested in reading dissenting views to know where to look.An absolutely fantastic read. A revelation. A must-read for all interested in their American history and the battles and conflicts that shaped a hemisphere."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann's remarkable book, 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, made me rethink most of what I considered to be true about life in the western hemisphere before the arrival of Christopher Columbus -- and that's saying something. I have considered myself a student of history since adolescence, one with a special interest in the U.S. and Latin America. I even lived in Peru for several years in the 1990s, where I read and wrote a great deal about the Inca Empire that had been based there.After reading 1491, I realized that my view of the world that Columbus stumbled on had not been turned on its heads, but that the tragedy I had imagined for the native cultures had been put into greater focus and delicately altered.The most surprising fact in the book is that by the start of the 16th century, small pox and other diseases brought by the very first Europeans had resulted in the death of around 100 million people living in the Americas: a mind-boggling 95 percent of the Indians exposed to Europeans died of disease. That's around 1/5 of the world's total population at the time, the equivalent to 1.3 billion extra people today dying of disease over the course of a century. Stunning.He also argues that the attractive stereotypes of native cultures as humans living in harmony in a pristine world is wrong and essentially dehumanizing: European cultures have, Mr. Mann writes, \\"implicitly depicted Indians as people who never changed their environment from its original wild state. Because history is change, they were people without history.\\" All of that made the horrifying treatment of these cultures easier over time.He points out that cultures in the Americas were no more uniform than those in Europe: from Eskimo populations in what is now northern Canada and Alaska, to the jungle tribes of the Amazon, to the pyramid-building civilizations of Central America, to the roving peoples of sparsely-populated North America.In between grand points like these, Mr. Mann touches on other points of contention: Where did these cultures come from? Why weren't they more effective in resisting the European advance? Why did they invent the wheel and then only use it as a children's toy? He even speculates (briefly) on what might have happened if the Europeans had arrived earlier or later.But what might be 1491's best trait is that through it all, Mr. Mann remains agnostic about what could of happened and who was to blame for what did happen. Like a good journalist -- and I have read that Mr. Mann's background is indeed in journalism -- he focuses instead on showing us the story rather than interpreting it. He leaves the interpretation to the reader."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann, a thoughtful science writer and producer of excellent prose, will surely face considerable attack over this new work. Sadly, much of it will surely come from talking heads who never read it and have little interest in the topic beyond their particular political axe to grind. That is their loss.Mann cogently argues that pre-Columbian civilization in the Western hemisphere far exceeded the stereotypes of savages that dominated much of the original thinking in Europe that greatly colors our modern perceptions. Far from simple, across the two American continents a great diversity of cultures thrived, marked by great advances in agriculture, art, architecture, and social organization. Indeed, from the great cities of Mesoamerica (often larger than their European counterparts) to the complex social organization of the Northern American natives of the Ohio valley with developed notions of liberty and autonomy, one cannot help but be impressed.In a few places the work falls a bit short, particularly where Mann seems to become over enthusiastic regarding his topic. While unfortunate, the author is not an anthropologist and should be forgiven for such flights of fancy. Anthropology remains conflicted over the period of initial human settlement in the West and to those first settlers relationship with the pre-Columbian natives found by Europeans on their arrival. However, Mann's decision to gloss over the controversy little damages the pace of the book or the strength of his argument.Readers of Guns, Germs, and Steel will surely take particular interest in this work. In several places this work dovetails with Diamond's argument, while in others it stands in sharp contrast. One particular point to chew on is the relative material wealth of natives of North America, with rich available food stuffs contrasting with the more central and \\"advanced\\" cultures of Mesoamerica. This issue points to one of the great arguments of Diamond's critics, that it was the relative material poverty as opposed to wealth in Europe and China that spurred technological advance to offset such challenges.Readers will surely take great interest in this work and find it a launching pad for further examination of a fascinating topic."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is one of the most captivating books you will read this year. It will take all of those \\"truths\\" you studied so diligently in school and make you question, question, question. Were the Americas (before Columbus) really the unblemished Garden of Eden setting that we have been told, or as Mann purports, were the Native's altering the terrain long before the arrival of Europeans on the scene?The fact that the ancient Aztec capital of Tenochtilan had more inhabitants than Paris and boasted running water and an enclosed sewer system would seem to lend credence to Mann's claims of the native locals shaping their environment and managing their food supplies to satisfy their comfort and convenience levels for many, many years before the appearance of Columbus or Cortez.Mann's subject matter and writing style as well as his vision, as he attempts to show both sides of this discussion, should assure this \\"scientific\\" tome a place of honor on the best seller list. It certainly provides the reader with a lot of food for thought and is definitely a lot more convincing and enthralling than much of the current material residing on the list of best sellers provided by our local newspapers."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Though it has its flaws (see below), this is an impressive review of new scholarship on what indigenous civilizations looked like in the Americas before Columbus. Mann took a reporter's approach, interviewing scholars who are rethinking the conventional wisdom (as opposed to reading all their publications). This approach makes the book eminently approachable for the general reader but means that he necessarily elides the messy side of scholarship - - the debates, the falsifications, the qualifications.The result is interesting and important for the interested reader, and I hope every American history teacher reads it. At the same time, I think you have to read it critically as well as with an open mind.Most important, Mann's presentation is intentionally biased. Let's say there is a serious academic debate on some issue, as there usually is. Position A is less flattering to Indians than Position B, and there are good arguments on both sides. Mann will always side with Position B. Rhetorically, he will present Position A as outdated, and associate it with unsympathetic and occasionally racist figures from the history of scholarship.In some respects, that's a decent model. Historiography often moves from orthodoxy to revisionism. But Mann's bias leaves out two other common features of change in historiography. First, it often moves from orthodoxy to revision - - and then reaches a new synthesis drawing from both positions. Mann's single-minded support of revisionism neglects the weaknesses of revisionism and the strengths of orthodoxy. Second, some revisionist ideas don't pan out and never contribute to a new orthodoxy. That will likely be the fate of some of the ideas that Mann presents favorably. A more critical view of revisionism would serve Mann well.That's a problem if you take Mann as presenting a new orthodoxy, and I hope that you history teachers won't do that. But, again, I hope that you read it and share it with your students."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"1491\\" comes out at a time when I've just finished reading Zinn's \\"A People's History\\" so I was immediately intrigued. As other reviewers have stated, this is not the history that we all learned back in Mr. Lombardi's fifth grade class. Though it's largely speculative (as is all prehistory) Mann fills in a fascinating story of an advanced and varied culture. Using as much data as he can and filling in where needed he creates an interesting timeline and history that has apparently struck some controversial cord with other historians. I like the book because I think it gives a clear picture of the continents' first settlers without stereotyping (a failure of Zinn's I think). I was also interested to learn how advanced the Indian's cities and cultures were. I thought that Mann was too hard on the Europeans at times, painting them all with one brush. Really a good book, though, if it can be read with a little bit of a skeptical eye."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Many thousands of years ago, people arrived in the Western Hemisphere from Asia. How many years, how many people and how many times they made the incursion are all topics of this book. How they lived has been the subject of increasingly intense investigation. Mann has assembled much research, both old and modern, to present a sweeping analysis of what the Europeans found when they arrived millennia later from the opposite direction. In a compelling and well-structured account, he offers an iconoclastic analysis of what the Americas were before Columbus' arrival.Mann's thesis is that the Western Hemisphere was far more densely populated than our school courses [when they touched on the indigenous peoples at all] led us to believe. After fitful starts along the Atlantic seaboard, European colonists felt they'd entered a nearly empty continent. The sweeping expansion of the United States seemed to reinforce the notion of an \\"empty land\\". Recent archaeological finds and closer examination of the conquistadores' accounts suggest otherwise. It's now known that many urban centres of high population density existed in the Mississippi Valley, in central Mexico and throughout South America. The peoples living there had complex societies and economies, with trading and cultural influences extending vast distances. Intricate calendar systems, including use of \\"zero\\" as a real number, existed centuries before Europeans developed the idea.Why did these cities and their inhabitants not survive to greet the invaders? There are the accounts of Cortes in Tenochtitlan and Pizarro saw Inka settlements, but population conglomerates seem rare in most accounts. According to Mann, the culprit was European disease resulting from the development of agriculture. Farming and pastoralism arose long after the arrival of those Asians to the Western Hemisphere. The two populations, isolated from each other led to differing immunities. Centuries of co-habitation with domestic animals like horses, pigs and fowl led to the transmission of many poxes, especially smallpox, to humans. The European and West Asian survivors developed a resistance to the infections. The indigenous peoples of the Americas, who domesticated few animals, had no such resistance. Multitudes of people were swept away, not by conquistadores and \\"cowboys\\", but by invisible microorganisms introduced by the earliest explorers. The pestilence left them vulnerable when more Europeans arrived. The result was the identification of the \\"Indians\\" as backward, illiterate, vulnerable and hardly worthy of serious study. Mann describes this attitude as \\"Holmberg's Mistake\\" - anthropologists finding of remnant peoples living in a manner European observers believed perpetual.Mann's search for answers to what the Western Hemisphere was like in \\"1491\\" took him many places meeting a host of researchers and relying on a massive document base. Skimming the notes and bibliography shows a preponderance of sources published in recent years. Although Mann gives voice to those who contend the numbers are poorly derived, there's little doubt he sympathises with the new wave of research findings. He provides useful maps, that almost overwhelming bibliography and a set of appendices to explain terms, describe a possible binary language of the Inka and \\"Calendar Math\\". With the mass of information and the evidence of accomplishments preceding those of its European infectors and conquerers, it's not unexpected when he questions use of the term \\"New World\\" in referring to the Americas. In regard to what was lost, he contends the disintegration of the societies in the Americas wasn't just the loss to those communities, \\"but to the human enterprise as a whole\\".

I've been to a few of the places discussed in 1491 (Massachusetts, where Mann talks about the various tribes vying for power and how that played in English hands; Cahokia; Peru, where Mann draws on research from the last 30 years to paint a picture of a culture from 3500 B.C.) and did some research before and during these visits but this book taught me a lot of new facts. This isn't too surprising because a lot of the relevant discoveries are going on right now and Mann talks about important archaeological work first reported in 2003, for example.This book will be great for young people who are interested in learning what it is like to be a archaeologist, anthropologist, or biologist engaged in debates over ambiguous data.Highly recommended to any curious person living in or visiting the Americas."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Let's start with the book's subtitle: \\"New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus.\\" The author reports on three major (and controversial) ideas in pre-Columbian studies, namely, that pre-Columbian populations in the Americas were (1) much older, (2) much larger, and (3) had a much bigger impact on the environment than people used to believe. These ideas, though, are hardly \\"new revelations;\\" they date back to the 1980's or even earlier. Readers who are already familiar with them, whether pro or con, and who are looking for a synthesis of current work in this field, may come away disappointed.On the other hand, for the general reader, the book isn't as readable as one might hope. Like most science journalism, the book includes three kinds of writing: an explanation of the concepts involved, the author's personal anecdotes (travels and interviews with scientists), and a history of how the concepts developed over time. In the present book, this is all mixed together so indiscriminately that the reader has to change focus, rapidly and often, among the personal, the historical, and the conceptual. This is especially true of the first two thirds of the book, where this reader, at least, found himself losing patience as well as the thread of the argument. The third section, dealing with ecological impacts of the native peoples, seemed to employ a better style and a smoother flow of ideas.The book does not mention the US Southwest or Pacific Northwest, nor does it present a connected account of the history or culture of the regions it does mention. In spite of its title, it spends a lot of time on the colonizing years _after_ 1491.Some good things about the book are the author's competence and understanding of his subject, extensive end-notes and a useful bibliography. Given that it has achieved near-best-seller status (at least, it is a best-seller for a science journalism book), it may be that I am wrong in some of the objections I've cited, or it may be that it is one of those books destined to be purchased by many though read by few. About that, only the individual reader can decide."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 more than lives up to it's promise.

It was European diseases that conquered the indigenous peoples, not any technology, including guns and steel.Mann makes the point that however contact occurred, it was inevitable, and the spread of diseases was also. It was the long separation that set the stage for the devastation.The nations on the American continents were not backward in comparison to those in Europe at the time. The diseases of the first explorers spread with lightening speed through completely unprotected populations largely because of the extensive trade networks that existed. It was a post disaster scenario that gave the first settlers the impression that the continent was sparsely populated and based on a subsistence economy.Charles Mann's best point is that contact was far from a one way street. It was intimate contact with the culture of the \\"Indians\\" which influenced the colonials to the point that they became unwilling to accept unquestioningly the rule of England and it's King. The Indians taught us about individual liberty and how to effectively fight for it. They taught us how to join sovereign entities like our separate states into a powerful union.He also points out that the development of corn was an agricultural achievement far more difficult than simply gaining control of wild grasses as was done in the ancient near east. Corn is not a natural outgrowth of tendencies in the wild plant but the product of considerable human ingenuity and design. It and other products of New World agriculture now sustain large portions of the globe.I enjoyed this book so much I didn't want to finish it. It is so well written and researched it should be required reading for all Americans."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"For decades, the dominating scholarly view on the pre-Columbus Americas before 1492 were that the Americas were sparsely populated by bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers, and that the only real beginnings of civilization per se were in Peru and Mexico. These narrow views of history are still being taught in some schools today, despite constant archeological research that suggests otherwise. Suprised by this, Mann decided to write a book that brought together all the available evidence to attempt to potray how the Americas may have been.Mann's book covers the scholarly debate on numerous topics: how the first natives arrived in the Americas, the time frame they may have come in, the rise of fall of vast city-states across the Americas long before Columbus was conceived, the depopulation that occured due to smallpox and other diseases, and the current knowledge of cities and archeological sites that are still being found. Mann presents both sides of the arguments, though he clearly feels that sufficient evidence exists to support the theory that millions populated the Americas pre-Columbus, that some had very advanced civilizations, and that the historical record is one of constant dispute and change based on new findings every year. Despite this leaning, Mann doesn't dismiss any possibilities. He gives critics their air time, and essentially paints a possible picture based on evidence and supposition and lets the reader decide.Whatever your take on the subject, this book is smoothly written and fair in its treatment and makes for eminently entertaining reading. Mann is not a scientist, but he makes convincing arguments that there is much more to the story than we had ever thought, and presents the scientific and archelogical evidence to support it. This book is highly recommended, and one of my Best of Year Books."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann starts writing his book speaking about several well known stereotypes that many have about American Indian people from before Christopher Columbus' arrival in the western hemisphere in 1492, and there are several points ha makes that he argues effectively:1. Native populations did not give way because they had inferior technology to the Europeans.Even before I read his argument on this point, I already agreed with him. There are several instances in Amerindian history when the native peoples had confronted Europeans and their guns and could have prevailed. One example is that at one point, the Aztecs were able to force the Spanish away from their capital of Tenochtitlan, and as far as I can tell they used the weapons they always had. Also another example is Pontiac's war; Pontiac was able to take nine out of eleven British forts in present-day Ohio and stood on the very verge of victory. What brought about the downfall of both cases of resistance was the same thing: disease. The Spanish inadvertently brought smallpox to the Aztecs, though in the latter case, the source was much more sinister. This would imply that if it were not for diseases to which the Indians were vulnerable, history could have been very different.[1]2. The Natives affected their environments.One of the examples that Charles Mann invokes in in the ninth chapter (Amazonia), though to be honest, I already had one of the sames reasons he gives in mind before I read his book. In the Amazon, the soil is very poor, so farmers continually clear land for more farming effectively destroying the rain forest. Soil analysis of past settlements in the area show, however, that the indigenous peoples in the area mixed charcoal with the soil, and the was that the soil became more suitable for farming.[2] So, kudos to Mann for mentioning this. Mann also gives other examples in other places, such as Indians using fire. Of course he does not agree with the view held by some environmentalists that the Indians were always ecologically friendly, but he does NOT disagree with the concept that they were still usually in harmony with nature either. They did mess up at times. They did live in harmony with nature, but they pulled strings. Translation: They were not tree huggers, but they were not ecologically dangerous either. [3]Charles Mann writes his book as a journalist, and he reports the findings as a journalist would. Personally, aspiring to be a historian, I would take a different approach, but that is the only real complaint I have for his book. Though I have read in some areas that this book is \\"controversial,\\" I cannot imagine why it would be since Mann's book is verifiable. Perhaps it is because of his acceptance of the high Amerindian population that inhabited the hemisphere by the time Columbus arrived. Mann does point out that there are some who do not like those figures because of certain \\"implications.\\" One review calls Mann a \\"liberal lunatic,\\" apparently because of his acceptance of the high population estimate.[4] I would like to point out, however, that I am far from a Liberal and I accept the estimate as well. The ad hominem attack is apparently due to a lack of seeing past a certain nationalistic, political scope.Overall, I recommend this book.-----[1] It has to be mentioned that another factor in the failure of Pontiac's war was that the French did not pull through for him. But he would have been able to go on without their help if it weren't for the epidemic of smallpox.[2] Charcoal May Help Improve Soil Quality: [...][3] I should recommend the Book \\"Ecocide of Native America.\\" This book argues that Indians were America's first ecologists. I agree with Mann, though I think this other work has merit as well. I would say that both authors are correct, though it is an oversimplification to take either opposite extreme that either Indians were \\"tree huggers,\\" or they were environmentally unfriendly.[4] See: [...]"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The author does a great job of portraying life in the Americas prior to Christopher Columbus and European intervention.The book will either please or offend everyone.The author's central points are:1) Native Americans existed in larger numbers than historians previously acknowledged and had a level of sophistication and grandeur that often dwarved Europe at this time period (this will greatly please Native American supporters).2) Native Americans were involved in agriculture, building, military endeavors that often placed them at odds with their enviornment and other native groups. Slash and burn farming, large scale human sacrifices, incessant war, etc. Pre-1492 Western Hemisphere was not a \\"garden of Eden\\" -- but a manipulated, often abused, piece of Earth. (This will greatly offend Native American supporters).In the end the book is fair, not trying to be politically correct nor reduce itself to pre-modern era hostile view to Native Americans.A good book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Having just recently completed 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, I decided to compare it to 1421: The Year China Discovered America by Gavin Menzies. The main point of 1491 is that the Americas, North, Central and South, were settled much earlier than we have been led to believe and that there was a very significant population of advanced cultures spread across the Americas. The author, Charles Mann, relies on various recent findings in archaeology, paleontology and genetics along with his own personal travels and historical first hand accounts to establish that there was a very large population of indigenous Americans present before the Europeans. These cultures had languages, complex agriculture, calendars and massive public works projects developed independently of Euro-Asian influences. His premise is that the very first contacts with Europeans led to the transfer of diseases such as small pox, measles and yellow fever to native americans, with devastating effects. The result, the sparsely populated continents the latter waves of European settlers experienced was actually the result of their own contact. By comparison, 1421 has its premise that a great Chinese fleet that sailed in the early 1400's actually covered all of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, making contact with many different cultures and establishing colonies. Unfortunately, and conveniently for Menzies, nearly all of the records of these accomplishments were destroyed during subsequent politcal upheaval. The difference between 1421 and 1491 is that Menzies spins a very good, even interesting tale, but provides very little in the way of scientific citations to backup his claims. For those who find 1491 interesting additional reading should include Genes, Peoples, and Languages by Luigi Luca Cavali-Sforza, The Seven Daughters of Eve by Bryan Sykes and The Journey of Man: A Genetic Odyssey by Spencer Wells."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Back in the 1980s I picked up a book off my father's shelf that caught my eye and read it through: \\"Indian New England Before the Mayflower\\" by Howard Russell. This book was massively researched the way David McCullough would research a book: every account left by early explorers and observers was read; every reference in regional or local histories or archaeological writings was examined; every New England museum or known archaeological site was visited and informed people interviewed. I was impressed by the scholarship and came away convinced that the Native Americans were far more advanced than we have been led to believe in the typical American History book.Thus I was not surprised by the content of \\"1491,\\" which takes the same thesis and expands upon it to cover the entire New World. Charles Mann has researched his book nearly as extensively as Russell - in fact it comes as no surprise that Russell's book is cited as a source for \\"1491.\\" As an aside I am puzzled by some of the one star reviews that imply \\"1491\\" has not been adequately researched - there is a 50 page note section at the back, followed by a 58 page bibliography citing, and I am not making this up, well over 1000 scholarly sources. Such comments make me question whether the writers of such reviews even have copies of the book in their possession, or are they simply launching negative reviews for some ulterior motive.And this would make sense, because the material IS controversial. The idea that the white man is responsible for the deaths of millions of people does not sit well politically with some folks, who perhaps believe it is somehow an indictment of them, or the United States, or maybe democracy. Who knows? Whatever the reason, there is a school of thought devoted toward minimizing estimates of the Native American population prior to the arrival of Columbus, and minimizing their level of cultural advancement. Perhaps it is more palatable to think that there were only a few pesky savages around and we brought them order and civilization, versus contemplating the possibility that we may have erased an entire hemisphere's worth of civilization. To put this in perspective, imagine a scenario where the New World inhabitants had progressed faster than the Old World, and that huge invasion fleets from Central America began appearing off the European coast and the Mediterranean at the time of the Roman Empire. Imagine if these \\"Indians\\" arrived with a suite of diseases lethal to the native Europeans, and possessing technology several centuries ahead of the Romans. Imagine Europe enduring the Black Death five times over, and then waves of \\"Indians\\" coming to inhabit the now collapsed and abandoned Roman Empire and slightly less civilized areas surrounding it in Germany or Eastern Europe. Mann presents a good case that this kind of scenario is far more likely to have occurred in the New World when the Europeans arrived than the one we have all been told in American History books.Regarding the population of pre-Columbian America, for every researcher who claims a low, less dense population, Mann shows that there are other researchers who estimate the population to be ten times higher. We will probably never know. In my opinion, and to his credit, Mann provides a balanced view of this debate, citing both sides, and then weighs in with his assessment (which is more in line with the \\"high\\" side). Again, I tend to think he presents a pretty convincing argument.It is also clear that the idea that Native Americans consisted of small bands of stone age savages frolicking in the woods cannot possibly be true. We all know this intuitively just from the \\"Pilgrim\\" story. We all know how the Indians taught the Pilgrims how to farm - how to grow corn and squash and beans and how to fertilize and tend these crops - we've all heard the story of \\"Squanto.\\" So if the Indians were a bunch of Stone Age savages living in tepees in the woods - how is that they knew more about farming than the Pilgrims? If they were that knowledgeable about farming, doesn't that imply that they had settled into agricultural communities? What do we make of the reports from early European explorers of large villages and even small cities surrounded by square miles of farms? The Pilgrims basically occupied the abandoned Indian town that was situated at Plymouth (it was abandoned because the inhabitants had been decimated by disease), and the early accounts describe it as a full-scale village with streets and large wooden buildings. Kind of like Iowa, only without satellite TV or football teams.And these are descriptions of the Indians living far from the major population centers and urbanized areas in central America.All in all, Mann presents a compelling argument that America was a far different place in 1491 than most of us realize. A fascinating account, and definitely a must-read for anyone interested in history."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is an awesome book, a great piece of work exploring and challenging what most of us have come to believe is true about the Americas before Colulmbus, very little of which is true, and most of which is still taught in our public school history textbooks.The impact of the Indians on the land, the impact of the settlers on the Indians AND the land, the impact of the Indians on the settlers is an intricate dance that Mann explores with style, grace, and clarity.It's a big book, full and rich with text, graphics and detail.

When I saw that Charles Mann expanded it into a book, I was looking forward to the author delving further into epidemiological or ethno historical evidence to support the supposition that Native Americans died off in HUGE numbers as European explorers arrived with new diseases. Unfortunately in making the transition to novel from short story, the author choose instead to explore creative ways to villainize Europeans and people of European descent while praising the knowledge, accomplishments and mystical beliefs of the American Natives. In the book (not the short story) the author takes pains to make fun of sixteenth century European speculations on the origin of humans in the Americas. Mr. Mann uses guilt by association to show how the agricultural products of the old world like wool and wheat were scratchy and unpleasant while the agricultural products of the new world (cotton and maize) were soft, sweet and superior due to the superiority of the people growing them. I had to put the book down about two thirds of the way through. I also didn't quite understand the need for this book to include 100+ pages of references to other publications. Perhaps, Mr. Mann contracted to produce a book of X pages, based on the fine Atlantic Monthly article, and was not able to fill it with facts. Instead wild speculation and notes were added as padding.On Page 140, Mr. Mann writes \\"Since the sixteenth century, the origins of Native Americans have been an intellectual puzzle. A puzzle to the Europeans, anyway - Indians seem to have been, as a rule, satisfied with traditional explanations of their origins.\\" Three pages later, Mr. Mann even uses the oddly misspelled word \\"Hindoos\\" (in quotes) to poke fun at one of the possible groups that a sixteenth Spaniard (Jose de Acosta) posited as a candidate for the peopling of the Americas. Apparently Mr. Mann sees greater truth in mythological claptrap as scientific explanation than he does in a Spaniard, who in 1590, described a land bridge connecting Asia and America. Rather than poke fun at this sixteenth century European, I would laud his insight. Granted, Jose Acosta's time table for this land crossing was off by several millennia, but from the facts that Mr. Mann presents, I would draw a very different conclusion about which culture was grossly ignorant. Regardless, poking fun at a group because of their ignorance is a despicable practice in a scientific treatise.On page 188, Mr. Mann writes \\"Norte Chico Chiefdoms where almost certainly theocratic, though not brutally so; leaders induced followers to obey by a combination of ideology, charisma, and skillfully timed positive reinforcements\\". Unfortunately, this idyllic interpretation of the scant archeological evidence represents wild speculation at best. No facts are presented to support this fanciful Utopian description.Please read the Atlantic Monthly article, either from the magazine or in the anthology \\"The Best American Science Writing of 2003\\" but don't waste your time and money on this derived work - this book is not even mediocre science writing."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"What is the conclusion then?\\" -- 1 Corinthians 14:15 (NKJV)Accurately describing the past is tricky business. Part of the problem comes in being unaware of our own thinking habits that stall our ability to perceive accurately what is in front of us. More significantly, lots of partial evidence can point in a variety of directions, many of which may be ignored. Further, there's a tendency to pick a view that will draw attention . . . causing \\"spectacular\\" explanations over more cautiously chosen ones. Ultimately, it's just that the past is so large, complex, and shifting that it's beyond our power to capture.1491 is not so much about what life was like before Columbus in North and South America as it is about the methodological and intellectual problems with identifying what has gone before us . . . particularly in the absence of written records that we can decipher and understand. In the course of exploring this broad theme, Charles C. Mann does a solid job of contrasting traditional beliefs about pre-Columbian times (small populations of \\"uncivilized\\" people who lived in the middle of a nearly pristine environment, little changed over thousands of years) with more recent scholarship that suggests the Americas may have had enormous populations relative to Europe that were soon decimated by disease from Europeans, very sophisticated civilizations, and advanced practices for controlling the environment that we would do well to emulate today. I came away with an appreciation that tracking down what really happened is probably the work of many future centuries of research. In any event, those who \\"assume\\" European superiority in 1491 can learn a lot from reading about the contrary evidence as described by Mr. Mann.The book's main weakness is that it doesn't have a simple thesis and structure. Ostensibly focused on new research, the book often tells about the new findings in such a leisurely and anecdotal way that what you learn is more at the factoid level than in fleshing out a picture of what happened. As a result, there's a lot of \\"what if\\" information here that's not likely to be fully confirmed or denied anytime soon. You'll come away realizing the you need to keep an open mind about many aspects of life in the Americas before 1492 without being able to firmly state what did occur . . . with the exception of descriptions of conquests among some of the larger empires. I found the book's photographs and maps greatly helped to make the scientific studies come to life so I could integrate what was being said into a personal perspective.Mr. Mann is very fair in presenting questions and rebuttals from scholars about hypotheses and competing conclusions so that you won't feel as though you only have the choice of accepting all the latest studies without question.My overall reaction to the book was to want to learn more about these studies. I hope that scholars in these subjects will be encouraged to publish well-illustrated books at the popular science reading level for those who would like to know more about the lessons from earlier civilizations that we should be applying today.

But the book is so annoying in its presentism and propagandizing that I quit reading and skimmed the remainder. Mann is an antinomian child of the modern age who wants to believe the Indians lived in complete personal liberty, as if an Iroquois male adolescent had the choice of being a brave brave or cowardly math nerd. He is a neo-Rousseauvian: he doesn't believe in the savage part of the noble savage myth (indeed, he thinks the advanced societies of Indians remade the environment, for the good), but he keeps the noble part with a vengeance. Even after a century of contact with debilitating European diseases, the Indians the Pilgrims met were well-formed and healthy while the Europeans were pock-marked and stunted-somehow it doesn't make sense, except that Europeans in this book are invariably destined to come out on the short end in more ways than one.Although post-Columbian North America was settled primarily by people from England, they are usually referred to in this book as Europeans, as if their distinctive Englishness was unimportant. In fact, he goes out of his way to criticize, quite unfairly, one of the finest scholars on the subject of the English origins of the early colonists, Bernard Bailyn. Mann simply doesn't understand the vast difference between insular and continental Europe in the history of the Western Hemisphere.My suspicions of Mann's judgment were confirmed when I found him citing that academic fraud Ward Churchill in all seriousness (e.g. p. 131).Mann's style is as annoying as his gullibility. \\"Taken literally\\" the recent assertions that \\"The Great Law of Peace inspired the U.

As soon as you read his \\"taken literally\\" you know that there is a better way to take it: \\"The framers of the Constitution... were pervaded by Indian ideals and images of liberty.\\" It's not just the absurdity of any of these assertions that annoy, it is the effect of his romantic enthusiasm on his choice of loaded words and his grammatical carelessness: the \\"framers\\" were \\"pervaded\\"?This book is more about the author's views on modern society than it is about ancient Indian societies."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is just ok.

While Europeans, Asians, and Africans used inorganic means to change the enviorment the Indians used organic means to change the enviorment. Neither is wrong.

However, this book is definitely worth reading for the interesting information you'll take away.I agree that it is poorly organized, but the main problem I had was the uneven writing: many minor/tangential topics receive great attention and are presented in great detail while truly major, interesting topics that should have been expanded were treated lightly. Were I an editor, I would have returned this manuscript to the author for a rewrite. Furthermore, I was irked that there were not more drawings, maps, and photographs of \\"Indian\\" art, lands, ruins, artifacts, etc. *YET* there were photographs of the archaeologists, sociologists, etc. whose work is mentioned (I wasn't reading this book to learn what these modern white guys look like - who cares?).But - it is interesting and worth reading. Just get the $10 paperback, not the hard-cover!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This topic had the potential for being something genuinely splendid but failed to live up to that potential. While I recognize that the authors was not attempting to write a text that would be consumed by scholars, the intellectual rigor that accompanies such texts should have been evident nonetheless. In addition to the fact that the first quarter or so of this book focuses on post-contact life in the Americas rather than life prior to significant European contact, it chooses a clear socio-political trajectory, omitting points of intellectual decent. This is hardly surprising in that the book is couched in the us/them tradition. Rather than discussing a culture or series of culture in their own right, the author is compelled to place these cultures in contrast, implying superiority and moral supremacy of one over the other. It is amazing that Europeans ever managed to survive let alone expand. Had it not been for disease and a ruthless evil known only in Biblical stories, Europeans would still be living in caves. If we replace \\"European\\" with \\"Sioux\\", we would have a reasonable facsimile of the kind of writing that frequently appeared 50 years ago. The same diatribe is present here, only the names and cultural contexts have changed.More disappointing is the fact that this inevitably shifts the focus of the book away from the native populations to the European conquerors and settlers. Just as with Hollywood blockbusters like Dances With Wolves, the white intruder becomes the star of the show and the native is reduced to the status of the noble savage. They are, in effect, turned into the historical equivalent of the people of Atlantis.Finally, Mann settles on dates and processes that while subscribed to by some scholars, are rejected by others. Rather than stating that human migration into the Americas started at the point he suggestss, it would have been more accurate and interesting to discuss the various models put forward by archaeologists. Multiple migrations, for example. Or new evidence suggesting that the people we think of as Native Americans (regardless of national/tribal affiliation) may have out-competed or even killed of a biologically dissimilar population that had made the migration before them. In other words, rather than telling a complete story (which, unfortunately, frequently makes things less clear), Mann has taken a position and decided to pick and choose which facts he will include to support it.Note that Mann writes very well. His book is entertaining. And there are indeed any number of interesting bit of history. It is, however, neither what it claims it is is, nor is it a book that that challenges the reader. It lacks scholarly rigor and as such is, sadly, something of a sensational farce."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"After reading the previous 45 reviews, I can see that this book have rise a lot of thoughts on many people's minds. I would have to side with those who thought this book have something important to say. Its a very thought provoking book because its not very politically correct. Pre-Columbian America were habitated by people who altered their surroundings to fit their mode of living, much as we do today. Many of the liberal environmentists must be gritting their teeth reading this book. It also appears that population of this world was vastly larger then anyone supposed and the main bane of the Indians, deadly diseases from Europe did more damaged then any single weaponary.Of course, due to lack of primary sources, author's writing rest much on educated conjectures in many cases. However, that does say quite a lot since he managed to amassed resources from all directions to come up with this book which explored the world of the pre-Columbian America from New England to Peru.The book proves to be well written, easy to read and understand with a certain flair that make the book interesting to read. I found it be highly informative and it will upset the popular perception of pre-Columbian world. I don't think it was written as part of some \\"white guilt\\" trip or to lessen it. The book reflects that many Indian civilizations that developed in pre-Columbian America were highly advanced to the European civilizations of that period but yet, inferior in many other facets.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who want to get out of the old fashioned rut of simplistic explanation of pre-Columbian America. I am sure this will be but the first of many books that will continued to explored this matter deeper and with greater insights as many historians and other professionals began to realized that old perceptions no longer stand up to the logic of the new."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I teach history and am always looking for more information to help my students enjoy a subject that can be dry and boring. Mann's book is an excellent resource. The stories he tells to weave together the various facts and theories are excellent. Reminicent of Malcolm Gladwell's Blink in readability and Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel in intellectual heft, this book is a great addition to the library of anyone who wants to know what some of us will be teaching and talking about when we discuss the history of the Americas during the next 20 years.I particularly like the way Mann gives us concrete examples of the theories, helping us see exactly why they might be true. While the things he's writing about aren't brand new, he has put them together in a accessible, appealing book that encourages amateur historians to delve further.The idea that Columbus \\"discovered\\" America has always been Eurocentric, exclusionary and just plain wrong. If nothing else, it ignored the first people to settle on this continent. Until now, there hasn't been a entertaining and readable book written for everyone which demonstrates the diverse groups which may have \\"discovered\\" this continent. This book gives us additional background on the first settlers, and shows us how inaccurate the idea that Columbus \\"discovered\\" the Americas really is.Great reading. A keeper."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If you think you know American history, especially its early origins, think again: 1491: New Revelations Of The Mericas Before Columbus will challenge everything you've ever known about pre-Columbus America. New archaeological evidence has proven some of America's most strongly-held beliefs wrong: that in 1491 America was more populated than Europe, even boasting cities larger than any in Europe at the time; that the earliest Western Hemisphere cities were thriving before Egyptians built the pyramids, and that Native Americans transformed the land before Europeans even arrived. So much for 'pristine wilderness'. And so much for traditional history: 1491 defies it - and is a 'must' for any history buff."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The other reviewers have admirably summarized this book. It is a wonderful compilation of current thinking on the history of the Americas before the Europeans.One thing that I would like to add to the reviews, is the wonderful writing of Mr. Mann. He writes so well that without any effort on your part ,you are drawn into a subject that could have been very dry. I could not put this book down.Bravo Mr. Mann."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Fans of Jared Diamond's cross-disciplinary approach will enjoy this effort, which very much follows in his mold.Mann does an estimable job of unpacking 40 years of revisionary scholarship which, aided by technological advances and greater monetary resources, have allowed us to understand life in the Americas far better than we used to, or were taught way back when.I in particular enjoyed the 180 done on the Olmecs, who fashioned those giant stone heads in Mexico, and how what we used to know about them was pretty much incomplete, outdated, or outright wrong.I don't see the political implications regarding the \\"Indian\\" myth in the way this book has been embraced by some on the right. It's a bit of a caricature in the first place to suggest that hippies and eco-nuts just want us all to \\"live on the land in peace\\" and smoke peacepipes and grow corn. The reality documented by Mann comports with my understanding of how Native Americans utilized the earth: they worked as best they could with it, developed techniques and adaptive technologies to make use of it, and revered its power and glory.More of us could do the same."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"It's good book BUT I am somewhat put off by Mann's writing style--which I am sure was something that his editors made him do to make the book more \\"accessible.\\" Too much of the book reads like feature articles--human interst stories about anthorpologists and archeologists and ethnograhers Frankly I could care less about the personal lives of these people, if they were grouchy or if they wore funny clothes--I want to know about life in the Americas before 1492, and Mann could have done this in a lot less space. I'm not saying the book is dumbed down--or well, maybe I should say that it is dumbed down. It's sort of like those new Nova shows--with the narrator making cute jokes and allthat stuff ---or appearing in costume--it's all a patronizing attempt to attract people who might not otherwise read the book or view the show (at least in the minds of the editors and producers). The book wouuld have been better if it were half the length, without the human interest padding."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I initially loved reading Mann's \\"1491\\"; his style of writing is detailed and interesting and the ideas that he expounds are fresh and much needed. The book focuses on three main ideas:1. The Native American population before the arrival of Columbus was much larger than once thought (closer to 100 million than to 1 million).2. The Native Americans arrived much earlier and developed to greater levels socially than once thought (think large urban areas with writing, organized religion, and centralized government as early as 500 AD).3. The Native Americans did not live like primitives, but rather made great changes to the environment of the Americas (in the form of farms, terraces, orchards, and massive wildfires).As I continued in the book, however, I found that it had a few faults that made continuing to read very frustrating. Although his ideas are interesting, and I would even guess there is more truth than falsity to them, Mann fails to give enough scientific evidence to convince close readers that the academic status quo is wrong. One example sticks out to me: he claims that the population of the Americas may have been as high as 100 million people. To justify this claim he uses an estimate of the population of the Americas shortly after Columbus's arrival and a percent of the population he believes to have been killed by various diseases and plagues. What he fails to get across is that there are huge error margins from that kind of analysis. He estimates that plagues killed 97% of the population of the Americas; if the true value was only 90%, the estimated population should be 1/4 of the size he estimated!To be clear, his analysis relies on statistics that are extremely sensitive to small measurement errors. Hence it is highly misleading to state that anthropologists know what the population of the Americas was with high levels of accuracy. His data does not have the statistical significance to overturn the status quo; thus this book should be clear about its limitations until more data comes in.I won't enumerate all of his scientific transgressions, but the main ones include relying too heavily on the work of a small number of academics with controversial opinions, relying too heavily on anecdotal evidence, and drawing conclusions that exceed what can be known from the data.Overall I enjoyed reading Mann's \\"1491\\", and I feel much better informed about the Americas before Columbus. I just hope that there will be books in the future that will sift through the data and theories and leave only the ones with real scientific support."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann presents an excellent mix of history, archeology, anecdote, and science, in order to paint a picture of what the North and South American continents were like before Columbus. He fleshes out a lot of the sketchy, hand-me-down impressions we receive about native cultures in school.For example, instead of just giving passing mention to the decimation that natives suffered with the arrival of Europeans, he goes into some interesting detail about how and why Indians so often fell victim to European diseases. (Incidentally, Mann said that in his researches he found native people almost uniformly preferred the term \\"Indian\\" to \\"Native-American,\\" so I'll follow suit in this review.) Mann provides a very accessible refresher course in the biology of the human immune system by way of explaining Indians' susceptibility. Part of the reason for their being so subject to our diseases was not only their basic lack of immunity, but the relative homogeneity of blood types among Indians. This is especially significant when it comes to antibody proteins that recognize invading antigens and trigger an immune assault against them. Indian populations across the Americas don't have the diversity of recognizing protein bodies that European populations do. So when a disease found them, it found a large percentage of them.Similarly, Mann doesn't rest with simple, easy idealizations of native cultures being \\"in harmony with Nature.\\" He maintains that repetition of that summary characterization leaves students with an erroneous picture of Indians as passive, long-suffering, and mute, in the face of environmental challenges. By contrast, Mann's researches showed that Indians actively shaped every landscape they inhabited. The unique form of slash-and-burn cultivation they might have practiced along large stretches of the Amazon enabled them to grow crops that would ordinary never have thrived in the basically poor soils of those jungle regions. Similarly, he believes that Indian modes of clearing the land were responsible for making much of the American West the open reaches that strike us as having always been that way, an eternal vastness.Occasionally, Mann has a misleading quirk of writing though. You'll be reading along, eager to retain what he's saying about some subject such as the Indians' arrival on these continents by way of the Bering Straits. Then all of a sudden, Mann will yank the rug out from under you with some reversal when he in effect says (paraphrasing) - \\"That's the conventional view. But research shows that Indian populations spread across the Americas in a much more complicated, or completely different, sequence of arrivals...\\" So watch out for these switchbacks.Then there are a few orienting topics that I think it would have been useful for Mann to cover in the book, but which he fails to mention altogether. He has written follow-up books such as \\"1493,\\" so perhaps he will write a revised edition of this pre-Columbian history. If so, it would be helpful if he'd explain more about the method Indians used to build the American \\"pyramids\\" and how these pyramids differ from Egyptian pyramids. Many travelers to Mexico, such as me, arrive being very woolly-headed about the nature of the pyramids at places such as Chichen Itza. Egyptian pyramids are built of stone blocks and have interior spaces often designed as tombs. American \\"pyramids\\" are generally solid mounds of earth over which a kind of cement was poured. Stairways and decorative reliefs were carved into this cement. Stone structures might be placed on top of these huge mounds. But American pyramids are principally designed as platforms from which the Mayan and Aztec rulers perhaps exhorted and impressed the general population.Mann does say that he thinks many of the great \\"cities\\" of South American empires were not designed as cities-to-be-lived-in as we know them. Instead, he thinks some of the famous South American sites might have been just similar to Disneyland - places to congregate for ceremonial and exhibition purposes. However, it would have been helpful if Mann had elaborated on building methods and materials.Then Mann doesn't include any mention of Thor Heyerdahl in connection with his discussions of how the Indians arrived in the Americas. Have Heyerdahl's conjectures and demonstrations about how Polynesians might have sailed to South American been dismissed?With these few exceptions aside though, this is a very enlightening, readable book. It would make a great supplement to any school history course of the Americas. In fact, it could well stand in place of any of the usual tired glosses we're given as students."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"It's a fascinating book and a real mind expander. But, this book will do more thatradically change the way you think about the arrival of Europeans in the Americas.Consider our views about how we manage our forests (if we do that at all). You may finishthis book thinking that our forests would be radically different and would be much lessfire prone if they were managed as earlier people had. When you visit Yosemite Valley inYosemite National park, enjoy the magnificent sights, for sure, but also take the time towalk around the valley floor and notice the small forests (carpets almost) of small cedartree sprouts and the larger cedars that are crowding out the large oaks that shoulddominate the valley floor. Indians, when they had control, would never have allowed that.They would have used fire to suppress the cedars and make more room for oaks and themeadows that supported deer and other wildlife.And the forests that covered the North American continent? In part those thick forestswhere there only because the Indians were killed in huge numbers by disease and,therefore, could not manage them and keep them from crowding out the meadows and prairiesas they had formerly done for so many years.Consider your views about the huge herds of American bison that we're told were herebefore Europeans arrived. Yes, but the story that Mann relates says that those largeherds were there for only a few years and only because the Indians, who controlled them,were wiped out by diseases brought be Europeans and, in particular, by their pigs. Ananalogous story explains the huge flocks of passenger pigeons which were here (almost)before Europeans.If you have a view of pre-European Americans as unorganized hunter-gatherers, then youreally do need to read this book. They were not only highly organized, but theirmanagement of their environment and their ability to keep the land around them in asustainable productive state was admirable.Not all of this story is pretty. Some of those early American societies were brutal andwarlike. The way in which they dealt with neighboring societies savage, but not becausethey were savages, rather because they were highly organized and well trained fightingforces. And, some of these early societies had increadible extremes of wealth andpoverty, some even worse than our own in the United States.This book touches on much of what we believe about our history and about ourselves. It'sa very radical view. And, you won't have the same picture of our society and our historyafter you've read it. You also may be left with the uncomfortable feeling that theAmericas were not intended for Europeans to take and that there were superior people herebefore the Europeans came. And, you may come to feel that \\"American history\\" should covermuch more than the period after the arrival of the Pilgrims. Often, the ideas that makeus uncomfortable are the ones we need the most."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is a revelation. I kept putting off reading it because I assumed, in arrogance and naivete, that it was for people who thought that Christopher Columbus discovered an empty continent, or for people who assumed the Maya weren't \\"civilized.\\" Little did I know that I would learn that almost everything we are taught about the Americas before Europeans arrived is wrong. Including the story of the first Thanksgiving. Squanto was not the \\"friendly Indian\\" who happened to speak English and helped the Pilgrims. He was a man who had traveled for years through Europe and had lived in England and spoke not only English but also Italian and a little French. The Pilgrims had squatted right on top of the decimated remains of Squanto's home town without realizing there had ever been a city there. His outreach to the Pilgrims had nothing to do with altruism -- he was a pawn in an elaborate political triangle that involved the Iroquois, the French, large swathes of the Algonquin people and, unwittingly, the Pilgrims.Similarly, the Amazon was not a wilderness. It supported thousands of people and both sides of the river were densely populated with cities for about the bottom thousand miles of the river. The local population farmed the area and managed the forest in a complicated but effective system. \\"Saving the Rainforest\\" as a way to \\"preserve\\" local customs is an illogical concept -- it is only since the local population collapsed that the rainforest got so out of control in the first place.In essence, the book reveals that the local populations in the Americas were actually way ahead of European populations from a \\"civilization\\" perspective. This has been hidden for so long because smallpox swept ahead of the explorers, which meant that by the time the explorers found the local civilizations, they were living in a post-apocalyptic state. It was as if one discovered Auschwitz and concluded that the way the Jewish people lived in the camps reflected the height of Jewish culture, not the abject devastation of a centuries old tradition.I won't give away any more. It's a must read."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I'll be the first to admit that my interests in the historical have generally been Eurocentric, especially the Roman Republic and Empire. Recently, though, I found reason to pick up Charles C. Mann's \\"1491,\\" and I have had a hard time putting it down since.The children's nursery rhyme reminds us that \\"In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue.\\" Just this last week we've celebrated Thanksgiving and the mythologized first meal shared by \\"Pilgrims\\" and Native Americans in the early years of Captain John Smith's Plymouth Colony in the 1620s. But what came before Europeans in the \\"New World\\" of North and South America? What was already here when they arrived? Was there much more than a few human sacrificing Aztecs (in South and Central America) andnomadic tribes in North America?Quite the contrary, says Mann. Rather, he says, the land was full of people, developed into complex cultures and polities. For example, and he expands on many, the Maya controlled an empire that was larger than any in the old world, both in size and population. The Mexica (pronounced Meh-shi-ka) had a literary culture full of metaphor and simile, and a rhetorical tradition that enabled them to meet Franciscan friars sent to convert them on equal ground. In North America, as far as the shores of New England, the coast was full hundreds of thousands of Native Americans-the nations of the Micmac, Passamoquoddy, Abenaki, Mahican, and the Massachusett, among others.Indeed, there were so many people in both North and South America that Mann wonders if settlement by European colonists would have been possible but for the effects of disease on the native population. So devastating were diseases such as small pox, influenza, and non-sexually transmitted hepatitis that civilizations such as the Maya may have been destroyed before Europeans even landed on the shores of South America. Similarly, the nations of New England, which had filled the land and had traded with early French and English merchants during the 16th century, almost disappeared over a period as short as two to five years.Why was disease so devastating? While not the central focus of the book, or even the examination of \\"what was here before 1492,\\" Mann explains how the relatively limited genetic stock of Native Americans presented insufficient diversity for the native populations to survive the diseases that had been active in Europe and Africa for thousands of years. Native Americans were in no way inferior-they just came from fewer people and thus had less genetic diversity, had never faced diseases as the Europeans (and their pigs) carried and therefore fewer of them survived the introduction of the diseases to the American peoples. The result was that within a few years, entire nations and their cultures all but vanished from the Earth...leaving the appearance of a empty land with only a few roving tribes. Indeed, says Mann, the reason those tribes were roving may be because they had been cut down from populations levels necessary to support a stable and stationary settlement.Among some of the other interesting tales and studies that Mann shares in his book is the story of Tisquantum, who we know as Squanto. His name, which he may have given himself, meant something along the lines of \\"wrath of God,\\" and Mann suggests that when he appeared in the Plymouth Colony, his intentions may not have been as benign as have been told to us in elementary school pageants. Born an original New Englander, he was kidnapped by Europeans as a souvenir and taken to Spain. Eventually, he ended up in England in the home of a rich merchant, again as an oddity to show to visitors. Learning English, he eventually convinced the merchant to send him back to America. However, in the time between his kidnapping and return, hepatitis ran rampant through his and the other nations living in what is not modern-day Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, wiping out his people and others. He returned to an empty land and was captured by a rival nation, who later used him and his ability to speak English to liaison with the Plymouth Colony. He, in return, may have tried to use the colonists as leverage to take over the rival nation.1491 is a fascinating book, and a fascinating piece of history, covering a period of history that we may have spent less time examining than is merited given the size and scope of the civilizations that preceded European colonization of the Americas. Containing cities that dwarfed Rome in its greatest day and Paris and London at the time, the Americas in 1491 were, by Mann's telling, a busy, populated and colorful place, and it deserves a place in our histories and archives alongside those of the other great civilizations of history."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The history I was brought up on held that the Spaniards were pretty incompetent and cruel, especially the ones like Coronado and De Soto who explored North America (partially justification for why we took the land from them), but that the land they found was lightly settled and that the original residents were fairly primitive hunter-gatherer societies.Of course, I also remember traveling to see sites that gave evidence of something much more advanced going on in the distant past -- places like Serpent Mound and Mound City in southern Ohio, a little south of where I lived. But I don't remember a lot of material analyzing the political economy of the Hopewell and Adena cultures -- or at least not much that made it into student textbooks in the 1950s and early-to-mid 1960s.We also visited the magnificent pyramid of Teotihuacan in Mexico and saw the pre-Columbian exhibits at the Cortes Palace museum when I was young. But even in the case of the Aztecs and Incas, we pretty much read about the \\"warlike\\" part and the \\"human sacrifices\\" part, but didn't necessarily hear that much about the \\"civilized\\" part. Partly, I know, this was because a lot of the great Mayan and Inca sites hadn't been discovered yet, but part of it was nothing but Eurocentrism (or racism, to use a less polite term).This view has been modified considerably over the years as more information became available about the extent and accomplishments of pre-Columbian civilizations in North America, Mesoamerica, and South America, the catastrophic effect on these cultures of European diseases, etc.Mann's book is a well written compilation of the results of recent archaeological studies all over the Americas and it tells a fascinating story. While his thesis is somewhat controversial, more evidence to support it surfaces every year. The basic argument is: man very well may have arrived long before the generally credited date of the \\"land bridge\\" crossing from Asia \\"only\\" 15,000 or so years ago, populations may have been far denser throughout the Americas at the time of Columbus's arrival than was previously believed, civilization and its trappings (for instance, the domestication of corn) may have begun much earlier and been far more widespread than many believe, and the ecological catastrophe of the Europeans' coming may have been more devastating than previous estimates suggested. Mann estimates that the mortality rate from European diseases and other ecological impacts may have been 95% in many areas. He says, for example, that the population of Mexico may not have returned to pre-Columbian levels until the 19th century.He presents evidence of \\"civilizations\\" nearly everywhere in the Americas, even the Amazon basin -- agriculture, urban areas, etc. He reminds us that when Cortes's soldiers first laid eyes on Moctezuma's capital city, Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City), the saw a place for more populous and magnificent than any city in Europe at the time.We meet some remarkable people along the way. Perhaps foremost, who were the Mesoamerican people who decided that some little, inedible grass could turn into a magnificent crop and then set out in a deliberate campaign of creating corn? This wasn't a minor little job to domesticate and tweak a wild weed that was already edible, this was taking something useless, envisioning \\"corn,\\" and then setting out to create it. We also meet countless generations of Peruvian and Andean civilizations, including my personal favorite, the Tiwanaku.Although he's not the first to travel this path, he also does a good job of removing the stereotype of childlike political incompetence that has been thrown at most of the Native groups, who seem to have been easily suckered or easily defeated by tiny groups of Europeans. He points out the sound (though in hindsight, mistaken) political calculations that affected Indian leaders' initial decisions to cooperate with the Europeans and the catastrophic effects of the European diseases on the social cohesion and military strength of these nations -- diseases that often arrived (in the case of the Inca, for example) just at the right moment to ensure that the Europeans would face the least resistance possible.It's a great yarn and gives an outstanding profile (even though somewhat speculative) of the magnificent civilizations that were utterly destroyed by the arrival of Europeans."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann is neither historian nor archaeologist - he is a journalist. Therefore it was with some trepediation that I picked up _1491_. However, given the reviews and the sometimes contentious disucssion here, I could not resist. After a reading of the book, I am honestly a bit confused about the controversy. Mann is neither \\"conservative\\" or \\"liberal,\\" and I could discern no nationalistic slant (or nation bashing) anywhere. He *does* provide a solid overview of recent (and not-so-recent) scholarship around what the New World was like prior to the arrival of Europeans, and what many of the academic controversies are over the nature of these civilizations, their age, and their size. As a historian, I was pleased to see Mann show so clearly what a vibrant, living thing history is as we attempt to create an honest, emperically-based historical narrative, and how very difficult it is to do this.Beyond the academic careers of historians, archaeologists and other scholars, Mann points out that the most important issue isn't one of \\"how large\\" pre-Columbian civilzations were, \\"how early\\" they existed, or whether they were \\"greater than\\" other world civilzations. It is a pity that so many get caught up in this irrelevant and silly minutae. Rather the importance of this work is whether pre-Columbian Americans are seen as a group of people who *acted* on their environment, or whether they were merely a passive and disposable people on whom events were *acted upon*. The age-old visions of the Natives as \\"brutal savages\\" or \\"stewards of the environment\\" certainly plays into this; Mann rightly argues that both visions do a disservice, and both are equally erroneous. To cite Mann, \\"The thesis of this book ... is that Native American history merits more than nine pages (in a history text of world civilzations.)\\" Of course, there are wide implications to how Native Peoples are viewed: if they were few in number, than the European arrival was merely one of occupying largely unoccupied land; conversely, if the pre-Columbian populations were in the millions (as some historians argue), than the arrival and conquest of the continent has much graver consequences._1491_ is about much more than how populous the Americas were; he also presents the controversy over when - and in what manner - did the First Peoples come to the New World? To the suprise of many, the theory of a \\"single migration 12,000 years ago\\" does not have much academic support now. There is no single theory that is uniformly accepted, either - and to Mann's credit he outlines the single migration theory as well as several of the more recent explanations.For the lay reader, I would strongly recommend this book: the first few chapters about the size of the Americas, the historical controversey and the implicit statements these theories make is fascinating reading. His narrative of the Aztec (\\"Mexica\\") and Inca empires just prior to the arrival of the Europeans is among the best I've read. The latter chapters of the book seemed to drag a bit, and were not as tightly tied to his earlier discussion of the Americas, hence the four stars. Were I able to give him a half star, I would on the basis of his subjectivity and intellectual honesty in presenting the historical and archeological evidence the various academics use in supporting their theories.I still remain puzzled at the accusations that this is a slanted work. On the contrary, I found it honest, open and clear in discussing not only the theories, but the rationale behind them and the broader stakes of each position. Of related - and for my money, more interesting - reading on a similar topic, I recommendThe Columbian Exchange"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"An absolute eye-opener. Especially from someone like me who reflexively thinks from an American point of view. When I think \\"Indian\\" I think Crazy Horse and Tecumseh. It's as if the Aztecs and Inca are not even in the same category as the Sioux and Shawnee.No doubt, I'll take western civilization as imported from Europe over anything else. But we delude ourselves in thinking that those here before us were not civilized in any meaningful way. I really appreciated the parts of the book detailing the native peoples' deliberate impact on the environment (e.g. changing the course of a river in Missouri). Anything historical information that combats the silly idea that the Indians lived in perfect harmony with the environment and we evil, white Europeans came and mucked it all up is welcome to me.I learned A LOT, and sadly, found that much of what I was taught in school by teachers I truly cherish is just plain wrong.

His style is approachable, intelligent, easy to understand, witty, and - most of all - human. He doesn't discuss a bunch of dates and dry facts; he talks about travels he undertook and people he interviewed -- academics and laypeople alike. He discusses competing theories and perceptions. He presents some material of post-Columbian contact to give us something to compare against (for instance, the empty villages and small populations the Pilgrims found, which were what remained after a devastating plague that no European was able to witness). He uses extrapolation based on accepted mathematical technique to arrive at startling conclusions.The summary for this book is that the Americas were a LOT more populated and advanced before Columbus than we have usually been taught, or tend to believe.I was in a store of native handcrafted goods one day, and while talking with the owner (which is something I frequently do), she asked me what my opinion was of the level of technology and advancement of pre-Columbian America. \\"Nomads, hunters, small bands of people living in harmony with nature, that kind of thing I suppose\\" was along the lines of my answer. \\"So,\\" she asked, \\"how do you fit that perception with the Cliffdwellers, the Mound Builders, the Maya/Aztec/Inka cities and temples, or even the 'common knowledge' that they grew corn/squash/beans together? How can they be both simple and advanced, nomads and farmers?\\"Insert cognitive dissonance.After lengthy discussion, she offered me a copy of '1491' for something like 15% off and threw in an engraved wood bookmark for free. The book was, for me, completely revolutionary. I re-read it every once in a while and never fail to regain a sense of wonder and amazement at the capabilities of people and societies that we've generally sidelined so completely. Best of all, you don't have to take Mr. Mann's word by itself -- his bibliography is incredibly dense and broad.I've read a number of criticisms against Mr. Mann and this book, and they mostly tend to rely on some kind of sentimental tripe, cries of political revisionism (both for and against 'native affairs'), or broad statements that, when put to simple scrutiny, fall flat. If you have ANY interest in native american cultures and societies, or you just want to broaden your mind about the capacity for human ingenuity, this is a fantastic book to dive into. I heartily recommend this book to everyone I know who isn't a drooling potato-head."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Not to be confused with '1492' or '1493,' this book provides an illuminating look into native american life prior to the arrival of Columbus and other European explorers. Painting a picture of highly evolved societies that had developed large cities and worked the land in sophisticated ways, the theory is that disease spread early and quickly after first contact, hollowing out these populations and making their urban centers unviable. This book destroys the myth that the scattered bands of natives that provided food to the Pilgrims and parried with the explorers were representative of native peoples and lifestyles; this well supported book is an important addition to the history of the Americas and a critical to a fuller understanding of the clash of civilizations that led to America as we know it.\\""},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I have learned things I never knew, I wish they would make school childen read this history, it would change their opinion about many things!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If I were to ask you what you know on the subject of the people that lived in the Americas before the arrival of Columbus and how they got there, you'd likely tell me they came over from Asia during the last ice age and proceeded to populate North, Central and South America in their small numbers and lived a nominal existence, traveling in tribes, forming their small civilizations, such as the Incas, Aztecs and Mayans, which eventually disappeared and then their lives were changed for the better when Columbus arrived in 1492, and brought the western world of civilization to the Americas. Charles C. Mann noted essentially this when he read his son's history books and saw that the supposed accurate history hadn't changed since he'd been in high school, which didn't seem right. And so began years of research and learning that has gone on to change the way the western world sees the history of the Americas pre-Columbus. While the book was revolutionary when it was released, went on to win awards and make a lot of \\"best of\\" lists, there is still a lot of educating of the world to be done with this true history; hopefully this book will help that cause.In 1491 Mann seeks to reveal the last thirty years of archaeological and anthropological research and discoveries with the hope that it will change and alter all the commonly held assumptions mentioned above. He does this in a well thought out way, revealing all the evidence and theory on particular subjects, like the whole population of people in the Americas, as well as the sizes and extents of the various empires that formed, and then proving what is the correct one and why, such as the astonishing fact that in 1491 there were likely more people living in the Americas than in Europe! He goes into detail on the Aztec and Mayan civilizations, revealing their true extensiveness and reach and the affect they had on the people, their development and knowledge, and simple things, like why they had invented the wheel but didn't use it as a means of transportation, because the rocky or jungle terrain made traveling by wheel wouldn't be inefficient. As to the supposed fact that the peopling of the Americas took place around twelve or thirteen thousand years ago with the Bering Strait land bridge, the evidence says otherwise, with some pointing to the mere existence of the peoples in the Americas before this period, as well as the crucial cutoff date with the end of the ice age not correctly coinciding with the people reaching South America according to the timeline; basically the evidence simply proves otherwise.By the end of the book, the reader has come to the incredible realization that most of what they learned in school about the Americas is completely wrong, and that this supposedly undiscovered continent went on to do amazing things for the rest of the world, such as providing it with three-fifths of the world's grown goods, including corn (or maize), peppers, potatoes, tomatoes and squash. In fact the term \\"new world\\" may have been somewhat of a misnomer, as it seems possible the settling of the Americas may have happened before western civilization.Much as Guns, Germs and Steel was revolutionary in changing our outlook on the way the world is, 1491 has the same affect on how the world views the Americas, what its true history was, the immense effect it had on the world after Columbus, and how the idea that these people were simple and primitive is just ridiculous. The book is by no means an easy read, but once the reader makes it through, the fulfillment is well worthwhile and enlightening to say the least.Originally written on March 17, 2012 Alex C.

Five stars doesn't really do them justice.RK Fowler"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"My wife picked up a copy of this book at the airport, as we were on our way to vacation in Mexico. I wanted something light to read as I was relaxing on the beach. This was certainly a good book and I learned a lot about the history of North and South America. It's great to see a different view on history than you'd normally get from Hollywood, or even from high school text books. I especially appreciated the author's scientific view on history - that is, we never know anything for sure, but evaluate all the options and go with the best - until we find a better explanation.Although it's a really good book, there were places I had trouble focusing on the narrative, and I'd often find myself re-reading a whole page in order for it to all sink-in. Perhaps this was because I was reading it by the pool, rather than being the fault of the book.For any history buffs, this should definitely be on your reading list."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I enjoyed this in much the same way as Guns, Germs, and Steel. Unlike Jared Diamond, who is a scientist in his own right, Charles Mann is a journalist. The difference I thinks this makes is that he tended, more than Diamond, to explore division and debate within the scientific community on quite a few of the issues he brings up (such as the viability of concentrated populations in the pre-Columbian Amazon, or the estimated population of the Western Hemisphere at the time of Columbus's arrival). Like Diamond, though, it's a book that distills a wide variety of scientific disciplines and conveys them in an accessible way to the layperson. One caveat - his vocabulary is Brobdingnagian! (to borrow an adjective he used to describe the appetite of passenger pigeons). I think it's a must-read for all U.S. History teachers. There is just too much omitted from textbooks, even college-level textbooks, on the societies and cultures of the Western Hemisphere pre-1492."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I don't know if they teach much about the ancient Americas in school today but when I went to school they didn't teach us any of this. We were basically taught that the Americas were mostly unpopulated. There were some primitive hunter-gatherers and some farming by the Indians in the Northeast who grew corn and saved the Pilgrims which became Thanksgiving. The Indians were savages who were always fighting each other and they didn't use the land to its potential and the Europeans were here to save them from themselves. It was to the benifit of everyone that Europeans populated the hemisphere because otherwise the land would be wasted and people would still be dying horrible savage deaths by Indian rituals.These type of things are probably still taught in Texas but this book really opens your eyes. Mann relied on a huge source of material to write this and the appendix and sources seemed to make up about a third of the book. The main points of the book are that Indian populations were much greater, Indians used and controlled the land quite extensively, and Indian origins may be much older. The Indians invented the wheel and the use of the number zero. They domesticated crops such as maize (corn). Maize does not reproduce so how did they do it? Tomatoes are thought by most people to be from Italy..nope from mesoamerica as well as most beans and squash. Huge areas of land appear to have been man made by the ancients. Most of the natives were dead from European diseases before the settlers ever arrived. There was an ancient advanced culture in the highlands of Peru who built reed boats that look almost exactly like the ones in ancient Egypt. These are just some random thoughts I had about the book.Mann kind of makes a compendium of ideas and thoughts and theories from all across science. The only thing he left out was ancient astronaut theory which is a shame. Since we need to question some things about how people move 100 ton blocks of stone around and cut them with laser precision with primitive stone hand tools as well as many other questions. All in all an interesting read."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann presented a brief excerpt from the book in The Atlantic magazine a number of years ago and I have looked forward to reading the full book ever since. Having finally done so I am glad I did, but I'm not quite as impressed as I thought I would be.The book aims to take a comprehensive view of the Americas before \\"white man\\" came along quickly upset the established order. In the comprehensive department Mann succeeds quite well as he discusses native cultures from north to south, including the Incas and Aztecs, as well as numerous US Indian tribes, Amazon native populations, and a whole lot more. The \\"whole lot more\\" includes interesting and lengthy discussions of maize (manmade rather than naturally occurring), a multitude of diseases and their devastating effects, farming methods, population counts before white man, and some of the methods scientists use to deduce knowledge about all of the above. One issue that is not discussed at all is the potential effects earthquakes may have had on the rise and fall of the old societies. For people who were clearly affected by phenomena like eclipses it seems that earthquakes and interpretations of their origins should have had some potentially significant effect on society.The material covers a very large time span and a huge geographical area so putting all of this material together in a readable form is clearly a significant accomplishment. At the same time I have a number of gripes about the book that could largely have been avoided in my opinion.One complaint is that the book could be better organized. The first part of the three-part book is the best organized one. After that it gets more scattered as Mann jumps over time and space without keeping a clear logical thread of why he is doing go.I intended to read this book without prejudice but at some point the constant comparisons between natives and non-natives became an annoying distraction. The intent in each of the comparisons is clearly to show that even if the natives were lacking in some respect then the non-natives were at least as bad. The world is what it is. It is pointless to excuse the number of Aztek executions by comparing with the number of executions in England (pp. 133), or arguing that the Incas were not comparatively stupid by inventing the wheel and then doing nothing useful with it because Europeans spent a thousand years not figuring out how to make a decent plow until they \\"stole it\\" (Mann's words) from China (pp. 248). Or, while in one place contrasting the exquisite cleanliness of some natives with the European habit of wading ankle-deep in filth in the streets, later on native filth is described as \\"it is apparent that Wari people experienced domestic refuse as benign and unthreatening\\" (p.255)? Words matter and, in times that are more polarizing than a good pair of Ray-Bans, consistently biasing word choices unnecessarily colors the narrative in a way that gives ammo to those who want to take cheap shots at the book.One previous reviewer referred to Mann as a \\"liberal a-hole\\", a label that I think is wholly erroneous. The material is clearly very interesting and it is sad that issues like the likely population in the Americas before Europeans showed up can be construed as yet one more pointless liberal/conservative flashpoint - \\"high counters\\" vs. \\"low counters\\".While I am whining I might as well also question the selection of illustrations. With a subject like this could any reader possibly be more interested in seeing portraits of various researchers than in seeing interesting artifacts or maps or something historically relevant? I think not, but apparently somebody with more editorial control than yours truly inexplicably did.Whining over. As I said at the outset I am glad I read the book for the information and interesting perspective on what the Americas may have been like before Columbus. I just wish it had been better organized and more sympathetic to the \\"winning side\\" (OK, that statement is sure to annoy somebody)."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I thought this book was amazing! Mann does a fantastic job of cramming an overview of the pre-Columbian Americas into 337 pages (plus a few appendices) based on current information, which he freely admits is always debatable and evolving. His writing is incredibly readable, due to his background in journalism, as opposed to some of the history books I've read.I felt like I learned something new on every page, but what stuck out the most to me is how highly developed societies were (especially in Central and South America), how much various societies manipulated and managed their environments (from deserts to rain forests) and how inevitable epidemics were upon contact.I also recommend Mann's follow-up book: 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The book arrived in great condition with no dog ears!

Luckily i finished as my plane landed and the first book store in the airport aisle had 1493 displayed."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"For many, the overall message of this book might not be something new and revealing. What will be new will be the numbers behind the facts. The sheer number of natives that thrived in the Americas is staggering which should not be all that surprising with the expansive land they occupied.This is more than a book about the world that existed in the few years before Columbus appeared. It is more about the history of the natives. It talks of the various tribes, their rise in power, their inter-tribal relations, their fall, and their decline in numbers. It's the prequel of American history that sadly has been much ignored through the years.The only part of the book that was hard for me was many of the technical terms. More than history is talked about between the pages. Science, geography, statistics, and more are covered along with it.If you love history and getting into the deep facts, this is a book you can't miss. I highly recommend this for your American history book collection."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This history presents lots of recent research and controversy around the extent of development of some pre-Columbian cultures. In almost all topics opposing theories are explained in great detail, including the Clovis culture, the Amazons, the Inca Empire, and others. We already know that European germs killed a great majority of Indians, but Mann presents the details on the numbers and the reasons (genetic) why this happened in one direction only. Some of the research expands or amends Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". Be aware though that Mann doesn't have his own theory (as Diamond had), but presents instead the latest research in the field. This has the consequence of making the book open-ended thesis-wise, which is slightly frustrating.I read the Second Edition, and although it contains a lot of new research up until 2011, the writing seems patchy and rushed, as if he wanted to finish before releasing his sequel 1493. This becomes conspicuous in the short history of Mesoamerican Indians. The history comes from a \\"conversation\\" with a researcher, and has a lot of details, but it's really hard to get anything out of it (this king made an alliance with that one, then there was a war, then another alliance, etc.). Compared to the presentation of the Incas, it seems written by a different author."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is more exciting than science fiction at it best- except this is real - every area changed my preceptions.exploring the old worlds - is so exciting , challenges all of the stero types - in biology , politics - and reveals concepts that have been covered by time.i loved iti read 1493 first.I think it should be on required reading for economics , history , the social sciences"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The book 1491, written by Charles Mann as a synthesis of the last 50 years of scholarship dealing with the populations of the Americas, is a book which should be read by students of both world history and American history. The very core of the book is a refutation, using modern archeological, anthropological, and other methods, of what the author refers to as \\"Holmberg's Mistake, \\"the supposition that Native Americans lived in an eternal, unhistoried state\\". It is this interdisciplinary approach to the subject matter, and the fact Mann is not trained in the fields which are being taken to task by his book, which makes his work so invaluable. Charles Mann takes on the established view of life in the Americas prior to 1492 and shows that, rather than a pristine wilderness similar to the garden of Eden, the Americas were, in fact, much more dynamic. \\"It was, in the current view, a thriving, stunningly diverse place, a tumult of languages, trade, and culture, a region where tens of millions of people loved and hated and worshipped as people do everywhere.\\" Mann takes on the idea of the Indians as having lived in a \\"garden of Eden\\" and turns it on its' head.The best example of Mann's willingness to take on the conventional wisdom is his discussion of the size of the population inhabiting the Americas in 1491. As Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian Institute said, \\"I have seen no evidence that large numbers of people ever lived in the Beni,\\" and she goes on to claim that thinking otherwise is wishful thinking. This quote exemplifies the difficulty the author has in overturning the conventional wisdom. This quote is troublesome on several levels, not the least of which is the improbability of Ms. Meggers having seen all evidence there is to see on this topic (as well as the fact she has a vested interest in promoting the status quo). Rather than engage with the evidence presented Meggers seems to be all to willing to simply dismiss it out of hand. Equally important is Mann's takes Meggers head on when he accuses her of possibly keeping new ideas about the history of Amazonia from the public. However, Mann does not take on Meggers alone. His greatest achievement is his ability to not personalize the dispute and his use of experts such as William Woods and Anna Roosevelt to counter mainstream claims (such as those expounded by Meggers).The problem with a book of this nature is one of its strengths, the fact it is not written by a specialist in the field(s) in question. While Mann does an excellent job of arguing his points and not making his attacks personal, one does wonder how the vested professional interests will react to his synthesis and his conclusions over the long term. Will we see a change in the way this subject matter is taught? Will professionals like Meggers continue to hold out or will they come around and help to form a new consensus? Only time will tell, but it appears those who argue for smaller numbers of Indians in North America prior to 1492 are loosing out as DNA evidence, computers and other modern techniques allow us to paint a more accurate picture of life in North America prior to the conquest.The obvious question is, what now? As the technology continues to increase and we continue to revise our thoughts on the past, will history books begin to present the new material, and will it do so in a skeptical way, or will this new material be discarded as irrelevant (or worse)? For a survey class such as ours, the implication is this is something which should be taught over a number of class periods in a freshman survey course, rather than simply mentioned for a few minutes during one day at the start of the semester (which it often is, if it is mentioned at all). Rather than treating history of the United States as starting with the English colonists, or with the discovery of the \\"New World\\" by the Europeans, it is apparent we should start with the people who lived here first. After all, they were living in this hemisphere for centuries, and as Mann points out the Haudenosaunee had the second oldest continuously existing parliament on earth."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann literally covers a lot of ground in this report on the first Americans, those who lived here before the Europeans arrived in 1491. He has explored a lot of recent anthropological finds and claims which give an idea of what life was like in various ancient societies. It is amazing to think of the large vast societies that we learned so little about in school. Many anthropological myths, such as the belief that numerous tribes lived in the Amazon jungles, and even that the Amazon jungles are a natural habitat, are debunked. Rather than an untouched natural wilderness, Mann explains how the various groups altered the landscape and developed agriculture. Mann writes in depth about the diseases brought by Europeans and their livestock and how those diseases decimated many native populations. In some sections of the book I found it a little confusing when the narrative jumped from one culture to a totally different area in a different time period. Overall, it was an interesting read about societies that I didn't know much about before.(Read the second edition, published 2011)."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book was an eye-opener for me ... having been taught american history in the 60's, i had no idea of the extent of civilization which existed in the americas before columbus! we were taught only from columbus' discovery forward. this (his)story is well-written, comprehensive, and meaningful... it is understandable by the layperson and makes history interesting, not dry. my thanks to the author for his excellent research and presentation."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann isn't as original a thinker as Jared Diamond or Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, but he equals their ability to synthesize masses of complex evidence for general readers. This is science journalism, but academics should welcome \\"1491\\" for making accessible the data and debates over the pre-Columbian Western Hemisphere. The scintillating storytelling is compelling, but the real strength here is the summaries of past and current disputes over the origins, achievements and decline of Native Americans. The overall view of Indians' abilities and accomplishments is quite positive; given the weight of evidence this is not \\"political correctness.\\" Mann excels at humanizing the many researchers shaping our views of ancient America, but is not afraid to take sides. By demonstrating unsettled consensus and ongoing debates he largely avoids a main drawback of popularization: being a prisoner of secondary sources and their limitations. Frequent interviews with researchers, however, cannot substitute for fuller use of their publications. The book is organized thematically, not chronologically, a feature that bothers some readers. But that's fine for a work which invites dipping into or reference use, not just continuous reading."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Being a senior in high school, I was looking for a quick read to give me some insight into Indian cultures pre-Colombian Americas for a research paper. I was intensely interested in the book and the overall themes were hit with large amounts of info and sources. The only major complaint I have is the way he structured the book. He jumps around time periods and at some points it was confusing if you didn't have prior info on the subject when events were happening. Besides that it was a solid book that satisfied my need."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Although this book does contain nuggets of solid information, it so poorly organized that I found myself skipping around, trying to find passages which specifically dealt with the groups living in the Americas before Columbus' intrusion.I thought, based on its title, that the book would primarily focus on the civilizations which existed in the Americas before extensive European contact. Instead, much of it concentrated on that contact and the deleterious effects it had on the native populations.I never managed to figure out why the author organized the content the way he did. My choice would have been to present the information chronologically, so that one could easily find various American civilizations based on dates.In addition to the confusing manner in which the content was presented, I simply could not take the off-hand way in which the author dismissed the overwhelming evidence of an early, and strong, African presence in the Americas. Its laughable to dispute whether Africans visited areas known popularly as the 'Olmecs'. The huge stone heads speak for themselves, but will so-called archaeologists and historical researchers ever fumble and fight to find another explanation - any explanation - than that.In summary, the author does a credible job of telling a bit about the lives of the populations living in the Americas before European contact. He actually does a passable job of giving credit to many technologically advanced features of said societies, debunking the stereotypes which labeled them 'savages', and the like. On the other hand, his dismissive attitude towards the very obvious fact of major African involvement in the area's early development is a significant reason to downgrade the rating, in my opinion."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is somewhat interesting, but what irks me is the tone in which it is written. It could not be more obvious that the author feels \\"we\\" Westerners are more superior to the people of the past, including the very people whose memoirs form the base of his book. I admit I didn't read past the first chapter, because of this.Another glaring problem is the author totally lacks imagination. For instance in the first chapter he is discussing how along the Amazon in the early 1400's, one group of Spaniards reported large communities of natives living on the river bank. The author draws the conclusion that the natives could not have been living anywhere EXCEPT on the river bank, as this is where their villages were reported to be, according to the Spanish. Do you see what I mean about a lack of imagination? How could one think the natives didn't live further inland, simply because the Spanish didn't see them? (as the Spanish didn't travel further inland?)This bothered me. I think I will find other ways to learn history."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Rambling story with no logical progression.

That being said, this book is lacking."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"And that one truth is that the Indians were not sitting around singing songs and building tools, but in fact were more destructive to the environment than anyone that came after them. It does not matter though because now we have people flying airplanes into buildings so it makes anything that happened in this part of history seem pretty mundane."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Pre-Columbian Indian societies were, for the most part, made up of stone-age hunter gatherers. The few who made it to urban God-king organizations, Aztecs, Incas, were interesting but bizarre. Sacrificing 16,0000 humans at a religious ceremony by cutting out their beating hearts and feasting on their bodies is more than just a curiosity.

It is this candor that helps make 1491 such a wonderful work to read and consider. Consider, because the reader will not be left with answers at the end, only questions and possibilities, a fascinating melange that epitomizes what good history should do.Mann's work takes a look at the Americas prior to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492. The work is not, strictly speaking, set in 1491 but instead uses that date as a marker for what existed prior to contact with Europe. He breaks the evaluation into three main parts: the population, the cultures, and the environment. In each of these areas he advances theses far different from what schoolchildren learn in their history classes, and while not all of his theses will be borne out, he provides solid backing for each suggestive enough to make it clear that while his writing will not be the final word on pre-contact America, the old narrative cannot stand up to the available facts.Mann's writing style is clean and entertaining, allowing the reader to understand the genesis of the theses he presents (I should note these are not Mann's theses: he is presenting data he has gathered from the cutting edge of anthropology and archaeology) and how the evidence buttresses what we think we know. Better still, Mann acknowledges shortcomings in the theses as well, not pretending that he presenting the final word on these subjects.1491 is a valuable read that should be picked up by anyone whose understanding of precontact America is limited to the belief a tiny number of Indians lived in static harmony with nature for centuries prior to the arrival of Columbus. Mann's work takes Indian culture seriously, warts and all, and offers a far more plausible and interesting view of the Americas."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I was a history major in college, and this book would have been great to read. When studying colonial America we did read Cronon's \\"Changes in the Land,\\" but we did not get into what Mann presents in this book. There were many, many cultures that rose and fell before the momentus 1492 change that was brought to the Americas.Mann presents a balanced look at both the past and future of the Americas, and how the native people shaped the environments more than we ever thought they did. If I have one knock on this book, it is that it is just too much information for one book. It could have been divided into three or four books, but none the less, it was a good read.I would suggest taking it slow, and taking notes so that you can keep track of all the different cultures and civilizations that Mann looks at and presents in this book. It definitely helped me gain some new ground in my understanding of pre-Columbus history in the Americas.JVD"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"First let me say that this gentleman is not a professional archeologist, anthropologist, ethnologist, historian or paleontologist. He's a professional journalist. In the past I might have considered this a definite negative; after all what does a journalist know about the history of native Americans? As I've become more familiar with this type of journalism, however, I have to say that the author's lack of credentials in other than his own field is a major plus. Not only does the author know how to write engagingly, he knows his job; in short he's a good journalist, one who does his homework.The book is extremely well researched. The bibliography is extensive and comprehensive. The end notes to the chapters provide helpful additional information, and the footnotes bring important points to the more immediate attention of the reader without breaking the author's stride with respect to the central theme of his narrative.Most important is the fact that Mr. Mann, as a non-academic, has no pet theories of his own to defend. He obviously-but discreetly-has an opinion, but he wisely keeps it in the background and makes no attempt to make it sound as though his position is founded on anything but what he has learned from the professionals. He therefore has no reason not to provide a well rounded portrait of what is known or believed in the field. He presents both or all sides of academic issues, even that of modern native Americans. He is, essentially, an unbiased observer.When he introduces a contentious issue-like the historical Clovis First debate, or the population statistics of early native people-he introduces or interviews main contenders on all sides of the discussion. Furthermore he presents the pros and cons of the matter with a total lack of bias, sometimes without introjecting his own personality into the situation at all. The professionals speak for themselves and often with rancor. The reader decides for himself.More than anything, the reader comes away with an understanding that the study of history is often a reflection of the culture and time in which it was conducted, of the types of research techniques available, of the data available, even of the types of things believed to be \\"possible\\" at the time. Everything moves forward in tandem. This is something we see in a history of technological progress all the time: it would be difficult to have a laptop computer until electricity, plastics, computer chips etc. and the education and technology that produces them are available first. Even the concept of such a thing or that such a thing might be created, has to come into existence first. Society itself might even have to change. In reviewing the history of the study of American ethnology and archaeology Mann notes that strong personalities often have kept new ideas from being given an airing. After all these people are often powerful, respected individuals who can make or break a neophyte \`s career. Why chance it? This type of social structure continues today, and the reader is advised to think outside the box, to evaluate the data separately from the people presenting it, and to make an effort to find out what opposition exists and what they also have to say before making a decision. This is not easy.Important too is that the author does not simply provide a platform for professionals and their ideas. He often mentions the theories and contributions of amateurs. If anything, he makes it evident that those with an avocation for a subject have nothing to lose by taking a risk. They can and do come up with hair brained theories, but some of those hair brained ideas when given a proper hearing are a valuable starting point for further research. Dismissing them out of hand is arrogant and wasteful. Disappointingly however, as Mann makes a point of noting, the actual non-professional authors of ideas and discoveries are often not even given their proper due from individuals who found careers on their ideas. This is sad and rather petty, but it is also a hallmark of a modern society that only values and respects those with formal credentials, ultimately those who are affluent enough or lucky enough to have an education.From the prospective of the actual information introduced, the book is superb. It introduces ideas not often aired, and questions what we \\"know\\" or believe we do about a topic. Does the popular construct of American history have a good foundation? Or has the received wisdom of the past been given icon status? It certainly had not occurred to me, despite my reading on the subject, that the overall population of the so-called New World lived and worked in permanent agricultural settings in large cities composed of many non-related individuals, and not on the plains in small mobile and fluid groups of closely related people. In short, like the people in the \\"Old\\" World. Like Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel, Mann's 1491 notes that the confrontation of European and Native American was not one of who was better than whom, but who was luckier than whom. He also notes that many significant discoveries and products have had a New World origin, that some were not just accidents but actual premeditated actions taken by giften people. We have traditionally given the inventions and ideas of the Old World priority, often without even thinking of Native American contributions. Maybe it's time we gave everyone their due.In my opinion, the book should be introduced to high school history classes along with Diamond's book, if for no other reason than that they both show how history is done, that what we know of events in the past is a changeable thing and affected by many exogenous factors about which it is incumbent on the student to know, to understand, and to evaluate critically. If nothing else both books would help develop critical thinking in young adults. It also points out that problem solving can be limited by cultural limitations. The future will be fraught with problems that will require intervention; if we limit our possible solutions by cultural blinders, we stand to make some big mistakes. We certainly stand to miss significant opportunities."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book satisfies on a number of levels:Mysteries presented and solved are always compelling, almost no matter what the actual subject matter. We have plenty to follow here.The peopling of the Americas is always a subject of interest, especially with new evidence or theories. Mann tells us of new and old theories and evidence, and even explains some of the infighting involved, although not as clearly as Dillehay and Adavasio in their recent books. Savage, some of that stuff is.The path of European settlement in the Americas is part of our history and thus interesting and Mann tells us about the beginnings in new ways which may overturn some views.And, to top it off, the book is well-written. Anybody who's tried to compose a clear business letter about an uncomplicated subject ought to, if he thinks about it, be overwhelmed at the effort and talent necessary to write an actual book, and write it well. As artists tell us, the most difficult thing is to make something look natural and easy.Mann's book is beautifully written.Some time ago, I was talking to a member of the Nature Conservancy about the effort to purchase a local area which looked to be untouched in its flora since who knows how long. The Conservancy wanted to maintain it in its pristine state. So I asked, \\"You want pre-Columbian or pre-human?\\" He laughed and called me a redneck. We both knew the issue. Pre-Columbian is good, is virtuous, is pristine and natural. That it may have been just as manufactured as some agri-business farm is to be ignored.Whether Mann's book will accelerate discussing the issue or not--it ought to--is unknown but the book is a terrific source to start. I don't see it as a philosophical excuse for unchecked exploitation, but certainly switching from one kind of manufactured landscape to another oughtn't be characterized as some kind of Gaia-rape.Mann's discussion of the role of disease in the episode of European settlement has a particular resonance for one particular group. There is a species of (extremely liberal) thinking which requires that the whites killed all the Indians. White guilt is maximized by this, as is the victim status of today's Indians. Victim status has a lot of benefits, only one of which is literally money in the bank.It just will not do to have the mass death which afflicted the Indians be the result of microbes which went before the whites, by hundreds of miles and several generations, arrived in a given location. The microbes are not white, they cannot be reproached, and the germ theory of disease had not been invented so the guilt one can lay on the evil whites is limited.We must be able to imply that all the Indians who died before their time were lined up and shot by Daniel Boone.I have actually heard some folks bitterly opposing this part of Mann's book because it does remove most of the guilt from the whites and they hate that.Mann gives us chapter and verse of new information on the technological advances of Indian cultures. One which particularly impressed me was the invention of a special soil for use in the rainforests, which have notably poor soil. Another is the still-mysterious invention of corn.I am a bit skeptical of his reasoning for the lack of development of the wheel. I was unaware that the moldboard plow was so late in Europe, and Mann uses the point to say that sometimes a bunch of smart people just don't think of something. So that's what, he says, happened to the Indians and the wheel. In addition, he says there were no prospective draft animals of any use, a point made by, among others, Diamond.Still, the Indians built huge structures in part by hauling rocks and fill on their backs. Couldn't the use of wheelbarrows have improved the efficiency of human labor? It's one thing to conceive of a big, two-axle wagon capable of hauling a ton from looking at a toy with wheels. One could understand not making the leap. It's another to simply build a toy bigger and see what happens.While the candidates for domestication are said to be few in the Americas, I think that's a short-sighted view. I don't think anybody would want to put a buffalo in a harness. But buffalo are wild. So are/were the ancestors of domestic cattle, and not at all bovine in their temperament. Domestic cattle are domesticated because the unsuitable were eaten before they were allowed into the farmer's stock gene pool. Has anybody thought about projecting the result of trying this over, say, a thousand buffalo generations?In sum, this book is a terrific read, has a great many new things to teach us, and will open new lines of history and anthropology. It is not perfect and does partake just a bit in the polishing up of the image of the Indian.As a supplement, I would strongly suggest getting hold of Zinsser's old \\"Rats, Lice, and History\\" for a survey of the effect of disease on the history of the Old World."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This well-written book is one of those rare books that completely alters one's view of the history that one grew up with and learned over the decades. One leaves this book seeing how pre-columbian Indians molded the Americas to their needs. After reading it, a friend looked back on a career in anthropology and marvelled at how much had been missed that was right in front of experts. Mann has a wonderful way of presenting this evidence through interviews with proponents and opponents of this re-interpretation."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is the only book in 10 years of monthly meetings that my book club has voted to read twice. I used to think of the Colombian exchange in terms of the decimation of the Native American population by Eurasian diseases and the new food crops brought to Europe from the new world. The impact was far greater than I knew. Think about pigs for example and the damage wild pigs can do! The preColombian civilizations were greater than I had realized, and I have started on a reading campaign about Native American societies as a result of reading this book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 provides an account of the state of the Western Hemisphere and its human settlements before the beginning of the European migration. There is a lot of archaeological and forensic information in here that was quite new to me and which has not circulated at all among the general poublic. It changed my fundamental assumptions with regard to the history of my continent; it will change yours too. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"A provocative work that aims to describe changing views on pre-Columbus America.Mann's central theme is that pre-Columbus America was densely populated and the environment had been heavily shaped by man. He makes a convincing case here, especially for North America. Early travelers describe densely populated regions (New England, the Mississippi valley) which were found deserted by later settlers. For some regions there are records of devastating epidemics; for others it has to be inferred. But it is entirely plausible that the Americas lost 90-95% of their native population to disease.So when the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth, they entered a region that had been recently devastated by massive population loss. Thus they were able to plunder abandoned villages. And the local Indian leaders were interested in helping them as potential allies against not-yet-devastated neighbours.In North America, the Indians shaped the landscape by annual burnings and the widespread planting of fruit trees. So when later settlers encountered a land of gentle clearings and plentiful fruit, they were not encountering a pristine world, but a world shaped by man.Mann makes similar arguments for Amazonia. This is a little less convincing, but his descriptions of the widespread distribution of fruit trees in \\"pristine\\" Amazonian forest do sound suspicious.Mann also describes early city sites, especially in Peru. He explains the ideas of Maritime Foundations for Andean Civilization (MFAC) which makes a good case that fishing may have been the base for civilization here rather than agriculture. (However, he sometimes seems to risk overstating the local achievements relative to the fertile crescent.)I found the book intriguing and a very worthwhile read. However it does seem to be a mixture of both radical alternative views (for example in the interpretation of the Beni sites) as well as a summary of changed mainstream views. Both are interesting, but sometimes it can be hard to distinguish them."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"1491\\" by Charles C. Mann provided me with some wisdom regarding the history and socio-political development of American Indian civilization leading up to the year that Christopher Columbus made landfall in the Caribbean. Prior to reading this book, I had studied other histories of the American Indians, visited many ruins left behind by peoples who had moved on in the period 900 to 1300 AD, and also studied histories of the relationships between settlers from Europe and the peoples who were already living in the Americas and visited more recent American Indian villages, some still in use today. \\"1491\\" provided me with a \\"glue\\" to bind together the pieces of knowledge already gained and to make more sense of what I know while providing me with new information regarding agriculture, construction, empire building, evolution of leadership structure as a society transposes from hunter gatherer to agriculture and farming. The maps and photos and explanation of codex, calendars and drawings found on pottery and walls of temples and burial sites greatly augment the text.For one example, the story of maize and its spread within the Americas and then to Europe and Africa as a superior crop was a revelation to me. I did not previously fully comprehend how diverse maize was and how this nutritious crop impacted the ancient world.This book gave me enough insight to better question what I hear, see and read as regards the impact of humans on the Americas both before and after 1491. It also provided me with a better grasp of history for when I am fortunate to visit some of the former cities of the Mayans, Incas, Mound Builders and other American Indian peoples. The heritage of their long and proud past may be seen in the faces of many of the people walking the streets of Peru, Chile, Mexico and the American Southwest, Alaska and many more places.This book is a \\"must read\\" for someone who likes to visit American Indian ruins and study tribal lore and who also wishes to understand how the introduction of people, flora and fauna from another place can decimate a population and change the appearance of the land in a very short time. The laws of unintended consequences play out in the places and occurrences examined by Mr. Mann."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"A more appropriate subtitle for this iconoclastic book might be: \\"Everything you thought you knew about Pre-Columbian America is (probably) wrong.\\"Charles Mann is not himself an archeologist, anthropologist or geographer; he is a science writer with impressive credentials. He obviously is also an industrious fellow who has traveled widely, interviewed everyone he could find who seemed to matter, and burrowed conscientiously through a mountain of technical literature.His intent in this book is to demolish the idea that America before Columbus was a howling wilderness thinly populated by inconsequential native people who can safely be ignored by historians. The general consensus among scholars today is that America had hosted a good number of highly advanced civilizations long before Columbus appeared and that its population when he did show up was equal to or greater than that of the Europe from whence he had sailed. One estimate put it in the \\"tens of millions.\\"The scope of this book's vision is wide, ranging from the coast of Massachusetts to the heights of the Andes and the Amazon rain forest. This gives it a rich underpinning of history, legend and scholarship; it also gives it a loose and blurry focus as Mann's argument moves abruptly from upland Peru to Massachusetts and from the Mississippi flood plain opposite Saint Louis to ancient Mexico.The reader learns quite quickly that very little about this vast subject can be pinned down with certainty. Every theory that has been advanced seems to have generated a counter-theory --- and Mann shows that scientific types are as capable as ward-heeler politicians of nasty public invective and personal attacks on each other. He seems almost to take delight in detailing their catfights and hair-pulling matches.Another lesson the lay reader takes from this book is the vast sweep of geological time. Mann writes of the rise and fall of empires over a span of perhaps 20 millennia. If two experts come within a century or so of dating a certain event or shard of pottery, the assumption is that they agree with each other. Population movements and geological events that took place over 200 or 300 years are called \\"abrupt.\\" It makes the modern reader suddenly aware of how small we bulk on the cosmic scale of time.Even with these cautions, Mann's book is full of fascinating tales of places like the great Inca city of Tenochtitlan --- in its heyday, it was larger than Paris --- and Tawantinsuyu on the shore of Lake Titicaca in the high Andes, a marvel of architecture and economic prosperity. Closer to home he writes enthrallingly about the Plymouth Colony and about the great settlement at what is now Cahokia, Illinois, just across the Mississippi from modern-day Saint Louis. Cahokia, once the largest settlement north of the Rio Grande and a center of trade and government, is today a tiny place of interest only to archeologists.Mann ranges across agriculture, government, warfare, economics and population movement in his broad-gauge survey of two continents and the historically rich Central American isthmus that connects them. Variations in religious beliefs and practices loom especially large.His prose is lively enough, but it can get highly technical, and he does have a tendency to get bogged down in the minutiae of some of his subjects. His discussions of agriculture, for example, will daunt readers who are not comfortable with terms like \\"mitochondrial haplogroups.\\" Elsewhere one must deal with terms like glyptodonts, caliche and zoonotic.At the very end of his book Mann confronts the clash between environmentalists and developers, a theme that has lurked in the background of much of his text. He sees this endless controversy as a clash between two conflicting philosophical principles: nomos (rationality, artifice) and physis (irrationality, nature). He comes down tentatively and without much conviction somewhere in the middle. We have to accept the need to bring order to nature, but at the same time we must respect the rights and historical accomplishments of native peoples, who were anything but the ignorant savages we heard about in school. Our learned tour guide seems unwilling to choose sides.This is disappointing --- but we cannot deny that we have learned a lot from him in the course of this long and difficult journey through time.--- Reviewed by Robert Finn"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann's fascinating exploration of pre-Columbian America finds a very different world than the one we learned about in high school - and the one still taught to students today. Rather than a sparsely populated land of stone-age tribes in North America, with a few higher but declining civilizations in South America, Mann describes a thriving mix of technologically adroit cultures with a population possibly larger than Europe's.As convincing as it is revelatory, science writer Mann's ambitious, accessible book has an advantage over the work of some of the archaeologists whose findings he discusses. A generalist, he's not hamstrung by absorption in his own area of expertise. Over the last 20 years his interest has encompassed not just the work of previous and present archaeologists and anthropologists, but also historians, linguists, biologists, soil experts, horticulturists, virologists, medical researchers, engineers and more.While there's necessarily a lot of \\"fill in the gaps\\" speculation, Mann is careful to cite sources and reasoning as he provides compelling pictures of the Mayans, Aztecs and Inca and the typically scheming, ambitious people who ruled them and fought among themselves. Their downfall, he demonstrates, was not due to the Conquistadors' technological superiority, but the devastation and demoralization of small pox, complicated by their own infighting. Mann makes a convincing case for an even greater disease calamity than traditionally thought, with up to half the population dead in the first epidemic after Columbus' arrival, leaving the population shaken and vulnerable.North America suffered even greater depopulation from first contact, losing up to 95 percent of its people before the arrival of the early colonists. Mann's eye-popping description of North America totally dismisses the traditional view of a pristine wilderness and posits a carefully maintained landscape of forests, orchards and plains, sculpted and shaped by the indigenous population. If this seems hard to believe, Mann gives two examples of agricultural ingenuity, which make believing a lot easier.The first is the initial creation of maize. Unlike other staple grain crops such as wheat and barley, maize has no counterpart in nature. And it requires human intervention to reproduce since its seeds are encased in a closed husk. Its closest relative, teosinte, looks nothing like it and is not eaten since it produces so little grain. \\"In creating modern maize from this unpromising plant, Indians performed a feat so improbable that archaeologists and biologists have argued for decades over how it was achieved.\\"The second is the rich soil found in portions of the Amazonian rain forest, called terra preta. Most Amazonian soil is naturally poor, but these areas - some of which have maintained their fertility for a millennia - seem clearly manufactured. For one thing, there is no environmental or soil-type pattern to the plots. And, most striking, the rich soil, usually one to two feet deep, is mixed with ancient potsherds.The Spaniards destroyed what written records they could get their hands on - a vast amount - and Indian conquerors had done the same to their predecessors. The victor's urge to destroy the history and culture of the vanquished seems a universal trait. Still, enough records, particularly in art works, survive to allow Mann to discuss successive civilizations in great detail. He is also careful to cite opposing opinions and conflicting researches, but his views and overarching thesis seem well grounded.From artificial islands to terraformed forests Mann brings alive a thriving variety of cultures which evolved without outside influence. \\"Like Europe, it was an extraordinarily diverse place with a shared cultural foundation. But where Europe had the profoundly different civilizations of China and Islam to steal from, Mesoamerica was alone in the world.\\"Mann returns to this reality again and again as he discusses cultures in various parts of the Americas. Scientists have long been baffled that the Inca, a complex urban society, had no writing. Now it seems, though no one has succeeded in deciphering it, that the Inca may have had the world's only three-dimensional writing - bundles of knotted strings.Or the wheel - Andean cultures used the wheel for toys and because of terrain and the lack of draught animals had little use for it in transportation, but they did not use the wheel to make ceramics or grind maize.Americans approached other technologies from a different perspective. Rather than the European reliance on compression - the arch, for instance, or the habit of nailing things together, the Inca preferred tension - \\"the manipulation of fibers.\\" Thus they wove boats and fabulous suspension bridges. The conquistadors ditched their cumbersome metal armor for the Inca's tough quilted cotton as soon as they tried it.In metallurgy they valued plasticity and malleability over hardness and strength. Though their metalworking was extremely complex, it was used mostly in art.And in North America, the Haudenosaunee, Mann posits, may have been more responsible for the American Revolution than we care to admit. Their views of individual liberty and social equality are remarkably like ours today and nothing like the monarchical views of Europe. \\"So accepted now around the world is the idea of the implicit equality and liberty of all people that it is hard to grasp what a profound change in human society it represented.\\"Mann leaves us with this startling idea - backed up with writings from numerous witnesses, including Jesuits who complained of the Indians' alarming resistance to obedience and \\" \`believe what they please and no more,'\\" and Ben Franklin who wove their notions of personal liberty into his own thinking.A wealth of detail and an organized, entertaining presentation make this a page-turner as well as an eye-opener. Copious notes will lead interested readers to further sources. With new technologies - and new interest - more and more sites are being opened and explored (mostly in South America) and readers will look forward to new revelations and theories from Mann as well as others.--Portsmouth Herald"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"There's a tremendous amount of new scholarship about the pre-Colombian Americas, and Charles Mann does an excellent job pulling it all together. He gives us a great update on what's known and not known about the various Indian civilizations. There are so many fascinating pieces of information and trivia in here that I can't recall them all.The Mayans' multiple calendars and sophisticated math, including their apparent invention of the zero. The Incans' use of fabric instead of metal in any number of implements - including seaworthy boats made of fabric. The architecture of the Cahokia culture of the Mississippi, engineering a sophisticated mound in the Mississippi flood plain - solving problems like the underlying clay's instability when wet - to build the largest pre-Colombian town north of the Rio Grande. The North American Indians' use of fire to create game parks.These are just a few. Studded throughout these books are radically creative approaches to mastering the environment, spawned by cultures growing in isolation from the Eastern World and often from each other. (The Aztecs and the Incas couldn't communicate because the swamps and mountains near the Colombia-Panama border were and are still impassable.) European and Asian cultures benefited from each other's advances as the ideas spread; Europe prospered behind advances few of which had actually come from Europe. The Amerindian civilizations couldn't benefit from those.Mann's central premise is that disease, particularly smallpox, had burned ahead of the conquistadors so rapidly that the major societies to fall to them - the Incas and the Aztecs - were already devastated and weakened when they got there, and that the disease had meanwhile depopulated North America, giving the English colonists, and decades of subsequent thinkers, the misleading notion that not very many people lived here to begin with. In Mexico, for instance, indications are the disease came ashore around 1518. Cortes didn't get there until 1519.Mann works a little too hard to dispel notions that they might have been primitive, like in defending the Indians' failure to use the wheel. One civilization knew about it but so far is known to have used it only in toys. He argues that Europeans failed to invent an efficient plow until the Renaissance, while the Chinese had known about it for centuries before. Here and elsewhere, he can be accused of hyperventilating a tad. He similarly argues around their failure to do much with metal.He works a little too hard to protect their civilizations from charges of tyranny, dictatorship or slavery, in an apparent effort to promote a \\"Europe was just as bad, or worse!\\" deconstruction of the \`Western civ' view of history. He equates the Aztecs' ceremonial human sacrifices with the hangings of England or the burnings at the stake of the Inquisition, but I was not convinced. The English hanged people guilty or purportedly guilty of a criminal charge; the Spanish burned religious heretics at the stake; but the Aztecs sacrificed young people they knew to be innocent for entertainment and to propiate the gods. It may not be PC of me, but they score higher Berger's Scale of Bestiality than do the English for hanging petty thieves at Newgate.It also seems the experts haven't addressed the possibility that disease arrived earlier, before the Europeans, despite evidence showing epidemics and die-offs preceding the conquistadors, or so soon after as to cast doubt on their being able to have spread that fast. As it doesn't take much to create an epidemic in a susceptible population - Mann notes two theories on the introduction of smallpox into Central America around 1518, each based on a single known \`Patient Zero' - it wouldn't have taken much for bugs to get here if, say, the Americas had visitors before 1492. The Vikings? Basque fishermen who knew about the Grand Banks (but kept mum about this major fishing hole) before Columbus and landed to trade? The Chinese, as argued in Gavin Menzies' provocative \\"1421\\" work? Any single sailor with any single new-to-the-Americas disease - a flu virus, say - could have set off epidemics, particularly if, as some archelogists argue, the Americas were supporting enormous populations making it easier for an epidemics to spread - rather than isolated tribes of hunter-gatherers. Hard evidence of the earlier arrivals is lacking, but so, too, is hard evidence lacking for half the theories in this book - those positing fantastic levels of pre-Colombian technology and civilization from peoples that left behind no written records and a few broken pots.But there's a ton that's good about this book. Archelogists have gleaned so much from major sites, impressive considering hardly any of these civilizations left written records. We get inside heated disputes like those between High and Low Counters - how many Indians there were in the Americas before the Europeans arrived, whether larger-than-we-thought populations implies more-advanced-than-we-thought cultures, how big the die-off was and how big a corresponding guilt-load the West must deal with as a result.Related debates concern when the earliest immigrants reached here from Asia and how they spread over the Americas - whether the era about 12,000 years ago represented by finds at Clovis, New Mexico are truly the earliest in the Americas, as has long been commonly thought, or whether it goes earlier; whether the Indians of that era wiped out oversize mammals like the mastodon through overhunting, or not.Mann touches on the recent theory that the Amazon jungle was in fact a landscape highly engineered by ancient peoples to favor fruit trees - people who even had knowledge no longer current about how to make fabulously rich topsoil that maintains itself over centuries.Mann is reasonably fair about the political and historical implications of these debates, showing how both sides use their viewpoints to advance present-day political arguments."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"\\"1491\\" is a well researched book. Mann has extensively traveled to South America with the leading social scientists at the cutting edge of pre-Columbian history revisionism. Additionally, Mann has solicited these same scientists' editorial input. Thus, the quality of the book content is excellent.Mann does a good job in presenting as objectively as possible the polemical debates on various controversial issues. In summary, here are the main revisionist themes he shares:a) The Americas population was far larger than previously thought. Some estimates are as high as 110 million. Those estimates vary widely based on what extermination rates scientists use. If they use 95%, a post-Columbian population gets multiplied by 20 or divided by (1 - 95%). If they use 90%, the multiple is now half that or 10. In any case, they come up with estimates that are high multiples of what we learned in our high school textbooks.b) Some of their cities in the 15th century were larger than Paris or London at the time. Agriculture, irrigation, urbanization, and waste management were often more advanced than in Europe.c) The apparent natural wilderness of the Amazon rain forest is a mirage. It was often more of a managed landscape serving the resource and agricultural needs of the natives at the time.d) The Americas were populated much earlier than 13,000 years ago and through different avenues than just the migration from Russia to Alaska through the Bering Strait. Estimates now range between 20,000 to 40,000 years ago of when settlers first populated the Americas. This was way before many Western European countries were inhabited.One of the most interesting polemics relates to the firsthand description of the Amazon area written by Gaspar de Carvajal, a Spaniard in the Dominican order who went on a military expedition down the Amazon river. He wrote his document at the time of his travel around 1500 AD. His document was so controversial that it was not published until three centuries later. He describes the area as abundantly populated with many villages and very large cities with abundant fruitful gardens. But, the main source of skepticism is due to his describing Spaniards being attacked by topless warrior women (Amazons) who lived without men. They reproduced by occasionally kidnapping men. Carvajal warned that any kidnapped man \\"would go a boy and return an old man\\" once the Amazons would be done procreating with him. One leading archaeologist, Betty Meggers inAmazonia: Man and Culture in Counterfeit Paradiseargues that the accounts of Carvajal are delusional. She discredits his narratives of the Amazons and everything else as sheer fantasy. She advances a case that no civilization could have generated an agricultural surplus in the Amazon area whose ground is unfit for agriculture. But, Anna Roosevelt, another leading archaeologist takes the opposite view that Carvajal firsthand accounts, besides the mythical Amazons, was probably for real. Today, the consensus on this heated debate has progressively sided with Roosevelt.Chapter 10, \`The Artificial Wilderness' is also intriguing. It suggests that nature really went wild so to speak after the conquistadors and their Western diseases disseminated the native Indians. The Indians managed thoroughly the natural landscape and had a profound impact on all aspects of the ecological equilibrium. Once the Indians were removed, the ecological equilibrium completely changed. Quoting the author: \\"... the newly created wilderness was indeed beautiful. But, it was built on Indian graves and every bit as much a ruin as the temples of the Maya.\\"The book contains also much information that is well established and not controversial. This includes how Pizarro with a really small army took over the Incas. It was not so much because of superior military technology. Instead it was because of the devastating impact of the small pox, Incas' factionalism and civil wars, and Incas lack of succession plans. When political and military leaders were killed they were not readily replaced. They were viewed as quasi deities whose dead bodies were still empowered by leadership. Obviously, this was a recipe for leadership vacuum. The documentation of the 97% drop in Aztec population upon the Spanish conquest within a single century is staggering. As shown on the graph on page 130, it is almost entirely due to a succession of diseases brought accidentally by the Spaniards and their pigs. Similarly, information in the Appendix regarding the three Mayan calendars is intriguing. This is because their combined precision entailed they had a surprising understanding of mathematics and astronomy.The author also covers many topics that remain unresolved. The Appendix on 'Talking Knots' is interesting. The Incas used knot patterns on ropes and textile in a way that baffles researchers. Some believe it was a form of accounting. Others think it is a full fledge language; but, they have not decoded it yet. The Olmecs invented the wheel over two thousand years ago but never made use of it besides manufacturing small toys with wheels. The Incas masonry including the moving of enormous stones and building huge fortresses without mortar or draft animals remains a mystery. The Mayas invented the number zero early on. But, besides their sophisticated calendar they left no mathematical legacy. Meso-American Indians were able to turn teosinte into corn through impressive genetic engineering feat we'd be hard pressed to duplicate today. The Nazca Indians drew on the ground huge figures of animals and plants several miles long. Erich von Daniken (not a scientist, but mentioned in the book) advanced a theory that the Nazca Indians were too primitive to have made drawings on such a large scale visible only from the air. Instead, he mentioned in his bookThe Return of the Gods: Evidence of Extraterrestrial Visitationsthat those drawings were the vestige of visiting extra terrestrial beings. Yet, how the Nazca Indians actually drew those drawings and why remains unexplained. Andean societies built a formidable 40 mile long Great Wall of Peru for no apparent reason. Why did the Maya abandon their cities? The standard answer that it was solely because of self-induced resource devastation is now questioned. The over 100 year war between Kaan and Mutal played a large role in the Mayan's ultimate collapse. Why did North American Indians build gigantic earth mounds 6,000 years ago way before the advent of agriculture is also puzzling? Social scientists will ponder upon those mysteries for a long time.I really enjoyed this book as it opened my mind to a new world (that's surprisingly old). If you found my review interesting, you'll find the book fascinating."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The commentary by previous reviewers about supplanting the myths about the Americas with new information and reliable evidence is one of the most lasting impressions from the material contained in this book.The positive side of reading this book was that it begot a great appreciation for the Americas, which, at least in my schooling, seemed to be left-out of the discussion of early history. The title was so appropriate because I had always started history of the \\"new world\\" from 1492.One star was not given only because to me the book felt a bit fragmented at times, but that is to me and I do not have a great deal of knowledge about early civilizations and related disciplines.However, reading this book piqued my curiosity so much that I went to see the ruins in Caral (Supe), Peru and am yearning to learn more.

With research such as this future students are going to have a wonderfully exciting time exploring the pre-history to the history of America that my generation was taught."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book was very interesting. I learned a lot about the early Americas, and I am glad that I read it. I thought the author explored a wide range of present thought on pre-Columbus Americas, and fairly presented differing points of view.However, I would not call it \\"highly readable\\" or \\"a good read\\" as other reviewers have. Frankly, having read some of these reviews before reading the book, I found the book a surprise. It was a difficult read. I read hundreds of books per year, but this one was a struggle. The author continuously jumped between subjects and time periods, and I found it difficult to follow his point in many places. It was a real struggle to finish this book. I kept putting it down and reading other books, before forcing myself to go back to this one, since I really did find the subject matter interesting.So, although the book did contain interesting information, it would have been much better with decent editing."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If there are lessons to be learned from the past, some of those discussed in \\"1491\\" have been forgotten or, conveniently, swept under the proverbial rug.The book, as its subtitle suggests, is a glimpse at new revelations about the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. It offers devastating new evidence to destroy the myth that the first inhabitants of this continent were ignorant savages who could only benefit from the civilizing influence of their conquerors.Rather, the book shows that the Americas were more thickly populated than European-influenced histories postulate and that the inhabitants were intelligent and inventive. Mann cites scientific evidence that in 1491 there were probably more people living in the Americas than in Europe and that some of the earliest cities in the Western Hemisphere were thriving before the Egyptians began building the pyramids.The scientific achievements of these first inhabitants are astounding when compared with what we've been told about these people in the past. They developed a number of complex languages and several sophisticated forms of writing, excelled in astronomy, \\"invented\\" the mathematical concept of zero long before it was dreamt of in the Middle East, developed corn by a breeding process that the journal Science has described as \\"man's first, and perhaps the greatest, feat of genetic engineering.\\" And this is only a sampling of the revelations.As Jared Diamond has shown in \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" the ancient Americans had the advantage of agriculture which is necessary to the building of civilization. They might have been able to survive the impact of enemies armed with steel. What they lacked, and what ultimately defeated them, was resistance to diseases of the Old World.Rather than conquering by their superiority, Mann cites incident after incident where Europeans prevailed only by dumb luck. For example, he shows that the Pilgrims survived only because of the charity of the Indians they met. This group had set off with little idea of where they were going, landed in New England without food or provision for shelter six weeks before winter, intent on producing their own food but without the foresight to bring livestock, farming equipment or fishing gear! They survived, at first, by robbing Indian houses and robbing graves.\\"1491\\" may force environmentalists to re-think some of their most cherished ideas as well. Mann cites authorities who contend Native Americans transformed their land in such ways that Europeans arrived in a place \\"landscaped\\" by its inhabitants and the primeval forest was actually an artificial and relatively new development resulting from the arrival of the intruders.Much of the book is speculative and will be the subject of debate for years to come.There is much to ponder in this volume and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is an entertaining, engaging, and sometimes provocative popularly-written account of pre-Columbian life in the Western Hemisphere. At the same time it is exhaustively researched and well referenced. In \\"1491\\" the author, a writer for \\"Science\\" and \\"The Atlantic Monthly\\" among other magazines, explores the complex process whereby historians, archeologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, biologists, and other scholars have reconstructed the world of the inhabitants of the Americas prior to the European incursion. In the process he explodes old myths, creates a new synthesis of the subject, and perhaps creates a few myths of his own.What we learn is that the inhabitants of the Americas before Columbus developed complex societies and extensive political, economic, technological, and cultural systems far more extensively than appreciated in the past. The essentially stone-age hunter-gatherers encountered by the English in eastern North America proved an exception to the experience of most natives of the hemisphere. Mann documents in extensive scholarship and clear writing how the population had altered the landscape, in many cases extensively, and the myriad complex civilizations that existed. The ravages of contact--such diseases as smallpox decimated the American population--ensured that many Europeans gained a false impression of the civilizations that they encountered. Among other stories in this narrative, Mann recounts the stories of the \\"Mound Builders\\" of the Mississippi River Basin; the great empires of the Inkas, Mayans, Aztecs, and others; and the impressive culture of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) which developed democratic institutions that may well have served as a model for European-style democracy.I found especially interesting Mann's unpacking of the process of discovery that has taken place in the last forty years to bring scholarship to the current state expressed in \\"1491.\\" A wide range of investigators, using both the traditional tools of their disciplines along with new technologies such as carbon dating, have added pieces to the puzzle of pre-Columbian America and are offering an exceptionally rich perspective on this hemisphere's history. In the process, they debate among themselves the data, interpretations of meaning, and the portrait these pieces show. Such debate is the scholarly enterprise at its finest, as all involved in the endeavor present their findings and over time the most compelling analyses find their ways into the body of accepted knowledge about pre-Columbian America.Charles Mann would be the first to admit that \\"1491\\" is not the final word on the history of the Western Hemisphere before the Europeans. It is a synthesis of what is known at present. As such it is most welcome. But what will become known in the future may well alter this portrait. Such is the nature of scholarship and the search for knowledge. I highly recommend \\"1491\\" as an excellent progress report on what we currently understand about this important subject."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book will help you gain a focus on the pre-European history of the Americas. The author positions his arguments with reasonable supporting facts and he clearly explains his points.I found this book enlightening because it challenged much of what I understood regarding the history of the Americas. Like many other people, my understanding was shaped by my childhood schooling which leads you to believe that the Americas was a land waiting for the better idea to arrive.This book is ideal if you ever wondered what was happening in the western Hemisphere while the Fertile Crescent was charging forward in the development of mankind."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 sets out with the thesis that there is a lot more to \\"American History\\" than what is covered in high school textbooks. Throughout the course of the book Mann lays down wide-ranging evidence that the people and societies that occupied the Americas before Europeans arrived were much more complex than historians and the general population have traditionally given them credit for. Mann argues that with an anywhere from five to fifteen thousand year (and perhaps even more) head-start, the peoples of the Americas developed and cultivated cities, monuments and complete ways of life that rivaled, and at times bested, anything their contemporary European (and Asian) counterparts had to offer.Mann's 1491 successfully argues that there was much more to the societies of the pre-Columbian Americas than has been traditionally thought as well as taught. The research that Mann put into this book through the course of many years is clear and apparent.Where Mann lacked in this book was in detail. I believe his primary argument would have been better served -- that pre-Columbian cultures were much more sophisticated and complex than generally believed -- if he had reduced his number of examples and expounded further on selected cases.However, because this book is so clearly well-researched, I would suggest it to anyone interested in the societies of the pre-Columbian Americas."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"One of the most imformative history books I have ever read.

It is time to review the role of humans in the ecological context of the Americas."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is an outstanding book, and probably one of the most eye-opening books I have read in a long, long time.It is not an exaggeration to say that, having been indoctrinated in school with the standard history of the American Indians, reading this book was like discovering an alternative universe, one where nearly EVERYTHING I had learned before was either wrong or completely twisted around.The real history of Thanksgiving presented in this book is but one example. I remember first learning about the traditional version of Thanksgiving in fourth grade, and thinking that there was something odd about the whole story. Why had the Indians, who could have snuffed out or driven away the Pilgrims, not done so? We had learned about other failed colonies and many conflicts between the Indians and white invaders - the Lost Colony of Roanoke and Jamestown, for example. It was clear that by helping the Pilgrim colony to succeed, the Indians were allowing competitors in and planting the seeds for the destruction of their own world. Few vigorous and thriving human cultures would have failed to forsee that possibility. Why had these Indians reached out to help the Pilgrims?\\"1491\\" details the real truth behind the story of \\"Squanto\\" and the Pilgrims, and how the First Thanksgiving dinner came about. It turns the celebration of Thanksgiving on its head, from a time of thanks to God for saving the Pilgrims to realizing that the Pilgrims had in fact accidentally landed in the midst of an Indian holocaust, a part of Massachusetts recently depopulated of its original Indian inhabitants by accidental germ warfare brought in by earlier European contacts. Even the food that kept the Pilgrims alive in their first harsh winter came from the recently dead Indian villagers, stored in the ground and still edible.This book explains the reasons for the success of the Spanish conquistadors, how disease both paved the way for the Europeans to take over America and made necessary the importation of African slaves to provide cheap labor. It explains the massive herds of buffalo and giant flocks of passenger pigeons (a response to the sudden collapse of the thriving Indian population in North America, who had been hunting both species). It explains the mysterious Amazon, which has large swaths of fertile soil filled with charcoal and broken pottery. It explains how Indian maize came to be and how corn and other foods developed by the Indians came to feed the entire world. It explains how the principles of individual freedom and disdain for rigid hierarchies were learned by the American colonists from the Indians; these values continue to set American society apart from the rest of the world even today.It is, in summary, nothing short of a revolutionary new look at the pre-Columbian history of the Americas and the American Indians. The Indians were an immensely thriving human culture that filled all of the Americas and changed its landscape and lifeforms, and then were nearly wiped out in a few short years by European diseases. We are still trying to piece together the details of their world.This book should be standard reading for advanced high school and college level courses on American and World History. It's high time that our schools stopped teaching the wrong history of our continent"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The author brings a journalistic perspective to this rather extensive review of the anthropological and archeological efforts that have been made over the last fifty years to understand the native cultures of both North and South America that more or less predated the arrival of Columbus in 1492. The book is essentially one long rebuke of the commonly held notion that the Americas were scarcely populated before Columbus and that its inhabitants were invariably uncultured, savage, and nomadic hunter-gatherers living in small tribes operating in pristine wildernesses.There are any number of key themes that interest the author. The most prominent area for correction, in direct contrast with the conviction of constant wandering, is the tendency of Indian cultures to create centralized, stable living arrangements, dating back several thousand years. Elaborate and sophisticated cities, with both practical and symbolic (religious) buildings, many remaining viable for hundreds of years, have been uncovered all across the Americas with Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, and the Southwestern U.S. being key sites. This urbanization was made possible due to a shift to agriculture for survival with maize, a form of corn, being the principal dietary staple. The surplus production of food supported a cultural and political elite, who then had the time to produce cultural products, direct working forces, and improve the technical infrastructure, such as irrigation systems.But all has not been straightforward in this broad corrective effort of our ancient history. Because the evidence used to reconstruct the past is so fragmentary and minimal and subject to vastly different interpretations, the conflicts among researchers and academics is a considerable part of the author's story. For example, there are disagreements among \\"low-count\\" and \\"high-count\\" theorists concerning the total population of the Americas at any one time, with higher projections being around fifty million. The debate about who were the first arrivals in the Americas, and when and how they came, still rages. Such issues as whether the soil along the Amazon River could have supported large towns still result in bitter denunciations in academic journals.The author makes clear that the native societies that the Europeans found in both North and South America were mere shells of what once existed. Little did they know that early visitors introduced diseases, like hepatitis and small pox, which virtually wiped out entire populations, forcing Indians to fall back to more primitive modes of living devoid of former cultural complexity. The genetic susceptibility of Indians to these diseases, beyond the lack of immunity gained due to exposure, is discussed. Also, the Europeans did not appreciate the efforts Indians made to shape their environments by such measures as controlled burning of woodlands or controlling the density of wildlife. It is interesting that New Englanders, according to the author, were leery of the democratic and communal tendencies that they found among the Indians, which they saw as undermining their hierarchical social order.The book is beyond a doubt highly informative, but its lack of organization and even editing gets in the way. The journalistic tendency to overload with facts is evident. It is hardly necessary to give the name of every researcher encountered by the author; that's why there are notes. Worse, is the author's tendency to randomly jump among time frames and locales. This is where a detailed time line of Indian societies would have been very helpful.There's no doubt that the author leaves himself open to a view that he romanticizes Indian culture. Perhaps the early Indian cultures compare favorably to the Mesopotamians, but one wonders whether such equivalency can be found in regard to the Greeks and Romans. It's difficult for the reader to answer that question, because, while the author roams widely geographically, there is a noticeable lack of detail about any of the Indian cultures, including differentiating among them. Certainly, our understanding of any of them is miniscule compared to what we know about the Greeks. He doesn't ignore the violence on both sides of the Atlantic. Some Indian cultures made human sacrifice a part of religious rituals, while Europeans engaged in massive executions to force religious conformity - pretty squeamish stuff, regardless.The author emphasizes the destructive nature of the European intrusion on Indian societies. That seems exaggerated, because countless sophisticated Indian societies disappeared well before Europeans arrived. Environmental developments and warfare are either given or suggested as reasons for those societies disintegration.Basically, the interesting aspects of the book outweigh its shortcomings. However, it is clear that this book merely scratches the surface of our early Indian peoples."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Take it with a grain of salt: most of this stuff is speculative, to varying degrees. But as a detailed and well-written summary of all the theories you never heard about Native American culture, it's a pretty fun read. Mann actually does a pretty good job of letting you know exactly how speculative each of his ideas are; some of them are certainly true, some are almost certainly wishful thinking. But as long as you don't forget not to believe everything Mann says, this is a great collection of Wicked Cool Ideas.Sidenote: I do wish someone would come up with a plausible excuse for MesoAmericans' failure to use wheels for anything other than toys.

Buy copies for your friends and relatives. Everyone even slightly interested in American history should read it. Why? One reason is because Charles Mann presents the Native Americans as fully human. It's astonishing that in 2007 this should be remarkable, but it is. The Native Americans were not primitive savages, noble savages, ignorant savages or any other kind of savages. They were people. They also were not tree-huggers. They managed and shaped the land like most other human communities. Sometimes they made mistakes. Sometimes they succeeded in ways \\"modern\\" people can't yet understand.Mann summarizes much of the progress made in the last half-century or so in understanding pre-Columbian America. In doing so he corrects most of the errors people are taught in school. He even provides evidence that some prominent archaeologists are actually anti-scientific in that they value winning the argument more than they value finding the truth. As an academic myself I can tell you that ideology and dogma are powerful forces, and few people have more closed minds than professors who are sure they know the Truth.Mann's book is not popular in all quarters, but it should be.

It sheds new light on the earliest inhabitants of the Americas and suggests that their innovations in government, architecture, agriculture, and science rival the similar accomplishments of any early Old World civilization. It also charts the devastating demise of these inhabitants due to disease, resulting in a die-off of unimaginable proportions in human history. Small Pox was most likely introduced by early European explorers and it spread ahead of them through extensive trading networks. Spanish conquistadors arrived in a wake of dying cultures and a dispersed power vacuum of political instability. Their horses and gun powder simply sped up the disintegration of 1,000 year old civilizations (Aztec, Inca, Iroquois) that would have otherwise crushed them like Panfilo de Narvaez and his 400 men, only 4 of which survived the aborted colonization of Florida in 1528.1491 provides much to contemplate about our notions of the New World and its vast cultural contributions, both lost, forgotten and assimilated without due credit. Where and who would we all be without them? What would the planet look like had disease not toppled these giants? What lessons can we learn from a less heroic understanding of our species' strengths and weaknesses, not the least of which is our enduring propensity towards self-centered righteousness?"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I love books that challenge my beliefs with well-formed arguments and mountains of supporting evidence. Those books come about infrequently and pretenders are full of holes large enough to drive my stubbornness through. 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles Mann is a treatise guaranteed to both please and anger every reader coming to the volume with preconceptions about the Americas and its history.It challenges the two most persevering paradigms about these continents, which in themselves contrast drastically and often violently. The environmentalist sees a hemisphere pristine when we arrived, precariously balanced ecologically, with multitudes of natives tending for the land as adherents care for the Goddess. The developer sees untouched, empty terrain, destined to be crafted into a population-sustaining paradise - preplanned to a degree the world has never seen. Okay, I grant you that I'm greatly oversimplifying the viewpoints, but Mann doesn't. He gives the opposing sides plenty of real estate in his book and then dissembles both arguments equally.This is the first comprehensive historical and scientific book to incorporate all of the most recent research and discovery. The picture of the Americas that emerges is one of two continents of well structured societies with no pristine wildernesses left. There were a lot of people here, in the hundreds of millions. First accounts show settlements of humans in lengths of the Amazon river spanning up to a hundred solid miles. MezoAmerica was teeming with civilization, nothing was untouched, uncultivated, or unstructured. Archeology and Anthropology experts show that the technology of the Americas matched anything anywhere else in the world. They had developed mathematics and the building arts to surpass the Greeks, Arabics and Chinese. Maize, the principle crop of the New World, is the single greatest human example of biogenetics before the genome project.So, the environmentalists, if these hypothesis prove accurate, are going to have to concede that the Americas are a product of human land stewardship and that the natives were exploiting every species of plant and animal and changing the landscape however they saw fit. Alternatively, the developers are going to have to concede that this land was teeming with people (and according to the consensus of scientific study, those people fell in horrific numbers to the onslaught of diseases, spreading in advance of European conquest) and that those people were using the land in more productive ways than today's industrial advancement has been able to achieve. To sum up, the Americans were neither eco-saviors, nor eco-destroyers; instead they were merely people living the best they could."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Who'd a thought the Americas might be the \\"Old World\\" and that Europe and Asia might be the \\"New World?\\" Civilizations flourishing in the Americas older than 35000 years while most of Europe was under ice? Populations in the Americas larger than in Europe? The Amazon River Basin planted, its soil enriched by \\"Slash and Char practices? Go on...Charles C Mann has written a book of revelations. No doubt archaelogists and historians will decry this book - they're a testy group after all - but the stunning thing about 1491 is that it provides logical answers to questions that have hounded archaelogists throughout history. Who occupied the vast cities found in archaelogical digs? How could so much broken pottery be explained? What happened to the cliff-dwellers? What happened to the Maya, the Inca, the Aztecs? Sure, there were environmental changes, wars, political stife, but there was also disease. Smallpox and Hepatitus A. Diseases brought by the Europeans; diseases for which the natives had no antibodies; diseases which raced ahead of the invaders and stripped the stricken peoples of most of their population and in many cases, their ways of life. Mann lays all this out in logical fashion, with proof from archaelogical digs, from glyphs found in these ancient cities, from broken pottery shards. Cities of hundreds of thousands of people once existed in the Americas, and they thrived. Until the Europeans, their pigs and diseases arrived. The history books we read in school were wrong. No doubt Charles C Mann will cause those books to be re-written.Thank you, Mr. Mann.

But how could it?What does fascinate, as Pirsig points out already in his follow up to Motorcycle Maintenance, Lila, is the impact from the American Indian culture on the western cultures in the United States, and thereby the rest of the world. It is the impact of the immunologically damned, but a stunning impact nonetheless.Finally, I can't help but notice the repetition of the man versus nature dichotomy, as if that is the only pedagogically shaping influence around. There is the constant drum beat of the impact of man on nature, as if such a separation existed. Are men not of nature? And nature not of men?How much have the birds affected the migration of seeds?

I think the author said something to the effect that, just because people don't have the most advanced technology of the day, doesn't make them stupid. Just because the people of the Americas before Columbus didn't have the metallurgical knowledge or resources available to them, or the domestic animals to help them like the rest of the world, it did not make them any less respectable or intelligent.I really liked how the author gathered so much information and did so much research, and then presented his findings and the findings of others without saying \\"This is how it was!\\". Sometimes, there isn't enough information available to be able to figure out things with certainty. But, some conclusions can be drawn and that is what the author does.

He explains how we know things, and what the controversies are, and what is still very much unresolved although the reader may have felt otherwise (like why the large mammals disappeared in North America, and just when the Indians migrated into the America's). While he wants to give the reader a more positive view of Indian culture and achievements, he does not ignore the bad, but puts it into context. For example, he compares estimates of the number of Triple Alliance (Aztec) sacrificial victims to the number of English executions in 16th century England. He does include more dynastic politics than is necessary (I find them interesting, but ultimately not very valuable to read about, kind of like historical gossip), while not including as much as he could about Indian philosophy and technology. Still, this is a truly fascinating book.--------------------Summary -----------------------By 2005, when this book was written, there had been dramatic changes in the view of pre-Columbian Indian societies. Population in the America's likely exceeded European population, and farming was widespread, having originated independently in 3 separate areas. In fact the majority of food crops planted today originated in the America's. Life was better for New England Indians than for most Europeans, and certainly they had a much greater sense of individual liberty. Cotton Indian clothing was more comfortable than European clothing, and their armor, in Central and South America, was more functional. It was textile based, and much lighter, if not quite as protective. In the Triple Alliance there was a good deal of philosophical thinking, and rudimentary education was mandatory. South American Indians had frigate sized boats.Indians dramatically altered the landscape for farming in various ways. Irrigation and terracing were widespread practices. Artificial mounds and more extensive built up areas were used in floodplains. Fire was used extensively in North America to clear underbrush, and thin out or eliminate trees, and charcoal was used to enrich Amazon soils and prevent loss of water and leaching of minerals. In fact, this recent rediscovery means that the Amazon basin could be used extensively for farming. Indians also controlled populations of such animals as passenger pigeons and buffalo, which is why their numbers increased dramatically when the Indian population of North America declined dramatically.European disease wiped out most of the Indians, often preceding the advent of colonists, as the disease was introduced by European traders and spread by Indian traders and war parties. It wasn't just that the Indians had never been subject to these diseases before. Because there had been a population bottleneck (i.e. Indians were descended from a limited number of ancestors who made it to North America), Indians had very similar HLA profiles. HLA's carry viral and bacterial particles to cell surfaces where they are presented to roaming white cells which then destroy the infected cells. However, HLA's can do this only if the particles \\"fit\\", and when there is limited HLA variability, it is more likely that no one in the population will have an HLA which will be useful against a new particle."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"In a very readable way, author Charles C. Mann re-orients our thinking about the Pre-Columbian world throughout its history and at the moment it dramatically changed in 1492.Mann synthesizes what we have learned through advances in archaeological methods and techniques over the last 30 years to call into question how and when the native population arrived in the Western Hemisphere, how many lived here, and the innovative ways the various populations adapted their divergent environments to suit cultures that were in many ways rivals to the world of Europe at the same time.What I enjoyed most was Mann's ability to show how scientific thinking and knowledge have changed, where it still disagrees and why, and what it does and does not know, particularly on such questions as how many people lived in North and South America when Columbus arrived, how many died in the first huge wave of diseases the Europeans brought with them, where corn came from, and how the indigenous people lived in the Amazon.I wish the book had spent additional time in North America, although the South American information was fascinating. And I would have also liked the book to have included a time line so I could have seen all the cultures he explored organized chronologically next to a single map showing their geographic relationship and communication routes.Nevertheless, I really enjoyed reading this book and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The other reviewers have more than admirably summarized this book.

Thnx."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book has several serious flaws. First, the presentation is very disorganized; the author is a journalist and not a historian and it shows. Secondly, as a journalist, the author has no real expertise in any of the fields he writes about; it's all a synthesis of other people's work (which isn't necessarily bad but the reader should keep this in mind when the author offers his conclusions/opinions. Third, I'm not sure how \\"new\\" these \\"revelations\\" really are. I'm not an expert in field but I am a reasonably well-read lay-person; much of this information was familiar to me. A lot of this stunning new research has been around for decades.The basis thesis of this book is: Native American societies were (1) older, (2) more populous, and (3) more sophisticated then we had been taught to believe. I was under the impression that, on the most general level, these were widely accepted facts by this point. I'm not sure if there are (serious) people who still argue to the contrary.I suppose that if you are unfamiliar with this subject, then this book might be worth reading. I suspect, however, that one would not have to look very long to find a better-written work. If you are already familiar with the topic, then you will be disappointed by _1491_.Not recommended."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Although I did enjoy part one, it was not about pre-Columbus, but post Columbus America. I could not finish parts 2 or 3, as I found them entirely disorganized and confusing. The text seemed to skip back and forth between peoples and times. The content seemed based on speculation rather than fact. I did not have a feeling that the author was really knowledgable or credible. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Henry Ford said that all history was bunk, and he had not even read 1491! What a shock to find that the population of the new world in 1491 was greater than that of the old world! That the natives, said to be long-term farmers, had shaped the landscape to suit themselves, that buffalo roamed in small numbers until old world diseases killed off most (90%) of the native tribes and thus allowed the huge herds to form. What a shock to find that many north American tribes considered themselves libertarian compared with the hierarchy bound Europeans. Yet more than enough evidence is given from old writings long ignored, and new archeological finds.This is all fast and entertaining reading. There are many maps to help explanations, citations by page number, and an index. Mann traveled to several of the archeological sites.On the downside, Mann talked of the \\"balanced diet\\" as though its desirability has been proven, and does not say how maize provided this \\"balance\\" (p18). The battle between Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s's men and the Mexica was said to have been described as the costliest battle in history with 100,000 casualties (not deaths), (p129). Why no mention of Verdun in WWI with a million deaths and Stalingrad in WWII with a million deaths? Is a mammoth's molar really the size of a bowling ball? (p152) Mann wrote of winter on the Amazon river. I thought equatorial areas had wet and dry seasons, not the 4 seasons observed far from the equator (pp301,305).But there is another, bigger fly in the ointment. Mann accepts the carbon dioxide from combustion hypothesis of global warming (pp300,308). Solar cycles of changing heat output and the sun's influence on cosmic ray effects on the Earth's clouds determine climate, not CO2 levels. [Jaworowski Z, Solar cycles, not CO2, determine climate, 21st Century Science and Technology, Winter 2003-2004, pp52-65. Accessed as a PDF on 5 Jul 07 at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Jaworowski or at: http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/] According to Laurence Hecht, Editor of 21st Century Science & Technology: \\"Of all the hypotheses [on Earth climate], that of human-produced carbon dioxide as the forcing mechanism for warming is the most deeply and extensively studied, and by far the most discredited. No other hypothesis rests on such flagrant and lying disrepect for data as...on the falsification of the historical CO2 record.\\" [Hecht L, What Really Causes Climate Change? EIR Science, 2 Mar 07, pp6-9. Accessed as a PDF on 5 Jul 07 at: http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/] The other big falsification in this hypothesis, skyrocketing temperatures in the last 50 years to levels not seen in 1300 years, is exemplified by the temperature graph of Michael Mann, which was shown to be a fraud, not just a mistake [McIntyre, S., McKitrick, R. (2005). Hockey sticks, principal components, and spurious significance. Geophysical Research Letters, 32, L03710; doi:10.1029/2004GL021750], [Soon, W., Baliunas, S. (2003). Proxy climatic and environmental changes of the past 1000 years. Climate Research, 23, 89-110].So for historical controversies Charles C. Mann appeared to do balanced work, with opposing ideas neatly cited. But by failing to look up the \\"other side\\" on global warming, he missed effects of giant volcanic eruptions and solar output changes on temperature. The Roman era warming and Medieval Climate Optimum, both with temperatures higher than now and the Little Ice Age (1500-1800) were ignored, thus their effects on migration and population sizes was missed. Now it seems that the crop failures of the Little Ice Age were a main reason for northern Europeans to try to move to a warmer climate.As always with with non-fiction, some errors make the entire work suspicious. Still a worthwhile book with its limitations in mind."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 is a fascinating book. It's well-written, highly readable, and full of interesting new research in archaeology and anthropology. It will no doubt stand for quite awhile as the most comprehensive summary of the current state of thought on the Indians of the Americas, and as such is a major contribution to our pool of knowledge. Buy it and read it!By offering a highly disingenuous critique of the goals of environmentalism, however, and by failing to address the alternatives, Mann gives short shrift to biodiversity and to the stark moral failure represented by the rapidly dwindling natural heritage we are witnessing during our lifespans on the planet. Perhaps unwittingly, this book will provide a great deal of aid and comfort to the future-eaters whose hands are now on the levers of power in this country and elsewhere in the hemisphere.After all, if there is as truly much wilderness now as there was before Columbus, which the book seems to imply, what's the point in trying to preserve it? If America was never pristine in the first place, why not put a mall in Yellowstone, or drill for oil in ANWAR? If the old growth forests of Amazonia are primarily man-made (and the data behind this agrument strike me as being among the weakest in the book), why not cut them down for pasture and affordable housing? If the \\"environmentalist\\" worldview is so wrong-headed, why listen to the increasingly loud alarm bells about global warming?I don't believe Mann really intends any of this -- despite his overreaching his argumentation is usually quite nuanced -- but by not anticipating the way his presentation of the data will be used, and by not providing a more forceful and sustained preemptive counterargument, he does the world a disservice.The root of the problem is the long-held supposition that mankind is somehow separable from nature. If you look at it in the very long view, those societies that have failed to comprehend their ultimate oneness with nature -- and their vital interest in acting as its stewards -- have met with disastrous ends. By glossing over this idea in the context of a book where its relevance must be seen as central, and by painting environmental ideology with too broad a brush, Mann is perhaps unwittingly perpetuating a deadly fallacy.Nevertheless, the book is a worthwhile read, and its qualities outweigh its flaws. I hope it reaches a wide audience. But I also hope that Mann will be more careful in the future about the way he frames his argument. And when he's touting the book in the mainstream media, I hope that he will emphasize more fulsomely, as he does glancingly toward the end, that the goal is not exploitation but balance. That while a natural America free of mankind is an illusion, a natural America with mankind as a positively contributing species is not only historically possible, but essential for our survival."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Often when developing a certain argument, some authors become so enamored by the argument that they get carried away by the beauty of their argument to the exclusion of the facts. Such is the case here.The fact is, what we have found out about the human occupation of the Western Hemisphere, both in the archaeological record for the extended period prior to Euro-American settlement (pre-1492), and in the early historic archaeological and ethnographic record since that time (post-1492), actually clearly illustrates exactly what it documents: Indians, regardless of their local manifestations were, at first, big game hunters, then hunter-gatherers, and only very late in the record (and in many places not at all), practicing horticulturalists or agriculturalists. And, in a handful of places, in the entire Western Hemisphere, from Tierra del Fuego to the Arctic Circle, this agricultural life way was superceded by early state-level societies (i.e., the Maya, Inca, Aztec and their immediate predecessors in their areas of occurrence.).Each of these life ways are paralleled, without exception, by a specific level of sociopolitical complexity and a concomitant population density. And each brought with it a certain impact to and relationship with the prevailing environment. There are no exceptions to this - worldwide.In all their manifestations in the Western Hemisphere prior to A.D 1492, we are dealing essentially with stone age peoples. The fact is, as a member of one of these stone age societies, there is only so much you can do to the environment with a stone axe. Moreover, all societies with stone axes are limited in size both by their technology (stone tool technology, you know) and economy (subsistence agriculture, at its most developed). So, there are just so many people to alter the environment. And, added to this, and probably most important, the people of these societies, people who carry around stone axes, only want to, and only have a need to, do so much to the environment.The fact is that which is overwhelmingly documented not only by the archaeological, historic, and ethnographic record, but also by the ecological record, illustrates precisely what occurred in the Western Hemisphere - That is, with the exception of the immediate areas occupied by the early state level societies, Indians did not significantly alter the ecosystems of the Western Hemisphere; Euro-American societies did - and are still doing so.One example makes this point: Every plant and animal species ever recovered in all of the tens of thousands of prehistoric Holocene archaeological sites (from 8,000 B.C. to A.D. 1492) that have been excavated in the entire Western Hemisphere to date have also been recovered from excavated early historic (post A.D. 1492) archaeological sites. However, it is also in the archaeological sites of this period (post A.D. 1492) that plant and animal species recorded prior to A.D. 1492 start to disappear from the archaeological record. The reason for the disappearance, extirpation and extinction of these species is heavily documented for this period in the ethnographic and historic record. The perpetrators of these alterations were not Indians.The entire prehistoric and historic record, in all the disciplines that yield this record, illustrates that Euro-American societies, with their fundamentally different land use patterns, huge numbers and totally different world view from that of the Indians, altered, and in many cases removed, the ecosystems of the Western Hemisphere.Yet, the author, ignores this entire record and comes to the opposite conclusion - that the Indians significantly altered the ecosystems of the Western Hemisphere.

The South American Indians built awesome stone pyramids that rivaled those in Europe, developed maize in a genetic process modern geneticists find mind boggling, AND they had GOLD. But the North American Indians have been viewed as either mindless savages fit only for killing, or childlike blank slates in need of educating. Although this book addresses both North and South American Indians, those living on the North American continent are of greater interest to me.Mann's popular book changes our long held preconceptions about Indians. 1491 is based on a meld of past and current findings of scholars, archeologists, paleontologists, and linguists. The book is scholarly, but not dry. Mann compiles a wealth of information from hundreds of sources and presents it in a fascinating, readable style.Where did indigenous inhabitants of the America's come from? Why did the North American Indians, in particular, not kill every European the second they stepped foot on land? Those are questions on which modern scholars have disagreed for decades. North American Indians saw the Europeans as fellow humans -- dirty and smelly and odd but humans nonetheless. Adversely, Europeans discovered a healthy, strapping, almost disease free people living in a land they had modified for maximum benefit.Scholars agree that modern man may never know for certain how Indians arrived in the Americas, and how their civilizations became so advanced. 1491 is an intriguing book to read and contemplate. Mann's work is highly recommended."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"In this beautifully written book Charles C.

Charles Mann tells lost stories of lies and betrayal between the Indians and the early explorers who landed on the coast of America. Many assumptions about what the Indians were like are completely contradicted in this book, although bold at time all of the facts are true and seem to line up perfectly. Although lacking cities of gold the Americas did have sophisticated technology in some tribes, even more ahead than their un familiar rivals in Europe. Early interactions between the first people to land on the United States are extordanary and just imagine how complicated it was with almost no communication possible.

And why not? History is written by winners. Europe was the home of the industrial revolution. It was therefore inevitable that the dominance that this created would serve to produce its own history.Charles Mann's work, 1491, makes some efforts to see history from a different perspective. He tries to paint a picture of the Americas prior to the arrival of Columbus. The result is something very different from the traditional image of simple people succumbing to a more powerful force. Rather, the Americas were home to vast civilizations that produce impressive societies. Their architecture is still somewhat in place but much else is missing. Mann tries to plug this gap.Although the people of the Americas never used the wheel in any productive sense and had claim to no animals bigger than a llama, they nonetheless still had an impact on the world. The Americas yielded an array of new vegetables that are used around the world today. How could we imagine a world without potatoes, squash, peanuts, most berries and tobacco?Yet, how could these people yield so easily to the early conquistadores who were clearly outnumbered on a massive scale? Sure, they had never before seen a horse nor knew of steel and gunpowder, but the real difference was disease. Smallpox more effectively killed a society than any amount of modern armaments. Indeed, it was germs that were the decisive factor in the victory of Europeans over the various Indian populations. It is this factor that led to the inevitable writing of Euro centric histories.Mann does much to bring to life an earlier and now largely extinct lifestyle. He is to be commended for his efforts. We are all the better for his work."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is an interesting survey of current thought on pre-Columbus civilizations.

An excellent book for the armchair historian who simply wants interesting information about what kind of people were on North America before the Europeans arrived. I was amazed at the number of people who inhabited North America before 1491. Somewhat weak on explaining where all these people came from maybe because there is very little evidence.Does give the reader a glimpse of in- fighting amongst the academics and how their various theories have influenced our present day school system and how difficult it is to change when new discoveries prove them wrong.The book does tend to wander because the scope is so vast.

He presents evidence mostly from recent discoveries to support both his claims, though he is fair-minded and careful to acknowledge both those who dispute his ideas and places where the evidence is sparse.

In this case, though, unlike books like \\"The Tipping Point,\\" there's more going on than just one idea beaten into the ground.That said, Charles Mann does rely heavily on recent research that shows that the devastation caused by the arrival of European diseases in 1492 was much, much greater than anyone would have guessed even a decade ago -- he claims that 95% of the population of the New World was wiped out by smallpox, measles and so on, and thus the cultures that were recorded by European visitors even 20 years later had simply disappeared. (He contends the diseases travelled so fast and did so much damage that even a 16th century visitor who returned to a particular spot six or seven years later would have seen empty space instead of thriving villages.)Given this, Mann takes the European references to bigger cities and more advanced cultures much more seriously than earlier writers, and makes the logical step of associating greater population and more resources with cultural sophistication. In addition, though, Mann makes the case that the New World (a phrase he does not use) was populated much earlier than previously thought, and thus there was more time, as well, for cultures to develop.In the end, of course, much of the 1491 New World is lost to us forever, because of the lack of written records and the huge gap between what the Europeans who attempted to describe the remnants of Native American culture (another phrase Mann does not use -- he prefers \\"Indian\\") could see and what existed before the catastrophe of European diseases destroyed almost everything.\\"1491\\" is also a cautionary tale, as the many complex and long-standing cultures of the New World were literally blown off the face of the earth by one single weakness -- in this case, vulnerability to new diseases. That vulnerability was simply inconceivable to the Native Americans who were destroyed by it, and one can't help but wonder what unperceived weaknesses could do the same to our supposedly advanced 21st century societies.flag"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book is fantastic, at least for me.

Therefore, we wistfully assure ourselves that our own time will not just vanish.

I was loaned a copy of the first edition a few years ago and it was true eye-opener. This latest edition has much new material - most of it based on very recent 21st century findings - and is a fascinating read. Like most people, I believed the Americas to have been thinly populated with hunter gatherers, with a bit of primitive farming, before 1492. The book 1491 describes huge population centres with monumental buildings and a sophisticated society living at the same time or before the building of the pyramids in Egypt. It is well written and carries the reader along without being patronizing or deeply technical.

I heard the author speak about his \\"1493\\" book on Fresh Air and both he and the book sounded quite interesting. I ordered both books and figured naturally I should start with 1491!The essence of the book is the author's assertion that the \\"traditional\\" view of pre-Columbus Americas (largely virgin territory sparsely populated by primitive but environmentally sensitive people) is wrong. In fact, he asserts there were very large populations, most of which were rapidly wiped out by disease or environmental calamities. He also asserts these populations were sophisticated and developed math, astronomy, calendars, writing, agriculture etc to rival any other ancient culture. In my opinion he does a thorough and convincing job of making his caseIn the end, I found the book to be a little TOO thorough. If this topic really hits you the book is probably superb.

There is a lot of information here, but most of it I had seen before in other sources. If you're new to the subject, this provides a broad overview, but please read additional material. The book presents the pre-Columbian Americas as a very complex mix of societies who modified their environment to perhaps a heretofore uninmagined degree. That's worth further investigation and I certainly hope we can learn from both their triumphs and their failures.I found it problematic that the author told about professional archeaologists who excavated Indian burial grounds with bulldozers, and then, within a few pages, lumps all amateur archeologists into one group and call them a bunch of \\"Altantis hunting quacks\\". This is extremely disrespectful towards the many amateurs who have done amazing work in this area and who have spearheaded the efforts to decipher evidence that has long been ignored by main stream archeologists.Secondly, the broad claim that there was no meaningful contact between the Americas and the other continents is likely not accurate. Epigraphers are now finding more and more links between ancient scripts in the Americas and abroad. Also, there is significant evidence of an ancient trans-Atlantic copper trade. Please see Michigan Copper: The Untold Story by Fred Rydholm and Contact with Ancient America by Ida Jane Gallagher for additional information.Third, the author touts that the \\"three sisters\\" cutivation method used in the Andes is the only horticultural method that had been used for centuries without wearing out the soil. Obviously he hasn't spent much time researching Chinese history. The Chinese have kept many areas in continuous cultivation for centuries by utilizing every scrap of available biomatter to enrich the soil. They've cut terraces and dug irrigation ditches and provided an amazing amount of food for their people in an often inhospitable climate and terrain. Personally, as an organic gardener and a histroy buff, I've tried the three sisters combo with less than stellar results in my location. I've also used the Chinese method of enriching the soil with anything that can be composted and have had excellent results.Worth a read, but don't stop with this book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I was very excited by an article in Science Magazine by Charles Mann I read three and a half years ago and was thrilled by the revelations in this book that turn my second grade history lessons upside down.

While enjoying the historical overview, I was driven up the wall by the author's needless and pointless digressions. Lengthy descriptions of bad roads on which he rode to this or that dig is just one of many examples. Not all digressions are that bad, but all are all quite annoying because they take you away from the storyline.

The book does not read very easily because it jumps around from one topic to the next without warning frequently. Mann's intentions may have been good, but it doesn't excuse the fact that you can't rewrite history simply to promote an idealistic view of native cultures based on circumstantial evidence. He offers no hard facts to promote his patronizing image of Native American civilizations prior to Europeanization.

The dense forests of thousand year old redwoods and sitka spruce which greeted European immigrants in the Pacific Northwest were not products of American Indian slash and burn, or other agricultural management techniques. It seems that by ignoring the greater portion of North American environmental history during his narrative, it was easier for Mann to make his somewhat remedial, politically motivated point."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"All I read are history books, and I have read hundreds. I wish I hadnt read this.No doubt the author is a smart and talented man. He clearly knows his native American history. Too bad he cant just stick to that, which is what I was hoping for when I grabbed this book. The author has an annoying habit of attempting to minimize or gloss over the more disturbing aspects of certain American Indian history, areas he feels may offend our modern sensabilities. I want history, good and bad, warts and all, not apologist liberal propaganda.He leaves certain information out, and what he does not leave out, he draws an equivilent example of action or behavior from a European example, so much so that a good 40% of the book ends up being European history, which is what I didnt want or expect.For example, and this is quite typical, he speaks of the Aztec capital ( present day Mexico city ) and is \\"forced\\" to mention, I suppose, the daily blood sacrifices by the Aztec priests, and how by most accounts it was estimated that 3 to 4 thousand people a year were killed. He does not mention that these people were men, women and children of lesser tribes, nor does he mention the gore that the whole temple was constantly bathed in at all times, and that there were other areas in the city that also had daily blood sacrifices, also dripping with organs and blood. Instead, he, as per usual, insinuates that the city was clean, and the water that surrounded the island was clean ( maybe but not likely, with over 200,000 people living in and around it ) and at the same time in Europe \\"people were foot deep in raw sewage\\", and if you are \\"horrified by 3000 or 4000 thousand people a year sacrified, just remember that in England they hung 75000 in 1 year\\". On and on, anything ugly some indigenous Indian tribe or civilization did, he has to cite a European equivilent. After a while it gets tiring. Ok we get it, you are a liberal a hole, and Indians of the Americas are better than everyone else. Conspicuously absent are any comparable Asian or African examples of atrocity, only European. He also suggests that European disease killed hundreds of millions in the Americas, which for obvious reasons, is not likely, as there are few acedemics who would even suggest that the population of the Americas in 1491 was above or even close to 300 million.He also doesnt explain how the disease he blames Europeans for spreading ( and please I am not suggesting it didnt happen, that would be foolish and a lie, OF COURSE IT DID ) up to 1491 didnt get spread by 7th, 8th and 9th century Irish and Norse visitors, only post Columbus visitors. Hows that ? Oh well who cares at this point with this book, he is all over the place... Bottom line, if you want to read a liberal lunatic getting his rocks off and pay almost $20 bucks - then by all means by this crap."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The other half, sadly, consists in the author's obiter dicta. Dismiss that; they're really not all that interesting.Mann makes clear, there are compelling arguments for both the Standard Brand Official and More-Technologically-Informed versions of the pre-Columbian, generally pre-historic habitation of the Western Hemisphere. He does a good job of summariZing what seems to be compelling evidence for revision of some very basic assumptions, from the new evidence of more sophisticated study.At the same time, much of what Mann seems to want to advocate -- generally, the More-Technologically-Informed revision of the account -- is not likely to be confirmed in any serious way, by the very nature of the enterprise. Archology is not history, nor even a very good substitute for it.Mann's account of the Maya makes this clear: For the Maya, there are at least some historical data -- their own accounts and even, seemingly, their own interpretations of what those accounts mean. [Of course, reading ancient texts is always an interesting problem; in another context altogether, is it the Dao De Ching or De Dao Ching?] Similar historical data are lacking, so it seems for other cultural enclaves indigenous to the Western Hemisphere; what texts may have existed were purged (unless they disappeared into as yet uncovered caches in ancient and very closed libraries); oral accounts died with the people themselves -- and that there were more people here and that they died out rather more quickly than received opinion allows does seem well established in Mann's account (in part, by the simple expedient of using the archological data to confirm contemporary historical accounts from European adventurers on the scene, whose accounts do survive).In short, it would be a serious mistake to take this book as presenting new historical evidence; by and large, it doesn't. It would be a serious mistake to take this book as presenting new science; it can't, by and large, because, absent history, nothing can emerge from archology (anywhere) but conjecture and interesting hypotheses.Along the way, there is a nice summary of battles fought between the Standard-Brand-Official archology and the new, More-Technologically-Informed archology, as it has come to assess what was going on before European Culture became EuroAmerican Culture. This is a long-standing battle (it starts with Franz Boas vs. Washington, as I recall), and rests ultimately, one supposes, upon the difficulties that beset archology, and (esp. cultural) anthropology as it seeks to be a science, while advancing claims to precision and prediction that are well beyond its scope.In short, then, read the book, but take it cum grano salis. It is not science; it is journalism (and along the way, a rather annoying account of how many archologists Mann hobnobs with). If you want the science, copy out the bibliography, and hit the local university library.

Most revealing is Charles Mann's analysis of the impact of smallpox on native populations, arriving in lightening spread before these indigenous populations had even seen a Spaniard. Consequently, when the Spaniards did arrive, these populations had been devastated by smallpox and were ripe for conquest. Theocratic governments also led to their downfall, as their technology, advanced as it was, was tightly regulated and controlled by emperors and priests."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles C. Mann's \\"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus\\" is an interesting but uneven book about pre-Columbian America. The author is a correspondent and science writer and did not write this book as a unified, methodical discussion of pre-Columbian America.Mann's primary point is to refute the common misperception that pre-Columbian history was ahistorical: the Indians (the term he intentionally uses and defends) were not living in static communities and societies in the Americas until the Europeans came to America. Instead, the Indians had diverse, technologically and socially advanced communities, particularly in Central and South America, and Mann did a good job illustrating the latest archaeological and historical evidence about the richness of pre-Columbian American societies.However, one problem is that Mann's story rambles and reads at time more like a journal or travelogue. The reader is not quite sure where Mann is going as you travel with him. Although he uses interesting stories and anecdotes to illustrate his points, Mann's points get lost as he rambles from story to story. However, he does wrap up and summarize his narrative at the end of the book.Finally, although Mann did a good job showing that pre-Columbian American societies were diverse and advanced, he did not do a good job showing exactly what they were like, especially in North America (the area of most interest to most readers). Often, he described the competing theories and philosophies and ends up taking one side, but not very convincingly.Despite some other criticisms, Mann's story isn't revisionist history. It is, however, disjointed and disorganized and, ultimately, Mann fails to do what he aims to do: present a picture of North American civilizations and cultures just before the arrival of the Europeans."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I was facinated by this book early on and couldn't often put it down for three days before I polished of the last appendix. Mann has done an impossible/ yet convincing job of bringing the pre-columbian world alive -showing it through a lens that magnifies and brightens. All sorts of opposing views are treated with respect - letting the reader sort out the wheat and shaff given the evidences presented. I lapped it up!Occassionally the book bogged down into so much detail that it was distracting - I wanted to shout \\"Get on with it!\\" I think the points could have been made in half the space. Yet, Mann has walked a delicate balance between a pedestrian world of interested people and the myopic and stuborn world of the university/smithsonian know it alls. Bravo to C. Mann. He's a genius and he's fun to read."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I don't know if I have all that much to add to this lengthy discussion, but overall I agree with many who say that 1491, on the whole, does a good job in making a case that many of the New World Indians formed incredibly sophisticated and complex societies and, in many areas of the Americas, did radically 'environmentally engineer' the land to suit their purposes.However, I also share the opinions of many that many of Mr. Mann's claims are made with the same degree of credibility as the old \\"Tiger whistle\\" joke (you know: \\"I found a whistle that gets rid of tigers.\\" \\"But there are no tigers in London.\\" \\"See? It works!\\"). He uses the absence of physical evidence as a means of trying to \\"prove\\" human behavior was responsible for it.Several examples:1. He suggests that \\"large mammals\\" such as giant beavers, sloths and mammoths were hunted to extinction by the MesoAmericans. While this may true, it may also not be true. For all we know, other factors, such as disease, drought, or 'mini ice ages' may have led to these animals' extinction, particularly if they had specialized diets that made it harder to find food to sustain their daily nutritional needs. After all, if the rivers are all iced over, a smaller beaver has a better chance of surviving on the one fish he can catch in a day versus the giant beaver needing a hundred. We also really don't know exactly when the last of these giant beasts really died out. There are hundreds of thousands of miles of uninhabited land in Canada (and probably the US) that have never been disturbed by an archaeologist's shovel. For all we know, under layers of permafrost may be the skeletons of mammoths or giant camels that died out only within the last 500 years or so. Also, the fact that the giant creatures like buffalo weren't also wiped out tends to weaken the \\"hunter-extinction\\" argument.2. He suggests that the European diseases that decimated the Indian populations led to ecological changes that caused population explosions among certain species. For example, he suggests that the relative scarcity of passenger pigeon bones found in Indian middens implies that the bird's population only expanded after the Europeans came. Why? Because if there were billions of pigeons living in meso-America there should have been more bones because the Indians would have eaten them. He doesn't even mention the possibility that perhaps the reason there are few pigeon bones in the trash is because the Indians simply didn't like the taste of pigeons, or considered them to be too nasty a bird to eat. After all, there are billions of pigeons living in our cities today, and they could easily be harvested to feed the hungry, but how many people do you see today eating friend pigeon for lunch? Even predatory birds and animals rarely go after them.3. It's very hard to buy these estimates of \\"hundreds of millions of meso-Americans\\" living in the Americas in the pre Columbian era, especially in South America. It's just not credible to believe that, given the inability to treat disease, relatively short life spans, and the constant threats of floods, poisonous animals, the huge expanses of deserts, and other threats, that there would have been enough land and resources to sustain such a population. This doesn't meant that there weren't perhaps tens of millions living there; certainly the thousands of large temples and living complexes in Peru alone suggest that significant population centers formed, since you needed thousands of men to carve and move those heavy blocks up mountain paths. I think the argument that European diseases decimated native American populations is an absolutely valid one; it's just questionable what the starting point was, not that that it makes this any less of a tragedy.4. Mann too often steps around difficult issues when trying to paint a picture of ancient societies. The whole human sacrifice debate is one of these. It happened, and was part of their culture. I agree with Mann that it was no different and no more 'savage' than the religion-fueled executions of Jews, Muslims and other non-Christians that occurred in Europe. Indeed, it could be argued that the Mesoamericans' use of human sacrifice was relatively more morally acceptable because they did it under the genuine beliefs that their gods required this as a form of worship(much as Judaism and Greco-Roman religions required animal sacrifices). That the powerless and the captured were the primary sacrifices is simply a matter of economics; get rid of your least valuable people first. Compare this worship-based form of murder to the thousands of Jews and Muslims tortured and burned at the stake simply for practicing the wrong religion at the wrong time (there is nothing in the new Testament requiring 'unbelievers' to be killed) and one really wonders who is the true 'savage' here.5. Continuing this trend, Mann's attempts to paint a noble picture of the Indians as community oriented citizens (based on their amazing construction achievements) totally sidesteps the issue of slavery. Given the enormous effort needed to build gigantic stone-based cities in the middle of jungles or atop mountains, it's hard to believe that ordinary citizens participated out of the goodness of their hearts (after all, they didn't get to live in the temples and palaces). It's far more likely that slave labor built nearly all of these places. Which would make meso-America no different than the rest of the world, where slavery had been an acceptable practice since time immemorial.Overall, 1491 is a good read, if only because it helps to counter the aggressive pro-European, anti-native-American propaganda we were all fed in school. But, like others, it would have better if Mann had better facts upon which to base his conclusion, rather than evaluation the theories of others or indulging in speculation."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This explosive book revolutionizes the traditional learning about America before Columbus based on serious research.The Native Americans, savaged as appeared to be, used their wisdom and labor to cultivate this beautiful American continent with so much wonders. Americas were more populated than Europe. The ancient Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan offered running water, botanical gardens and clean streets, the paradise on earth. The monuments, ancient cities and pyramids were not mirages of Egypt, but their real achievements. The genetic engineered corn of variety amazed modern scientists. Of significance was milpa crops which are nutritionally and environmentally complementary without artificial fertilizer. The care and concern for the rain forest in farming without harmful effect are admirable long before Earth Day.The Great Law is inspiring in terms of equality and federal system of government. Women were powerful under their system of democracy. Truly, women could hold up half of the sky. The Calender Math is surprisingly accurate. It is interesting Charles included a picture on p.239 . . . scientists did not confirm the existence of the Great Wall of Peru, a forty-mile stone rampart across the Andes, until the 1930s. And it still has never been fully excavated.This books gave a good introduction on Americas prior to the landing of Christopher Columbus. It is a duty for all Americans to explore from sea to shining sea in learning and appreciating the great achievement and civilization that are truly American"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I heard about this book from the podcast \\"stuff you should know\\" and I'm glad I took the leap and got it. I am not what you would consider a history buff, but I have to say I couldn't put this book down. You can't help but think of your elementary school's Thanksgiving plays and classes talking about the Pilgrims and Indians and just questioning everything. While there is nothing absolute about what is proposed in this book there is enough credible evidence to challenge almost all of our previous ideas of the native population of the Americas prior to the Europeans landing in 1492. It is quite possible they not only outnumbered us by incredibly large, staggering numbers but they were also culturally and scientifically more advanced.I'd recommend this to any parent, teacher, high school student or person living in North or South America."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I began reading 1491 having absolutely no idea of what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn tons of information of which I was totally unaware and which is hardly ever discussed in traditional history books. The author (Mann) does a superb job of keeping the language simple enough for anyone to understand while delivering information which may be difficult for some to accept and obviously remains controversial to many. Of course, many of these ideas are certainly \\"theories\\" which cannot really be proved, but even if you believe half of what's contained in this book, you will probably never view history in the same way again. The author offers alternative views from many experts regarding life before Columbus, such as the incredible length of time the americas had been inhabited, the true way of living of the \\"Indians\\", the possible number of Indians that inhabited the americas and the Carribean Islands, along with how the cultures were decimated, perhaps losing up to 90% of the population due to slaughter and disease.

Mann surveys the contentious debate over what the Americas were like before Columbus arrived. His central premise is that what we know about the western hemisphere prior to Columbus is essentially wrong. The existence Indian culture is so cloaked in mystery that \\"1491\\" is almost a study in scientific paradigm shifts. What we thought about the pre-1491 western hemisphere has gone through a series of conceptual shifts and continues to be open to speculation. Even the basic \\"who what, where when, how\\" questions are unknown. If Homo sapiens started in the Fertile Crescent near Africa, how do they get to North and South America? What was the population in 1491? Each question had an accepted world view, but each is going through major revisions. Mann systematically builds the case that the Americas were not the primitive ecosystems populated by hunters and gatherers. Instead, the Native Americans had built vast, complex cultures, and architectural wonders.So, why is our collective conventional knowledge of the ancient western hemisphere so inaccurate? In short, two reasons: germs and euro-centrism. First, the germs. Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" has previously discussed how germs decimated the western hemisphere. However, Mann extrapolates the pandemics impact on our current ability to understand Indian culture. In particular, the diseases may have spread so fast that by the time European settlers came west, the civilizations they encountered were already decimated. There is such as standard measure of error in making estimates of the mortality rates, that even a small change in the percentage rate grossly changes the estimate of the existent populations of the Indians. Mann cites a death rate as high as 95%. This level of sudden death is unheard of in human history. Even the Black Plagues of Europe pale in comparison. The point is that, by the time the settlers came west and described what they saw, Indian civilizations were gone. All that was left were some decimated nomadic tribes. So, history books are written about the culture in near extinction, not what it was like at their prime. At the time of discovery by settlers and explorers, the geography and landscapes of the Americas were not as cultivated and manipulated as they had been when Indian populations were thriving. One example is our preconceptions about buffalo. According to early explorers, \\"the plains were black and appeared as if in motion\\" with buffalo herds. Mann points out that buffalo had only recently been as prevalent as the settlers described. Current thinking is that that Indians were apex predators. The sudden demise of the Plains Indians led to an explosion of the buffalo population. Indians had a different way of herding domesticated animals that putting fences around them. Without the Indians, buffalo propagated unchecked. But current evidence reveals that the buffalo were not always that prevalent. Only suddenly, when the Indians died in masses, did the buffalo population explode.The second major reason for our historical inaccuracies is our collective euro-centrism. Until recently we have been obsessed with ourselves, tracing the trajectory of civilization from its birth of civilization in Mesopotamia, through ancient Greece and Israel (with an input from ancient Egypt), through Rome, to Europe. Study of \\"Western Civilization\\" has always started with early mercantilism around the Mediterranean which ultimately blossomed into \`blossomed' into our current system of global capitalism. For me, what makes \\"1491\\" so interesting is that it investigates a parallel cultural evolution that, through its extreme isolation, was its own closed system. The rise of civilization in the Americas was completely separate and cut off from the development in Europe and Asia. As Mann states,\\" there are a thousand different ways of being human.\\" Wouldn't it help our understanding of humanity to know how this totally pristine and independent strain of Homo sapiens developed and prospered?The debate over how Indians lived in the Americas will perhaps never be settled. There is too little archaeological evidence and too many variables. However, Mann brings together the existing evidence to build the case that the Indians pushed frontiers and transformed vast swaths of landscape to meet their agricultural needs. They pushed human ingenuity to the limits came up with solutions and lessons that were bought with their lives. Mann makes clear that we have a lot to learn from these civilizations."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I am really enjoying this book.

The very ignorance of Christoforo Colombo or \\"Cristobal Colon\\" who thought he had landed in India. Why do we continue to perpetuate ignorance is unbeknown to me. Unless, of course, immigrants from other lands now want to claim the title for themselves! I'm sure it wouldn't matter now, they took everything else already from Native Peoples...I was amazed when I watched an interview with Dick Wolf by Tavis Smiley show, on PBS, He claims the Smithsonian as a source for Political correctness and the term Indian for \\"Native American\\". He surely jumped quicker than flees onto the back side of a quaking duck with American Indian. That name was concocted by ignorance, the very ignorance of Christoforo Colombo or \\"Cristobal Colon\\" who thought he had landed in India. The fact that some Native American tribes (which does NOT mean tribes in the US/Canada-but the Americas) call themselves American Indian, is part of the same filth Ales Hrdli&egrave;ka and the Smithsonian spoused and actively carried out in hopes to keep out the great nations that existed and that had created a much more advanced systems, cities, than in Europe and other places by the 10 century! In fact, they were so advanced in mathematics, for example, the first culture to use zero where the Native Americans, in the South of Mexico, Guatemala, throughout Central America and South America!I'm sure he will claim Native American for him now! The Americas, or the land of the early light, as Native Americans called these lands, was the last to be discovered and we have just started to learn about the GRAND cultures that existed here, before the Spaniars ravaged the land and its people in 1492. And then, almost 2 centuries later, came the Britons (pilgrims) who did more damaged to Native Peoples in less than 100 years, than the Spaniards did in over 400 years. The Spaniards intermerried with the Natives, the Britons killed most of them, or uprooted them from their land to inhospitable lands, far away from their homes through aparthei."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Very disappointing! This book is the ultimate in political correctness, and extremely biased against white Europeans. For example he says that the gentle Pilgrims are responsible for the ultimate slaughter of Indians. Nonsense! The Pilgrims were invited to settle the land by the Indian chief. Governor William Bradford honored the treaty with the Indians all his life -- the only treaty white men didn't break. The pilgrims executed one of their own who killed an Indian. Under Bradford true democracy flourished all 31 years he was in office. He brought trial by jury and insisted that religious leaders stay out of office. He protected an Indian (Squanto) when the chief demanded his head. Bradford was criticized by religious leaders for not trying to convert Indians. He invited Indians, and 90 arrived, for the first American Thanksgiving. Later in his life Bradford agonized over the influx of Europeans and their mistreatment of Indians. The author includes plenty of facts but went out of his way to paint the Pilgrims as bad guys when, in fact, they were the perfect settlers, learning from the Indians, teaching them, and maintaining a wonderful partnership for decades."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"A well written work that explains where early natives came fromand how they lived.

Brading.It appears quite a bit more scholarly than 1491.From Page 103 of Brading:To insist on the peremptory, even violent character of the \`spiritual conquest' is to recall but one side of the story. Martin de Valencia was an ascetic more liable to scourge his own mortified flesh than to whip dissident Indians. Moreover, all the chroniclers testify that after a period of \`coldness', attributable, no doubt, to shock of seeing their idols cast down and destroyed, the Indians flocked in thousands to hear the gospel and learn the rudiments of Christian doctrine. For his part, Cortes summoned over a thousand children of the Indian nobility, entrusting them to the Franciscans for education. Thereafter, it was the native elite, lords and nobles, who acted as their lieutenants, helping to organize services and to summon the labour drafts necessary for the construction of churches. This intimate collaboration testified to the rapidity with which the Indians assimilated Spanish culture and language. It was also responsible for the scenes of mass enthusiasm which at times greeted the mendicants, the natives clamouring for permission to build churches and chapels to serve the religious needs of their particular communities. The friars marveled at the zeal with which their neophytes participated in the celebration of the Catholic liturgy. Any skepticism about these reports can be allayed if we consider that in Peru chroniclers constantly complained of the recalcitrant indifference of the natives to their preaching, and drew an explicit contrast between religious behaviour in the two countries. In short, there is a sunlit, euphoric quality about the spiritual conquest in central Mexico, endowing it with a numinous character that still haunts the precincts of such churches as Huejotzingo, Acolman and Tzintzuntzan.Books by Robert C.

I know a lot of the information comes from new excavations and new scientific information, but it is quite amazing how much of what we have been taught about the history of the Americas is incorrect. Much of what we were told about early interaction between native americans and colonists in this country is not what really happened. Also, the information that has long been believed about how long this continent has been inhabited is far from correct. There is still a lot of question about when the waves of new inhabitants came from Asia, in how many waves, and probably we will never know definitely, but it is fascinating to learn all the new information contained in this book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I really enjoyed the book, and learned quite a lot through the experience. I'll just get on to my petty complaints. With all the author's tiptoeing and walking on eggshells when considering word choices and so forth, it's rather lamentable that he still holds firm to the 60's liberal \\"blame Colombus\\" ethos. Come on already! Is this man going to serve as scapegoat for every horrible crime committed against the indigenous that involves the newcomers? Hold people up to self-responsibility, don't just heave it on Colombus. The author comes off as a bit too giddy when it comes to his hypothetical questions regarding cultural comparisons between Europe (his dependable foil) and the Pre-Columbians, I can almost picture him with a researcher askng, \\"Come on, just tell me! I know you don't think it's professional, scientific, or accurate to compare, but come on.. just tell me, who's better?\\" It comes off with the author looking so desperate for validation for his obviously pre-conceived opinions. At least I hold the researchers and scientists in higher regard. But what should I expect from a journalist with an obvious prediliction towards Indian/Native American superiority? The hypocrisy of the whole thing is that we are reminded not to compare cultures necessarily, but to respect them, or at least understand them for what they are and how they became that way, but the author continually does just the opposite! Constant comparisons to justify actions, behaviors, discrepecies, degeneracy, etc.. all, primarily, against the Europeans. I'm not European, and don't consider myself one, despite where my forefathers may have came from (apparently for the author this is a matter of self-hatred, being that some way-to-distant forebear 15 times removed was a complete reprobate from \\"Europe\\"). If he wants the Indians' culture and history to stand on their own, let them, but don't try to justify human sacrifice of captured foes within the context of appaling levels of executions in the UK(?) Murder, is murder in both instances, and both are dreadful independently of one another. The author just seems to want to make everything sound \\"OK\\", when put into \\"context\\". His Indians rarely made mistakes. His mistake is not admitting that all humans make far too many.Otherwise, loved the book. Really, I did!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a book that I feel I can hardly praise highly enough. It is no less, I feel, than the greatest tragedy in history. One's ranking can of course change with one's very next book, but at the time of writing I can hardly think of a more rewarding and yet more harrowing read.The Americas seem to represent a cornucopia of revelations and overturned expectations. For a start, palaeontologists seem to have underestimated, probably by a factor of 3 to 5, the duration of inhabitation of the continents. In fact, it seems that humans have been there long enough that the famous Bering land bridge could not have been open, leaving some mystery as to how and when people physically reached the hemisphere. At any rate, they have been there and been building civilisations for so long that the old and slightly pejorative \\"New World\\"-\\"Old World\\" dichotomy must be overturned.Jared Diamond's arsenal of guns, germs and steel must perhaps also be revised. While South America had never seen cavalry, this author reports that their cloth armour and light boats were so superior that the conquistadors immediately adopted them, while native arrows had greater range and penetration than the firearms of the day. So why were the Spanish still so effortlessly the victors? Well, it seems that germs get the genocidaire's accolade. Smallpox, influenza and measles, the germs of the Europeans and of the Europeans' pigs, had raced before the victors and left them kicking down the doors of societies already shattered and filled with people suffering an immune bottleneck from their small party of settling ancestors. The noble savage of the North was not living a timeless existence in harmony with nature - he had just staggered into the wilderness as his civilisation died behind him.There is surprise after surprise in this book. The Inka, far from having no metals, wrought exquisitely fine work in gold, silver and copper and were advanced metallurgists. They did not use metal for structures and weaponry, however. Their entire technological civilisation was an inversion of that of the Europeans, and based on the tensions in textiles. Across the continent on the unforgiving karst of the Yucatan, a writing system based on the weave and warp of textiles was perhaps the most sophisticated system of its day, only recently recognised as an alphabet at all and embodying some of the binary character of digital computer code. The Inka, in another inversion, apparently pursued a state-directed command economy - one that produced a burgeoning of surplus!Even the Amazon itself may be, in effect, a vast, extended orchard. Environmentalists generally recognise today that human-managed ecosystems tend to be richer and more diverse, but the Amazon seems to occupy a blind spot. Perhaps that will now be corrected.This is a staggering, wonderful read to which I will have to return. Neither the drab monochrome of Amazon's pages nor the spare serifs of its fonts can truly convey its majesty, no matter how I strive to praise it.

Unlike others it doesn't take sides and attempt to paint a rosy picture of noble savages living in perfect harmony with nature, murderous stone age barbarians in dire need of the benefits of civilzation, soap and Cristianity, or try to balance between these views. Rather it presents a detailed, factual and realistic picture of the people, social structures and land that were here before the Europeans and what became of them.

Though some reviewers have fussed at the sub-title, claiming that there weren't really new revelations in the book, should I be ashamed to admit that almost all the book was history of the best kind; the history I did not know?Of course the book is not literally about that year; it covers the period from the very first arrival of humans in America, which Mann claims is substantially before the 12,000 BC Bering Straits land bridge arrival that I had been taught; and it extends to much beyond the initial arrival of the Europeans, to cover their interactions with the natives. The author devotes major sections to the civilizations in what is now Peru, and Mexico; the prehistoric finds in eastern New Mexico; the Cahokia \\"mound builders\\" around modern-day St. Louis; the arrival of the Pilgrims in New England; and life in \\"Amazonia.\\"Charles Mann is not a \\"scholar\\"; instead he has a journalist background writing for \\"Science\\" and the \\"Atlantic Monthly,\\" and I think the reader is much better served as a result. He displays humbling erudition, managing to incorporate observations by Nabokov and Pascal, while also capable of giving a concise explanation of the Carbon-14 dating process in one paragraph. His central premise is to debunk the idea that not many people were in America, in 1491, and that they were \\"primitives,\\" devoid of higher learning. His first chapter is entitled \\"Holmberg's Mistake,\\" after the academic who promoted the concept, and Mann quotes from historians George Bancroft, Samuel Eliot Morison and Hugh Trevor-Roper who supported this view. Time and again throughout the book Mann has the gift for selecting an appropriate analogy to make his point, in this case: \\"It was as if he had come across refugees from a Nazi concentration camp, and concluded that they belonged to a culture that had always been barefoot and starving.\\" Mann certainly does not paint a Rousseauian paradise prior to 1492, with observations like \\"Because human beings rarely volunteer to spend their days loading baskets with heavy rocks to build public monuments...\\" nonetheless, he stresses the all too human tendency to denigrate the living conditions and morality of those from whom you are taking their property and land.My copy is thoroughly \\"marked up,\\" with passages that I want to return to, and consider, and even quote in the future. For example: \\"trade in goods was important, but it was the trade in ideas that mattered.\\" Mann was discussing the rise of the empires in central Mexico, but it is at least as important to contemplate today, when, nominally, we have such a flow of ideas, but in practice the barriers to the acceptance of new ideas is high. Or how about expressive formulations: \\"Peru is the cow-catcher on the train of continental drift.\\" In terms of establishing the \\"glue,\\" that \\"animating ideology\\" that holds a society together, and he cites \\"manifest destine and \\"Mission civilisatrice,\\" as examples; for the Mexican leader, Tlacaelel, Mann says the following: \\"He came up with a corker: a theogony that transformed the Mexica into keepers of the cosmic order.\\"Mann writes well, he thinks well, and has presented an excellent synthesis of some of the current theories and research on pre-Columbian America, and what happened to the natives after the arrival of the Europeans. There are some interesting appendixes, particularly the one on calendar calculations. Humbling also is the bibliography, which underscores why there was so much history I did not know. Are there mistakes of fact, as some of the low star reviewers indicate? Probably, in a work so broad in scope, and I trust he would correct in a revision. Are there mistakes in emphasis? Is he too \\"political correct,\\" in other words? Not for me; think the images of the \\"innocent white settlers\\" in those wagon trains being attacked by the \\"savages,\\" for no reason at all, could still use some additional correction with a dose of reality.

In the past, historical research was confined to documents, oral histories, and a few other areas. Today, historians are able to integrate data from multiple sources -- archaeology, geology, ethnography, and many others -- to produce a far more accurate picture of the past.Thus is the case with Mann's book. I've read a number of the primary sources he cites, and just completed a short article on this topic. The evidence is there. Colonial and Conquistador accounts of mass deaths among natives, medical/genetic research showing American tribes with higher susceptibility to European disease, and other data all point to the Americas having a far higher population than is generally believed.I also fail to understand why those who scream \\"political correctness\\" don't make the same accusation against US school history texts, which are adopted and edited based on politics rather than accuracy. They contain sanitized, Disney-esque versions of history designed not to \\"confuse\\" children or anger parents. They're often grossly out of date as well.Mann's book, along with James Loewen's _Lies My Teacher Told Me_, should be required reading. Are they absolutely accurate? Probably not.

Spanning thousands of years and two continents Mann recounts the accomplishments and destroys the myths about Native Americans, and he does it in an easy to read narrative.These accomplishments include: Creating a city if not older then Uruk in Mesopotamia (the first city in world history) then in close second; Inventing the concept of zero as a number in 32 B.C., centuries before India was supposed to have invented it (Europe didn't even adopt zero as a number until the 15th Century A.D.); Genetically engineering maze; and basically creating the biodiversity of the Amazonian rainforest!One myth Mann destroys is that the New World was sparsely populated when Columbus arrived. In actuality the population of the Americas made up 1/5 of the entire world population in the 15th century. The only reason it seemed so sparse is because European diseases advanced before Europeans and depopulated native communities before natives Europeans encountered these communities.None of this is taught in high school history books. Most only dedicate 6 pages to the accomplishments and history of TWO CONTINENTS, and most of what they teach is just plain wrong. In my view this is a very important book which must be read. Great for those interested in history, archaeology, or science."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a great overview of recent findings regarding the history of the native populations of North and South America before the arrival of Europeans. It is very readable and extremely interesting. It truly deserves the highest rating."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I have read through many of the reviews that others have left, and come to the decision that this book is probably more for the amateur historian. That being said, I found it absolutely illuminating. If your main source of information about the Americas, is from your high school years or earlier (like me), this book should be quite interesting. It throws all the old teachings out the window for the most part. It does jump around quite a bit. I need to read it again, to get a better grasp of it. Imagine trying to cram, a comprehensive summary of all the Egyptian dynasties, Roman rulers, and all the European nations rulers for a couple thousand years, into one little book. Then add to that, an all encompassing account of their cultures, communities, sociology, politics, technology, etc. Very educated people spend lifetimes on these subjects, and can not know it all. Don't expect this book to have it all. But it is entertaining. It does cause a lay person to question the old and want to explore more information! As others have pointed out, it is not strictly pre-Columbus landing. As a matter of a fact there is a lot of information about Indian/English interaction. It doesn't detract from the book in my opinion. Especially if you're tired of being force fed the \\"winners\\" version of history, and want a different take on things. If you want a \\"text book\\" cronological, layout of pre-columbian history, this will probably be disappointing. If you want a \\"good read\\" that you can learn something from, give it a try. History books shouldn't put people to sleep....they should inspire them to want to learn more ! I really enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I love fresh looks on old topics. This book delivers on that theme. As a history teacher I find the same mundane, lopsided, and inaccurate truths presented in textbooks about this era time and time again. Mann's book is a counterweight to that miseducation and shed's light on often under appreciated and misrepresented Native American societies."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann gives the reader a comprehensive overview of the new theories concerning native American societies before the colonial period. The story is intriguing, and the fascinating narrative will hold the reader's complete attention. The assertions made are too numerous and complex to go into in any detail here, but in brief: we are told that the Western Hemisphere was actually much more populous than anyone had imagined previously. Most of the inhabitants were wiped out by plagues brought by the Europeans. Far from being either brutal and child-like, or \\"noble savages\\", the native Americans had established sophisticated societies which served large and growing populations, and which had great impact on their natural environments. No small Indian tribes living in a vast, untamed wilderness! To the contrary, fire was used repeatedly to burn off weeds and undergrowth, extensive mounds and other structures were raised to provide crop land and ponds for fish breeding, and cultivation was widespread. Indeed, Mann asserts that the Amazon, far from being the quintessential wilderness most regard it as, is actually a garden gone wild!The tale is breathtaking in its scope. But is it true? The author of 1491 acknowledges that the new theories are controversial. For example: everyone agrees the Europeans brought diseases which wiped out large numbers of Indians. But not all agree that the original population was anywhere near the levels claimed. And many researchers contend that structures claimed to be of human origin, such as the Beni causeways in Bolivia, are actually of natural origin. This reader withholds judgement until a lot more evidence is forthcoming. However, everyone interested in history owes it to themselves to read this spellbinding story of an America that just might have been, and then watch as it is either confirmed or refuted by continuing, widely based research."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Although recent years have yielded significant progress in understanding how \\"Indians\\" lived throughout the Americas before 1492 and Columbus, only isolated bits of the story have reached the popular press. Far too many people still hold to one of two myths of the Indians, or have little conception at all of pre-Columbian America.The first popular myth is that the Indians were a bunch of primitive savages just keeping the land warm until superior Europeans showed up. It's sad to read reviews here that assert that because Indians used stone tools they were therefore \\"stone age\\", with the implication that their culture was no further advanced than that early period.The second myth makes the Indians into proto-flower-children, naively and simply in tune with their environment.Both myths are based on stereotyping and are condescending to the pre-Colombians. How could people spread over two continents and many millennia be briefly summarized? They can't be! The Americas saw the development of a broad range of cultures, just like every other inhabited area of the world. Some cultures overstressed their environment and soon collapsed. Others created stable conditions under which they could survive for generations. (Which is not the same as saying they didn't impact nature.) But even the latter could be brought down by climate change, political instability, disease (especially European), or contact with outsiders (Indian or European).Great cities arose in mesoamerica and the Andes, and also in other areas when the right conditions prevailed. And sophisticated cultures existed even where city building wasn't favored.This book takes the reader through a vibrant overview of centuries of Indian culture both before and shortly after Columbus landed. Much of the narrative is based on work-in-progress by archaeologists and historians, and will certainly become dated with time, but it is an important update to the common, current understanding of the subject.For those not enthralled by one of the myths I mention above, most Americans recall our history along the lines of Scene 1: The Pilgrims land and encounter Indians who teach them how to grow corn; they then have a big Thanksgiving party together. Scene 2: Americans moving inland encounter savage Indians who need to be exterminated or moved to reservations to make the continent safe for manifest destiny. Scene 3: The few remaining Indians are victims of brutal European suppression, and we need to buy jewelry and pottery from them to make ourselves feel better about the situation.This book is a welcome update to our thinking about the Americas before Columbus. It's also one of the best books I've read in long time, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles C. Mann has taken much of what we thought we knew about the Native Americans and their world and thrown it out the window. In a pleasantly informal yet highly professional style, Mann recounts tales of his own studies and travels, as well as those of many archaeologists, historians, and anthropologists past and present throughout the Americas.If your knowledge of the Native Americans begins and ends with what you learned in school years ago, or with the stereotypes perpetuated by Hollywood, you are in for quite a shock. To begin with, the Native Americans have been \\"natives\\" here for far longer than any one suspected. Next, their cultures were heterogeneous and quite advanced, in many ways far outdoing their counterparts in Europe. And in what may be the most controversial sections, Mann maintains that the Native Americans were neither primitive savages who left no mark on their world, nor dreamy proto-environmentalists who lived as one with nature, but rather people who throughly altered and shaped their landscapes.This is not a book which will please many with an agenda on either the pro-development or pro-environment side, but it will be found invaluable by those who seek a better understanding of the \\"New World\\" before the Europeans \\"discovered\\" it."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is a highly readable and informative compendium of current knowledge on the Americas prior to Columbian contact. Charles Mann has gathered modern research into an engaging narrative that offers updates on old theories, bold new theories that often contradict the old ones, and a fair amount of useful speculation on what was really happening in the ancient Americas. The speculative parts of this book will turn off serious historians (plus those with political, academic, or ethnic agendas, as can be seen in some of the more condescending reviews here), but the speculation offers plenty of food for thought, and Mann has mostly just channeled the exploratory ideas of his sources. In any case, such explorations are grounded in at least partially corroborated findings by modern archeologists, anthropologists, linguists, and experts in other fields, and Mann has made extensive use of legitimate sources both old and new. In fact, his bibliography will provide the enthusiast with reading material for years to come.In addition to increasing the reader's knowledge of little-covered Native American societies such as the Cahokians and several pre-Inka South American kingdoms, the main running contention in this book is not necessarily historical but ecological. There is growing evidence that Indians throughout the hemisphere did not live in a timeless and static communion with nature, which is a common \\"green\\" stereotype. Instead, the majority of native populations actively engineered their landscapes and altered their local ecologies to better suit human needs, though this usually (but not always) resulted in long-term mutual benefits for nature and man, rather than the dead-end destruction resulting from Western methods. And in general, large and structured city states seem to have been remarkably common, even in the previously little-appreciated Amazon basin (which itself is not as \\"pristine\\" or \\"untrammeled\\" as modern hype would have you believe). And finally, Mann presents the latest evidence showing that Native American populations were once several orders of magnitude higher than those found by European explorers and colonists, with horrendous percentages being wiped out by Western diseases just a few years before. While this book is not a groundbreaking research effort in its own right, Mann has compiled a great amount of knowledge that will go a long way toward shaping your views of how civilized the \\"old\\" world really was. [~doomsdayer520~]"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If you thought, as I did, that the Americas prior to Columbus were a couple of barren continents occupied by a sparce population of savages, you are in for a mindblowing surprise in this wonderful new book. There may have been 100 million people living in the Americas in 1491, perhaps more than in Europe. There were bigger cities, some with running water and botanical gardens, larger than any in Europe. Did you know the Inkas invented the salad bar? Okay, that's a joke, but the other stuff is true and a zillion other amazing things. Other books and articles on preColumbian America have disappointed me with their fantasy: Chinese in Rhode Island, King Arthur in Kentucky, aliens in Peru, etc. But this is solidly researched by an award-winning science writer, with endorsements from some heavyweight historians--Richard Rhodes, Tom Powers, Joseph Ellis, and others. There are clear and helpful maps, copious and readable footnotes, and a H-U-G-E bibliography for those of us who teach or just want to know more. On a personal note, Mann explains why he uses the term \\"Indian\\" rather than \\"native American\\" or more politically correct terms. The Chippewas (aka Ojibwa) in my family always called themselves Indians, so this makes me realize Mann really immersed himself in the subject. This is an important, fascinating, readable, and handsome book"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann's book - with the subtitle of \\"New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus\\" - is not really about the year 1491. It's really about everything, or almost everything, that created the world that Columbus and the other explorers, conquistadores, missionaries, and fortune-seekers encountered when Europeans arrived in the Western Hemisphere.The author has a mission: to let us non-experts in on the fact that many of the assumptions and theories dealing with the pre-Columbian Americas are being challenged, and in many cases overturned, in every relevant discipline. His sympathies are clearly with the overturners and, for the most part, he won over this reader's sympathies as well.If the book were to be ordered chronologically (and it most certainly isn't; see below), it would start with Mann's review of the challenge to the long-held assumption that the first Americans all came by way of Beringia and traveled down the relatively short-lived ice-free corridor around 10,000 years ago. Other possible routes at other, perhaps earlier, possible times are now being suggested by some researchers. Mann spends more time putting forward the contemporary counter-arguments to the equally long-held belief that the early migration quickly resulted in an \\"overkill\\" of large mammals, leaving North America bereft of such species.What Mann does treat in detail early in the book is the argument over the size of the pre-Columbian population. In the 1930's, a figure of 8.4 million was generally accepted. Today, some researchers believe that the number was closer to 100 million. As Mann says, that would mean that when Columbus set sail more people lived in the Americas than in Europe. That'll make you sit up straight and pay attention.Mann takes up many other contentious issues and in doing so alerts us to many little-known facts (and factoids) about the pre-Columbian Indians and their cultures. His review of the history of maize - perhaps the earliest example of genetically engineered foods - is one of the most fascinating examples. His treatment of the rapid spread of smallpox is another. Only space constraints keep me from providing a much longer list of such examples.And in fact that story of maize is emblematic of what I took to be the main lesson of Mann's book: pre-Columbian Indians were shapers of their environment in massive, comprehensive ways and in almost every watershed, mountain range, and plain of the hemisphere. Such was the magnitude of this environmental engineering, it seems, that the images of the pre-Columbian world that we grew up and that were promulgated by both textbooks and mass media were totally at variance with reality.I find two interconnected faults with the book, one major, one not so. The major one is the sense of randomness in the way Mann has organized his material. Themes come, go, and reappear. The short history of the Inca (Mann insists on \\"Inka\\") is presented; then later we hear of the peoples who preceded and were conquered by them. The section on the population debate is followed by one entitled \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\", a chapter that seems out of place and premature. Other examples abound. This is admittedly a book of themes rather than strict narrative, but Mann is too good at narrative to have not put more effort into organizing those narratives better within his major themes. I was left feeling totally confused about some aspects of the book and the peoples whose stories it tells.My minor objection, but one which contributes to the confusion, is Mann's predilection for telling us a story with a straight-face and then admitting that it's all wrong. He spends, for example, almost 6 pages recounting the history and conquest of the Inca, only to start the next section with \\"I have just pulled a fast one.\\" A fascinating discussion of \\"Why did the Inka lose\\" follows. It would have been even more fascinating without the nagging suspicion that we might still be being had. He duplicates this technique elsewhere in the book.But I haven't stopped talking about the book and its many absorbing and challenging themes in the month since I finished it. It's boldly provocative and makes you want to keep reading about how the history of the hemisphere is being rewritten.The maps are plentiful (16), clear, and informative. More obvious credit should be given to the map-maker. The photographs (36 of them) are also helpful."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles C. Mann's book manages to convey an impressive breadth of theories and ideas in a fairly short volume- the book itself is only 336 pages, it's the notes and appendices that take it well over 400 pages. In those pages, however, Mann packs in so many new (to me, at least) ideas and interpretations of American history that are awe-inspiring at best, and food for thought, at least.In his book, Mann presents the argument that the Americas were highly populated by Indians before Europeans came (they were then subsequently killed off in alarming amounts by disease). Far from being the tree-huggers they're made out to be, Indians had a drastic and important effect on the environment around them. He presents evidence of complex agricultural techniques, from forest fires to \\"genetic engineering\\" of crops and even, amazingly, proof of lengthy and highly successful farming techniques in the Amazon rain forest. He paints a vivid picture of Inka and Mayan societies, and then delivers evidence that those were not the first advanced civilizations in the Americas, but that they were the culmination of thousands of years of growth and learning.He states that the environment before Europeans arrived was systematically influenced by the natives, and that when they were killed off by disease, it created a whole =new= environment that, by the time colonists came (1600s onwards), they saw a drastically different country than had existed only a short time before. He cites the well-known story of the passenger pigeon as an example, giving it a twist, and then even hints at a precursor to democracy and the American Constitution in the Haudenosaunee culture.The most potent point, in my opinion, that Mann delivers is given early in the story. He says, \\"Having grown separately for millennia, the Americas were a boundless sea of novel ideas, dreams, stories, philosophies, religions, moralities, discoveries, and all the other products of the mind ... The simple discovery by Europe of the existence of the Americas caused an intellectual ferment. How much grander would have been the tumult if Indian societies had survived in full splendor!\\" And then Mann uses the rest of the book to make a case for just how MUCH was lost when the Indians died out- their agricultural skills, their knowledge, their ideas and their cultures. It's a compelling account, well-presented, and, in my view, thoroughly successful."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 is part science text, part history book. Charles C. Mann's main premise is that the Americas in 1491 were a much different place than our history books say they were.Mann's first line of attack is the \\"empty America\\" syndrome. He claims there were as many people living in North America as there were in Europe, prior to decimation by smallpox and other European diseases. In the process he also belittles the \\"pristine America\\" argument. Prior to the smallpox pandemic, Indians burned the underbrush of our forests; the result was more of a parkland than a wild Garden of Eden. The forest stretching from the coast to the Mississippi came afterward, when the Indian caretakers had been depleted.Most impressive for me was Mann's analysis of Indian technology. For instance, maize was not an indigenous plant. It was genetically engineered from a mountain grass called teosinte. The Amazonian Indians of South America also managed to invent their own soil, \\"terra preta,\\" a sort of mixture of pottery shards and charcoal. The South American Indians even experimented in social engineering. Inca warriors would infiltrate villages, \\"convince\\" their rulers that accepting Inca rule would be beneficial to their people, then gradually take over. Once in control, they would move some of the subjugated population to others villages where they were required to learn the Inca language. The Incas even managed to \\"eradicate hunger\\" in an empire larger than that conquered by Alexander the Great.Mann hopscotches back and forth between such diverse cultures as Triple Alliance (Aztecs) in Central America to the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) in Canada and New England. Each has a surprise in store for the reader. For instance, it's not true that the Aztecs never invented the wheel. Children's toys have been unearthed with definite wheels. Mann theorizes that because of the mountainous and wet environment the Aztecs scorned the invention. Then he compares them to Europe, where our supposedly superior civilization never did invent the plow; it had to be imported from China.Another criticism of Native American culture is that they had no system of writing. Mann counters this misconception with the Inca's \\"khipu,\\" sort of three-dimensional stringed knots, which were felt and read. Scientists are still trying to decipher them. Mixtec Indians also left behind \\"codices,\\" deerskin or bark books whose painted pages looked rather like murals.Native America civilizations also appear to be much older than the history books say. The Clovis culture, for instance, has been carbon-dated to between 13,500 and 12,900 years ago and archaeologist Alex D. Krieger lists fifty sites said to be older yet. Some scientists maintain that paleo-Indians \\"walked or paddled\\" to Peru fifteen thousand years ago."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann's excellent book does not deliver \\"new\\" revelations so much as an accomplished and respected historian's summation of the salient points known to date about the history of the Americas. Certainly much of the material is new to many readers, and in Mann's competent prose, the information is presented in an understandable and compelling style. Significantly, Mann balances his sound and rigorous research with suppositions based on his own remarkable insights. It is a clever and interesting read for the lay historian--as well as an important book for researchers into early American history."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I was excited about this book for a while, yet, particularly after disappointment with 1421's overblown claims, I was skeptical that its initial claims would be supported by hard evidence. Instead, I found that Mann has clearly done his homework to produce a brilliant book describing the lost chapters of American history.Mann's (and the researchers he cites) basic argument is clear: conventional history on American Indians is stale, often relying on faulty, static, or even blatantly racist research. These societies weren't waiting in stasis for Columbus - they rose and fell, much like European societies, a fact many researchers failed to realize. The introduction is illustrative, in which Mann describes an Indian society that is currently poor and nomadic, although it built large earth mounds and had a successful civilization before 1491.I also like the fact that Mann presents the conventional historical argument before he introduces the more modern argument. He also does a good job explaining why past researchers may have been mistaken. For example, many glossed over the accounts of early explorers, even though they may have actually been recording what they saw (surely not that surprising when you think about it, but a revolution in the field nonetheless).The only faults I found in the book were relatively small. First, it would have been nice to have a glossary. Second, while the book follows a well-developed structure, I wanted more. One gets the feeling that Mann only scratches the surface, and he could have easily written another 100 pages while keeping the reader entertained. On the other hand, this book already took so much work that this may be a lot to ask. I only hope Mann produces more books on this subject."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Whenever the new thought upsets previous ways of thinking,its attacked and criticised.Charles C. Mann got tremendous amount of criticism for this book,but Im glad there are also circles who recognise importance of this work and how it might change our opinion about when American history begins.Not only because of what it says,but also because writting style is so engaging and easy to follow (reads almost like detective novel,without a trace of usual academic boredom where other writters often overwhelm reader with too much reasearch & dates) I have found this book impossible to put down and in fact,what was just a library book found a place in my own library as private copy to be cherished and re-read.It might very well be the one future generations will learn from."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Dealing with so many contested, cutting-edge topics in American archeology & anthropology, it is to be expected that Mann's _1491_ would be a bit controversial. On the whole, however, is seems to be an even-handed and fairly comprehensive introduction to a vast field of research in the throes of revolution and rebirth.Most importantly, the \\"stuff\\" this book deals with is extremely interesting and even profound. The panorama of native American cultures and histories presented is mind-boggling. I am astonished that I could have been so unaware of the antiquity, diversity, and complexity of the indigenous people of the Americas. (Indigenous from the European standpoint, that is.) There are some terrible things we learn about these cultures, but also some extraordinary, wonderful things, such as the many examples of agricultural genius.Mann argues that we have failed to see the real past and greatness of Indian accomplishments because we have inherited an image of them as impoverished and incapable of civilization. This is largely owing to the fact that disease had ravaged the entire Western hemisphere in the first few decades after Columbus with an intensity unequaled even by the Black Plague in Europe. This universal catastrophe allowed for the ease of Spanish and British conquest. Mann provides compelling evidence for this fairly new claim in the narrative of American history.Mann uses the history of the American Indians to suggest that responsible land use (the \\"garden\\" vs. the \\"wilderness\\") is the best and most \\"Indian\\" response to the environmental crisis that is becoming more and more evident today. Indians, he argues, were very heavy-handed with the land, but on the whole (with a few glaring exceptions) they used it in sustainable ways. (The terra preta and jungle-husbandry in the Amazon were perhaps the most fascinating cases addressed in the book. The milpa and land-burnings were also intriguing.) There seem to be some native American agricultural and land-management techniques which even today surpass what science and long experience have been able to devise.However controversial this book might be to some specialists, at least it exists! It brings to public light an entire hemispheric history that changes the very way we think about being human.A wonderful book!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Charles Mann has done an absolutely smashing job of telling us a lot of things most of us didn't know about the Pre-Columbian North and South Americas - so many thinggs in fact that, having just put the book down, I have s surfeit of information which I will never remember but enjoyed taking in. He\\"s done his homework from a bibliogrophy which lists out at 43 full pages; and, while some academics are sure to find some factual inaccuracies and while his prejudices show through occasionally, it's a great read for the general public - which certainly includes this writer.The book is a kind of \\"Gee-Whiz-I didn-know-that-before\\" affair which will provide you with the material for several interesting dinner table convesations as well as dispelling any ideas you my have had that the Pre-Columbian Americas were lightly populaed (they weren't) or that their peoples were \\"backward\\" (most certainly not) or that a few \\"Indians\\" walked across the Bering Strait 10,000 years ago and settled he Americas(That's not so either, although some did enter this way.)So please read it and be enthralled with a new view of the Old Americas.

It dispels centuries-old myths and calls upon the latest research data to disprove errors among even modern-day society regarding the accomplishments of the inhabitants of the American continents in the millennia pre-dating the reference date, 1491. This is the sort of book I couldn't put down. It had everything: interesting facts, incontrovertible data, and theories that stimulated deep thought. Finally it's being proposed to a wide, mainstream audience that the tired old \\"Asian land bridge\\" concept of history classes past is full of flaws and that humans-possibly even of European heritage-dwelled in America at least 20,000 years before the present. I love knowing that here in North America great civilizations once resided, in cities like Cahokia and Poverty Point, and also among such philosophically heavyweight peoples as the Hopewell, the Maya, and the Anasazi. Finally, Mann does an excellent job of demonstrating that the cultures extant in the \\"pre-Columbian\\" western hemisphere were not always the earthy tree huggers so many today believe they were and that they in fact experienced many of the same problems as their European an Asian counterparts, including wars, famines, and the effects of human-authored ecological ravages. Mann does a better job of giving us a remarkable and fully-rounded view of the original Americans than any other author I have yet read. This book is a groundbreaking masterpiece!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I am a professional archaeologist, schooled in anthropology, the study of humans. With 37 years experience I had not expected the mind-altering material that Charles Mann synthesized for this book. The book deals with native cultures of the New World from before and after the arrival of Europeans. He gathers together the most recent discoveries and theories regarding how and why native cultures were essentially overthrown by the invaders from across the Atlantic. He brings in lessons wrought from archaeology, biology, epidemiology, horticulture, history, ethnography, geography, you name it. I blazed through this book and Mann left me wanting more when I was done. This is truly a magnificent work from a leading science journalist."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I found this book extremely enjoyable. It contains a wealth of knowledge about Native American cultures in N. and S. America; findings that are apparently well-known in academic circles, but which have remained largely unreported and unknown to mainstream audiences. Mr. Mann clearly admires much about the achievements of these pre-Columbus civilizations, and seeks to redress \\"common\\" misconceptions that most Westerners have about \\"primitive, savage\\" Indian life. I am glad I read this book. I learned a great deal from this book, and was fascinated by the subject matter.This book is also beautifully written, and makes the subject matter accessible to laypeople. I was expecting it to be readable buy dry, but it was instead a book that just compelled me to keep turning pages. It helps to bring these ancient civilizations to life, talks frankly about the impact of European colonization on these civilizations, and challenges the reader to set aside his/her textbook knowledge and consider seeing Native Americans in an all new light.Every now and then a book comes out that makes science \\"sexy.\\" For example, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" by Jared Diamond, or \\"Krakatoa\\" by Simon Winchester. To me, this is one of those books. It's both revealing and entertaining. \\"1491\\" was just a terrific read - thought provoking, compelling, entertaining, well researched. I even read all the appendices, and that's saying something.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Please don't confuse this excellent book with the poorly researched fantasy \\"1421: The Year China Discovered America.\\" 1491 is an extremely well researched and documented look into the latest archaelogical findings and theories pertaining to life in North and South America prior to Columbus's landing.Mann does an excellent job explaining the accuracies and flaws of the multitude of theories surrounding this topic. As he simply exposes the debates and doesn't attempt to resolve them himself, he provides an illustrative lesson that one should not become too entrenched with any particular theory on the pre-history of man as each theory is eventually overturned or modified by new findings.His writing style seems similar to Jared Diamond. Mann, however, makes his points without getting bogged down in the excruciating details which makes this book much more readable than Guns, Germs, and Steel or Collapse (both of which were excellent books as well). With over 100 pages of notes and references he provides the reader with the necessary information for them to conduct their own level of research based upon their desires."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"So what was Pre-Columbian America really like? According to Charles Mann, it was not what you think. For starters, there were a lot more native Americans. Would you believe, about 100 million? It seems an extraordinary number but Mann, using some newer scientific discoveries, makes a plausible case for it.But how could so many people spread over two continents within a couple thousand years of crossing the land bridge from Asia? Again, there's new evidence that points to more than one migration, migrations that go back as far as 20,000 or 30,000 years, perhaps, even migrations by sea from Asia directly to the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-migration theory might explain why Pre-Columbian America was populated by a broad range of cultures, even more diverse than other heavily inhabited areas of the world. Moreover, newer archeology shows that great cities existed in mesoamerica , the Andes, and in other areas. For example, Mann estimates that the largest, most prosperous city in the world in 1491 was not Paris or Rome; it was Mexico City with as many as two million inhabitants. But he also shows that native cultures were no better than Europeans at overstressing their environments; the Mayans did it to the point of total collapse.Although he constantly reminds the reader that not all his theories are accepted by other scientists, the material is presented to make his case: Life in America in 1491 was a lot different than we all were taught in grade school. Whether you accept his conclusions or not, you'll find the material very enlightening and highly entertaining."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Fast-paced and respectfully humorous, author Charles Mann tackles a very difficult question - \\"What were the America's like before Columbus arrived?\\".Mann clearly did his research on this book (How old is this guy, anyway?!? He recounts so many travels that he must have started traveling at age six! :-)Whether you believe this is historical revisionism, or historical revelation, what stood out to me the most was Mann's discussion of the uncertainty of science -- and his accounts of scientists arguing and defending their pet theories in ways that appear rather irrational for a methodolgy that claims to be rational and objective. (I could have done without the pictures of the scientists, though. I would have preferred more pictures of the country or artifacts.)The last two pages of Chapter 10 -- \\"The Artificial Wilderness\\" alone are worth the price of the book. Beatifully written. Mann's Coda, \\"The Great Law of Peace\\", started out to me as a digression, but soon became the most important chapter in the book, bringing it full circle to where it began.Wonderful book! I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann rejects the idea that the first inhabitants of North and South America were 'suspended in time, touching nothing and untouched themselves, like ghostly presences on the landscape'. Instead, he proposes that the number, age and complexity of these native societies were much greater than conventionally believed. Mann blames smallpox and other European diseases for decimating the indigenous population in advance of later physical intrusions and influencing their response to the new settlers. The book covers famous cultures like the Maya, Inca and Algonquin as well as more obscure ones. Mann mixes accounts of personal research and site visits with summaries of other experts' opinions, often tracing changes in a leading hypothesis in response to new evidence.The text and short appendices comprise only 360 pages. Forty pages of endnotes and a forty-five page bibliography follow. The book also contains several maps of the groups throughout the continents, for example the one oppostite the title page which further dispels the image of a fresh New World ripe for colonial division."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book will give you insight into the North American landscape and the lives of native Indians before Columbus landed. Great detail. Easy to read."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Like the author, I attended high school before the archeology of the Americas had made the discoveries he describes, so this came as a page-turner of revelation upon revelation. No pastoral hunter - gatherers crossing the land bridge after the retreat of the last ice age. Instead, sophisticated, urban civilizations rivaling those better known ones in the ancient Near East, India, and China, but earlier.At mid-way, I had to check the bio of the author to make sure he wasn't an academic, since his research and scholarship seemed so vast (check out the bibliography and notes at the back). On the plus side -- a real sensitivity to culture and to the meaning of words; on the minus, the jarring reminders of a journalist's interview process (\\"so-and-so told me that ...\\").What's astonishing is that the high school texts his son read 20 years ago, and those my daughter is now reading in High School, are hardly better (more thorough, more balanced) in covering the pre-history of the Americas. And the tragedy of the profound, deadly impact of diseases from Europe on these people, and their cultures.Required reading for all who want to appreciate the cultural history of our continent and the innovations of native peoples."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Got home from work and read all weekend... Back at it when I'd get home. Couldn't getenough of these new ideas and information that explains so much about the abandoned structures and misunderstood native cultures of the Americas. I love the new way of thinking about our history that seemed so obvious as I read. One of those times I'd like the author to know I'm grateful."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 paints a three-part picture of the American continents before the Europeans arrived: it was settled earlier than is generally believed, there were more people and, most importantly, the populations here controlled their environment. Any other person who has ever had to sit through someone describing Native Americans as, essentially, timeless hippies in constant commune with Nature will particularly enjoy Part Three: Landscape with Figures. This may be the hardest chapter for a lot of people to take. In it, Mann shares the theory that the Amazon forest is really a giant man made orchard. Hard to believe- unless one considers it more likely that human beings would have inhabited a region for thousands of years and not changed their environment, or that those people would have discovered a group of tree species growing in abundance that just happened to provide food and medicine for them.The book's opening anecdote is \\"Holmberg's Mistake\\". Mann briefly explains the conclusions Allan Holmberg drew after meeting the Siriono people. He described them as being the most culturally backward people on the planet. True, they couldn't count past three, they had no clothing and they couldn't make fire. However, what Holmberg saw was what they were in the 1940s- after they had been devastated by infectious diseases and battles for land with cattle ranchers. It's not that Holmberg inaccurately described them as they were at that moment in time; it's that he assumed that because he was looking at them in that state, they had always been in that state.That criticism is at the core of the book: most of our histories assert that the people of North and South America lived in small populations and were surrounded by plenty before the Europeans arrived. This is because this is what many settlers saw. This myth persists despite the fact that it has been shown repeatedly how devastating European diseases were to Early American populations. Mann quotes accounts from early explorers who reported \\"cheek to jowl\\" populations when they first visited. Four decades later, many of those accounts could not be verified; follow on explorers found sparser populations. What they could not have known at the time was that the diseases they brought with them lingered long enough after they left to wipe out up to 95% of the original population. With fewer among them, they would have been less likely to control their environments as they had before; thus New England forests were lush, 60 million bison roamed the plain states and it would have been all too easy- and convenient- to interpret the Americas as relatively uninhabited and thus ripe for colonization.Understandably, it's difficult to make any clear assertions about when the earliest Americans arrived and settled- and that is also part of Mann's criticism. The popular theory- that people crossed the Bering Strait from Asia to North America- was something that people were hoping would be true almost as soon as people were seen in the Americas because then it wouldn't invalidate the biblical timeline that had been established in the 17th century. While almost undoubtedly people did use that passage, there is evidence that they came through other avenues as well. There is also strong evidence that they have been here longer than is generally assumed. This is perhaps the most disturbing part of the story: though known in scholarly circles, this is not shared in schools or popular books.Mann is not a historian, anthropologist or archeologist. He is a journalist- with a point of view. His writing is clear and easy to follow, and he's quick to point out where others would disagree with him or even call him out for his naivete. It is also frustrating because much of what he asserts, though logical and supported by evidence, is not universally agreed upon. To that extent, he is not just presenting the known scholarship, but asking the reader to draw his or her own conclusions, not only about the Native Americans but about the Europeans that followed. You may find at times that you have to put the book down and let things sink in before you can read again. The idea that Native Americans were civilized, cultured and successfully managed their land goes contrary to what we've all been taught, but it's a lesson worth learning.Recommended for mid-teens and up."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This book opened my eyes to a number of ideas I had never considered. It was a very quick read in spite covering some pretty dense material. I wish I had been taught this in high school. It would have given me a very different view of American colonization."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I am finding it almost scary to attempt a comment about 1491 because it is, seriously, one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. I am a little numbed by the facts assembled by Mann and I have no doubt that wealth of scholarship will withstand any amount of counter argument. I admit I started this book months ago and it seemed that every new chapter I read, I was confronted by such a wealth of new material that it has taken me too long to attempt to digest all that I have read. No, I do not believe the one star criticisms of this fabulous compendium of current scholarship regarding aspects of the ancient history of pre-Columbian America.As an example and I fully admit to being a modest general reader, I was amazed to read of the Beni in Bolivia. The simple existence of those undoubtedly constructed mounds attests to a technology for which we Westerners cannot even judge. Then skip to the last chapter and mind-wrestle with the idea that some scholars believe the Amazon Basin was tree planted to provide natural food for huge populations. Then deal with the idea of terra preta or manufactured soil; something our technology cannot approach.I believe it was chapter six where Mann talked about corn; now who, certainly not me, has ever given corn a thought but he tells us that biologically it should not even exist because it needs human beings to propagate it. We in the West are so constipated with our own greatness that we cannot digest the breadth of other technology used by the peoples of the Western Hemisphere.In this short comment how can I even deal with the extraordinary civilizations that grew around Lake Titicaca and made Peru as important as the Fertile Crescent or that the Inka Empire was territorially the largest in world history. My mind literally reeled from the bombardment of new material assembled by Mann. I leave this book with a completely new appreciation of all that was taking place in the Americas before Columbus. I am truly amazed and I, stupidly in hindsight, thought I knew a little about the human history of this rock we inhabit; but no, I only had a little of half the story and I thank Mann for correcting that vacuum slightly. Now I just have to remember all that he wrote."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books that I have ever read. The only small downside is that it is written by a journalist. Thus the style of the writing is as you would expect from a journalist and not a popular science/anthropology writer. The difference is that the book is writing in a more entertaining fashion but many of the details are glossed over and there is a large focus on the 'characters', rather than the ideas. But this is a minor quibble for a great, well-written book. This is an extremely enjoyable book that will update much of the history you learned about native cultures in high school. The controversial and fascinating ideas in this burgeoning field are treated with an appropriate level of interest and skepticism. Like Jared Diamond's 'Guns, Germs and Steel' this book can be appreciated simply as a human and natural history textbook, regardless of the fascinating hypotheses presented. I got the pleasure of reading this book, while I was traveling and hiking in Peru and viewing the sophisticated Inca ruins such as Machu Picchu. This multimedia experience gave the book a much more visceral feeling that I rather enjoyed. I highly recommend doing the same excursions while reading this book!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"In 1491, the author provides a succinct summary of many of the different theories of the \\"Indian\\" history in pre-Columbian America. He often presents a scenario, followed with \\"or maybe it never happened\\", and then follows it up with another scenario. Within the book, he presents brief histories of many of the early inhabitants of the American continents, complete with their culture, origins and fall. The most recent scholarship is presented along with old \\"knowledge\\" about the groups. The narrative is well written and surprisingly cohesive, considering the broad topic. (Despite the title, it is not about '1491', but instead about the entire history of the non-European inhabitants of the Americas. The focus is primarily on pre-columbian times, but it also provides fairly detailed coverage of the 'interaction' with the early European inhabitants.)One of the key points that is made is that the various \\"Indians\\" had many different advanced civilizations, and were it not for their susceptibility to European diseases they may still be the dominant inhabitants of the American continents. The historical \\"savage\\" view of Indians or the politically correct \\"noble environmentalist\\" views are all somewhat misleading. The early American inhabitants likely had plenty of good qualities as well as bad qualities, and were made up of very different groups with differing degrees of urbanization and \\"civilization\\". They also did much to change their environment to suit their needs."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"So many reviews of this book miss the point: before Columbus and other Europeans arrived in the New World that there were tens of millions of residents here, with all the trappings and problems that so many people cause. By the time European settlers arrived perhaps more than 90% of the residents had died due to the influx of contagious diseases spread among them. And much had changed in the century or so as farmed forests became overgrown and formerly heavily hunted populations of animals, such as bison and pigeons, grew way out of hand. The settlers never realized that there were so many people formerly resident and that so much was already \\"managed\\". Great fun and great stuff. I especially liked the section on the Amazon, which so many thought was uninhabitable by large groups. Check out \\"The Lost City of Z\\" and \\"The Ecology of Power\\" for more on this interesting subtopic. There's great food for thought here."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Way back in 2005, I set out to study American History all over again -- from the beginning, chronologically that is. I launched the effort with 'big history' 65 million years ago with the outstanding \\"The Eternal Frontier\\" by Tim Flannery, then followed with another winner, \\"Facing East from Indian Country\\" by Daniel Richter. The next one was still another superlative title, \\"American Colonies\\" by Alan Taylor. I was all set to move on to the French & Indian Wars when I stumbled upon \\"1491\\" by Charles Mann.Everything suddenly came to a screeching halt as I literally inhaled this masterpiece of multi-disciplinary scholarship on the pre-Columbian Americas, and I realized I needed a long pause and lot more study before I abandoned the early period of American history and moved on.Mann successfully integrates and synthesizes all the latest research and findings from historical sources as well a wide range of archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and -- well, you pick a field and Mann has consulted it -- and successfully wraps his narrative around it. Mann virtually rediscovers the lost world of Mesoamerican, Andean and other pre-Columbian societies, bringing a new and crisper focus to the more familiar \\"high civilizations\\" of the Aztecs and the Incas, and -- more critically -- rescuing from the dustbin of pre-history less well-known and perhaps less advanced cultures that were nonetheless more than the equal in many ways to their European counterparts who supplanted them. He challenges the customary assumptions that most of the pre-contact population beyond the golden cities was primitive and made little impact upon their respective environments.With a narrative gift that is never tedious despite the complexity and detail of the material he discusses, Mann delivers nothing less than a tour-de-force of history told from a perspective long overlooked, a fascinating account of a thriving and successful population much larger than once assumed, decimated primarily by devastating plagues from across the sea they could never have anticipated or countered.Readers will walk away from this book breathless from what they have encountered and absorbed. I award \\"1491\\" five stars because it is unique - like such other masterworks as Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs & Steel\\" and Nicholas Wade's \\"Before the Dawn\\" - in literally provoking entirely new perspectives in otherwise familiar territory.

Because of this book, I went to Cahokia mounds just outside St. Louis to see man made structures dating back to 700 AD. Simply amazing. I had no idea. Now I have a dozen places in Central and South America to see now that I understand the historical significance.This should be required reading in high schools and colleges. But it reads much easier than a text book. The author did a phenomenal job of making it flow. Never thought I'd be interested in the history of agriculture.

It does, however, attempt to make a point - the peoples that lived in the Americas prior to Columbus were technologically advanced, some American cities rivaled/exceeded their European counterparts, and these peoples altered their environment (by planting trees, farming / developing crops) more than was once believed.This book requires thinking - it's not an \\"simple read\\" - but it lays out history in a way that is interesting and understandable to a person with little background in pre-Columbian history.

They'd been killed in massive numbers by germs brought by the crews of explorer ships from Europe that made landfall in the 1400s and 1500s, bringing smallpox, influenza and all manner of diseases that most Europeans and Asians had developed some resistence to.The Americas in contrast, were surrounded by oceans, giving people here less contact with diseases Europe got from Asia. Here, the American trade routes extended from northern tip of N.America to the southern tip of South America, and to the Caribbean Islands, but did not bring the latest diseases until the explorers brought several at once carried by their crews.So, what we saw were two american continents with crumbling remnants of empty and disappearing ghost cities and forests that had grown to conceal orchards, and tribes that had been reduced to nomadic lives again."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The pre-Columbian American Continent was highly populated with a degree of technological, social and civil sophistication largely unmatched in Eurasia.

The author does a comprehensive job in exposing the biased and inaccurate views towards so-called Indians as primitive, scattered, savage, etc. He brings a more balanced view of these peoples, one that shows advanced civilizations, major public works, political entities, and agricultural achievements that made this land grow and prosper to the fertile land it remains to this day. I must admit that prior to reading this book, I too was a member of the ignorant group. This book helped to open my eyes to the great civilization at Cahokia, to the large numbers of native americans even in the early years of european contact, to the profound intricacies and fundamental american ideals underlying the Iroquis confederation, and much more.I particularly enjoyed the parts where he exposed the inaccuracies of the past, and the controversies of the present concerning human migration patterns into the americas. This helps to prove that ideas and views that were intractable a few decades ago can change with time and deeper understanding and evidence.Finally, I found the author's wish-washiness somewhat regrettable. It seems kind of schizophrenic on his part. On the one hand he is making great progress debunking old ideas, etc. But another part of him seems unwilling to fully commit to those same ideas, and allows for too much skepticism of the same ideas being presented. I also found the discussion of Native-American, while perhaps necessary and somewhat interesting, to be also overly apologetic and ranting. Overall, however, I found this book a fascinating insight into pre-columbus american civilizations, and would make it required reading in any high school american history course if I had the authority.

While I know that some people view the interpretations of the observations to be suspect, I found the observations and findings described in the book to be fascinating. In this book I enjoyed the thoughts regarding pre-Columbian architecture, politics, government, trade, agriculture, etc., of cultures in both South and North America.Of course there is still a lot of controversy surrounding re-interpretations of long-held ideas about pre-Columbian native Americans, but I enjoyed the thoughts that Mann had on the subject. I found the section on how early dwellers in the Amazon were able to manage the soil so that it was productive for long periods of time, as well as about how North American native Americans may have managed the landscape by using fire to suit their needs.The section on Maize (corn) was particularly interesting, since many if not most of the processed food items we eat today are just reorganized versions of corn.Evidences of early civilizations to rival those of the Middle East were also fun to read about. But, accounts of the impacts of European explorers and the diseases they brought were saddening.Oh, I was amazed when I read about the different approaches to engineering in the old versus the new world. The old world's architecture and engineering is based on the principle of compression (arches in construction, etc.) while in the new world the focus was on tension (suspension bridges, etc.).If any of this sounds interesting to you, then I highly recommend this book.

Some day the rug will be removed...."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"I bought this with great anticipation, but was sorely disappointed. It was a vey thick book for a thin set of theses. I was interested in Mann's points that Indians were more numerous and had a much greater affect on the landscape than typically acknowledged, but his tale was too anecdotal to be very convincing. I would say that it brought a new possibility to public light, but that the jury is still out. That half of the book was clearly interesting however.The half of the book that I found annoying was his gratuitous attempt to use the purported affect of Indians on the landscape as a criticism of the environmental movement today. His arguments were simply unconvincing on their face. As a purely logical matter, why should the already well understood and trivial fact that aboriginal peoples -- especially those that were not nomadic -- had effects on their environments have anything to do with whether we should make efforts to reduce our much greater impacts. If all he is trying to say is that the concept of environmentally pure Indians is a myth, then his point is pretty trivial, well documented, and not worth so many pages.He reserves much of his scorn for a straw man target -- a long ago commercial showing a North American Indian shedding a tear at modern pollution. His argument is flawed for various reasons, starting with the fact that this was plainly an Indian from North America, meaning in this case the U.S. or Canada, and Mann's rebuttal examples are from Central America. More importantly, whatever effect Indians may have had on the land, they did not create factories that billowed smoke; nor did they pollute the waters and shores with industrial detritus or create a situation such as existed at the time of the commercial -- which Mann may be too young to remember -- where a large portion of U.S. rivers and streams were not swimmable, fishable, or drinkable. So even if he has made the point that 1491 was not as untouched and idylllic as some people once believed -- a point not made by the comemrcial -- it is a waste of many pages.Also, at one point Mann states that land changed by Indians long ago is as valuable or diverse ecologically as untouched land. This is a difficult argument. First, it ignores time. Our cities, other than green areas, are generally ecological wastelands relatively speaking, except for rats, pigeons, starlings, insects, etc. But far enough in the future, they will return to nature, when mankind is no longer present. But that does not make them beneficial for the perhaps 10s of thousands of years they exist. Nor can tropical rain forest be compared to the clearings that remain when it is burnt or chopped.A very flawed book.

I spend hours telling friends about it and emailing them on the Internet. The author writes beautifully, no doubt about that. His description of the effects of North American Indians on the world's perception of human dignity and the freedom of the individual are extraordinary."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Paul Hawken recommended this book during a Seattle lecture introducing his latest bookBlessed Unrest: How the Largest Movement in the World Came into Being and Why No One Saw It Coming. It took me a while to get to, but it is certainly an extraordinary achievement, and it has enormous meaning for future studies of both lost histories of 183+ indigenous cultures and languages, and for a new appreciation of how humans can and should shape the environment, not just try to protect it.The maps alone are a treasure, and are complemented by perfectly selected photographs and graphics, including one on page 144 that documents the deaths of 50 million indigenous Indians in Mexico alone, over the course of a 100 years from 1518 to 1623. The maps highlight the extraordinary contribution of this book and this author in documenting the scope and sophistication and massive numbers of native Americans across both continents, and with some documentation going back to 5000 BC.The author opens by pointing out, as \\"Holmberg's Mistake,\\" the long-standing incorrect views that history began in 1492, and that the indigenous people's were few in number and lacked any semblance of influence or \\"agency\\" over what historians over hundreds of years assumed was a \\"state of nature\\" in which the indigenous humans were nothing more than a higher state of animal.The book, which comes with 140 pages of endnotes, is world-class scholarship and world-class investigative journalism. It compellingly documents an Inka Empire spanning a continent in the 15th century and before, with 25,000 miles of roads that last to this day. Tens of millions, many languages, a great deal of trade, sophisticated culture with metalurgy and stone masonry equal to or superior to the Europeans.I was particularly impressed by the author's description of how language analysis, looking for common words or syllables, helped to document a breadth of unique languages going far back in time.Overall the book documents how the introduction of smallpox from humans and many other pandemic diseases from pigs that spread to wildlife and then humans, killed perhaps 100 million indigenous American Indians (north and south).The book ends, appropriately for our time, with a section on the Five Nations of native American Indians who in the early 17th Century were practicing the Great Law of Peace. The Chinese brought Dick Cheney's airplane down over Singapore with precision electronic pulses, and have demonstrated that they can sneak up on our carriers and also immobilize or neutralize are mobility and weapons systems which are completely unprotected against advanced electronic warfare.

I had a vague notion of what the book was like having seen various references to it on the internet in the past few years. Almost all these reference were positive. It seemed like exactly the type of book I should like. It wasn't. I didn't.Author Charles Mann bills the book as a synthesis of \`recent' research which challenges three major facts about the Pre-Columbian Americas. The three sections of the book discuss these \`facts' in turn: 1. How many people lived in the Americas before Columbus, 2. How long people had been living in the Americas, and 3. How extensive Native American Indians altered the physical landscape. Mann's self-described intent is to present an overview of findings from the last few decades which undermine past research, research which has often given short thrift to Native American societies. Revisionist history of this type serves a valuable purpose if it corrects previous errors in research or analysis. Yet, the tenor of the book and Mann's conclusions on several issues lead me to doubt the book's adherence to sound historical analysis. This is unfortunate. I'm not an expert in Native American history. I cannot parse, on a majority of issues the book covers, what Mann overstates and what he does not. But on several occasions Mann molds the documentary record to fit his narrative. By doing so, I'm left to wonder what else Mann leaves out or elides.I don't want to go through a litany of problems so I'll discuss one specific issue. Mann apparently believes that to revise the conventional view of American societies as primitive (the underlying theme animating the \`facts' above), he must reflexively contextualize behavior in pre-Columbian America by recourse to European atrocities, failings, or actions. This is tedious and unnecessary. And, at least some of Mann's attempts are blatantly absurd. Take for instance his discussion on Aztec ritual human sacrifice. Mann begins this discussion by saying that he will dispel two myths: 1. Aztec human sacrifice did not happen. 2. Aztec human sacrifice was unusual in scope. The mere juxtaposition of these two \`myths' is ridiculous. No serious historical account could advance the first myth (the wealth of Aztec documentary information about human sacrifice alone makes this impossible), and numerous, well-researched and documented analyses ascribe to the second. To undermine this second \`myth,' Mann culls the documentary evidence to only discuss sources which advance low numbers for how many people the Aztec Empire sacrificed (conveniently leaving out even Aztec sources which contain much higher figures). Armed with almost certainly inaccurate numbers, Mann compares such numbers with figures for contemporary executions in England, accounts for population differences by multiplying the European figures based on the highest estimate of Aztec population, and ta dah, England was even worse in terms of state-sponsored murder! This type of analysis misses the point. First, in pure numerical terms, Mann completely overstates his case. Second, the comparison doesn't make sense. Much of Aztec sacrifice was not meted out as punishment, but a key part in Aztec eschatology. Mann himself discusses this. Moreover, this deceptive defense doesn't even concern any of the three major facts the book sets out to set straight (which I provided above). I'm at a loss for why Mann thinks this type of digression was even necessary.I would have liked it if this book had convinced me. I wish the book didn't have its bizarrely defensive tone and digressions. And, I wish I could trust Mann's analysis and arguments. But, I can't because Mann seems willing to disregard inconvenient documentary sources and evidence which don't fit his narrative."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"Mann, a journalist, presents here a summary of the views of the current crop of archaeologists, ethnographers, geographers, and epigraphers regarding the Americas before the arrival of Columbus. Both the extreme negative reviewers and the extreme positive reviewers have missed a couple of things. First, Mann repeatedly mentions the necessarily speculative nature of much of the narrative. Second, he makes it clear that we have here an academic debate that shares the same problems that any debate in the academic arena shares. That is, the debate becomes so vicious because the stakes are so minimal.Two phrases that he used toward the end of the book appropriately summarize the situation. The first is \\"dialogs of the deaf\\" which makes the point that the various sides in the dispute are often either talking past each other, or not really hearing each other. The other phrase is \\"the earnestly opaque language\\" of academia. That is, academic discourse is so filled with technical jargon that it is often almost incomprehensible to the average non-academic reader.That being said, Mann's reporting of these views makes two strong cases. First, that the population of the Americas was probably orders of magnitude greater than has usually been thought in the past. Here, I think the data are compelling. Second, that the native population of the Americas probably were more active in the \\"farming\\" of their ecosystem than has usually been assumed to be the case. Here again, the data are compelling.The \\"Coda\\" of the book was the worst part. in this section, Mann made a lame case in \\"a Rousseauvian\\" fashion--to quote another reviewer) for the \\"noble\\" savage, conveniently forgetting the \\"savage\\" part of that phrase, and trotting out the almost non-existent evidence for Indian influence on the constitutional system of the US form of government. This was similar to Mann's correlation earlier in the book between New World human sacrifice and Old World public execution. The numbers of dead are in a certain sense irrelevant. In the latter case, people were executed for crimes committed. In the former case, people were executed for the crime of being human in the wrong place at the wrong time."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"A few comments:Interesting thus far (1/3 of the way). I do get the feeling I am reading a re-hash!? The population deaths from diseases, while interesting isn't new thought.The extended discourse regarding the Beni is most interesting.I am a bit perplexed by the wheel.Charles (Mann) laments the lack of usage of the wheel as many other authors have. I don't understand this. Just staying with Azteca/Mixteca for these statements, let me explain.Central Mexico had an enormous population. I trust there is no doubt regarding this. The rulers also faced tasks related to keeping the population gainfully busy when not killing them off with war and religious festivities. I fully suspect these were often times orchestrated as the need arose to control the population.The \\"average\\" man could carry somewhere around 60 lbs. for extended periods of time at a rate of 3 miles per hour. 60X3x10 (hours per work day)= 1,800 lb. hours per day.With a wheel: 240x3x10= 7,200 lbs. This presumes that a small hand cart supported four times what a man carried on his back.As a labor administrator you (anyone) realize a large number of unemployed or under utilized laborers leads to troubles.Another reason for the lack of the use of the wheel is the increased industry requiring over-site and the use of scarce woods. Just any wood won't work for a wheel on a work cart nor the cart itself. Rare hardwoods and metals not in ready supply again requiring expanded industry.Why bother? No need. The majority of the acceptable population was within half a days journey for most carriers. Additionally, the market place and road system would require maintenance and construction not already in use. Ergo- more diversity.Mesoamerican society was not a widely diverse society requiring broad controls. The existing bureaucracy functioned acceptably and changed as needed to accommodate more of the same. There was no need nor desire to create more work for the overseers. Whether priests or some other \\"crat,\\" those in power liked the status quo.As in the examples of the Inka (Inca) regarding multiple roads between the same two cities and moving a mountain for no apparent reason- labor use.Additionally I am a bit perplexed with the statements regarding the lack of the use of an arch in South American architecture. A picture in the book (page 79) should be self evident. No arch can withstand side (lateral) forces as well as post-lintel construction. Any builder wanting his creation to survive earth movements that will occur use what survives- an arch will fail. Similar rationale explains suspension bridges versus any type of hardened (fixed) bridge. Whether cantilever, arch or beam the survivability is low compared to a relatively free swinging suspension bridge."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"The publisher of the badly written, un-edited, and poorly documented \\"1491\\" by Charles Mann is Vintage Books. When did Vintage deteriorate to this degree? Mann jumps around all over the place without making connections, and is sometimes self-contradictory.

Thanks!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"If you are a serious historian, or a \\"lay person\\" who loves reading history but takes it seriously, you may find this book disappointing! If you are serious about catching up on new developments in Native American history, from both continents and central America, you should look elsewhere. 1491 is too broad and lacking in detail to provide the serious history student/scholar the information they crave. Focus your attention on journal articles and books by full-time historians.If, on the other hand, you are simply looking for a one-book fix on Native histories, a broad-overview, then this book should suffice.My most serious gripe about the book is this: the constant political undertone. Most books I have read discussing history of any kind have been written by full-time historians, professors, and the like. I can only assume that because Mann is by trade a journalist, and this book is more or less a coalescence of his 30 or so years of work mostly in magazines, he took the opportunity to show his political leanings in this book. Whereas, the Morisons, Fischers, etc. (historians) feel their job as a strict historian precludes them from making any kind of political commentary, overt or explicit. Put another way: if you want a book on history, you want a book on history. If you want a book of political commentary, you want a book on political commentary. Personally, I don't like the two mixed.Another disappointment was the feeling that the first 150 of this book were more or less dedicated to what could have been stated more simply and what is already a widely accepted fact: many, many, many Native Americans died of smallpox and other diseases brought by Europeans. I feel far too many pages were spent explaining and re-explaining what I do not consider a \\"new revelation about the Americas before Columbus.\\" This is not a new revelation, and it is not pre-Columbian! It did not require 1/3 of the book! It felt like filler.I write this review out of disappointment. I was so excited to read it, and was utterly disappointed after spending a week plodding through it. Very little new information was gleaned, what was learned was mostly controversial and doubtful, and there was a (nearly) constant political commentary running in the background. If it takes me a week to read a book, and I have another 40 years left to read, then I can read a maximum of 2080 books in my life. There are millions of books to be read! I hate wasting my time on a disappointing book!"},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"1491 should be more accurately titled 1492. Its primary focus is on European contact with Native Americans, which in itself is interesting reading but fell short of my expectations. After reading the book, I now understand my expectations should have been lowered because most of the data that we have about the pre-Columbian natives came from Europeans. The ideas that Mann proposes are based on ever-evolving theories that balance one on top of another. For example, genetic similarity created a 95% kill rate from Eurasian diseases among the natives, but he also proposes that three or four separate waves of Asians populated the Americas. These contradictions are apparent from the beginning of the book and continues through the end. Mann tries to present many sides to controversies surrounded by these theories, but this creates even more confusion. He does lack a little focus, jumping from one subject and back to another. He includes a lot of great information, but falls short in some cases by being incomplete. Most smart readers will conclude that we still don't know a whole lot about Native American culture and civilization prior to European contact, but the book is a good step in the right direction."},{"Title":"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus","review":"This is great author but the aftertaste is that you never know where history stops and imagination begins.

Critics here have noted the lack of plan and structure in 1491 (which is mostly about 1493 and thereafter) and they are correct. But it's also true that readers would have been badly served by a rigid and coherent organizational scheme in which Mann's dueling data looked more settled and linear than they really are.Dueling data, in fact, may be what 1491 is about. What pre-Columbian America was, as settled and tidy history, is still a fable not agreed upon. Mann's real story is what pre-Columbian America is, an unresolvable playground and battleground for irreconcilable scholars with otherwise useless archaeo/paleo/anthro degrees. It gives the academic old guard (e.g. Betty Meggers) and academic young Turks (e.g. Anna C. Roosevelt) job security and the frisson of fighting like Pleistocene tigers, but without the inconvenience of real damage or death. High counters battle low counters, old footnotes combat insurgent footnotes, multiple regressions masticate the evidence for Pleistocene mass murder (lions, tigers, & bears; sloths, mastodons, & glyptodonts, oh my) and everybody gets paid to fight another day without losing blood or sleep.The duel began with \\"the supposition that Native Americans lived in an eternal, unhistoried state,\\" and the supposition of European colonists that Indians were \\"incurably vicious barbarians.\\" These previous conditions of certitude held sway with American exceptionalism, the certainty that America was exceptionally virtuous and that an empty, vicious continent was destined to be filled by Anglo-Saxon civilization and Christianity. Anna C. Roosevelt's great-grandfather said so.Then flower power happened. Anglo-American exceptionalism flip flopped from exceptionally virtuous to exceptionally vile. Colonists were reconstituted as invaders, and native barbarians were rehabilitated as noble, gentle, saintly, communitarian ecologists, rather like the Viet Cong.Those suppositions and their gradations and varaints are in disarray. Pre-Columbian Americans, north and south, built empires and transformed landscapes with fire, cultivation, and slaves. The forest primeval eulogized by hippies and environmentalists was probably an unwanted consequence of native dissolution before Europeans invaded. The rainforest primeval of Amazonia, sacralized by environmentalists, was possibly the intended consequence or artifact of deliberate pre-Columbian construction.In America, before the barbarous incursion of 1492, barbarity coexisted with profound intellectural attainment and sometimes overwhelmed it. In Mesoamerica life had been cheap, just as it was for the Viet Cong. And in pre-Columbian America human life was probably abundant but narrowed by a constricted gene pool that probably parted like a malign Old Testament miracle and let the germs of barbaric invaders come in, probably, before bearded smelly men with guns, horses, and steel prevailed."},{"Title":"The Scary Sleepover","review":"Ulrich Karger tells hier a wonderful, sensitive picture book story.

The book is very logically composed: Each country is introduced with a brief on history, geography and politics. Mr. Derleth manages to explain politically complex issues in a fairly simple way, and each country's chapter has a helpful geographical map showing regions and cities.Having read this book, the reader is certain to have a solid understanding of the political climate and current problems of the countries mentioned above. Very good.I like two particular details: a. In each chapter, politically important people in the respective countries are described and introduced with a small CV (less than half a page each).b. Furthermore, Derleth has added to each country's chapter a very helpful overview of related and relevant internet adresses where one can obtain additional information on a variety of political issues. Thanks for this detail.However: My reason for giving this book only four stars instead of five are: 1. A slightly clearer point of view would be helpful in some of the chapters. For example, in the Bulgaria section, crime is described a couple of times as being on the rise, but in the very end is is said that under the current government, crime is down. I fully understand what the author means, namely that the crime wave seems to get under control by the ODF government, but on a couple of occasions there are some unclarities. Another way of putting it would probably solve these things.2. Some more maps... Although each country's section is introduced with a good map, this good book could benefit from just a few more illustrations. Why not some photos/pictures of the most important figures? OK, most of us now very well how e.g. Yeltsin looks like, but why not in each country's section bring four or five photos/pictures of the most important persons in both historical and political sense?That's it. Summa Summarum: If you want fresh and up-to-date info on politics in Russia, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary, buy this book. Other readers may find the number of maps fully satisfactory, it's a matter of taste. The most important thing is that everything is explained in a way so that even a person knowing absolutely nothing about these four countries will obtain a solid and useful knowledge, on history as well as politics."},{"Title":"Transition in Central and Eastern European Politics, The","review":"Professor Derleth's book is an excellent primer on former Soviet bloc countries that have been trying to establish constituional governments and free-market economic systems. Using Bulgaria, Russia, Hungary, and Poland as examples, Professor Derleth answers the question, &quot;Why has the progress towards this goal has been uneven among these countries?&quot;He gives a thorough overview of the political systems, party systems, and electoral systems in each country, then demonstrates how the design of those systems directly affects outcomes in the transition process. Taking Russia for example, he demostrates how the checks and balances between the President and the parliament are strongly tilted towards the president. This system that gives the president so much power has caused instability when the president has tried to impose policies that lacked legislative support.In taking this comparative approach, Derleth looks at historical similarities and differences, but he also examines the reforms that have been implemented and how they differ from one country to the next. If one wants to clearly understand the politics of countries in this region, this book offers a clear and concise way to do so.I particularly enjoyed the overviews of the history of each country, but also found them quite telling about the contemporary situation in each countries today. For example, Derleth writes of Bulgaria, &quot;As a result of Bulgaria's almost slavish alliance with the former Soviet Union, it has most of the latter's economic, politicial and social problems . . . this political and economic legacy has made it difficult to create a civil society, democratic institutions, and a market economy based on the rule of law.&quot;What makes this book so useful is how it shows the inseperable relationship between politics and economics. Without the right kind of political reform, economic reform is doomed to fail. For example he shows how political battles in Bulgaria have prevented crucial economic reforms, such as privatization.He also does not ignore cultural factors. He notes that one cultural factor that has led to Hungary's success is its previous economic and cultural links to the West. However, while Derleth considers the importance of culture, his book offer hope beyond the all-too-common refrain that countries are victims of their history. This book shows that there are right ways to establish political and econmomic systems, and that doing it the right way can direcctly lead a country towards freedom and prosperity -- regardless of their history.One can take this lesson and apply it to any underdeveloped country. Derleth's approach is to look at the country's economy and ask such questions as, &quot;To what extent have enterprises and property been privatized? How open and competitive are markets? What is the legal enivronment in the area of invesments?Look at a country's political system, and ask such questions as &quot;Is there a democratic, multiparty systems with free and fair elections? Do citizens have civil rights such as free speech and freedom of assembly?Derleth leaves readers with hope for this region, noting that legal rights are being strenghtened, economic reforms are being implemented, and even former communists are learning to play politics in a democratic setting."},{"Title":"The Fragrance of Sweet-Grass: L.M. Montgomery's Heroines and the Pursuit of Romance","review":"&quot;The Fragrance of Sweet Grass: L.M. Montgomery's Heroines and the Pursuit of Romance&quot; by Elizabeth Rollins Epperly exposes many insights about Montgomery's literary works. Most interestingly, Epperly connects home, self-awareness, and romance. Home is where you discover yourself. Not until this discovery can the heroine go beyond herself to recognize her male counterpart. The heroine establishes herself so she can find a hero equally self-aware. Epperly makes the point that although Montgomery subverts convention by having self-aware, independent women not marry until later in life, they do marry and thus conform to convention. Therefore, Epperly suggests that in the 1990s we may not see Montgomery as a feminist. However, I believe she is wrong. Montgomery is a feminist because her heroines are stongly aware of what they can do. Montgomery gives them choices of career, family, or both. Epperly gives an excellent analysis of Montgomery's work, although I do not agree with everything she posits. The book is thoughtful and interesting, providing insights for further investigation."},{"Title":"The Fragrance of Sweet-Grass: L.M. Montgomery's Heroines and the Pursuit of Romance","review":"\\"The Fragrance of Sweet Grass\\" is Elizabeth Epperly's 1992 exploration of the romantic themes in the novels of Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery. Montgomery was most famous for her \\"Anne of Green Gables\\" novels, but she created a number of literary heroines, including Emily of New Moon, Pat of Silver Bush, Valancy Sterling, and the Story Girl, among others. Epperly examines Montgomery's evolving technique, including how romantic choice is dealt with by her heroines, and the author's often subversive narrative with respect to the romantic literary conventions of her day, which called for happy married endings.Epperly considers the Anne novels in the order in which they were written, which leads to some interesting insights about the later appearing novels, such as \\"Anne of Windy Populars\\", in which a mature Montgomery writes about a fiesty and independent Anne after college and before her marriage. Of most interest to this reviewer was a discussion of the cautious, even coy approach to Anne Shirley's relationship with Gilbert Blythe in the first three novels, culminting with the wonderful symmetry, and suspense, of \\"Anne of the Island\\". Epperly devotes considerable space to \\"Emily of New Moon\\" and its two sequels, with its struggling writer heroine, said to be modeled on Montgomery's own early challenges as a writer. \\"Pat of Silver Bush\\" is an extended lesson about romance that may be misdirected into a house or place vice a person.\\"The Fragrance of Sweet Grass\\" should be a fascinating read for Montgomery fans, even those who don't normally go in for literary criticism. The approach is balanced, and there are many insights for devoted Montgomery fans, to whom this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","review":"Sequel. Ugh. What a horrible word. Most of them should never beborn, or if they are, they should be left on a hillside to die of exposure.There ought to be a different word to describe SHANGRI-LA--THE RETURN TO THEWORLD OF LOST HORIZON by Eleanor Cooney and Daniel Altieri (Wm. Morrow,1996). It is in fact the sequel to James Hilton's classic, but without theirrelevance and loss of tumescence you've learned to expect. It actuallyneeded to be written.LOST HORIZON leaves you dangling deliciously. Forget about the movieversion--it was good, but they took huge liberties with the plot of Hilton'stightly constructed work. Most notably, the movie shows the hero, HughConway, arriving back in Shangri-La to the accompaniment of a swellingchorus and heavenly beams of light. It was the era of happy endings inmovies, so they stuck one on. But the book--ah, the book is very differentindeed.It starts with a group of British gents in a men's club talkingabout Conway, a likable but peculiar chap, and how one of them discoveredhim quite by chance in a hospital in Canton suffering from amnesia. Then welearn that his memory abruptly returned on board a liner bound for SanFrancisco, that he jumped ship in Honolulu and was never seen again. Themiddle part of the book is a flashback: Conway's story of being benignlyabducted along with three other people into Shangri-La, meeting thetwo-hundred-year-old lama, finding himself annointed as his successor, andthen having to make a decision of Hamlet-like proportions: stay or go. Hegoes. Dreadful things happened to him after he left, evidently, so that hewound up ill and amnesic in a hospital. Then he got his memory back andjumped ship--to try, we presume, to find his way back to his lost paradise.And that's the last we hear of him. The final words of the book echo downhauntingly over sixty years: &quot;Do you think he will ever find it?&quot;The authors of SHANGRI-LA dip into that poignant mystery withrespect, precision and imagination. Their account of what happened to Conwayduring his disastrous journey out of the hidden valley in the highHimalayas, how he lost his memory, and what happened to him after he got itback is uncannily Hilton-esque and fits with the unanswered questions in theoriginal like the parts of a fine watch. This account, in turn, is part of ahighly relevant story about the brutal Chinese occupation of Tibet in the1960s, the real-life fulfillment of disaster prophesized by Hilton throughhis fictional character Father Perrault.Tibet is still under the heel of China, and SHANGRI-LA teaches the reader some of the harsh facts whiledelivering a taut tale of suspense, intrigue, romance and mystery. Sufficeit to say that there's a rapacious Chinese General who's got hold of aseries of ancient riddles that put him on the trail of the hidden valley. Areally good villain is the heart and soul of a thriller, and this guy isfull of the complexities and contradictions that satisfy our appetites. Andinstead of crudely killing him off, the authors reward him for his villainywith a highly eerie anti-Shangri-La that makes you think of some sort ofhell out of Oriental mythology with Rod Serling as a consultant.SHANGRI-LA pays tribute to Hilton not just in its integrity, formand careful attention to the original--it leaves us with unansweredquestions of its own, of the same poignant proportions. And here's a littletidbit to tantalize you: it's told from the point of view of a woman. Iwouldn't mind a sequel to the sequel."},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","review":"Write a sequel to Lost Horizon? What hubris, what presumption! Just who do you guys think you are? Then I read it. It's wonderful. When James Hilton ordains that you leave Shangri-LA, you understand that you will never find it again. But Cooney and Altieri work their hermetic arts, and as you inch your way around the narrow ledge, hugging the rock like a lover, you pause to catch your breath, the mists below slowly clear, and there it is! I think Hilton would have been honored, and enchanted. How can this book be out of print? To Ms. Cooney and Mr. Altieri, Thank you."},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","review":"Shangri La, that heaven on earth, is under attack. It's the 1960s, and the Chinese army is at the height of its ideological zeal for the Cultural Revolution. Originally, that army was marching against native Tibetan culture, in an attempt at forced assimilation of the disputed territory. Legend, then clues to that edenic valley begin to emerge, and then ...I won't spoil the story. One family leads the hunt for Shangri La: a corrupt General Zhang, a son burning with missionary zeal for the revolution, and a daughter with quiet doubts about the party. A character from Hilton's original story learns of the threat, and leaves Shangri La to avert the threat. Leaving, of course, is a death sentence unless he returns soon enough, but the hero puts the safety of Shangri La ahead of his own.This post-hoc collaboration never really captured my imagination. The writing is good enough, except for an especially magical resolution to the threat. I don't see it as a sequel, so much as an unrelated story in the same setting. That could have been good, but the characters never enticed me. The plot was very plain, an intellectual dead end: things happen, they're resolved, and that's it. Nothing more to think about.Some people seem to this one - just not me.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","review":"I wouldn't consider this to be entirely a sequel to the original novel. It's more of a separate story that involves, briefly, characters and settings from the original novel. Maybe I just enjoyed Lost Horizon too much but I found Shangri-La to be a bit of a disappointment. The two different styles of writing get confusing at times, especially in the parts where no quotation marks are used to distinguish between different speakers. The flow of the story was very rigid also. Sure, there were words arranged into sentences and sentences into paragraphs, continuing on for pages, but there was nothing to draw me into the story. It was more like reading a newspaper than a novel in this respect. To top it all off, the ending seemed clich&eacute;d. Just because the original ends in a cliff hanger doesn't mean the sequel should also. It just didn't seem very original.Overall it was good to see that James Hilton's brilliant work of literature carried on into the future, but the original far overshadowed the sequel. Instead of providing closure, Shangri-La left me waiting for something the book didn't deliver."},{"Title":"Shangri-La: The Return to the World of Lost Horizon","review":"I'll agree with a couple of the other reviewers; this isn't so much a sequel as a book set in the world of Lost Horizon. \\"Messenger\\" (another book written in the world) seems more of a sequel than this does, and I would not even call it a sequel. Having said that, this is a pretty good read in my opinion. Yes, they took a few liberties perhaps, but it was worth the read for me. Who but someone who lives in Shangri-La would know what \\"hazards\\" may be around their home. I did like the storytelling in this one a bit better than in Lost Horizon, but that isn't a bad thing. I loved Lost Horizon. And I feel this does keep in the spirit of it, if not recapturing the wonder we felt when we read it. You can't really compare this to the original in fairness. I think it is a case of right place, right time. Lost Horizon found us when we needed to read it. This book you can read I think without knowing anything about what happened in the original. And it is a good story. It shows that any of us would try to protect our home in any way we could. There is nothing inherently good or evil about it; it just is a fact. Can any of us say we would not have done as Conway did given the circumstances? Would we not risk all to save all? I think those are questions to remember when reading this.Don't get me wrong, this didn't capture me the way Lost Horizon did. And the book was so much better than the movie (isn't it almost always the case?). But this book does draw you in, just not with the fervor of the original. The characters were at least believable in the context of when they \\"lived\\". I don't know; I think to an extent, this is like Lost Horizon in a respect. Either you get it or you don't. You need to be a little open-minded reading this one, or at least a little more open than when reading Lost Horizon.All in all, I enjoyed this. There was one or two times I was like \\"huh?\\" but even then it is only mildly outlandish. I would, however, have changed the ending slightly. I won't ruin it for those who haven't read it, but I don't think it works as it is. I would have changed it to where she got an invite and then ended it the way it does. For me, they tried to force the mystery a little too much. They could have, the way it's currently written, had her finish the journey and closed the story without leaving it so open.

Aldrich has a gift for conveying a sense of living history, combing colourful detail of this or that episode with the grand strategies that drove the intelligence men.Cal McCrystal in The Financial Times 1 July 2001 >What makes Aldrich's book so delightful is its abundance of marvellous anecdote ... Miles Copeland, the CIA's new station chief in Cairo at the time of the Suez crisis, had little time for US ambassadors and was a bit of a cowboy. As station chief in Syria in 1950 Copeland was blamed for a series of army coups that \\"eventually led to an increasingly pro-Soviet dictatorship\\". He was moved to Cairo after a wild party during which guns were fired through the ceiling. Indeed, an Aldrich sub-theme is the extent to which British and American secret agents frequently unnerved their own governments more than the regimes they were supposed to monitor subvert or liberate."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence","review":"Richard Aldrich is another British historian of intelligence who offers lots and lots of data, fact as well as myth, and adds his own opinions to sort of freshen the materiel. His 740-page The Hidden Hand is preceded by Stephen Dorrill's MI6 and several works by Christopher Andrew and some of Andrew's co-authors; he credits both Dorrill and Andrew for their support for his own project.Aldrich tries to debunk some of the myths that are carried from one U.K. published espionage history to another - none more prevalent than that Harold Adrian Philby's betrayals destroyed much of the MI6 and CIA/OPC covert and often fatal dispatching of East Bloc exiles to do political mischief in their homelands, such as driving Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha to history's ashheap. By Aldrich's brief light, Philby was too important a spy for the KGB to allow him to be much involved in secret shoot-'em-ups. While it is to his credit for not totally swallowing the British - and too often American - myth about Philby, he misses some important details that grew the Philby legend; did Burgess truly courier Philby's purloined top secret papers to KGB case officers in New York City?One overall element that bothered this writer is Aldrich's themantic approach. Too often a reader has to overuse the index to maintain one thread or another coherently. That is not to say the book is badly written, for it is not; rather it is merely inconvenient. In fact, there was little if any of the obvious mistakes that gatherers of huge volumes of factoids too often make. Finally, for this American, there is reason to credit Aldrich for his obviously huge amount of research effort. One must assume that he visited such backwater American presidential archives as the Truman Library at Independence, Missouri, and its even more isolated neighbor, the Eisenhower Library at Abilene, Kansas.With both the British and American governments moving to release ever more Cold War era documents, there seems a certainty that more volumes on the fascinating 1950s West-East faceoff will surely be turned out. One can only hope that the myths that make up the history of Cold War intelligence 60 years after its beginning will one day be debunked by an availablity of solid evidence rather than merely by an author's guesswork."},{"Title":"The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence","review":"As someone else said, well written, but I only mean the sentence structure in this case. The entire book goes back and forth on dates and people so much that there is no timeline structure, and therefore impossible to get a better understanding of the events after reading it than before. It reads more like a soap opera giving name after name with one anecdote after another but with no clear overall picture.Having so much jumbled information with such a heavy mixture of what I believe to be personal opinion \\"facts,\\" such as the opening chapters reliance on \\"sources\\" focusing almost entirely on how the English and Americans thought that the Russians were nothing more than animals, makes this a book that does not seem like a very reliable source of information.Personally, I prefer the historical books that have a well written timeline with a much less emotional focus, such as the Winston Churchill books on WW2 events or the XX system of 1939-45. They may have biases etc, but they are not mostly about trivial opinions and people in an unstructured timeline."},{"Title":"A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant","review":"This is a truly remarkable presentation of an unusual perspective of the history of philosophy, one that most writers are so conveniently ignorant of. Scharfstein proceeds under the premise that the accepted Western paradigm of reading the history of philosophy within the boundaries of a single tradition can simply be replaced by a comparative tripartite paradigm with an equal claim for authenticity. The effect is strikingly similar to changing lenses in a camera, from zoom to wide-angle: some features are inevitably lost, but so much more can now be seen. Contrary to what we usually find in the bulk of contemporary works in the history of philosophy, Scharfstein is ultimately concerned with understanding the all-too-human activity of philosophizing. As he so beautifully puts it, the philosopher can-or perhaps, should-be seen as an artist, whose medium is abstract thought. Here the historian and the philosopher converge, but in a way very different from the cases of Hegel or Heidegger, for example. Scharfstein shows how to engage in the history of philosophy without being parasitic on philosophy, on the one hand, but also without being overly manipulative, on the other. The book hovers, so to speak, over its subject-matter, posing historical and philosophical questions, and then trying to answer them in the author's own voice, with a kind of mixture of sympathetic attention and mature intellectual detachedness that is commonly reserved only to the expert anthropologist. This is clearly one of the most remarkable characteristics, and perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this book. Scharfstein's discussion is expansive yet rich, clear-headed, insightful and fully aware of the historian's responsibility for accuracy while never losing sight of the philosopher's quest for truth or of the artist's quest for creation. It is also written in the kind of beautiful prose that has become so rare in contemporary scholarly writing. I strongly believe that many instructors would find this book very useful in intro classes in philosophy as well as in the humanities in general. The neat and elegant summaries that Scharfstein produced for each philosopher he discusses are inevitably incomplete and cannot replace-nor were they ever meant to replace-a careful reading of the philosophical texts. But to the best of my knowledge, none of the available historical texts can do that particular trick. Those of you who are willing to overcome the academically entrenched philosophical xenophobia, and to admit Chuang-tzu, Nagarjuna, and Vasubandhu, among others, in their classes alongside with stalwart texts of the European tradition, would find that Scharfstein's history enhances and enriches any reading of these texts with a rewardingly broad philosophical and cultural context that may prompt fruitful discussions of that great human adventure called philosophy."},{"Title":"A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant","review":"This is a truly excellent work, and I want to defend it againstthe charge of leaving out African philosophy. One can truthfully say,without any disservice to the impressive achievements of African culture, that there is no distinctively African tradition in philosophy, just as there is no distinctively African tradition in chemistry. Philosophy is an art that developed in certain cultures and not others: the Chinese but not the Japanese; the Indians but not the Persians; the Greeks but not the Africans, the Romans, the Germans, or the Celts -- though those cultures that did not develop philosophy made other achievements in other areas. Even if the contention of _Black Athena_ were correct that &quot;western civilization has its roots in Africa&quot; (and that book has been pretty much discredited -- see _Black Athena Revisited_, though I think that book overstates its case in the opposite direction), it would not follow that Africans were responsible for philosophy any more than they were responsible for chemistry. The _Comparative History of World Philosophy_ focuses its attention where it belongs: on the three, and only three, cultures that developed philosophy. Every culture has world views, a wisdom tradition, etc., but philosophy is more than that; it is a specific art of argumentation that emerged in specific places in history.

I do not want to raise the bete noire of philosophical discussion here, that is, the authenticity of African philosophy. If there is any philosophy at all, there must be African philosophy; and if there is a text on world philosophy, that text must contain a section on African Philosophy.

While it does cover a larger range of topics, the nomenclature and variable usage may be different than what some people are used to. That's not so much of a problem in itself. One is expected to encounter such variation between books or disciplines as they progress through education and different professional environments.What is a problem is the fact that, on average, every problem set has at least one giant error. Most of these are show-stopping errors involving omitted information, incorrect markup or symbols (10 &#8800; 10 &#937;) or incorrect or unfounded assumptions made by the solution (the first problem set assumes that a dependent voltage source is a current source instead). Assuming only one such error per problem set, that would imply an approximate 20% of the problems in this book are messed up and will result in confusion and time wasted. Maybe you'll learn something by proving yourself right, but i hardly consider that a product feature.The sample exam is heavy with ridiculously ambiguous problem statements, incorrect answers, and the general lack of editing and proper notation (and lack of requisite parentheses) that makes the review sections so incredibly frustrating.Nobody needs to pay hundreds of dollars to learn to doubt themselves when they are correct.

Complementing and complicating the established American mythos surrounding founding documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, Gustafson explores the dynamic and dialectic of what she terms the 'performance semiotic' and its impact on American culture from its earliest figurations to the present day. Gustafson defines the performance semiotic as the historical interplay between speech and text, which 'performs social conflict,' setting the stage for a broader notion of cultural interplay between racial and gendered identities, and between religious and political sensibilities. Utilizing a broad spectrum of theoretical frameworks, Gustafson incorporates models of gender performativity, critical race studies, and generous historical contexts to situate her reevaluation of American history.\\"Eloquence Is Power\\" cleverly constructs its arguments in the framework of the performance semiotic: each chapter focuses centrally on two, sometimes three key figures at a particular historical moment who enact the struggle for linguistic primacy and social control through, and increasingly, in the mutual involvement of orature and literature. Eschewing the popular teleological view of a cultural progression from \`savage' speech to 'civilized' writing, Gustafson claims that not only are the two insistently linked throughout the history of early America, but that each develops with notable contributions from Euro-American, Native American, and African-American, and sources. The central question of the book concerns power relations and their respective derivations. In the religious and political realms that provide consistent loci of cultural tension for Gustafson, inspiration and textual precedent are both at odds and variously incorporated in disputes over who has legitimate authority.Beginning with the friction between Anglicanism (text-centered) and Puritanism (speech-centered) and their early efforts at conversion of the Native Americans, Gustafson shows how the supposed universality of the prepared text and the supposed appeal to the individual from extempore speech form a paradigmatic conflict that is repeated throughout American history. The following chapters detail the ways in which gendered and racialized modes of access to divine and scriptural authority provisionally threaten, but are tenuously contained by public displays of white male power. Publicly enacted debates over the relevance of feminine piety to religious communities ensue in the interstices of the ongoing performance semiotic between the arenas of speech and text.In her account of Euro-American encounters with racial others, Gustafson discusses the appropriation of 'savage' performances in the religious conversion of Native and African-American populations. Aspects of these include the gesticular performances, and ritual qualities of both Native and African religious ceremony, manifesting itself as mimicry with a difference in the mobility and adaptability, and even linguistic translations of Euro-American itinerant preachers and missionaries. Of course, the mimicry with a difference is primarily attributed to 'Othered' American subjects, as shown in Gustafson's discussions of the careers of Samson Occom and John Marrant, who incorporate Euro-American evangelical styles hybridized with Native custom to serve and alter the interests of Euro-American Christianity. Gustafson clearly delineates the methods by which colonial authority maintains a cautious relationship toward the potential ascendancy and potential threat posed by the exploited Native, the enslaved African, and the suppressed woman.Turning to the American revolutionary moment, The mixing of oratorical and textual modes troubles and defies any teleological notion of American national development through the spread of print media alone. The two, for Gustafson, are mutually-sustaining, continually challenging and reinforcing each other. The primacy of the body as semantic vessel returns in the pre-revolutionary period as the Boston Massacre furnishes revolutionary orators, writers, and engravers with an occasion to exercise their eloquence against insupportable English forms of tyrannical control. Deftly, the argument shows how public sentiment in the years following the Boston Massacre and the tradition of annual oratorical remembrances elide the initial identification of racial scapegoats, turning all of the American casualties into martyrs in the struggle for American independence. In the aftermath of independence, Gustafson shows how nothing was cleanly resolved by either the Declaration or the Constitution, as public debate raged in the form of party politics concerning the appropriate form that the new American government should take, as well as in an examination of George Washington's presidency and beyond.Gustafson's \\"Eloquence is Power\\" is a fascinating reassessment of early American history at the intersections of literature and orature. In recuperating the influence of women and ethnic minorities on the formation of the American public sphere, Gustafson offers an inclusive and important study. Professor Gustafson's prose is lucid and devoid of academic jargon, making her arguments easy to understand and follow throughout the book. \\"Eloquence is Power\\" is a book that is informative, accessible, and enjoyable."},{"Title":"After the Clockwork Universe","review":"If the modern world seems confusing read this book.

Sally Goerner's thesis is that we are undergoing the biggest social transformation since at least the middle ages and probably since the beginning of known history. The driving force behind the transition from medieval to modern was the development of a new mathematics, physics and astronomy which fundamentally changed how people saw the place of man in the cosmos. These intelectual tools eventually led to the development of the industrial society in which we now live. In the past 30 years there has been similarly powerful new developments in mathematics and all other sciences which Sally calls web dynamics. You may have heard of chaos theory which is one aspect of a much larger way of understanding complex systems which develop out of the operation of many forces. This new understanding is changing the old competitive, isolated, reductionist and individualistic social structures in favor of an understanding of the world based on complex, self-organizing systems which evolve cooperatively as well as competitively. It has implications for every aspect of social, poilitcal and intellectual life from physics and biology to medicine and education.

In the past 30 years there has been similarly powerful new developments in mathematics and all other sciences which Sally calls web dynamics. You may have heard of chaos theory which is one aspect of a much larger way of understanding complex systems which develop out of the operation of many forces. This new understanding is changing the old competitive, isolated, reductionist and individualistic social structures in favor of an understanding of the world based on complex, self-organizing systems which evolve cooperatively as well as competitively. It has implications for every aspect of social, poilitcal and intellectual life from physics and biology to medicine and education. This book helps us see the much larger patterns which are often obscured in the choas of world affairs and gives some hope and direction for making a positive difference in the outcome."},{"Title":"After the Clockwork Universe","review":"This is an astonishing and truly revolutionary book.Dr. Goerner builds a practical picture of the transformation that we must choose to take if we are to flourish or even survive. Her basic concept begins with the now familiar concept that civilizations undergo periodic \\"Big Changes,\\" that involve changes in the way that they view the world. Not just how the intellectual elite sees things, but rather the general population. She thinks, and I am sure that she is correct, that we are on the cusp of one of these \\"Big Changes,\\" which will involve the replacement of the Newtownian (\\"Clockwork\\") view of the universe, with a \\"Web\\" view, that sees the universe as a series of intricate interconnections. This \\"Web thinking\\" has been around for a while, but has so far not really taken root, because it has not always been expressed very clearly, many people have failed to see it's relevance to everyday life and it was not linked to any deeply felt, motivating vision.This book is an important step in rectifying those previous failings. She introduces a helpful term: \\"Intricacy,\\" which she defines as \\"the order which arises from interweaving.\\"My only disagreement is with her use of the word \\"Energy,\\" of systems, when I think it would be more accurate to use the term \\"Information.\\"Highly recommended."},{"Title":"After the Clockwork Universe","review":"Long before Korten began writing about 'the Great Transition,' Goerner wrote this beautiful, eloquent, and sweeping study of what she described as the emergence of the Integral Society. Unfortunately, this book was published in britain (american publisher's didn't take it) and has not gotten the circulation it richly deserves. While there are many other books out there looking at this Transition (including Hawken) and it is almost common knowledge in many circles, I still recommend this book because of its theory of social and cultural changes. Unlike Korten, who sees this current epoch as going back 5000 years, she accurately looks at the multiple shifts in world view in the West and how those have taken place in the past 2000 years, and demonstrates the integration, complexification and evolution of these ideas. She also presents a concise yet thorough understanding of systems theory, science of complexity and interdependence, chaos, biological changes, and 'new' scientific world views, etc. Alas, her last few chapters make several statements that are questionable, and it is difficult, without being an expert in the field, to really know how much weight to give her social predictions."},{"Title":"After the Clockwork Universe","review":"Ms. Goerner has managed to integrate the disparate cultural, scientific and intellectual trends of the late 20th Century into a cohesive and comprehensible whole.

The story centers around Little Rabbit who is having a birthday. As a special treat mommy and daddy rabbit pack up the family and take them to the Rabbit World amusemant park. Little Rabbit is very excited to go but his happiness turns to disappointment as he learns that he is too little to go on some of the rides that he wants. In his frustration he rushes ahead and gets seperated from the family. Once he is lost he realizes that he is not the big rabbit he thought he was. Of course Little Rabbit's mommy finds him and the book ends on a happy note as the family celebrates Little Rabbits birthday with a picnic and cake. This book really struck a chord with me because like Little Rabbits mommy I see my three year old daughter daily experience frustrations about being too little to do something. My daughters favorite expression to use is babies need help and big girls don't need help. She always says this to me whenever I try to assist her with one of her struggles. It is a constant challenge to make her realize that it is okay to accept help. Before I had a child I never realized how determined nad independent preschoolers can be. Both my daughter and I love to read this book together. The illustrations are so adorable. We especially love going over all of the rides at Rabbit World. I highly recommend this book to all parents of preschoolers."},{"Title":"Little Rabbit Lost","review":"My 3 year old loved this book and wanted it every night. She identified with the little rabbit growing up and wanting to be independent, and of course the happy ending at the end. The pictures are very detailed and she loved to point out little details like the mice houses at the tree base and the giant mushrooms."},{"Title":"Little Rabbit Lost","review":"Little Rabbit couldn't be happier that his birthday is finally here, and it's a bigger birthday than ever for him, as he is no longer little, but a big rabbit now. Little Rabbit quickly opens his gifts, and is quite satisfied with them, especially with the big red balloon, and the tickets for his whole family to visit the theme park Rabbit World. However, Little Rabbit is nothing but frustrated at Rabbit World, for he is unable to go on the jungle gym or roller coasters due to his small size. Soon Little Rabbit has wandered away from his family to take a peek at the other rides that Rabbit World has to offer, and realizes that he is lost, and suddenly sees that he's not as grown-up as he originally thought he was.It is a known fact that young children always want to feel grown-up, which is why Harry Horse's LITTLE RABBIT LOST is the absolute perfect addition to a home with young children, male or female, as it teaches them the lesson that wandering away from their parents, or elders, will quickly get them in a bind. The short amount of words on each page of LITTLE RABBIT LOST is perfect for children with short attention spans, and the illustrations will quickly have them wanting to know more about Little Rabbit. This is an adorable book for all.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Little Rabbit Lost","review":"The \\"Little Rabbit\\" series of books are wonderful for preschoolers and early readers. The illustrations are gorgeous and detailed, the text is simple and easy to read, perfect for early readers and also for reading aloud.In this book, Little Rabbit celebrates his birthday with his family - they all take a trip to Rabbit World, a huge amusement park. Little Rabbit exhibits the typical characteristic of a little child who is getting older - fierce independence! He goes about on his own, refusing to listen to his parents' advice to stay close in case he gets lost, and lo and behold, that is exactly what happens to him!There is a good lesson to be learnt in this story - little ones will learn caution and the importance of listening to their elders and paying attention.

I found it fascinating. I lived in the UK and was a member of a real \\"happy clappy\\" Christian group, but I couldn't figure out which church her family was a part of....maybe Plymouth Brethren. Very strict, anyway.I really appreciated Tova's honesty, and her articulation of that most apalling feature of Christian Fundimentalism: the \\"God is a work in me-frozen smile\\", while you really want to cry.I also think it is amazing that her husband, a former Episcopalian became a hasidic Jew. I wanted to know more about his journey too. I often think about these people and I hope they are well. I was very encouraged by this book. I am not orthodox, but I spent too many years in Fundimentalism."},{"Title":"Playing with fire: One woman's remarkable odyssey","review":"Tova Mordechai goes into great and interesting detail about her life before her return to her Jewish roots, and then about her struggle to eventually find herself at home in the Jewish world. The book left me wondering whether she ever compared the Christianity as interpreted by her particularlly strict church with the Christianity as it is expressed in other, more tolerant denominations -- seems like she blames on Christianity a lot of the sins of men claiming to be Christians, but conducting themselves in a decidedly un-Christian manner. Also, while it is clear that Judaism &quot;fits&quot; her, she doesn't really explain why; she seem to account for it by the fact that she has Jewish blood in her veins drawing her in a mysterious way toward Judaism, rather than by any particular idea or principal of Judaism that was more attractive or &quot;true&quot; than its counterpart in Christianity. This is a very interesting book with which someone raised as an &quot;strictly observant Christian&quot; can identify so easily."},{"Title":"Playing with fire: One woman's remarkable odyssey","review":"Well written story, in which the power of searching for truth emerges.

I thought it was interesting with the recent hub-bub about JFK's back problems that this was mentioned in this book, a couple of years before that recent story. Perhaps the authors knew a thing or two about things that happened. If you would like to know a little more about the Cuban Revolution and Castro's rise to power, but want to learn in an interesting and delightful fictional story, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Creating the High Performance Team","review":"A High Performance Team. We all want one or want to be a part of one. This book tells you how to develop one. It begins by developing a Mission Statement and Vision Statement, discusses how to communicate the goals and objectives, and then discusses techniques for achieving the necessary buy-in from the team.I am a mid-level manager. I recently joined a young telecom company and set about interviewing and hiring staff and coalescing them into a Team. This book helped refresh the process of developing and communicating &quot;management vision.&quot;For a mature manager - a dozen years experience of managing 12 to 40 people - this is a good refresher. For a younger manager recently promoted or just getting started, this is a must.This book should be coupled with Winning Management by Wolf J. Rinke."},{"Title":"Creating the High Performance Team","review":"I read this book from front to back and found it a very good read. No doubt I will get even more out of it when I look at it again. The authors propose a holistic approach to the creation, development and nuture of high performance teams through participatory management.

She stated that a person might enjoy a visit to the South \\"superficially\\", but one must \\"shut one's eyes\\" to the conditions of the Southern Negro.In this small book (about 60 pages), author W. E. Debnam answers Mrs. Roosevelt with a thoughtful and detailed analysis of the problems of the South, the roots of these problems, and a Southern perspective of the current situation (in 1950). It's a very readable book, lots of interesting facts, a dash of humor, and more than a dash of editorializing. This book would be of interest to the history scholar, and to Southerners both Black and White."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long time when I finally picked it up off my TBR shelves. I don't know what made me wait so long, because I had heard so many good things about the book, and it was a 2006 Alex Award Winner (there are some fabulous books on the Alex Award lists). Well, I'm glad I finally got around to Jesus Land, because it was a darn good memoir and I'm glad I gave myself the chance to read and enjoy it.This book isn't the easiest to read. Julia and David had a harsh childhood - their parents were at worst physically and emotionally abusive and at best cold and unloving. Julia had to deal with her brother Jerome's sexual advances and molestation from a young age, and the two of them both had to deal with blatantly cruel racism in a time when David and Jerome were the only black people living in their town. Not only that, but their wealthy parents lived an incredibly frugal lifestyle, one that had them eating \\"garbage soup\\" on a weekly basis and wearing ratty hand-me-downs at an age when what you wear is more important than who you are.The book definitely held my interest throughout, but the early sections were somewhat less interesting to me than I expected the book to be. It was when Julia arrived at the reform school in the Dominican Republic that the book really got interesting. What they were subjectd to and how they were treated at that school was just incredibly sad. Jesus Land is a testament to how much a person can handle with the support of the one person in the world who loves her unconditionally. Some parts of this book will truly break your heart, some parts will make you laugh out loud, but most of all the book made me think of my own family and feel so grateful to have them. Because that's what this book really is about - Julia and David's relationship which, against all odds, flourished in this crazy reform school environment.The ending to this memoir took my breath away. What was hard about it for me is that I know this is a true story - to me, the ending was like something out of a novel, yet it was reality for Julia and David. And that knowledge was really difficult for me - the book completely changed for me once I got all the way through and read the ending. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop here, but I am curious about your thoughts if you've read this one - how did you feel about the ending, and did it influence the way you think of Julia's story having finished it?Anyway, I highly recommend Jesus Land. This would actually be a great book for those of you who dislike nonfiction, because it truly does have a novelish quality to it. Scheeres' writing is really great, and their story could just as easily have been fiction as fact (in a good way!). I definitely suggest giving this one a try."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I got this book for a buck at a used book store and have not been able to put it down. Scheeres' cool journalistic style adds to the brutality of the racism, sexism and arch hypocrisy that propel the plot and the narrative voice down a deep hole of psychological misery.It reminds me a lot of Scott Heim's \\"Mysterious Skin\\", another tale of lost childhood set in the heartland.If you read \\"Jesus Land\\", it will make most accounts of dysfunctional families and tortuous childhoods pale in comparison."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Get this book, very powerful story and the author takes you page by page with ease and you can not wait to read further."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I was hooked from the beginning and the read was quick and good.

I'm serious, I would adopt."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I bought this book because the title and cover jumped out at me. I did not regret my purchase. I couldn't put it down. The final chapter and epilogue had me sobbing. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia and David are inseparable twins but as they mature and the family moves to Southern Indian the two are pulled apart. This is mostly because Julia is white and David is adopted and black. This is just the first of many twists that takes us through \\"Jesus Land\\", Julia Scheeres, personal essay of growing up surrounded by Christian ideology and hypocrisy. In part one of the book, 16 year old Julia is forced is endure a number of pains in her life as she tries to adapt to a new school while trying to survive at a home where only Jesus' love is allowed. Written from the point of view of a 16 year old, Julia thinks she's helping the racial tension at school, brought forth by her brother's skin, by ignoring him. While at home Julia escapes her pain in the arms and bed of the dreamy next door neighbor kid, even though he once tried to rape her. There are other revelations that show both David and Julia had a hell on earth home life but it is a small comparison to the books second half where both kids are shipped off to the Caribbean and forced into a Christian boot camp/school. It is here where both Julia and David are mentally beaten each and every moment, best friends betray them, and each begins to fear that they may not leave even after they turn 18.Scheers attacks those that tried to attack her and her brother, her parents, her church, the camp, even herself in some ways. Her guilt about her brother is plain to see, even though there is little she really needs to feel guilty about. Scheers biggest target is fundamental faith. She points out how it's often abused by flawed people to over compensate for their own failings then forced upon the vulnerable.It's easy to wonder nowadays how much non-fiction is actually fiction. It's possible, resentment and youth clouded Scheers' memory, but Scheers sidesteps part of that problem by writing this books as 16 year old Julia might haven written it (it's also based on David's notes and diaries). So by the end of the book, you feel for Julia but your also annoyed by her, her poor decisions, and her poor sense of self. The result thus seems nothing less than a brutaly honest piece of work.In the end Julia and David do finally escape the camp, but not their lives and a short epilogue relives a very sad ending that ironically proves to be the seeds of \\"Jesus Land\\". It's easy to call this a blue state's book attacking red states values, but if you look a little deeper you'll see there's no political message, just a slight warning and a ray of hope to those who are young and helpless."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia Scheeres' memoir is a gripping account of a difficult childhood with brotherly love and hate set against a rural religious backdrop. The main weakness of the book is the one-sided picture that Scheeres paints of her parents and any other figure of authority. She gives little insight in why she is boozing, 'fornicating' or generally not getting along with her parents. I can understand that she was tremendously hurt, both by the loss of her brother as well as the abuse. But 15 years later one would expect a little more self-refection on Scheeres' own role in the problem. What would she have done differently if she were in her mother's shoes? Probably a lot, but the reader can only guess.The Kindle edition of this book is riddled with spelling and punctuation errors. I have never read a book with this many mistakes. It seems that the publisher entered the text using OCR, rather from the typeset source text.

Having also grown up in a Christian home (though not Fundamental) I was fully expecting to read about a nice, loving home for Julia and her adopted brother(s). I couldn't have been more wrong.She describes things so accurately; I recognized a lot of the terms she used, songs she sang and listened to, things that were said in church, etc. But for me, those things always meant \\"safety\\" -- unfortunately for her and David, it was the exact opposite.I'm sure that she is an incredibly strong person today... that which doesn't kill us makes us stronger. I admire her ability to put into words the things she went through, and also her honesty in her mixed feelings and questions about herself.I would recommend this book, but I did notice quite a few typos in the second half, which I thought was odd... the first half had none.Julia...

I happen to be from the same small town where the author grew up, and my parents knew her parents (in fact our fathers were both physicians and were in the same professional circles).

My heart goes out to Julia, and hope that writing this exceptional book has allowed her to have some healing. What a strong woman, with such a strong talent for the written word. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"You know, I could almost give this book five stars because I could NOT put it down. It's compulsively readable.Julia tells us about her unique childhood being raised by very strict Christian parents in the Midwest. Her parents have four children of their own, and they adopt two African American boys. One of the African American boys, David, is the same age as Julia, and this memoir relates their story of growing up together as siblings.Unfortunately, this tale is not a pretty one. Julia's parents are largely absent, in the case of the father, physically, and in the case of the mother, emotionally. Julia and David truly only have each other, and even their relationship is under a lot of stress as their parents treat them differently, and David struggles as one of the only African Americans at his school.This memoir is to some degree in the same vein as Mommy Dearest or Dave Pelzer's books. Not quite as graphic and horrible - - but definitely the situation is not good, and you feel Julia's pain throughout the story. The parents really seem to have NO redeeming qualities whatsoever . . .so I didn't find it quite as strong as The Glass Castle where the writing really goes so far beyond a mere characterization and really develops the family dynamics.Nonetheless, Jesus Land is pretty gripping. You want so badly for things to take a turn for the better for these two children. Unfortunately, things by and large get grimmer and grimmer . . .but underneath all the pain, Julia and David's love and loyalty to one another takes center stage and makes the book more than a parent bashing session. For those of you who do not like much in the way of sexual content, it should be noted that there is some here. Not unduly graphic and not gratuitous - - but it's there."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I will not summarize this book as others have done it so beautifully before me. Suffice it to say, this book broke my heart and I was unable to even write a review for several days after finishing it as I was mulling it over in my mind. Julia Scheeres told her story without anger or bitterness which, to me, is astonishing and it appears that she still has a relationship with her family after all that they did to her and her adopted brothers. I believe, as another reviewer does, that Escuela Caribe reform school should be investigated then closed so that other children are not subjected to abuse at the hands of these people. I am happy to see that Julia emerged from this horrifying childhood with her mental faculties intact and has done so much with her life. The book is a tribute to her love for her adopted brother, David, which is what ultimately kept her alive and sane. I highly recommend this book and will recommend it to my reading group."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Crying, crying, crying...for Julia...for David...for all the kids in the world who are mistreated, hurt, neglected, and unloved.

Julia, inspired after finding David's notebook detailing stories from their childhood, wrote the memoir that he was no longer able to. I read this in 12 hours (minus a few hours to sleep...) and could not stop until I knew the rest of the story.

Use it wisely.\\""},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The book \\"Jesus Land\\", I mean. I've seldom read a less joyous book. The only real joy to be found in these memoirs of an abysmal childhood is the moment of release, and that comes very near the end of the book. This is a story of physical and emotional abuse, inflicted upon the girl Julia by her own parents and upon the boy David, her 'colored' brother-by adoption. It's not quite a story of survival; obviously Julia will be 'in recovery' all her life and David's recovery is to be cut short at age twenty by a car accident. In fact, the only trace of human value in this story is the abiding loyalty and love between the two victims, Julia and David. And it's sad to think that the people who should read this memoir - not for enjoyment but for epiphany - will almost certainly avoid it at all cost; it ought to be read and discussed by every public school PTA and every adult bible study group in America. Whether the tale is entirely factual, or embellished for literary purposes, or utterly fabricated, I can testify, based on my own adolescence as a 'trailer-trash kid' in rural America, that it's within plausibility. I don't want to endorse it any further. You, dear reader, are wise enough to read reviews so I presume you are smart enough to draw your own conclusions.Julia's Mother, as portrayed, loves her Saviour far more than she loves any of her three natural children or her two adopted African-American sons. That is, of course, a choice sanctioned by her Dutch calvinist theology, demanded of her by Jesus's own injunctions in the Bible. She also loves her dog more than her daughter, as she screams hysterically when the dog is run over; that choice is not Biblically sanctioned. It would be better if Mother were simply a hypocrite, but she isn't; she's an obdurate believer, and her religion is the core of her life and the governor of her behavior. Unfortunately, she's a loveless, smug, rigid, cruel monstrosity, so hateful that if there were any possibility of such a person being among the Elect, the whole idea of Heaven would be discredited.Julia's Father may well be a hypocrite, but his state of denial would be far too potent to let him know so. He's a successful man, a well-off surgeon, a workaholic, a man with huge 'anger-management' problems. His self-righteousness is unbounded. He takes some relief from his own sour depression by whipping his two adopted sons with his belt. Once he manages to break one of the boy's arm. When the colored boys are out of reach, his violence tilts toward Julia.But the worst of Julia's childhood isn't her parents' religious extremism but rather the incessant racism that she confronts along with David. The racist harassment and violence the two kids encounter in their small-town Indiana community is truly heart-breaking. Julia has another grief as well; she's a girl, she's \\"abused, confused, misused\\", even by one of her adoptive brothers, and she responds in self-destructive ways.At age sixteen, David is jettisoned by his pious parents into a Christian-operated reform school, Escuela Caribe. His God-loving Mother scrubs his room with bleach and declares that David is no longer part of the family, though the good Doctor continues to pay for his incarceration. Neither parent so much as tells David that he will never be welcomed back. Julia, however, has resources of rebelliousness; she manages to get sent to the same expensive Christian reformatory, where every detail of the program is excruciating and sadistic. If you've read or seen \\"Holes\\", you'll have an idea of Escuela Caribe. Otherwise, think Guantanamo with 'Salvation Radio' on the PA system 24/7. Disgusting as the treatment is, which Julia and David receive from the sincere Christian staff at Escuela Caribe, in a way it's less traumatic than what they'd already undergone in their home and home community.To me, it seems irrelevant to ask whether this book is well written. It's not an entertainment. It's an accusation, an expos&eacute;, and a plea for help. If Julia Scheeres's accusations are just, then a broad swath of self-satisfied Middle American culture is dysfunctional beyond redemption. Or should I capitalize?... beyond Redemption."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I could not put this book down! Although it was difficult to read at times and incredibly sad due to the abuse inflicted on kids by so-called \\"Christian\\" adults, its overwhelming message is of hope. If Julia can survive these horrid experiences with a sense of humor and the bond with her adopted black brother, then there is hope for all of us to move past bad things that happen and create the future we want.Great message for teenagers who hate their current lives for whatever reason.It is a wonderful tribute to the author's brother David, who truly touched my heart with his sweetness, survival skills, and desire for a loving family.Talking to Julia on the phone at our book club meeting made the experience of JESUS LAND even better... she is amazing!"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I've had some pretty good luck with books lately. I love reading (it's pretty much the only hobby I have these days), but I have to admit: I really really like only about 1 out of every five books I finish. Luckily, this summer I had a great run -- only one dud (Funny in Farsi: A Memoir of Growing Up Iranian in America): the others were all humdingers.And this was one of them.The thing is, I wasn't expecting it to be so good. At least no relatively. It came immediately on the heels of Jeanette Walls' masterfulThe Glass Castle: A Memoir, after which I pronounced that it was going to be a long, long time before I came across such a shattering memoir. Well, turns out \\"Jesus Land\\" is nearly as good.It's actually two books. The first covers what it was like for the author to grow up in the Midwest with an adopted black brother. The second part covers the time when her morbidly religious parents sent her to a kind of Christian boot camp in the Dominican Republic, the Escuela Caribe. As Sheeres has elsewhere described it, \\"a dumping ground for rich evangelicals to send their problem kids and be rid of them.\\"The book had kind of an odd effect on me: I kept wishing my parents had been sinister enough to send me down to the Escuela Caribe, as you got the feeling Julia Scheeres came away with a lot of strength, clarity, and humanity as a result of the experience. I'm almost jealous!There's something that troubled me about the book, though. As I wrote in an email to the author:\\"But perhaps the publication of \\"Jesus Land\\" and the concomitant exposure of the EC as a hell-hole has made it easier for them to be evil down there? What I mean is that some parents might not just want their kids to be \\"improved,\\" but simply hate their kids, want them to suffer, or want to get \\"revenge\\" on their kids for whatever reason. Knowing that their children will assuredly suffer down there might actually be a selling point for some parents, swelling the applications and even allowing the EC to increase tuition! By this reasoning, your efforts may actually be helping evil parents to vicariously abuse their children in a more satisfying way.\\"The reason I started musing on this was that during your book you talked invariably about how the parents didn't know where they were sending their kids and that they should have done research, that the kids were prevented from writing about what the place was like, etc. But now that the truth is \\"out there,\\" perhaps it's merely changed the clientele: the only difference now is that most of the parents sending their kids down there are ones who are knowingly, malevolently looking for a hell-hole. By this reasoning, EC would have no problem with your \\"exposure,\\" since it does nothing to hurt their business and even helps to cement it in a way.\\"After all, it's over 4 years since the publication of \\"Jesus Land,\\" and that place is still going strong. What are your thoughts on this line of reasoning? Do you know of any hardships you have caused the school as a result of your book?\\"Alas! Never got an answer."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia Scheeres has tremendous courage. She tells the story of a dysfunctional Christian family where image is everything, and love is basically absent. The parents use religion and morality as a \\"mental wall\\" to keep themselves from healing and learning lessons. This is a telling indictment on religion in America today. Faith should enlighten and guide individuals, especially parents, to learn new and often difficult lessons. Instead, faith was used by Scheeres' parents to stubbornly deny the truth of what was going on in their family: sexual abuse, child abuse and racism."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This true story is very compelling and frightening.

I hope more people decided to read it and pass it along to someone else, who has enjoyed it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This book is an uncommonly good book because it is an honest window into one white woman's world as she tries to \\"navigate her way around\\" the moral and racial jungle of obstacles of the \\"years of the Reagan culture wars.\\" But Julia Sheeres' honesty is good only as far as it goes, and at least in the mind of this reader, as a voice for her dead black brother David, it does not go very far at all.According to her stated goal, (one that seems to have evolved as the book progressed) the memoir was supposed to have been inspired by a notebook found in the twisted wreckage of a car that killed David, the younger of her two black brothers. Thus, in some weird twisted racist way, even though the book is about Julia, David turns out to be the \\"backhanded\\" protagonist that she \\"piggybacks\\" on to tell her own story. Her story is of what it is like to be the deflected target of, and the unintended victim of, racism as a result of being the white sister of two sibling black brothers. Don't get me wrong, this too is an important story, but this is not the one she set out as a goal to tell.Unfortunately, the moral of the story she told is not one that \\"seeks an end to the racism that she too endured,\\" but that advocates \\"never becoming the white sister with black siblings.\\"The problem with Julia speaking for David is that she doesn't quite know how to go about it? She fails to recognize that there is an impenetrable wall, a virtual societal barrier that makes it impossible to come up with a vocabulary that will allow her to get into David's subjectivity and thus to give his voice a sense of authenticity. As a result, David's voice never shows up in the narrative, except as a pathetic whining defense by his inept white sister. In the end he just becomes a convenient moral prop for Julia to tell us her own story, a tale of what it is like for a white girl to grow up in the heart of America's racist bible belt of Indiana with two black brothers.All we learn about David through Julia is that he is a weak, passive white wannabe, who not only wants to be loved by whites -- especially by his adopted white family - but also wants to be one of them. His only goal in life, according to the author's limited vision of black subjectivity, is to grow up in a normal \\"(white) family\\" and then to end up in Florida with her, his white sister. (C'mon now, really is there any black male alive who would think like that?) Since she is limited by the unwritten rules of racial thinking and cross-racial American discourse, the author seems to lack the knowledge to know where her ability to speak for David begins and where it ends, and thus where it becomes down right unrealistic, irritating and misleading.Paradoxically, and in the classical racist pathway left open for cross-racial expression, we learn a lot more about Jerome the darker black brother (and here we mean darker in more ways than just skin color) even though he only makes cameo appearances as the unpredictable black \\"black sheep\\" of the white family (and by extension of white society more generally). But, unlike David, Jerome is no one-dimensional caricature of some imagined generic ideal black human being. He comes fully alive with his own rules and his own humanity, however perverse they may be.Unlike David, Jerome kicks white butt and takes no prisoners, drinks, smokes dope, screws white girls, including his own adopted sister Julia, parties with them all, thumbs his nose at their religion, and then as soon as he knocks over all of the China in the China shop, like the bull he is, gets the hell out of Dodge, and does it several times. (Now, morality aside, that's a life worthy of living -- and just happens to be in the grand tradition of any good old red-blooded hell raising American male.)Jerome knows that this white Christian family's idea of adopting black kids is BS: a virtual societal scam and an existential death sentence for any blacks who manage to get trapped in it. And thus, Jerome goes about trying to make the world safe for Jerome. He does not get very far in this self-construction project though, as the racist American society has a hierarchy of traps set just for such black bastards like him, no matter that they may have grown up in a white family. He thus predictably ends up first in Reform School (like the others eventually do too), and then in prison for a six-year stint for B&E.; After that, the book does not tell us what happens to Jerome. (But I sure wanted to know?)On the other hand (and in the mean time), David, our erstwhile limp-wristed backhanded \\"white fashioned\\" black hero, is just another human pinball: always rolling downhill at the whims of the random whites that just happen to be in his path. He has no ideas, no independent thoughts, and just gets swept along with the current: from being savagely beaten without cause, to being spit on and kicked and mocked in school, to being forced to act like a monkey, to being sent to reform school just to get him out of the house, to being killed in a car crash after being release from a Christian Reform School (for which he was sent for committing the crime of \\"living in America while being black\\").When both brothers were repeatedly and savagely beaten like slaves in their uber Christian home by their (great) white father (with raised whelps on their backs and broken limbs from being beat up with a two by four), for the same infractions that got Julia a \\"timeout,\\" Julia had no words, either for why she escaped punishment, or, for why her black brothers were beat so savagely? She simply turned up the radio to avoid hearing the screaming. Likewise, when David was being harassed in school, kicked and spit on, on the school bus and incessantly called the \\"N-word\\" and worse, Julia had no words then either. David had no voice, no one to speak for him. Julia was more concerned with her own image as being called a \\"N-word lover.\\" She either remained mute about the unfairness and violence expressed towards David, or \\"distanced\\" herself from him altogether. Her reasoning was, that after all there was more to being a white girl than just having black brothers: She had to have a life too. And it is difficult to disagree with her logic, or not to sympathize with her, but then she should have told us this up front: that this was a book about her, and not lead us into believing that it was about her black brother: the \\"lovely, lovable, but impotent, David.\\"So, I think that one has to give up on the idea of Julia being a voice for either of her black brothers. For even though she was closer to them than her parents, it was nevertheless true, that like them, she too did not have a clue about their subjectivity. Thus, throughout the narrative she proved quite incapable of piercing the psychological barrier, the \\"racial iron curtain.\\" And just like the rest of America, none of the Scheeres' really wanted to know what was going on behind the racist screen, behind that racial iron curtain -- inside the minds of their black brothers. Better to allow the unwritten rules of white society to play its usual role and speak for them.As far as the rest of the book goes there is a great deal of honesty to be had. And behind it lays another gruesome reality hovering in the subtext: It is that life in a fundamentalist Christian family is just an empty shell, a mere rehearsal for the main event, the afterlife. For in this life, there is really no life there. Their religion thus is just a secular ideological shell for \\"going through the motions of this life.\\" It is a cruel, mindless, sexist, racist fear-based pretext for a temporary existence on earth: an empty way to \\"go through the motions of \\"having a real life\\" while constantly making claims on God and patting oneself on the back for being pious and godlike. But the truth is that religion like that practiced by the Scheeres family, is little more than a fear based ideology and thus is everything but, godlike.Somehow, through the narrative presented here, one gets the impression that Christians of the Scheeres ilk cannot avoid knowing that fear of death and fear of being out of control sexually is their only religious ground truth. Unknowingly to them, their religion is nothing more than a fantasy, a theoretical idea, an ideal to be \\"faked\\" in order to insinuate oneself into the imagined everlasting afterlife, but in all of this fantasy, there is not much room left for living in this life. The highest form of God in this life for these Indiana bible thumpers, lies in the subconscious parameters that hang down from the dictates of American society: that is, in the hidden dimensions of racism, violence, and fear of losing sexual control. These are the true totems of religion that lurk in the background as the Scheeres' pray, sing, eat, and carry out their race-based brutality and child abuse in the name of their God.After they discovered that there were no white babies available and after considerable arm-twisting by the adoption agency reps, the Scheeres sense of Christian charity finally \\"kicked in.\\" They talked themselves into believing that it was their Christian duty to adopt not just one, but two black babies. And then almost immediately, they began preparing the ground to make them into not good Christians, but into good N-words that the white Christians would like and accept. However their greatest fear was that they might grow up just as Jerome did, to have a black mind of his own. Beating them did not seem to help, and love unfortunately in this instance was not a Christian option. Therefore all that was left was to beat the N-word out of them both. And while Julia's parents did not consider themselves to be backwater bigots, they somehow nevertheless managed to turn their own home into a local home grown version of the \\"White Man's Burden.\\" Their job as they saw it was as \\"white masters,\\" guided by scriptures, to literally beat white civilization into the heads of their two adopted black boys. As Julia described it, Jerome and David became her parents' own failed mission to Africa. The black brothers, even within the family were always the outsiders, Sartre's proverbial \\"other,\\" the basement dwellers. Julia realized that there was no way there could be any love in that family. But it was not the brutal treatment of her black brothers that led her to this conclusion it was when her mother cried for the first time at the death of their dog. And when he died, she referred to it as her baby. That is why, when given the choice, Julia chose Reform School over returning to her parents' home. There simply was no love in that household, Christian or otherwise.There was a lot of reading of scriptures, kneeling for prayers, listening to religious hymns, and going to church, between beatings, but little \\"real\\" life\\" in the Scheeres' household. They ran a tight Christian ship. Real life for the Christian fundamentalist appears to have been a kind of totalitarian regimentation that avoids temptation by outlawing it by theological decree. In doing so, there is no room left for a life. And as quiet as it is kept, their tyrannical religious practices would make even the worse Communist Totalitarianism seem like a Sunday School pjcnic: Everything that is not prohibited in their Christian world is mandatory. There is no such thing as freedom -- that is, not until the Rapture and pearly gates are opened wide for those saved. In fact, the Christian Reform School where Julia and her brothers eventually landed was little more than a \\"miniature Communist style gulag, or child labor work camp.\\" It too was just another metaphor for religious hypocrisy wrapped in a cloak of institutional cruelty and piety.In the end, the Scheeres family did not disintegrate, it just \\"peeled off\\" the malignant layers: the black part and the black sympathizing part. When Julia and the black boys left: all was again right with the world. Of course, they will never read this book.Thus the ultimate truth of the book is that the author knows hypocrisy when she sees it, and struggled mightily to tell her version of the truth. She did this even when she chose not to acknowledge it, or even when she tried to acknowledge it but lacked the psychological depth or the vocabulary to express it. And for a white American woman steeped in a racist culture, that is already quite a lot. I wanted more but I am willing to accept the fact that Julia Scheeres' book is a healthy first step, a start down the long road to telling the truth about the defects inherent in our culture, and thus this fine work is a large step towards racial healing. This woman wanted to tell it like it was, but there was no cultural vocabulary to go beyond where this book could take us. But for making a gallant try this book gets five stars."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Oh. My. Goodness! Julia writes this honest memoir of her Christian childhood. However, the Christian family is nothing but a facade to impress the members of the local Calvinist church. Julia's mom is obsessed with missionaries and constantly plays Christian music. Her eyes is like those of a hawk, always watching the kids...and spying with the intercom as well.Julia's surgeon father is worse. He's the one that beats Julia's adopted Black father with 2x4's until they're covered with welts or get broken bones. Julia feels guilty but cannot do anything. So, instead, she turns to alcohol and sex.While I've never suffered physical abuse, I was familiar with many aspects of Christian living. Such are constant Christian music playing, Christian adages, Scripture throwing and memorizing, letter writing to missionaries, church attendance and many more. However, Julia didn't write the memoir about her perfect Christian childhood. She wrote about the dark horrors she and her brothers suffered through...in the name of Christianity.And if that wasn't bad, things become worse when David and Julia are sent to the Dominican Republic to a Christian reform school. In an eerie way, it reminded me of a Bible college I once attended for a semester.Gut-wrenching. Appalling. Unbelieveable. Despite the horrors of Christianity's dark secrets and hypocrisy, Julia's memoirs was an interesting read. At the end is an interview with Julia."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This was one of those books that you just can't put down. I found Julia Scheeres memoir of her life disturbing and depressing but also truly engrossing. I felt awful for Julia and her brother David and the way that their parents treated them.

I was frightened by Julia's account of life at their reform school in the Dominican Republic and I just kept hoping that something would change for them. This book really stayed with me for a long time after reading it.After reading what I've written I realized that I make it sound like an awful book and I certainly don't mean to, it was a very good memoir, very well written and like I said before engrossing but also touching and very sad."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"the evidence of julia scheeres' realness is inviting and to the point where you can't believe that she is sharing so candidly..great read..great book..great author..great story..its true.."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This book focuses primarily on the author's high school years, and it's a rough read in places. At a young age, she had to navigate a lot of danger and a lot of adult irrationality. I think it's important that books like this are written, and the world would be a safer place if victims of every sort of abuse were willing or able to drag their story out into the light. Abusers love a \\"shameful\\" secret.That said, \\"Jesus Land\\" suffers from a few obvious problems that make me question how balanced the book is.First, almost every adult in the story is painted as either a cruel idiot, or just an idiot. It reminded me of the eighties film \\"The Breakfast Club\\", where all of the kids were intelligent, nuanced and sincere, but the school principal was a one-dimensional, unthinking monster who needed to be defeated. It isn't just the adults, though - almost the entire adolescent population of Lafayette, Indiana in the early eighties were apparently idiot hicks, too.There is also very little concession to the reality that to everyone around her, she probably appeared to make consistently horrible and dangerous choices. If my teenage daughter was drinking Southern Comfort on a regular basis, tanking at school, and sneaking a guy that she didn't even particularly like into her bedroom every night to have sex, a few flags might go up. I don't believe that the right solution was to ship her to reform school in the Dominican Republic, but she was well on her way to being an alcoholic teenage mother with no education and a venereal disease. I can sort of empathize with her parents on this count, even if they were making some equally poor choices (with only half of the relevant information).Personally, I found some of her treatment of Christianity to be gratuitously and deliberately offensive here and there. It's her book, but that was my reaction, and I found it very distracting.Beyond all of that, I felt that the author sometimes confused immodesty with transparency. Consequently, we are treated to some rather weird details about her life and perceptions that contribute nothing to her story but made me want to scrub my brain with bleach. We all have those details, but few of us publish them. Decorum isn't all bad.I have actually been to Escuela Caribe (hence my interest in Scheeres' story) - not as a student, but as a visitor for several days. I'm completely aware of how glaringly superficial my glimpse of the school was in comparison with the harrowing experience of being held there for many months. I certainly do not doubt any particular aspect of her account, but a couple of things did come up for me:- The Dominican Republic is a poor nation suffering from third world living conditions. To an American teenager Escuela Caribe was no doubt a complete dump, but by Dominican standards, the facilities are quite nice. Maybe they were decidedly worse when she was there. The courtyard area described in the book is absolutely beautiful. There's a deep pit at the school that has to be manually emptied on occasion with buckets, and locals were paid to do just that when I was there. I've also stayed at a very nice, modern home in Santo Domingo, and they were throwing their used toilet paper into the waste basket next to the commode because the sewer systems are not very advanced, just like at the school. It's a different world.- For some kids who end up at Escuela Caribe, it is their last stop before they go over a cliff into continued drug abuse, prostitution, or crime. The reality is that for at least some people, the school has been successful. Whether or not the Christianity aspect is key in that, or the brute discipline is the reason, and whether or not those two things are even compatible in any way, is another discussion. But there is another side of the story, and I heard it myself from former students who were appreciative of the program and were in turn working there to help others. To my knowledge, the school is not completely without any accountability, however informal.The book just seemed lopsided in a way that made me maintain some critical remove. Overall, I appreciated the author's experiences and especially her resiliency, but I didn't see that she had gained any particular wisdom or insight. Maybe she views the book as more of an expos&eacute;."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Book arrived long before anticipated arrival date. Book is in better condition than described.

I too am angry. Angry at Julia for letting her brother be treated the way he was, and that she reunited with her family apparently readily if she went to Calif. with her mother to check out colleges. David's story breaks my heart, I will see him in heaven. Julia's story, on the other hand, just ticks me off. I'm probably not giving her a fair shake, but David's love for here was apparent and she was nearly as unworthy as the parents."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia Scheeres writes candidly, truthfully, and honestly about growing up in Indiana with two African American brothers who were adopted into a white family. She describes her mother's hypocrisy about serving God but not her family. Julia writes about her life as the blonde girl and her relationship with her brother, David, who was African American and adopted by the family. She describes in detail about the racism experience against her family especially her brothers.But Julia's life is also complicated by her parents' zealous religious values and determination that their children follow the way of the Lord. Julia's mother is a religious fanatic and zealous without apology. She is also abusive towards her own children and also doesn't display signs of love or affection.In reading this memoir, I began to understand Julia's point of view. She was driven to her behavior which landed her in a horrible concentration camp called Escuela Caribe or return to her parents' home. She chose the religious camp in the Dominican Republic because her brother, David, was already there and he couldn't warn her about it, escape or come home.Once there, Julia's memoir comes alive with horrifying details of abuse, punishment, and a discipline style that reminds me of Jesus Camp but much worse. Everybody can rat each other out and gain points to move to the next level.In conclusion, Julia has written a tribute to her beloved David, her brother. This book is about sibling relationships that became stronger even in the toughest of times. I would strongly recommend this book to anybody.I would have just recommended that she added pictures or maps of the Escuela Caribe to help understand the layout if possible or even a map of Indiana as well."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The writing is superb. Julia's story although difficult at times is ALWAYS engaging. The way she describes her relationship with her brother David is heartwarming. I could not put this book down. Most fascinating story I have read in years. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is a memoir of a little girl's family that adopted two little black boys. The story is disturbing about the hatred and racism that she encountered as well as her two brothers. People were cruel to black people in the late seventies and early eighties in these small little towns in the north as well as the south. This story is set in Illinois. The family was highly religious as the mother spent most of her extra time corresponding with missionaries and her father was a doctor. The father was abusive to the little boys while he was merciful to his girl. But when the boys left home, one ran away and the other was sent away, his angry and wrath turned on Julia. The book recounts the time that her and her brother David spent months at a Christian reform camp. The book was painful for me to read. People hate with gladness. There is a big difference between being a Christian in action and appearance and being a Christian in heart. This book makes you sad at how people treat one another, how Christians treat one another, and how love of one another is the strongest bond in life. This book is a page turner, in the sense of hoping for a better result, a happy ending. The book ends, but you are left to provide happiness in your own life. You will watch how you treat people, that is where the happiness is in the book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I found this book to be a very good read; however, I will warn - it is quite depressing.

Either way, it's an excellent book, and I am glad I read it!"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Immediately absorbing, Jesus Land is a tribute to the author's younger brother, David, her soul mate. She goes to great lengths to make sure he is safe, indeed she gives up her own freedom to look after him. It will cost her much more in the long run.At first I thought this family had to be poor. As the story unfolds, you see the children sitting down to a meal of the most awful boiled-down leftover crap you can imagine, flavored with a little beef. But then the author casually mentions her father is a surgeon. Immediately, the reader's perception changes. Why is the family eating slop? And aren't surgeons supposed to be smart, and not radical religious fanatics?This was quite a harrowing journey and throughout the book, Julia's bravery shines through. She does not spare herself, however. She is upfront and honest about her own insecurities regarding having black brothers. Kids at that age are trying so hard to fit in, still finding their way. She spends their early years ignoring him while Jerome, the older adopted black brother protects him. Except he can't protect them both from their father. The surgeon has a sadistic streak.Strong and intimidating, Jerome violates a deep trust and places himself beyond redemption. Unspeakable things occur. Racial revenge? The reader finds himself engaged in a whole new set of philosophical and familial riddles.And Julia stays huddled over vulnerable David, doing her best to protect him.I don't want to give any of this book away. It just has to be read. It is a suspenseful account of a family subtly and then violently torn apart. But Julia's honesty and courage brings redemption in the end.Great read."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I liked this book a lot.

Certainly a worthy read but not a happy book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Great read with an unexpected ending.This memoir focuses on two siblings, Julia and David, who become family through adoption. Their parents are christian fanatics and instead of providing their kids with a loving home, they offer beatings and a religious boot camp.This book will have you question religion, race and humanity all at the same time. Don't pass this up!"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read. After finishing it, I wanted to start it all over again. From the very beginning, you feel this heaviness- this sadness- over the whole story like a thick winter fog. Julia Scheeres' sort of dry, matter-of-fact telling of her childhood with her adopted black brother makes you think she might not care all that much about his predicament in the home of Julia and her fundamentalist Christian parents, but she does care, more than anyone knows. Her brother David is such a sad, sad character it makes my heart ache just thinking about him. He had such a sweet soul, and all he wanted was to be loved in a family (sounds trite, but it wasn't). Another brother is a bit player, and even though he impacted Julia's life in reviling ways, it's David who leaves his mark on her heart. The mother character belies the true nature of her persona. She may think she's a wonderfully giving Christian person, but she's just an evil witch. The book is not capricious like Running With Scissors, nor does it evoke images of grungy little Dickensian children like in The Glass Castle. It just plainly states what happened in a seemingly \\"normal\\" (on the outside) family, but what not so subtle influences can destroy the hearts and minds of young people. Jesus Land touches on so many issues: Christianity; prejudice; teen angst; bad parenting; and the list goes on. This book definitely lays out full bore for us what our lives really are- a complex juxtaposition of many issues- even though it may want to be about living in a fundamentalist Christian home or having an adopted brother, it won't let itself be just about one thing. The ending leaves you pervasively saddened and feeling exhausted by the inequities of life."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"this was a very powerful true story that changed me. i sobbed when it ended and recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I finished this book in 3 days and loved it!!! Ms. Scheeres is very good at telling her story; she puts you in the story. Julia's story is rather depressing but uplifting in that she survived it. That is the lesson I took away; sometimes people can survive anything. The story also illustrates the hypocrisy of fundamental Christianity; More and more I can see why no one is buying that stuff anymore. Buy the book and read it."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"There are times when Jesus Land veers into typical memoir territory like youthful alienation and early sexual experiences, but Julia Scheeres is far too good of a writer to let those elements balloon into overarching themes. She sticks to the unusual and even tragic aspects of her childhood and adolescence without ever sinking into self-pity. The title refers both to the area of the country in which she was raised - rural Indiana - and the strict religiosity of her parents, particularly her cold and strict mother. These parents, in a spirit of Christian charity later all but debunked by Julia's shrewd observations of familial relationships, adopted two African-American boys when Julia was a child. The one closer to her age, David, came first, and the two developed a close but at times volatile relationship tested by racism in school and the various struggles between their parents and siblings.The memoir takes us from 1980s Lafayette, Indiana and the vagaries of fitting in (made all the more difficult with the different-looking brother), to a religious school in the Dominican Republic, where David and Julia's bond coalesces into a life-affirming and heartbreakingly beautiful entity all its own. All along the journey of the book, Scheeres uses local details of weather and scenery to keep us anchored to the backdrop as well as the story. Her skill in doing so becomes obvious with the physical disparity between the book's two major settings. More importantly, however, the book is as close to pure storytelling I imagine a memoir could get; like a novelist, Scheeres lays out a frame of reference and consequently never loses the reader's apt attention. I never felt distracted by her voice or by her emotional response to what she went through as a teenager. She never veered into coldness, but she understood her mission: to tell her story, to make it readable, and to draw us into a world existing only between the covers of her book.[..]"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The writing is beautiful, the story is nearly too bizarre to be true (and therefore engaging as hell). It sucked me in and spit me out a different person. This one is going to stick with me for a long time."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia was able to write with a sense of humor and keep the book as light as possible despite her hear wrenching account of her childhood & adolescence. My heart ached for her little brother and the abuse he received not just from his own family but from his peers and teachers alike. It left me hungering to find out where her parents are now and what their thoughts are on the book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said in the numerous reviews from others, but I just wanted to give this book a 5 star rating. A very touching and eye-opening story, told from an interesting perspective, and well written. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I read this book several years ago and was absolutely put on a roller coaster of emotions. This story will grab hold of your heart and make you feel as if you are actually experiencing everything the author is writing about. I highly recommend this book. Loved the added web site bonus!"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Sixteen-year-old Julia Scheeres and her adopted brother David, just a few months younger, were long accustomed to depending upon one another. The two youngest children in a large family, Julia and David were by then the only ones left in the house -- and subjected to the full force of their mother's religious fanaticism and father's violence. Christian hymns were piped into their bedrooms via intercom at dawn; the same intercom system was used later in the day to eavesdrop on the children's conversations, lest they be thinking unholy thoughts. Dad, a surgeon who worked long hours at his private practice, was rarely home. But when he was, chances were good he would pull out his belt and drag one of his children to the barn for a beating over some small transgression, real or imagined. There was no room for explanation or discussion.Leaving the house provided no relief, either, as David was black -- the only non-white student in their Indiana high school. Because of her brother, Julia also suffered. She was often taunted and abused by her classmates right alongside him; but other times, the biggest anguish she faced was knowing that that she simply could not help him against all the world's bigots, could not follow him every step of his day and protect him from harm. And to expect their parents to intercede for them was simply out of the question.Shortly after Christmas during their junior year, things spiral so out of control that David and Julia find themselves sent to a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. While they expected things might be austere, they could never imagine such a place might truly exist in the 1980s, physically and emotionally abusing American teenagers in sadistic ways.Without a trace of self-pity, Scheeres relates her teenage journey through a personal hell, where all sorts of horrors were regularly inflicted in the name of Christianity. The irony, so plain to see, is bound to make readers begin to examine their own beliefs and everything they've learned and thought til now, regardless of faith or lack thereof.Scheeres is an excellent storyteller, and is guaranteed to pull readers into her life."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Harrowing! I got this book because I thought it would be amusing reading about how awful the Fundamentalists are. But instead I was really, really upset by how these kids were treated...couldn't get over it, had to go to the author's website afterwards to find out more. The writing is good, the awfulness nearly unremitting. I was in love with David from the first I read about him and stayed that way throughout. I want to thank the author for her candidness and heart.It would have been nice if the proofreader had known the proper usages of \\"lay\\" and \\"lie,\\" however."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The book \\"Jesus Land\\", I mean. I've seldom read a less joyous book. The only real joy to be found in these memoirs of an abysmal childhood is the moment of release, and that comes very near the end of the book. This is a story of physical and emotional abuse, inflicted upon the girl Julia by her own parents and upon the boy David, her 'colored' brother-by adoption. It's not quite a story of survival; obviously Julia will be 'in recovery' all her life and David's recovery is to be cut short at age twenty by a car accident. In fact, the only trace of human value in this story is the abiding loyalty and love between the two victims, Julia and David. And it's sad to think that the people who should read this memoir - not for enjoyment but for epiphany - will almost certainly avoid it at all cost; it ought to be read and discussed by every public school PTA and every adult bible study group in America. Whether the tale is entirely factual, or embellished for literary purposes, or utterly fabricated, I can testify, based on my own adolescence as a 'trailer-trash kid' in rural America, that it's within plausibility. I don't want to endorse it any further. You, dear reader, are wise enough to read reviews so I presume you are smart enough to draw your own conclusions.Julia's Mother, as portrayed, loves her Saviour far more than she loves any of her three natural children or her two adopted African-American sons. That is, of course, a choice sanctioned by her Dutch calvinist theology, demanded of her by Jesus's own injunctions in the Bible. She also loves her dog more than her daughter, as she screams hysterically when the dog is run over; that choice is not Biblically sanctioned. It would be better if Mother were simply a hypocrite, but she isn't; she's an obdurate believer, and her religion is the core of her life and the governor of her behavior. Unfortunately, she's a loveless, smug, rigid, cruel monstrosity, so hateful that if there were any possibility of such a person being among the Elect, the whole idea of Heaven would be discredited.Julia's Father may well be a hypocrite, but his state of denial would be far too potent to let him know so. He's a successful man, a well-off surgeon, a workaholic, a man with huge 'anger-management' problems. His self-righteousness is unbounded. He takes some relief from his own sour depression by whipping his two adopted sons with his belt. Once he manages to break one of the boy's arm. When the colored boys are out of reach, his violence tilts toward Julia.But the worst of Julia's childhood isn't her parents' religious extremism but rather the incessant racism that she confronts along with David. The racist harassment and violence the two kids encounter in their small-town Indiana community is truly heart-breaking. Julia has another grief as well; she's a girl, she's \\"abused, confused, misused\\", even by one of her adoptive brothers, and she responds in self-destructive ways.At age sixteen, David is jettisoned by his pious parents into a Christian-operated reform school, Escuela Caribe. His God-loving Mother scrubs his room with bleach and declares that David is no longer part of the family, though the good Doctor continues to pay for his incarceration. Neither parent so much as tells David that he will never be welcomed back. Julia, however, has resources of rebelliousness; she manages to get sent to the same expensive Christian reformatory, where every detail of the program is excruciating and sadistic. If you've read or seen \\"Holes\\", you'll have an idea of Escuela Caribe. Otherwise, think Guantanamo with 'Salvation Radio' on the PA system 24/7. Disgusting as the treatment is, which Julia and David receive from the sincere Christian staff at Escuela Caribe, in a way it's less traumatic than what they'd already undergone in their home and home community.To me, it seems irrelevant to ask whether this book is well written. It's not an entertainment. It's an accusation, an expos&eacute;, and a plea for help. If Julia Scheeres's accusations are just, then a broad swath of self-satisfied Middle American culture is dysfunctional beyond redemption. Or should I capitalize?... beyond Redemption."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I can say with complete and total honesty that it must have taken Julia tremendous amount of courage to write this book. How can I say that? I was also in the school in the Dominican Republic. The horrors, the abuse. It's real. Though I do not know her personally, I know her story from the school all too well. I'm proud that she has taken a stand and shed light on this horrible place."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I spent much more time reflecting on this book than it took to read it.First, it made mad. Really mad. I wanted to call the White House, the State Department, the Dominican Embassy, the governor of Indiana. I contemplated the 101st Airborne's helicopters flying in low over the hill and liberating the camp by force.After a while it occurred to me that Scheeres' experience was certainly one of many. How many other children are being abused? How many have been killed in these camps? Is this really different from Chinese or Soviet re-education camps? Does anyone listen to Jesus' words when they read them in the Bible?In the end, easy to miss that among all the hate, this is a story of the love between a girl and her brother. I rejoice that she escaped to California, got married, and had a baby! I don't think Julia Scheeres and her story will ever leave me."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I just finished Jesus Land. It is going to take some time for me to recover from this powerful book.Julia's views of racism, hypocrisy, control, and child abuse are both poignant and disturbing. It was enraging and difficult to read about how her so-called Jesus-loving parents beat both her black brothers in the garage, sparing her until much later.Her relationship with her adopted brother David is beautiful. It renews my faith in the power of human connection, blood-related or not.I finished this book in a couple of days. I left it at my doctor's office today, and had to drive to the bookstore to finish the last 2 chapters, because I was dying to know the outcome.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is a page-turning memoir that will stay with you long after the last words of the last pages are read. The author writes of her tragic childhood with unbelievably honest prose, resulting in a powerful memoir that leaves the reader speechless. This is a must-read story of family, race, religion, and the bonds of love that hold us all together."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"You will not be disappointed with this book; I was glued to it all weekend. I really admire Julia for her honesty and her courage to let the reader into her life. I can't begin to imagine how hard it was to write this memoir."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Jesus Land is Julia Scheeres' memoir of her childhood, with the main theme being her relationship with her adopted brother David. It has witty prose and graphic reality, leaving you with the haunting feeling that there are places in the world where things are terribly wrong.The majority of the book is set in mid-80's rural Indiana. Julia lives with her father, who is a doctor, her stay at home mother, and her adopted brother David, who happens to be black. There is another adopted brother, Jerome, who occasionally makes appearances. Julia's parents are devoutly religious, preferring mission trips and Bible studies over their children.This is not a feel good book. Julia's father, who is absent through most of the book, beats Jerome and David. Jerome rapes Julia, yet her relationship with her parents is so bad that she feels she cannot tell them. There are frequent encounters with racism, as most people at the time were not comfortable with siblings of different races. David and Julia are shipped off to the Dominican Republic to attend Escuela Caribe, a fundamentalist school outside of U.S. government control for a reason. There they encounter more physical and psychological abuse, often reduced to animals in the way they are treated.But there is plenty of good to take away from this book. It is essentially the story of the love between David and Julia. It is hard to imagine two siblings being closer, especially considering what they had to endure. They were the same age, and nearly inseparable. They were even able to develop a code of \\"sign language\\" between them during the times they couldn't speak to each other at Escuela Caribe. There is also the opportunity to learn what a home looks like when love is absent and religious rules and traditions are used instead.I strongly recommend this book, but it is highly graphic. Be prepared to be confronted with real life, unfiltered and without apologies."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia Scheeres' memoir has easily become one of my absolute favorites. The reader should be warned: this book is incredibly painful to read and will leave the reader feeling rancorous for the entire Midwest, every religious fanatic, and inevitabley Julia Scheeres, but above all else this beautifully chronicled story of the unbreakable bond between her and David, her brother and best friend, will be one of the most rewarding and life-affirming experiences ever."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This book reduced me to tears at several points, probably because of my several shared experiences with the author. Jesus Land is the well written story of growing up under an oppressive, twisted, and abusive form of religion in America's Heartland. It's the story about how religion can bring out the best and the worst in people -- although mostly the latter is drawn out of the characters in this book.Scheeres story takes her from the Hoosier State to the Dominican Republic with only one constant in her life: her beloved brother, David, her adopted black brother. Not only is this memoir about the effect abusive religion can have on a young psyche, it's about the bond that develops between two people who go through that experience together."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"\\"Jesus Land\\" by Julia Scheeres is one of those rare books that one can read in a day, given enough free time. It is lucidly written, engaging, and very troubling. Fans of memoirs/biographies will likely enjoy \\"Jesus Land,\\" though it reads like a novel, so fiction lovers will enjoy it as well.\\"Jesus Land\\" is about Julia growing up in her Christian fundamentalist household in Indiana in the 70s and 80s, and particularly about the relationship she had with her adopted African-American brother, David. The first part of the book focuses on Julia's experiences at home, and the second part on her harrowing stay at Escuela Caribe, a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic.David & Julia are the same age, and so begin high school together. Unfortunately, David is the subject of ceaseless racial taunting, and Julia must keep to herself during the school day to avoid being seen as \\"the black kid's sister.\\" Yet still, she is seen as an outsider. At home, things are no better. The Scheeres adopted another African-American, Jerome, since they thought that David \\"would want to play with someone of his own color.\\" Unfortunately, Jerome is highly aggressive, and gets into trouble frequently. The father of the family is abusive, and frequently beats David and Jerome, while Julia is simply scolded. This sets the 2 boys against the white sister. Jerome then begins sexually abusing Julia, perhaps as a way of getting back at the father. The mother is emotionally distant (if not hostile), and resents it whenever the children ask her for something beyond the minimum food, water, shelter, and church that she provides. At their hard-line Calvinist church, Lafayette Christian, they are told lots about sin and repentance, but very little about how to deal with the problems around them. So Julia deals with them in her own way- she siphons liquor and has sex with her new boyfriend, Scott. Eventually, she is caught and sent to Escuela Caribe.Escuela Caribe is one of the worst places a parent could send a teenager. Everyone there is ranked, from 0 to 5, and must rank up points in categories such as Being Truthful, Being a Helpful and Positive Influence, Respectful to Authority, etc., to move up on the rankings. Only when one reaches level 5 is it possible to go home. The \\"program\\" rewards tattling on other people. For example, if a student catches another student cussing, then informs the teachers, then the informing student will get points in the \\"Being a Helpful and Positive Influence\\" category, whereas the offending student will be docked in points. Students at the school experience all manner of abuse, and Julia is constantly woken in her sleep to the shrieks of girls with nightmares. Throughout all of this, her one constant is the relationship she has with her brother David. In one particularly touching passage, after David finally learns about Julia's abuse at the hands of Jerome, he slips her a note saying \\"I know what happened to you is not your fault.\\" In the end, despite all the hardships, Julia and David know that they have formed a bond that could not be broken.\\"Jesus Land\\" is fascinating in so many ways. It is fascinating in its exploration of racism and fundamentalism in the American heartland, the dynamics of a dysfunctional family, and how people can form bonds to overcome bigotry and dogmatism. David, who died in a car crash when he was only 20, was the inspiration for this memoir, and it shows. At the end of every chapter, in italics, there is a tale about David from childhood, giving the reader insight into the character. Despite the grim subject matter, this is not a bombastic, self-pitying memoir (like Jodee Blanco's \\"Please Stop Laughing At Me\\"). Scheeres never goads the reader into anger, sadness, or joy, but simply tells the story. And that's what makes it so powerful. I would highly recommend this book to anyone. (See my comment for some links)"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"What an amazing memoir this is. it is one of the best I have read in a long time. I was completely engaged and could not put this book down. Julia has a way of telling her story with such plain honesty that you can not believe she dares tell it.Her family upbringing, complete with abuse, fanatic religion, molestations and racism are truly horrific at times, but she tells her story with grace and objectivity- which keeps you turning the pages.Her adopted black brothers bring racism close to home, and her own loyalty to David, the brother closest to her, encourages conflict and trials continually.As troubles unfold, her parents ship her and her brother to a Christian reform school, and the antics there are nothing short of horrible, as well. After you read the book, don't cheat yourself of the goodies on her web page, with pictures and links to the reform camps alumni to keep you thinking well after you've read the last page.This book is nothing short of amazing. Difficult and depressing at times, but beautiful and amazing all along the way. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I found Jesus Land to be at times heartwrenching, at times inspiring, but at times, a tad dull. Scheeres blow-by-blow \\"this happened, then this happened\\" narrative style lacked the emotional draw necessary to match the scenes she was describing.I've lived in Lafayette for 10+ years, and we certainly have our share of fundamentalist Christians and other bigots. There is evidence of intolerance not only toward African-Americans, but to Jews, gays and others, too. But, like any community, we are not all like that. I hope that this book (and it's recency of events!) might open the eyes of those who believe discrimination is dead and encourage us all to start new dialogue about racism, intolerance and sexual abuse (just to name a few). Together, we can make our community grow stronger."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"It was interesting the way that the two victims in this book, the white girl and her adopted black brother, exemplified the two victims of patriarchal and totalitarian Christian fascism, women and blacks. If one of them had turned out to be gay, all bases would have been covered. The depiction of life in a \\"Christian\\" family in the Midwest, and the accompanying repression, hypocrisy, and abuse, is accurate. She says at the end that she and her brother \\"survived racism and religion\\", but at what price?"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I sort of like this book. I mean, nobody writes epic stories anymore so we end up looking at microcosmic stuff that may have cosmic import and I assure you that Jesus Land does. If it is true, you know more than 50% fake memoirs, it is a fessing up I suppose. But when I look at literature, I look towards something else, this is just a good read but nothing that I see carved into my life as a reader. I read it quick and easily and think you should if you want a quick and light thing."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The book was quite interesting but it just didn't ring true. It was I think supposed to be a true story but I'm not sure I'm convinced that it was."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I read the entire book in three hours. This book seemed to have too much fluff added to it to make it worth reading. She seemed to say the same thing over and over. I pretty much skipped 3 of the end chapters. I'm guessing the last 5 or 6 chapters have deal with her time at Escuala Caribe. Unfortunately, the are all pretty much the same thing. Mental abuse, physical punishments, etc. Ok we got the point after the first two chapters at the school. They were abusive and you wanted out.This book definitely made you hate her parents. In the acknowledgement she talks about her sisters, but she never mentions what happened to her parents or her other brothers. All in all it had interesting parts, but was definitely not one of those books that you just can't put down."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I liked the book but the portions about The Program went on a bit long. I would have liked to have read more about what all went on after The Program. Her love for David was pure and real throughout the book, yet she waited until the Epilogue to tell the readers what happened to him. At that point, I felt robbed. Also, Julia's hatred for her family seemed untrue after you read that she graduated from college; college (at her parents' alma mater) that was paid by her parents. I found that obscene. Otherwise, it was a good trip down memory lane in the early-mid-1980's in Central Indiana for me. She painted Central Indiana during that time vividly."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is one of those great \\"Truth is stranger than fiction books.\\" It's a very candid exposure of those who misuse religion and who can't seem to apply their beliefs to everyday life, for those who need it most. The characterizations are great. The story is engrossing. It is a story almost too bizarre to be believed except for the fact that it is presented in a way that really helps you believe.That being said, I was absolutely disgusted with the horrible grammar in the book. How can Julia Scheers be a professional writer and still write with such shoddy usage? I don't know who is to blame: Scheers or the editors who neglected to correct the numerous mistakes. How can a college-educated journalist not know the difference between \\"lie\\" and \\"lay\\"? After the 50th time I read the words \\"lay down\\" in the book I threw it across the room in frustration. Seriously. Who writes like this and gets published?"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I am halfway through this book and I'm not sure if I plan on finishing it. Two stars to the author for writing the book and releasing the painful memories, but I just can't get past her cold and emotionless writing style.Edited to say: Ok, I finished it and my initial comments stand true. The author seemed too detached from the actual events."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Anyone who's been to Lafayette, IN knows this story streches the truth....a lot! In one part, the author claims that the students at Harrison High School have \\"probably never seen a real live black person before.\\" (pg 6). Really? Because I know some African Americans who have graduated from Harrison!! I'm not saying Lafayette is not over 1/2 white (it is) but Scheeres should stick to fiction, because this book can hardly be called a \\"memoir\\".It's another 'million little pieces', a \\"memoir\\" that's 'spiced up' with fiction to sell more books."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is just another memoir written for shock value. Just like \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" incidents are embellished and exaggerated to gain sympathy from the reader. It is not believable, and certainly not accurate. Reader Beware!"},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This is a beautifly written memoir of youth and adolescence in a strict fundamentalist household in the midwest and a reform school in the Dominican Republic. It exposes the dark underbelly of christian fundamentalists, and also the dark underbelly of being a teenager in the modern world. I enjoyed the book very much, but be warned, it's very dark."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Never read a book that's so moving in a long time. I feel like seeing the story unfold in Julia's own eyes. You'll never be disappointed in reading this."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This book was so disturbing. I couldn't get it off my mind the whole time I was reading it. I'm sure it was incredibly painful for the author to share these experiences."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"The writing of this brief autobiographical book was inspired by the author's reading of her brother's diary.It is a poignant memoir, very well told: funny, sad, at times horrifying, and very insightful. Readers will learn to what depths hypocrisy can sink to, and to what heights hope and love can reach.My wife finished the book in short order and I reached the end two days later. It then seemed urgent that we stop whatever we were doing and talk about how the story affected us. This is not common in our home, but Jesus Land is not a common book, for it deserves and demands the reader's personal reflection.The book is NOT for conservative, deeply religious, born-again Evangelicals. It is for everyone else, anyone with an open mind and heart."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"It was such a tragic story but I enjoy reading memoirs about people and their struggles so this was right up my alley. i would highly recommend this to anyone who likes life struggling stories."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"This novel was fantastic, I dont want to go into details because other reviews have already done so beautifully.

I was never bored with even one page. The author puts it all out there. While it's quite sad, it's also redeeming to see how she persevered. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"In my Creative Non-Fiction class, we were assigned this book. I couldn't believe how captivating it was.

This book changed my life. Read it. Then read it again. Then again."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"I picked up this ALA Alex Award Winner because I am fond of memoirs; I like to know how other people live. In her story, Julia's white Christian parents adopt two black boys, Jerome and David, seeing their attempt at a multiracial family in mid 80s Indiana as a test from God. Their dad is an absent father, a doctor, who sees fit to physically punish the boys. Their mom is more interested in the lives of Christian missionaries and doing the church's good than learning how her children's day at school went.Eventually, due to \\"bad behavior,\\" (Julia will tell you the details), David and then Julia get shipped off to a Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic. It proves to be a dumping ground for teenagers whose parents were more devoted to God than loving and raising their children.Julia and David begin by surviving racist Indiana together. They then rely on one another again at Escuela Caribe, determined to get by and get out. It's a simply written tale of sibling love and necessity. A true testament to our own fallacies as human beings as well as our strengths and triumphs."},{"Title":"Jesus Land","review":"Julia Scheeres has written a courageous memoir about herself and her family. It's hard to put into words my feelings about the emotional neglect, religious blackmail and wasting of young lives. I kept wondering if her parents had put as much time, effort and money into their children as they put into their own lives, how different things might have been."},{"Title":"Balthus","review":"This book is really a must for anyone who wishes to know everything there is \\"available\\" to know about the painter's work and position vis-a-vis modern art in relation to the traditional canon of European painting.A job of this size would have been simply too much for any one author to handle alone with the degree of thoroughness that was attempted here; and so it was not. Many scholars have come together to shed light on various facets of Balthus' work: reference, method, technique, and influence. Here you will find a rich collection of obscure sketches, out-takes, doodles, and comparisons / parallels with Master paintings.In addition to the essays and studies, every Balthus painting collected in this volume is examined individually but concisely: text on one page with the painting on the other so that one can understand what is being described, and appreciate the work at the same time.HOWEVER, the color reproductions are less than 5 stars. Leans too much to brown/red. If color accuracy is important to you, Claude Roy's is the best so far. So if you love B's work, get both: I did. For the richness of the analyses, this one is hands-down superior, and indispensible.Guy Davenport did some amazing analysis of B's work -- collected in his _Bathus Notebook_ This wonderful work is cited on several occasions and deservedly so. Study B's work better and you will avoid the meretricious vulgrity of applying adjectives like \\"perverse\\" to B's work, or \\"nubile\\" to speak of nudes, as if the word were synonymous with 'erotic,' or 'slim.' The question of nubility (marriageability) is simply irrelevant, and this book will reward the thoughtful reader by disabusing her of the banality of art-talk cliches and solecisms.If you are more than just an \\"art appreciator,\\" then this volume will help to enrich your understanding of art beyond just Balthus'."},{"Title":"Balthus","review":"The painter Balthus, nee Balthazar Klossowski, is one of the most original and disturbing of European modern painters.He is something of a cult. I am happy to have received, promptly, this rather smart, large book dedicated entirely to his enigmatic work. This is the capricious plastic world of the elusive painter Balthus, where females endlessly appear, like succubus, gracing an artistic landscape that's both alluring and repulsive. One cannot help but compare some of the imagery in the Interpretation of Dreams by Freud, to the visions depicting Balthus sexual agonies. Look up Balthus 'La Chambre' on page 329, perhaps one of the most inspired and perverse canvases, ever. There is no other painter like him. Like Picasso he shocks, but with a much more simple and personal vocabulary. There is something of El Greco here, the angst. He is limited like Modigliani though soon his ouvre becomes very telling. A persistent parade of pictorially enticing nubiles that is both delicious and repellent. The book by Rizzoli is a treasure almost 500 pages in all. Part art book part encyclopedic tome. Many color pages. In this book by Jean Clair there are, along the many art pages, also photographs, sketches, private correspondence, etc. A lot of personal information offered us fascinated by Balthus. It's a big book that can double as an object d'art.
